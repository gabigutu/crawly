		<shortDescription>Stunning - in every sense of the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.Based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of Rio de Janiero, where life expectancy doesn't reach the 30's and drug dealers are kings.The tale of the City of God, and its myriad of characters is told by Rocket, a young man who struggles to make something of his life, other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.Not only are the characters in City of God absolutely fascinating, and also very endearing, but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian "Pulp Fiction" or "Goodfellas", but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One of the best films you'll ever see!"--Roger Ebert, does it live up to the hype?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence. The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all. 10/10, A+Would also recommend: Bus 174 and Carandiru</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing of this film before I saw it by chance in a rare Pub open screening, but boy was I glad I got the chance to take a look. I was riveted all night - I completely ignored my friends! I thought it was an awesome re-enactment of a true story - powerful, moving, raw, real - and even funny in parts. I walked away afterwards, beaming. It's rare a great film like this is made, especially these days. I gave it ten out of ten. Please see it if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangs of Rio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're unlucky to be born into a socially, economically and racially isolated community that has poverty, crime, drugs and violence as its everyday realities, the odds are stacked incredibly high against you. It literally takes so much effort, strength, struggle and plain ol' good fortune to simply avoid becoming a gangster, let alone do anything more with life. Most who find themselves in the situation described above never even enter this fight and out of those that do - only the rare ones succeed."City of God" depicts this conundrum masterfully. In a Rio slum called Cidade de Deus we meet character after character that has the right idea, knowledge and courage to get out but somehow always ends up being pulled right back into this vicious circle. Becoming a hoodlum in Cidade de Deus isn't just a fringe career option for disenchanted rebels and social outcasts - it's the main industry.The images of gun toting pre-teen killers are very disturbing and Meirelles uses them relentlessly to underscore just how hopeless and frighteningly predetermined life is for these kids. Many of them can't read or write but already know how to use a gun and kill without remorse. In a particularly harrowing scene, local drug lord Ze Pequeno or Lil' Ze (Leandro Firmino da Hora) exacts revenge on a disobedient gang of 9 and 10 year olds by incapacitating two of them and forcing one of his own kid soldiers, as initiation of sorts, to choose which one of the two he wants to kill. Faced with death, one of the kids starts crying crocodile tears; suddenly all the bravado is gone and he is shown for what he truly is - a desperately misdirected infant.'If only these people had more options....' is the sentiment reinforced with every gruesome event. Of course, this lifestyle comes a little more naturally to some than to others. Ze Pequeno, for example, from an early age when he was known as Dadinho / Lil' Dice shows a considerable lack of aversion to blood and death. In another aptly choreographed scene so that we don't know what exactly happened until much later, he more than 'holds his own' alongside much older gangsters during a motel stickup. Also on hand is a colourful palette of characters. From our narrator Buscape / Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) whose ticket out of the slum is his love of photography over to people like laidback Bene / Benny (Philippe Haagensen), followed by Ze's fierce rival Cenoura / Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele) or good guy turned bad (although it's not so simple) Mane Galinha / Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge) we see a multidimensional, pulsating, alive community that seems in need of a strong, sustained outside push to finally stop chasing its own tail and get out of this destructive cycle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cidade De Deus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God. The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket. The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component. The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons. The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation. And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here. The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker. Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese's narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script. This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story's main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, 'I've seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino', and this may make some look less favourably on the film's direction. However, it is not fair to consider this 'a Brazilian Goodfellas', as one critic has observed. The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta's role in Scorsese's epic. But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it's hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles, has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing. Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses. Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses. As Raul Walsh said if you don't have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using 'ultra-modern' direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath. Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does. The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality. But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior. The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject. Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them. As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person. Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film. Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to. This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros. Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies. In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect. Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed. The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese's Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far. Like it's predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking. Hollywood beware.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best unseen foreign films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.The characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is "Lil' Dice's" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.The City of God is a world you don't want to visit, it won't be featured on a post card, and it's said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it's violent temptation. More importantly, it's about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it's worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.You see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my top 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have made an effort to watch all the movies in IMDb's top 100 rated list. As of now, I'm looking for a place where the DVD for Sunset Blvd. is (currently at #30). But this movie is one of the movies I've seen that's on the list. And I find it an amazing film (currently #5 on my top 10 list). What I enjoy about this film is the visual look of the film, but also the way the director puts you in the story. At the end of the film you have become friends with just about everyone in the film, even though some of the characters are very despicable people. The violence hits you in the chest like a load of bricks sometimes, especially when you recognize that many of the kids involved in the violence are right around 10 or 11, but you also realize that this reflects the culture of the slum these kids live in.Gangster films always seem to make for good dramas (e.g. the Godfather, Goodfellas), where the culture of evil almost always triumphs as the dominant character. This film is no different, but it shows the life of children in places where bribery and corruption reigns supreme. It also shows the bravery of many of these people when even the government won't stick up for them.If you're thinking of starting to watch some foreign language films, this is a good place to start. It is a classic IMO among films made in languages besides English. I did find that the subtitles in this film were done rather poorly (they displayed on my DVD player at the wrong times and it took a few plays to figure out who was saying what.) But I think the film itself is a truly great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not be fooled by the coy charm of the promotional poster. The image of the girl shyly leaning over to kiss the cheek of a bare-backed boy on golden sands drenched in sunlight represents an ideal that many residents of the City of God strive for, but few achieve. The rewards are all too tangible: The football, the music, the heady culture of samba and carnival joie de vivre is never far away, but escaping from the slums of Rio is a little more complicated than sloping off to the beach for the afternoon. The City of God is a raging maelstrom of violence, drugs and gang warfare, and its inhabitants are indoctrinated in the way of the gun from an early age.Fernando Meirelles' film (based on a true story) is a breathtakingly convincing interpretation of life in the notorious Rio favela. Using hundreds of real-life slum children to supplement a superb central cast and shooting entirely around the dusty streets and abject poverty of the neighbourhood, Meirelles charts the history of the area through the narration of Rocket, a peaceable soul with journalistic aspirations who is entirely at odds with the mayhem around him.Rocket explains how the slum was used as a dumping ground for all Rio's undesirables in the 1960s. Despite a population of criminals and ne'er-do-wells, the early part of the film is an homage to plucky underdog cheeriness and community spirit. Rocket's brother is a member of the 'Tender Trio', a dashing group of bandits who go about brandishing pistols and holding up gas trucks like latter day highwaymen. Despite an elegant notoriety, the Trio's crimes tend to yield less than impressive fiscal reward, so they plan a heist on a motel-cum-knocking shop in an attempt to up the ante. It goes badly wrong. The gang's lily-livered tendencies mean they make a sharp exit at the first sniff of trouble but, unbeknownst to them, their lookout, unhappy with his passive role in proceedings (as bored nine-year-old little brothers are wont to be), strolls into the motel and fires at will, chortling psychotically as each hooker and john crumples to the floor.The kid in question is L'il Dice, a chubby Arnold-out-of-Diff'rent-Strokes lookalike with an insatiable lust for mayhem. The motel incident marks a shift in emphasis for the City of God and the following years see the slum descend into chaos as L'il Dice (later renamed L'il Ze) builds a narcotics empire by ruthlessly eliminating the competition. The streets become a recruiting ground for drug dealers and gang lieutenants. Small children (or 'runts' as they are affectionately known) come to see guns and criminal activity as the only viable rungs up the status ladder. 'I smoke, I snort, I've killed and robbed - I'm a man,' one prepubescent boy states defiantly.The film culminates in all-out war between L'il Ze's bunch of hoodlums and an idealistic group of insubordinates who throng behind the handsome Knockout Ned after he stands up to Ze's cruel regime. Meirelles is careful not to lionise Ned. Turning him into a hero figure would, I suppose, have romanticised a bitter and essentially futile conflict. Rocket, caught in the middle of the hostility highlights the ultimate irony: 'By the end, after years of fighting, nobody could remember how it all started,' he says. The war becomes the way of life in the favela. Being affiliated to one of the gangs gives the street kids credibility and, more importantly, access to weapons. Before long, guns are being handed out like lollipops, and the runts are running about excitedly firing their new 'toys' indiscriminately. It is the ultimate in power without responsibility.In their breathless exaltations, many reviewers have dubbed City of God 'Brazil's answer to Goodfellas'. It is a comparison that may be sound in terms of structure ? Meirelles has certainly mastered Scorsese's canny editing and daring method of chronicling events over long periods of time ? but overall this is a different beast. It is more of a Lord of the Flies with AK-47s. The most alarming aspect of all is the shocking lack of parental presence.This is essential in conveying the choices these street children have (or rather don't have). L'il Ze and his barbaric ilk become all these poor, impressionable little tykes have to aspire to. In short: they don't stand a chance ? a fact sharply illustrated in one particularly distressing and almost unwatchable initiation scene where a young gang recruit is required to murder a cornered infant in order to appease his older colleagues.But Meireilles does not let this base, visceral tone swamp his movie. In Rocket he has an inspirational protagonist ? the perfect foil to the madness and despair. His coming of age scenes where he bashfully attempts to flirt with girls and lose his virginity; and the sequence where he and his mate resort to petty crime only to bottle out when their intended victims turn out to be 'way too cool' to rob are the glue that holds the drama together. Without the light relief this would be intense and depressing fare.As it is, City of God is a triumph of story-telling: Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling, it is cinema of the very highest order.Do not miss it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'What are you doing, you're just a kid?' "I steal, I kill, I carry a gun, how can I be just a kid? I am a man."Many who visit Brazil the first time, tend to view Brazilians as lacking serious ambition. They seem to party the night away, and appear to seldom work. The old joke about Brazilians is that they have breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon.But such a narrow view does not take into account the fact that while we in America work to live, sweating away for pennies which the government steals at every turn, they in Brazil Live to Live. It is a different kind of living, a life that sambas with the vibrance of the swaying palm and the bounding drum. A life that understands that we are only on this earth for a cup of cafezinho, and we should have fun while we can before the end comes, but quick.But as the City of God also shows us, Brazilian life is often nasty, brutish and short. A certain degree of anarchy overshadows all the denizens of the film. But Director Fernando Meirelles takes a situation lacking definite boundaries and clear authority, and creates a framework, a structure, that of Gang Rule. The gang-members are not seasoned, old-time criminals like Fredo Corleone or even Tony Montana. Instead, they are a bunch of sweet-faced kids. No one is older than 25, partly because of choice, but mainly because no one lives past this age.On the surface, in this context, City of God is a coming of age story of two young people, a sort of Brazilian "Angels With Dirty Faces.' One character escapes from the City of God, while the other succumbs to it.But when one scratches beneath, one finds the film a comment on the morally bankrupt City of God in Rio De Janeiro, and a mirror on Brazil itself. Far away from the party hopping, Travel and Leisure postcard perfect white beaches, is another world, one of marauding bands of displaced children.The most surprising thing about City of God is its references to American films. Most Brazilian films, as the films of all countries do, owe allegiance to their own particular cultural situation. Brazil owes a cultural debt to Europe (Portugal, Germany, Italy) and Africa. However, the United States has a far more distant cultural relationship to Brazil. That is where City of God triumphs to me an American film goer. It uses the chapter format made famous in Pulp Fiction and more recently, Kill Bill. It uses the familial structure present in Goodfellas. It uses the 'white-suit cool' present in Miami Vice and the Bacardi and cola ads from the preview before this very movie.The fact that City of God can be subtitled Grand Theft Auto: Sao Paolo, is not a surprise nor a mistake. The film is built like a video game in its use of random acts of violence. But the fluid perfect camera work and editing give way to a film with enormous contradictions. Contradictions as large and as vast as the noble country itself.Stylistically, the camera work does not conform to its premise as a gangster film. A gangster film never looked this good. It is as if the camera is released in the wide open beaches, and kicked around like one of Ronaldinho's headers. It starts on the sand and moves steadily across. It picks up on the story but then heads into the sun. It then leaves us, the film-viewer, with the most indelible image in years as we see Sonia Braga (A world icon and sex symbol of Brazil)'s niece, sitting on the sun-drenched coast putting her arm around another young boy. The innocence conveyed in this scene is something to behold. It literally takes your breath away.You see the slamming of different, competing themes. You see the subtlety and tranquility of the beach, smashed into scenes of battered youths dying on city streets. You see a wealth of hypnotic ambiguous images pulled together, much like the very Culture of Brazil itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this is one of those different movies - meaning not run-of-mill by any means - and one of those which isn't pleasant to watch but one you might find yourself mesmerized by it.This also is one of those "based on a true story" films which makes it even more shocking, if its mostly true. The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs. Overall, a very tough but fascinating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the first moment to the last this movie is enthralling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first moment of the film shows us a swaggering gangster preparing food somewhere in the Favella of Rio de Janeiro. A knife scrapes across a whetstone, a chicken is plucked, fabulously atmospheric music plays in the background and a second chicken makes a break for his life! A chase ensues, the poor chicken being pursued by a whole gang of hoods, armed to the teeth, and the frenzy stops with our hero (Rocket) being caught between heavily armed Policemen, the chicken and the hoods. Violence seems inevitable, and things look bad for Rocket...From this point of suspense we re-wind to the sixties. We are introduced to the City Of God itself...the omnipresent character in the movie. The carefully laid out buildings are reminiscent of a battery farm, and we soon find that criminality is evidently 'designed in'. The local youths (including Rocket's brother) are involved in petty crime, and the crime is of little interest or consequence to anyone. In fact we are quickly shown that crime is the only real option to get out of the Favella. Football is the other, but the ball is shot by one of the criminals, highlighting how difficult that route is.Against this background, Li'l Dice organises an armed raid on a brothel (he must be about 7 or 8). In a fit of pique caused by his being left outside the Motel, he goes into the building after the criminals have left, and shoots everyone dead. He is on his way (via shooting Rocket's brother) to becoming Li'l Ze, the boss of the gangs of the Favella. At the same time Rocket realises that he cannot be a gangster (he's scared of being shot) and talks of becoming a photographer.But Rocket cannot escape. He tries to work, but earns nothing, and loses his job. He tries crime, but is no good at it. The City drags him back all the time. He does better than others however. Benny (Li'l Ze's partner) is shot at the point when he is preparing to leave, Knockout Ned is dragged into the violence of a turf war, and so on. The slaughter continues with no intervention from the corrupt police, continually destroying the lives of the residents of the City, continually drawing more and more residents into the battle.Eventually Rocket's life in the Favella itself becomes the key to the exit door. He can take pictures where no other photographer would ever dare to go, and it is this that takes us back to the police, the chicken and the gang! The ensuing, climactic battle sees revenge being taken, the gang leaders arrested, the police corruption, and Li'l Ze being killed. Li'l Ze is killed by the young kids, much as he has killed Rocket's brother, and the cycle of drugs, territory and violence starts again, imprisoning the next generation.The film is brilliantly shot, linking subject matter and events into an excellent whole, and is complimented by fantastic sound effects creating a really credible (and Brazilian) view of the slums in which the action is set. The shocking reality of the children running the criminal gangs is well handled (Rocket and Li'l Ze's virginity lies in stark contrast to the experiences no adult would expect to ever see) and underscores what is both a touching, and terribly shocking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unsparing portrait of a sociopathic generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"After the first death, there is no other" - Dylan ThomasIn Brazil there are 120 million people. 50% of them are under 21. 28 million of them live below the lowest standards set by the International Children's Rights Agency of the United Nations. Last year 7,000 boys from 12- to 22-years old died in shootings. This is the background for the disturbing Brazilian film, City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund. City of God is a "favela" (government housing project) on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro where the Brazilian government dumped undesirables and homeless in the 1960s. The film is based on real events described in a novel by Paulo Lins, who lived in the project for thirty years and spent ten years researching the events. It is an unsparing portrait of a sociopathic generation, where manhood is determined by who can kill the most. When a child is ridiculed for being too young to join one of the gangs, he replies, "I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man."The film traces the favela's history over the span of three decades, showing how its children first became petty thieves, then drug dealers, and finally cold-blooded murderers. To make the film, 2,000 children who lived in the City of God were auditioned and 200 were chosen to go to acting workshops where they improvised the scenes. It is narrated by Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who survived the gang warfare and has since become a photographer for a local newspaper. The picture opens with the sharpening of knives and an adrenalized chase scene involving gangsters, guns, a runaway chicken and Rocket coming face to face with the feared gang leader L'il Zé (Leandro Firmino da Hora). It then flashes back to the more sedate 1960s, where three friends, Goose, Shaggy, and Clipper, known as the "Tender Trio," engage in small time robberies and use their guns only to threaten. The remainder of the film is divided into chapters, each depicting different characters and time periods, each extending the violence until it reaches manic proportions.One of the most disturbing scenes involves the holdup of a brothel and the murder of its patrons. A nine-year old named Li'l Dice (Douglas Silva) is told to wait outside while the Tender Trio robs the customers. He is told to shoot a window if the police come; instead, however, he goes on a killing spree with a big smile on his face, massacring the patrons in the middle of their lovemaking. The second chapter contains the most gut-wrenching scene of all, when L'il Zé, pursues a gang of "runts" who are disobeying his rules, cornering two of the small boys in an alley. He gives a gun to a member of his gang known as Steak-and-Fries (Darlan Cunha), telling him to prove his manhood by killing one of the smaller boys. The two boys start crying, allowing us to witness the real fear beneath the bravado. Yet the madness and violence keeps building from there.City of God is essentially a horror story that hits you with a punch to the solar plexus. It is very powerful, but also desensitizing in its high-tech stylization and dizzying special effects. It becomes so fixated at simulating a cocaine high by jumping from one character to another with breakneck speed that, unlike the 1981 Brazilian film Pixoteby Hector Babenco, it often fails to allow full comprehension of the human aspect involved. Yet the film deserves praise for its honesty in tackling an issue most of us would rather avoid. In the process, it has uncovered the natural raw energy of children, with no place to use it except in self-destruction. It leaves me to wonder how this energy could be harnessed against a system that encourages and perpetuates this cycle of violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other (Sad) Side of the Wonderful City of Rio de Janeiro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids. This movie takes place in Cidade de Deus, a set of buildings originally built in the 60's for poor persons originated from a big flooding in Rio and from some slums. In the 60's, this area was isolated, without any infrastructure. Nowadays, with the construction boom, it is located close to Barra da Tijuca and Jacarepaguá, very valuables zones. Rio de Janeiro City is surrounded by slums, where the situation presented in the film is the reality of thousands and thousands of honest poor persons. This movie is remarkable: the screenplay, the direction, the performance of the cast, everything works perfectly. The frantic camera looks like a documentary. Today the DVD was released in Brazil, I bought it and I have just watched it with my family. I really can imagine the reaction of foreigners watching this sad side of Rio de Janeiro. It is strange, because a person who does not live in Rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates in some aspects. However, this is our reality. Lost bullets, robberies, violence is part of our day-by-day life. By the other hand, the same person may think that life in Rio 'stinks', and again it is not true. My city, like a golden coin, has two sides: heads and tails. If you can afford, you have wonderful places to live. But unfortunately, a great part of the population lives in slums, like the ones showed in this movie. The lack of perspective in life of the children, unemployment, ridiculous salaries, lack of education, lack of the faith, all of these factors contributes for the formation of the next generation of drug dealers and bandits. The traffic offers positions to the kids, like showed in this movie. And in the end, even when the 'grown-ups' are arrested or murdered, there is a bunch of children to occupy the spot. A sad social problem, but true. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Cidade de Deus" ("City of God")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unmoved (some small spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been executed with considerable skill - 10/10 for visual and storytelling style. It is brilliant, expert and flawless in its execution.Much of the style is stolen from Scorcese movies, as unashamedly as the characters in the film steal money. I don't mind that, as there's plenty of original invention - I particularly liked a scene in the a room where the time fades from one part of the story to the next, with the room's decor changing, but the camera angle was fixed. Although, I'm sure someone will tell me that wasn't original either. The use of freeze-frame with subtitle is tired now, as it's been done by so many Scorcese wanna-bes in the last 15 years.So this was all very impressive - except I didn't care about any of the characters. I don't know how accurately this is based on the "true story", but if the real characters can dispatch each other as carelessly as their fictional versions, and think of nothing but screwing, stealing or killing, I think they must be rather boring company.Much of the action focuses on a man called Li'l Ze who, we are shown, kills people and enjoys it, from a very early age. Why he enjoys it is a question not entertained here, and so he comes across as a rather bland killing machine; at one point, shooting a comrade on the spot for talking to him in an annoying way. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a comedy moment - it certainly came across as one.The one character who isn't obsessed with killing and stealing is the narrator, Busca-Pé, who's ambition is to become a photographer. But he's not really involved in the story, except to be in the right place at the right time to be able to recount it for our benefit. We never see Busca-Pé have much of an effect on events, or express much of an opinion, or even express much emotionally during the constant slaughter. He seems more concerned about losing his virginity than anything else.The way women are portrayed in this film is questionable. They are either objects of sex, having sex, talking about sex, being raped, or being beaten by their men. At no point do we hear what the women of the City of God express their thoughts or feelings on this hellish world in which they exist.In fact, nearly all, if not all, of the characters in this movie appear entirely soulless. Are we supposed to sympathise with Li'l Ze's best friend because he doesn't kill people as wantonly as the rest? Am I supposed to feel empathy for this man because he occasionally persuades Li'l Ze to spare someone's life (meanwhile, coming across as a fairly easy-going chap - something of an achievement, considering the countless killings he's been involved in)?No matter how skillfully this film was made, how well acted, how perfectly constructed, as the body-counted mounted, like the characters in the movie, I didn't really care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explores a world or violence and moral ambiguity rarely depicted on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most moving moment in a trip I made to Brasil occurred when I visited a community school in the slums (favelas). These children were desperately trying to better themselves ? the school (paid for from community and rotararian funds with no government help) was their *only* chance to get out of the cycle of hopelessness and crime. The awful dilemma was that the community and its inhabitants were protected and supported (with no strings attached) by the local drugs and gun running infrastructure. I was safer there than on the streets of Copacabana ? no-one would harm a tourist as that might attract police attention (bad for business). One infraction to law and order would mean a warning ? the second, death.City of God looks at the slum area (a slightly less criminalised one than the one I visited) some years not to long ago as it evolved towards this position. The honest struggles of a teenager to break the mould, and the enormous pressures on his less intelligent peers to enter the short lived occupation of gangster. There are many moral challenges the audience is forced to confront, including the many shades of villains that accept a certain degree of criminality in order, at least in part, to do some good in an environment where the worst are very bad indeed and even the police are generally known to be more corrupt than some of the drug-runners.This is a monumental film ,bravely told and skilfully put together. It opens a world that is largely unseen by the developed West, telling a nail-biting story that accurately reflects generations of children and adults lost to a world we wouldn't wish on anyone. Queasiness at an opening scene where live chickens are beheaded for the cooking pot is soon put into insignificance as we realise the horrific cheapness of human life. This rollercoaster ride of a movie leaves you with very uncomfortable questions about the nature of goodness. Even thinking back to it now brings tears to the corners of my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career.There are so many reasons why 'City of God' is compelling, but besides its stylish and flashy cinematography and brutally realistic script, the pacing of the film is unrelenting. Not one time did I check the clock to see how far along we were in the film, even though I was on a time constraint. From start to finish, Meirelles gives us a solid yet exciting film. Of course, since I had no idea it was based on real events, 'City of God' became that much more intriguing, especially when, during the closing credits we see actual news footage of some of the primary characters, and we can see how closely the film mirrored actual events.With a film like 'City of God' it is nearly impossible to convey why it is an excellent film because it is just seamless and well done in so many ways.All I can do is recommend the film to pretty much anyone who is looking for a good story and a great presentation. See this film. Now. 9/10--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely amazing! It is a cinematic tour de force. It is undoubtedly one of the top ten best movies ever made. Comparable to American masterpieces such as Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction. But it is its own unique film.It is based on a true story of one boys desperate attempt to survive and escape the city of god (the slums of Rio de Janeiro) a truly brutal and violent place. A place where murders, holdups, drugs, and criminals are commonplace.This film announces the presences of a truly talented filmmaker, Fernando Meirelles. He directs this film with a ferocious, frantic, intensity perfectly merging every aspect of the film. He uses many different filming tricks from split screen to freeze frame. Each one is used at exactly the right time for the exact right reasons.All of this combines to make an unforgettably perfect cinematic masterpiece that i highly recommend. 10/10 A++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of how a chicken escaped alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's imagine for a split-second that you have not read a line about 'City of God' as you click Play in your remote. As the footage starts, the camera snaps back and forth in a frenzy, people dance the samba, a party is on the make, a poor chicken watches as her mates become chicken wings. And hence we get to the big chicken run. It's the most brilliant scene of the whole movie - in fact, the whole movie revolves around it. Around this frantic scene and the shooting that follows and that sadly shows the reality of thousands of Brazilians in Rio and elsewhere. There is no space in Paulo Lins' novel for the idle hedonism of 'Capit?es da Areia', the renown Jorge Amado classic that tells us the story of a junior delinquent gang in the streets of Salvador in Bahia. 'City of God' simply has no space. Not even space for the viewer. From the first scene onwards, you are permanently reminded that you aren't but a viewer, that you are outside, that you have absolutely not the slightest-faintest-slimmest idea of what it feels like to be inside. The narrative structure is a strike of genius in that sense. Not that it was a cutting-edge idea - it has been done time and time again. But the manipulation of at least three hand-held cameras, the constant sound of samba and the relapses of the story, together with the sheer vivacity of the original dialogues (mind you, I do mean the original, extremely nuanced Rio favela-slang Portuguese dialogues!!) make the movie possible to be watched without post-traumatic-stress. You are outside, and you know it. Your whole body is either stiff or numb, uncomfortable in any case. That strange butterfly-cold-revolving sensation in your stomach reminds you that you are not comfortable. The way you breathe (or don't)reminds you that you're not comfortable. The way you bite your knuckles or shake your head in disbelief, perhaps the dampness of your eyes when that young child cries in fear of being shot dead reminds you that you are not comfortable, that this is not your world. Sometimes, in your deep discomfort, your thoughts will go ashtray, only to be rescued back by the next still, the next title, the nest flashback that requires your attention. That is the stylistic exercise that achieves the objective of keeping you focused and in your seat. That is the role Meirelles responsibly takes as film director.The rooftops of 'City of God' in the '60s remind me of Soweto. The street scenes in the '60s remind me of Soweto, Jo'burg today. Or Gaza. Or Bagdad. Or Monrovia. Or Mogadiscio. Or Rio, for the matter. See a pattern here? There is no innocence any more. There is simply the ignorance that another life is possible outside those impossible invisible walls of the favela. There is crime and punishment, cause and consequence, shoot and shoot-back, or better yet, shoot-before. It could be a war anywhere in the world. Yet, it's the city you choose to go to for holiday. You'll be dazzled after you watch these 130 minutes. Meirelles allows you the luxury of enjoying the story, despite the violence contained in it. But do stop to think about it for a minute afterwards. Think: how many of those real-life actors, casted in a real-life favela in Rio do you believe had a similar fate since 2002? Think again. This is the harsh reality. Imagine this was a documentary - you would need counseling after watching. But you do need to know what lies behind Morro-do-P?o-de-Açúcar (Sugar Loaf Mountain). Some wars happen in the gut of our society - in Rio as in Paris or L.A., and 'City of God' is there to remind you.And, well, contrarily to what you thought, the worse in Rio is not that your camera gets knacked. Now you've learned that you'll never see the worse, lucky you... F.y.i., the chicken escapes alive (clever chicken!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what is absolutely true here is the name of the slum "Cidade De Deus"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many consider a movie outstanding just because it shows tragic poverty and violence. Subconsciously, people feel "politically correct" for liking it. Praise becomes a form of self- elevation, whilst the mere, unnecessary styling offends the topic's intrinsic seriousness. The ideological showcase overcomes an honest presentation. Mixing tragic elements to create a shocking, poignant movie is easy. But somehow the whole thing becomes a farce too pretentious to be positively assessed. An unpunished, 10 year old killer runs around, kills everyone and then bursts into evil laughs. The horrifying situation exists in reality. But a film approach ought to be different. This film has been sold as a kind of triumph of the human spirit, yet it's no more than a typical mobster movie sited at Jacarepaguá. Scene after scene, someone is killed and the deaths have the same depth or significance of a video game. The protagonist does nothing to improve himself. He is a social victim, period. He features the moral character of a robot. And banditry, to the Brazilians' 'delight,' recruits untouchable children as hoods. A Guy Ritchie-like gang plot has its moments of shock: non stop bloodbaths &amp; revolting human filth. For those fond of Grand Guignol, this is a perfect movie. Horrible and cheap in all aspects, including pain and suffering. Simply pathetic, filmed as an elegant commercial edited with rather annoying camera movements. City of God was just another product from the Third World that dazzled the radical chic community of the First World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic Feat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God, co-directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, is a gripping tale about life in the slums, or favelas, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In particular, the film follows the story of a boy named Rocket, who is determined to not become a street hood like most young boys his age, and instead become a photographer. Another main character the film chronicles is Lil' Ze, a determined youth with the end goal of taking over all of the illegal drug operations and other activities in the favela.The Brazilian favela is perhaps one of the worst examples of slums in the world. Criminals run rampant, and there is a feeling of lawlessness and apathy from the government towards the areas. As Rocket (who also serves as narrator in the movie, when need be) clearly explains the situation in the opening minutes of the movie: "We came to the city of god hoping to find paradise. Many families were homeless due to flooding, and acts of arson in the slums. The big wigs in government didn't joke around. Homeless? Off to City of God! There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation. But for the rich and powerful, our problems didn't matter. We were too far removed from the picture perfect postcard image of Rio de Janeiro." The directors capture this feeling almost perfectly. Meirelles and Lund take an extremely objective view towards life in the favelas, not playing favorites or trying to draw sympathy for those who live there. The only compassion one feels for the characters is of their human emotions, like Knockout Ned's family being killed, or Rocket losing the girl of his dreams. The main goal of the directors is to report on the conditions and lives of those who live in the favelas, rather than editorialize. There are no scenes of comparison between the favelas and the nice tourist sections of Rio, scenes that would normally be added to draw sympathy from the audience. Based on information known about the favelas, City of God paints an extremely accurate and telling picture of these slums, and even gives greater detail than what they teach in the history books. For example, the story of the runts was interesting and surprising to see that children get caught up in the hood-life so early.Aside from its historical context and importance, City of God is a great piece of cinema. The actors, mostly non-professionals (in fact, the only star really is Seu Jorge, a famous Brazilian samba artist who made his acting debut in the movie, and has since gone on to have a minor role in 2004's The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou), are extremely believable as their characters, giving the movie almost a documentary feel. The cinematography is also stellar. Many scenes appear almost washed out, and very vintage with high contrast, creating a gritty visual landscape. The screenplay of City of God itself has also spoken beyond the Portuguese language barrier. The film has a cult status among college students and those in the know. Many see it as the 21st century's first stellar gang-wars type movie, a la Scarface or Goodfellas.Overall, City of God is an amazing movie. It has even had effects beyond the screen, provoking the Brazilian government to make social reforms in the favelas after the public became more aware of the conditions through the movie. It is rare for a film these days to have this sort of far reaching effect. I give it a 9 out of 10, only because I felt like it could have been shortened by about twenty minutes or so..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple life in a horrible world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching this much praised movie, and I can certainly understand why so many people have found it fascinating. It is very well done in a technical aspect, and it's easy to be seduced by the way it looks and the constant flow of action scenes, not very different from the efficiency of some glossy &amp; clever commercial. It also shows a way of life and a part of the world that is not very well known to many outsiders, thereby invoking some sense of illumination. Unfortunately, looking beyond the interesting setting &amp; the glossy surface there's not a lot to be found. In 'Cidade de Deus' we follow some dirt poor kids who live as brutal gangsters in a shanty town part of the Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro. The kids need money, so they steal, they deal in drugs and they kill. This is the basic plot for the movie. And then what, you may ask? Well, then there's ? sadly, pretty much nothing more. What we get here is just a grim world contained within itself, where people perform a lot of horrible acts without really wondering why or thinking about any options or consequences. Now somebody could argue that this is actually the way that many people handle such savage situations, and so this movie is just portraying them in a realistic way. But even then, a filmmaker telling a dramatic story has many opportunities to put things into a broader context and he/she can make the choice to give the audience a more multi-layered view without embellishing anything. If you've seen something like the excellent TV mini-series 'The Corner' you know what I'm talking about. 'Cidade de Deus' makes no attempt to explain why these kids don't have any other opportunities than a life of violent crime, so there's no real critique of the society that produces this horrible condition. Without even a glimpse of the reasons for this, you cannot give any real insight into the desperation that drives the characters to behave in the gruesome ways that they do. Instead it comes across as something that's inevitable and almost natural. Like wild animals eating each other, not because they're forced to by special circumstances that could be changed, but simply because it is their instinct. As we all know this will seldom apply to human beings since our existence is much more complex. Any such complexity is totally missing here. In addition there's not much effort made to show the devastating effects that drugs &amp; brutality has on the human soul. Most of the times when something really awful happens in the story, like children becoming killers or getting killed, it's rapidly followed by some non-emotional scene with some cool music and flashy editing. There's no grieving for the victims, the movie is over 2 hours long &amp; the director spends about 30 seconds of that time showing family members shattered by this unnecessary loss of life, which means there's no depiction of the deep sorrow &amp; hopelessness that extreme poverty &amp; violence creates. We get little or no reflection, just one gun-blasting action followed by another &amp; then another. A lot of stuff for eyes &amp; ears, less for hearts &amp; brains. So 'Cidade de Deus' is a film that looks very good. But for me to agree with IMDb placing it among the top 20 ever made (we're talking higher than 'Citizen Kane', 'Apocalypse Now' &amp; 'The Seventh Seal'), the director's ability to convey the depth of human beings should at least be equal to his flair for technical tricks &amp; brilliance. This is truly far from the case here. I rate it 5/10 for the cinematography &amp; editing and for showing a small piece of a harsh reality without blinders, but for me it felt more like an ordinary action movie than an epic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and Annoying MTV Favela movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie proves that foreign directors are perfectly capable of putting out soulless Hollywood crap too. This movie has nothing to say about Brazil, nothing to say about the rise of crime in Rio's shantytowns, and ultimately nothing to say about any of its characters. And to make things even worse, it ruins almost every dramatic scene by applying utterly pointless fastmo/stop sequences, the should-be-banned-forever shakycam, and the super-annoying fastcut MTV style edits that not only suck, but are hopelessly dated. The only people this movie will impress are film-critics and Tarantino-wannabes.I won't waste your time with the story since you've seen it in about 100 movies before this one. Nothing intrinsically wrong with telling a boys from the hood gangster story, but its just not in and of itself strong enough to carry the movie. Lil'Dice grows up to be a big boss then gets killed. Yawn. Rocket escapes poverty (I guess) by becoming a reporter. Snore. A bunch of other guys get killed before we have any chance to figure out who they are. Zzzzzz.The music is buried in the background for the most part, and when it takes center stage, it's often stuff like "Kung Fu Fighting" which sounds more like Hollywood shorthand for "the 70s" than any real attempt to capture what favela kids were listening to back then. I swear it feels like this movie was scored by an American right down to the rustic types playing their little guitars on the street.The acting is fine but can't escape the one-dimensional writing. The Tender Trio are amiable thugs whose roles in this movie are completely superfluous. Lil Dice is 100% bad, Rocket is 100% good, and Benny is so underwritten that we don't really care what, if anything, motivates him. The one character who might have acquired some depth (and around whom the entire movie should have been built) is Knockout Ned, a bus driver who turns into a murderous gangster. He, more than anyone else in this movie, embodies everything that went wrong in the favelas in the 80s--a deadly combination of ex-military and drug gangsters, with the military guys supplying the connections for heavy firearms, the organization to mold the drug warlords armies, and the training to shoot to kill rather than simply spray bullets around. Knockout Ned is portrayed as a "hero" of course, even though so many of his kind were anything but heros, taking advantage (and often creating) the total anarchy of the favelas in order to grow rich and powerful. The cinematography often makes this film all but unwatchable. Fast cuts, speedups, filter shots, the abysmal strobe-light sequence on the dancefloor. All of this is crap and totally kills every scene where its employed. The one great scene in this movie (where Lil Dice shoots one of the "runts" in the foot, then forces another young kid to decide which of the two "runts" to kill) is devastatingly effective because it doesn't use any crap film tricks at all. It's a tense, realistically portrayed scene shot at medium distance which manages in a few minutes to show just how the mindlessly violent generation of the 90s came into being. If the whole movie had been like this, it would have earned all the critical praise heaped on it.But of course, the whole movie isn't like this because the director is too busy showing off his technique to worry much about how the scenes connect. Copying Tarantino's style of putting little titles up for each segment, he seems to utterly forget what story he's telling, jumping around from character to character, and even short flashback loops like the whole "apartment" sequence that he seems to think build dramatic tension whereas all they really do is shout "hey, look at how cool this narrative technique is!" It might be cooler if we hadn't seen the same "Lil Dice takes over another dealer's turf" sequences so many other places. And all the praise about how "realistic" this is must be coming from critics who think Quentin's films are realistic because almost all the violence is as perfunctory and fake as any movie coming out of Hollywood these days. In the end, this feels as plastic and stylized as any gangster rock video, and carries the same emotional weight.In short, a real disappointment. Essentially a tired American gangsters from the hood movie shot with a Brazilian setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gangs of Rio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out! At least in this film they outshot you big time. Watching this film is difficult at times. The violence is to such a degree, the viewer has a problem seating through it.Director Fernando Meirelles has an eye for realism and detail. The most disturbing thing about City of God is the fact that the killers are children playing adult games before they can be children. It is a well known fact that these kids' gangs created terror, not only in the favelas where they lived, which was unfortunate, but they mugged, robbed and just plain terrorized the big cities in Brazil. News about street children being shot in the streets of Rio or Sao Paolo were perceived as criminal because of the ages, but one can get a clearer picture in this film by coming to the realization these same children were killing real grown ups and getting away with murder.The only problem I had with this film is with the English subtitles. Sometimes, one doesn't know who's who. To make matters worse, the principal character grows from a young boy into a photographer who looks like a small boy himself. The plots and subplots are somehow hard to follow at times. The great accomplishment for the director is that he never preaches. He shows the world what went on at that particular time. The realism is extended to the way we see in gory details the corpses of the slain gang members. If Hollywood would have presented scenes that are so hard to take as these, many would be criminals would have been able to see first hand what bullets do to human beings: they kill!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, "The Godfather" reigns supreme as number one, while "City of God," or more appropriately, "Cidade de Deus," is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to "Crash." They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, "City of God" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and "The Godfather" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).Now, "City of God." What a rush! Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece is a film to behold. Many critics have described films as "explosive" for the punch they pack, and/or the unflinching reality of the subject matter. But there has been no film I have ever seen that can match "City of God" for energy. It has so much energy that instead of unfolding, it throws itself at you all at once, leaving everything else to be done afterwards. The actors don't act; they don't have time. They just...are. Everything is done to such an extreme, it's surprising that Meirelles manages to make none of it sensationalistic or exploitative.Some people will tell you that this film is the chronicle of two drug lords. While there is some truth in that, the plot, if one could call it that, is better described as the chronicle of the "City of God" itself. Characters float in and out, with the "out" part frequently involving a bang (or more likely, a series of them). The characters are given background only if and when they are needed.Like I said, there's really no time to develop subtly-nuanced performances. The film moves with such breakneck energy that to do so would only slow it down. There are only a few characters that really matter. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is our window into the hellish slums. The result isn't voyeuristic, instead Rocket is more like a guide (albeit with only the narration addressing the audience). He's a normal teen, with interests in girls (particularly Angelica (Alice Braga)), sex, and aspirations to be a photographer. But his main goal is simply to survive each day. Also of note is Li' Ze, who we see growing up with a taste for violence as a kid (kids shoot and kill people just as frequently, if not more so, than adults). His increasingly drug-addled brain and his ambition makes him more frightening by the minute. The only one who keeps him grounded and (relatively) under control is Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), the "coolest hood in the City of God." There's some truth in that statement, as spoken by Rocket. He's the shed of brightness in this hellish city (though he's no goody-two-shoes). Finally, there is Lil Ze's rival, Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who has the film's most notable character changes.But this is Fernando Meirelles movie. He throws in everything he can think of, and then some. References to Tarantino are abound, and there are probably more, but Meirelles takes the energy level up so high that there's no room for even a "please" or "thank you." Desaturated colors. A constantly moving camera. Loud noises. An upbeat soundtrack (which is the film's saving grace from becoming too grim). It's all here.People may not agree with me that this is the best film ever made, and that's okay. I respect that. But make no mistake, it's an unforgettable 130 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Three-Body Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The first choice a modern filmmaker has to make is deciding who is the camera. Everything flows from that decision, inheriting already maturing visual vocabularies for each path chosen. It's very hard to be novel today: most interesting projects come from careful integration of a novel eye with a novel narrative stance - parallels, time reversals, untrusted narrators, etc. But here is something new, thanks to the creative incubator of Brazilian TeeVee commercials, one of the more vital pockets of popular art around.In this case, we have three characters: a narrator/photographer, a dancer, and a `pusher' who literally pushes the linear logic each step at a time. Each of these is represented by a camera philosophy (and accompanying editing style) which are mixed up helter-skelter. The most obvious is the notion of the `running camera' which sometimes looks at the road or away as it moves in frenzy.This is interspersed with a rhythmic camera. This camera (Benny's eye) is the one that permeated most: it is reasonable yet hedonistic. In the first few seconds, we are introduced to these two in masterful composition: the observing, recording chicken who subsequently runs with a following POV. This is mixed with the aggressive logic of rhythm. If opening shots are promises, this is a strong promise. Over time, the third eye is folded in, literally a folding of linear stories. Each is tightly linear until it hits a node, then goes off on a tangent or a new direction usually paralleling something already seen. Garrison Keiller is the master practitioner of this sort of storytelling; not chopped Clancey-style; not shuffled Tarantino-like; but direct until hitting a capricious nexus, then direct again.All three are shooters. The story is irrelevant: kids killing kids, albeit sometimes viscerally. The characters are literally disposable. The experience is nominally about the place, but it is really about how we are shown the place. I do not think this will reinvent film like a few projects have (from Welles, Tarkovsky, Greenaway, Kurosawa, even recently Luhrmann) but it is a visual adventure worth taking and a fresh experience.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays some consider a movie to be phenomenal as long as it shows tragical poverty and violence. It is so distinct from their lives that they unconsciously feel "educated" by seeing the film; praising the film therefore becomes a way of self-elevation.City of God's fancy cinematography did not appeal to me. Unnecessary stylization in this case offends the serious topic, in my opinion. Feels more like a showcase than a honest presentation.If one wants to dig deep into tragic elements in order to make a teary, "shocking" film, he can always go as far as his claws can take him. But there's a stopping point by which the whole thing becomes a sham too pretentious to be appreciated. A 10 year-old running around killing everyone and then enjoys himself a couple of evil laughs (that are made to echo to achieve "epic" cinematic effects)? "Cliche" would be an understatement...I haven no objection to the theme of the movie. By all means such horrifying situations do exist in reality. But I really wish the approach to present the themes was different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In terms of movie-making, there's nothing like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God (2002)A broiling, gruesome, vivid, unforgiving submersion in the drug and crime world of a Rio de Janeiro barrio. You want to just say wow wow wow, it's so violent and awful, and yet the filming and acting, wow again, it's virtuosic and artful. On that most visceral level, there is no faulting a film with this kind of cinematic integrity.Questions start to rise by the last hour, however. In terms of the subject, you wonder, could it be so? Is life so apparently run by children with guns? Where are the older thugs, where are all the kids who aren't criminals, on and on? You come to realize this is a hugely partial view. That's okay, for sure--it's a movie--but it then draws attention to its own need for violence. You will never see so many people ruthlessly, heartlessly, even laughingly murdered, point blank, by children, on and on and on. This makes the movie awesome and awful, both. As a narrative story, it needs, it demands, greater complexity, and maybe, even if it's basically fiction, greater truth.On this level, the movie begins to depend on its energy to succeed. It has energy to spare, for sure, both in the acting, and in the camera-work, both of which are nothing short of unbelievable. But there is a lack, oddly enough with all these "types" of young men and boys, of actual "character." Where is some sense of the psychology behind so many of these people. Yes, the mood, the interactions, the scenes taken whole, the groups and even the confrontations leading (usually) to murder, all are filled with human depth. But the individuals seem largely to be types of people, not digging into their motivations and their inner states of mine. Maybe that's asking too much.I've seen the movie twice now, and twice I got anxious half way through because it was mostly kinetics and film-making on crack. And it really is astonishing stuff. But as with Slumdog Millionaire, the fractured and imaginative mise-en-scenes would mean so much more with deeper understanding of the human elements involved.A masterpiece, with some large chinks in its armor.</fullReview>

About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it.The style and the look remind you a little bit of a documentary, just to make things scarier/real. It fully achieves it's goal. The "actors" (the director mostly used people who really live or lived in Brazilian ghetto) are superb too. And since the story is well written and told, there is nothing more you could wish for. Of course if watch it in it's original version and don't speak Portuguese, than you will have to read the subtitles ... but it's more than worth it (and I personally prefer it that way)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most impressive (not to mention important) films of the last few years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title "City of God" is steeped in irony, which becomes all too apparent to the viewer within minutes of watching this. Despite a few points of stylistic influence (namely "Goodfellas"), "City of God" is one of the most memorable films of the new millennium. It uses the sort of flashy editing and quick cuts made popular in mainstream cinema. While this technique can be very tiresome and headache inducing (witness anything by Michael Bay or McG), it can occasionally be used for good effect. To truly capture the frantic danger of the slums of Rio de Janeiro you need truly kinetic film-making to complement it. This film is a triumph in that sense. The film becomes quickly paced as all hell but to its own advantage. You often feel as if you're the center of the action presented on screen. In addition to the mind-blowing style of the film, it actually has an engrossing story to tell with interesting and sympathetic characters.A film such as this needs a sense of epic for the proceedings to truly work. Therefor we follow the characters throughout the years and through the good times and bad. Despite how horrible the actions they commit, we really get a sense of feel for every person in the film. "City of God" is a completely (and sadly) realistic work. Hopefully this film will call attention to what is taking place in the favelas, because its an unfortunate situation that has been devoid of amnesty for too long. "City of God" is slightly flawed (it can become confusing occasionally and the style grows slightly thin towards the end), but overall its one of the most impressive (not to mention important) films of the last few years.

		<shortDescription>The Hype and Acclaim is Real: Cidade de Deus delivers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before have I seen movies being overly praised but were not worth the hype and time and vice versa for the rest. It's been like that for a few years already.But now finally, I can see a film that's pretty close to perfection and one that everyone has been right about for four years already. This is the story of Rocket and Ze, one who becomes the most notorious criminal and dealer in the "City of God" and the other who tries to make a hard, honest living while tasting the temptation that is drugs, sex, and vengeance.The movie portrays the "City" as a land of corruption but at the same time undeniably beautiful to look at. Through the cracked walls and deteriorated letterheads from decade old paint, there lies an incredible and breath-taking city. Through a style similar to Tony Scott's Man on Fire, Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund portray the city in a "grunge-shine" point of view, with a realistic shaky camera (complete with zoom ins and outs) to enhance the city and its inhabitants. Its use of colors and interesting angles throughout the entire film (with a few creative shots tucked in) gave it an edgy look that makes it near impossible to turn away from. The visual imagery I thought was incredible...but not the only reason to like the film.The story is surprisingly well-thought out. Before you know it, twists are implemented here and there, which I think is fantastic. The best films, to me, let you soak into the atmosphere and characters and while you gaze and become fascinated with them, *BOOM*! The writers secretly add in a few flashbacks and interesting twists and slam them into the picture, which prevent you from guessing beforehand on what's about to happen. And how can you? The movie captures you and absorbs you, making you feel that you're apart of the "City". While I wish certain characters, like Angelica, were emphasized as much as all the other characters, overall what you get is definitely worth the price of admission.The characters themselves are pretty memorable. We have Rocket the photographer, Benny the stylish dealer, Ze the notorious bad guy, Knockout the good guy gone vengeful, and the little Runts. We have a whole lot of other characters as well, but these are the main characters we focus on. Through clever and interesting flashbacks, we get to know each of those characters more and find out more about events that have happened in the beginning of the film. As we near the end, the piece of the puzzles come together, the evil are finally punished, and the story is finally told. Poetic justice involving Ze, Knockout, and the Runts is especially evident near the end. Its pretty sad, yet fulfilling.Top #20 material? Maybe. It has the goods and it delivers. But while it entertains, it didn't impact me immensely or have any catchphrases and whatnot. But for what I saw, it was a good film. One that should be viewed by all. I would recommend this to anyone who's even remotely interested in film, gang life, or stories about coming together in the face of destiny in general.</fullReview>

And I say "world" and not city because when you are watching this movie, it doesn't even seem like a real place in our world. It seems like a made up land that is full of unbelievable stories. But it is all based on a true story, which totally amazed me when i found it out at the end of the movie. The only down side was that the plot caught a hold of me and kept me hooked, reeling me in for a great climactic ending. But when i got to the ending, I was sort of let down because it didn't seem satisfying or to be what I had hoped and expected for. But that was before I realized it was all based on true accounts, and that was when i was completely shocked. All in all, the movie is great and is a fantastic way to expand your world, showing you a place that you thought couldn't possibly exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a great movie! I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game.The film follows the misadventures of various, almost feral children as they attempt to eke out an existence and then a living as they grow up in a Rio de Janeiro slum in the '60s, '70s and '80s. The central narrator isn't a gangster at heart; all he wants is to become a photographer and yet he's caught up time and time again in the violence surrounding his drug-dealing friends. Particularly good is Leandro Firmino as Li'l Ze, a psychotic hood who becomes a gang leader and who thinks nothing of having kids executed if they dare so much as get in his way.The direction is top notch, with Fernando Meirelles employing hand cameras on more than one occasion, so that this has a vivid, on the street look to it. The editing is slick and sleek, the music fits the action perfectly, and almost every actor seems to fit his or her role like a glove. I'm trying to think of things to criticise, but there's nothing, really: the story drew me in, got me interested in finding out what happened to the characters, and before I knew it a good two and a half hours had gone by while I sat back and was lost in this film's world. Of course, it's a tremendously violent movie, unflinching in its depiction of violence against children, and one of the most hard-hitting films I've witnessed, so not for those who prefer family-friendly fare; but if you're up for it, this just might be one of the best, most realistic crime films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, a good movie is one that tells an important and entertaining story, makes you feel a range of emotions and makes you believe and feel for the events that are happening on screen. It should be able to do this by harmonising acting, writing, directing, post production and sound. And when I think about movies that have been able to exceed these expectations, often City of God is one of the first titles that pops up in my head.City of god takes a look at the lives of various kids and teenagers involved in a turf war in the slums of Brazil that spans over 2 decades. Life in the slums, corruption, gang violence and growing up in a dangerous place are some of the themes addressed in the film. It has a unique storytelling structure, transitions from one story of a 'hood rat' (or gangster) to another, before they intertwine in the climax.The characters of the film are amazingly likable and relatable. The slightly psychotic tyrant 'Lil'ze', Peace loving Ned, charming Benny and lovelorn Shaggy are some of the more prominent characters in the movie. My favourite would be Rocket, the narrator. He aims to be uninvolved in the turf war and become a successful photographer. All he wants to do is mind his own business, stay alive and get laid. That's about as relatable character a movie character will ever be. The raw and emotional acting of the cast makes the movie all the more memorable and authentic.One of the main filmmaking achievement of City of god is the way that it immerses the audience in its unfamiliar setting through brilliant editing and music. The famous opening, the 'chicken chase' sequence, is a perfect example of this. The actors, played mostly by residents of the slums itself, provide great authenticity. They manage to provide great, believable acting performances as well, despite having no prior experience in the craft. Despite being an emotionally impactful story, this movie still has several scenes that ooze coolness, without straying away too much from the actual grittiness of the subject material. Also, there are several witty dialogue scenes that help to prevent the film from getting too gloomy. Without scenes like Ned on the bus, Rocket taking photos of the gang and Benny's party, these characters would be mere participants in the harrowing events of the area. These scenes are crucial in highlighting one of the film's main theme: That these hood rats and gangsters are, at the heart of it all, still humans like the rest of us.</fullReview>

It's easy for a filmmaker to shock an audience - just put something really horrible in, that an average audience has never seen before, in this case, the torturing and eventual killing of children. The scene did shock me, but I don't think it should be praised as an "emotionally affecting movie".Despite the lack of emotion, the film is still excellent.

		<fullReview>If I had written this review as soon as I came out of the cinema I think I would have given it 9/10. However, having had a week or so to reflect on the movie I don't think I will be quite so generous.CITY OF GOD has many good points: the directing, the acting, the locations, the interesting storyline. But I can't help thinking that it's all a little hollow. The central theme of the movie is that violence breeds violence -true but trite. Perhaps the worst thing about it is that, despite the violence, the slums in which the film is set don't seem like such a terrible place to live. The people there have a strong sense of community and, as long as they don't step out of line, all seem to be fairly happy. As a piece of social commentary, I don't think the movie really pulls it off.Regardless of these flaws, CITY OF GOD is stunning to look at and a joy to watch.

		<shortDescription>Hand grenade of a debut film! One of the decade's finest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all starts with one of the most exhilarating and allegorical opening sequences is recent film history.A chicken caught between two opposing sides.One of those opening sequences,like Danny Boyle's "Trainspotting" (1996), that simply grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let them go until the film is done. One of the signs of a truly great film.Thankfully, "City Of God" quickly proves itself to be equal substance and style. One of the aspects of this film that I love so much is the way that it is very raw,candid and intimate in the story that it tells. I have read that "City of God" has been compared to Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas"(1990). I can see the comparison in the way that both films basically put you, the viewer,smack bang in the middle of the story they tell.Both films also have that sense of edge in that they are based on true events.Spanning three decades, the story of "City Of God" covers many aspects of a very negative type of life, that of living in one of the most dangerous slums(favelas) in Brazil. What I found so compelling about the film is the way that it's main character, Rocket, searches for a way out of his supposed predestined fate. Before he discovers photography as a career, his choices are either policeman or criminal, both about as corrupt and venal as each other.Although confronting and disturbing, "City of God" tells its story with a very down to earth attitude and, at times, a wonderful sense of humour, never more evident when Rocket tells us about his attempt at a life of crime.There is some beautiful writing throughout the film which really makes the viewer give a damn about its characters. "City of God" is that rare film where the visual style fits the material perfectly. Watch the way that the optimism and innocence of the first part of the film, particularly the depiction of 'the tender trio', is contrasted against events after Lil Dice shows his true colours during the hotel robbery.The use of a largely non-professional cast also absolutely rammed home this story for me. As a viewer, the worldly wise experience and attitude of a great deal of the cast really shone through. An absolutely gut wrenching moment that illustrates this perfectly would have to be Benny's going away party and its abrupt, shocking ending.To me, Benny was one of the more sympathetic characters in the film.For his life to be taken just as he was finding a way out of the 'ghetto thug life' hits the viewer right between the eyes. It is symbolic of the point of change within the story's framework. In "Goodfellas", Tommy's death was very similarly used.Like one of my other films that I would say is one of the best of the decade so far, Darren Aronofsky's "Requiem For A Dream" (2000), "City of God" shows how its characters are attracted to something so negative such as gang life and criminal behaviour, while at the same time showing what happens when attraction turns into repulsion; the dream becomes a nightmare. The clarity with which this is shown in both "Requiem" and "City of God" is something I admired greatly in both films. The ability of both filmmakers concerned to be impartial and non-judgemental in the subject matter at the cores of their respective films impressed me in both "Requiem" and "City of God".The subjects of both films, drug use and gang life respectively, are subjects that,via their films, make filmmakers either glamorize or preach in regards to how they depict their stories.One of the greatest strengths of this film is its absolute refusal to compromise or sugar coat its depiction of life in the slums.At the same time,I found "City of God" a very positive and hopeful film. The just about prefect final scene shows this. Rocket finally finding a way out of the slums and moving forward with his life, contrasted with the 'runts' planning their death list and how they're going to run the favela. This shows how one can achieve positive things in their life if they choose to do so, or take the easy option and follow what has gone before in their lives, even if it is a very negative thing to do.A very haunting and moving way to end a truly remarkable film.As someone who loves cinema, I wish more films were this forceful and impassioned. Films like this remind me why I love cinema as much as I do.Can't wait to see what this director has done in his next film, an adaptation of the John Le Carre novel "The Constant Gardener".Bring it on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving, Powerful, and Compelling Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic story, a boy who is raised in the real world, from the beginning of his life. I believe this is one of the most powerful, and truly realistic stories, that can truly show the hardships of reality, and the decisions given to people, and how they choose to accept different opportunities. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was all those things: powerful,moving, beautiful and all that, but I realized this is a story that should be heard. This story reminds me of Lord of the Flies, with realism in it. This movie deserves all the credit it gets and some, and I hope that the situation that this story follows, one day, will no longer exist: life of violence, drugs, and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps expected too much before entering the cinema. Did not turn out as well as I thought it would. The story is told through the mouth of Rocket, a future photographer who grew up with the hoods in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The narrative style is excellent, the best thing about the film. It throws several stories at the audience one at a time, all linked chronologically and eventually leading back to the opening scene of the show. It's pretty clever and well executed. The acting's top notch too, the hoods feels extremely real, right down to the little 'runt' who cried so painfully when he was shot in the foot. Without doubt, violence is the integral theme in this film. It shocks initially, but numbs you into submission as the film moves along. A friend commented that the only reason why the City of God is named as such is because the people living there get to see God very quickly. It seems inevitable for the boys to succumb to the world of drugs and crime. Admist all these violence it is really a miracle for the narrator to be able to live and tell his story and not get hit by a stray bullet in the frequent gang shootouts. Perhaps this is the fairytale aspect of the movie. The only person who escapes death is the one who has managed not to subscribe to the seemingly unavoidable world of crime. The film should have left a deeper impression in me, but yet it doesn't. I don't know why, but somehow my emotions are not stirred. Are we living in such comfort and are so remote from real violence that there is nothing for us to associate with?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God is set in poverty-stricken and corrupt Rio de Janeiro and bravely zooms in on its young citizens in their extremely violent day-to-day circumstances. Some of them are really only just kids. I don't mean kids like "rowdy teens", but actual little children with guns and blood on their hands. It is quite heartbreaking to watch, but very compelling at the same time.As it follows the life of two childhood friends who take very different paths in life, it is an excellent portrayal of eras?the 60s, 70s and 80s?capturing the style, music and way of life of each. Between the two story lines, the director introduces a multitude of violent characters and their lives in Rio through titled segments. Unlike Tarantino's violent segments, they are cohesive.It is also stunning to see how well the actors performed in their individual parts, especially when I come back here on IMDb and read that they were not even professional actors, but locals recruited specifically for the film. Wow! More praise: I think City of God possibly has the best cinematography I have ever seen in a movie. It had such a unique mix of shots?sometimes choppy editing (but not Tony Scott seizure-inducing), 70s TV style images, quick camera movements and other times more drawn out and more "epic" shots. All the while it truly felt as though you were there, but desperately wanted to get away from the madness.However, it may feel, at times, somewhat like an orgy of drugs and guns or mindless glorification of street violence to appeal to teen audiences.But then I realised the violence is not gratuitous because City of God is about violence (duh, I know) and it condemns it in many ways, such as making out the protagonist non-violent and aspiring to a better life, and getting us to sympathise with him more than anyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God" is an adrenaline jolt of a film that for once manages to find a balance between stylistics and substance. The director, Fernando Meirelles, stuffs his movie to the brim with machine-gun editing, swirling cinematography and pounding music, but while this reliance on fancy tricks has ruined other films, Meirelles is so expert at blending them seamlessly into an engrossing story that the viewer quickly accepts them as inseparable from the world of the film. He delivers a deeply emotional and human story that obviously owes much to Scorsese and Tarantino---but his movie feels completely original, never like a rip off. And underneath all of the action and plotting, there is a compelling message about about the power of art (specifically the camera) and a suggestion that, just as the pen is mightier than the sword, the camera is mightier than the gun. Can't recommend it enough.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great addition to the gangster genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is based on the true events of a young man growing up watching everything around him is destroyed. Families are changed and friendships are destroyed so that each character can escape the ghetto that consumes his life.City of God captures innocence lost at an early age and spans two decades in Rio de Janerio. The movie tackles the hardships of living in poverty, a situation in which the only way out for many is to fight and steal. City of God has two main characters: Rocket and Lil Ze; the movie uses these characters to show that there are different ways to escape the ghetto. Rocket uses his brain and an eye for a great photograph. Lil Ze takes a completely different approach to escape, using muscle and weaponry to take over the drug trade in Rio.Bráulio Mantovani does an amazing job of making each character three-dimensional. Each character is built with personality and attitude. There is black and white, good and evil. The movie shows the events that each character has gone through to come to a decision point that could change his life from that day on.City of God borrows a lot of the ideas and techniques from American films. The gangster motif is something that has been done in the United States for over eighty years. Drawing from modern American hits like Goodfellas and Casino, City of God takes over-the-top characters and puts them in adverse situations. A common theme in these movies is the obsession with money and what to do with it when you have it. A big difference between City of God and its American counterparts is how real the violence seems. There is nothing to glorify the killings that take place in City of God.Another American movie that City of God pulls from is Citizen Kane. Just as in Citizen Kane, flashbacks are used to reveal the story and develop characters. In Citizen Kane, the technique is used to show what kind of man Mr. Kane was. In City of God it is used by the screenwriter and director to develop characters in a limited amount of time.City of God has it all: a great story line that fosters the development of all the characters, the struggle to overcome one's past, and the battle between good and evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a horrible movie that I strongly recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I say "horrible" I am referring to the vileness of the characters and terrible images in the film. Technically speaking, this is a great film--with some of the most amazing and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The stories are interwoven very well and the film seems so very real. It is so unfortunate at the film's conclusion you find out that although these are actors, the story itself is true. It's just so hard to imagine living in this hell on Earth in Rio. After seeing this film, there's no way I am ever visiting Brazil!! I'm sure many viewers feel the same way due to the absolute brutality of their slums where the police do little to interfere with gangs who run it.FYI--there's an excellent and sobering documentary on the Criterion DVD of this movie about the drug problem in Rio in the present day. However, it and the film itself are very intense and bloody so I would not allow kids or even teens to view the film. It's really a shame, as most of the way through the documentary I realized it would be a great thing to show my high school world history class. But, the sight of a room full of naked teens with their penises a-dangling changed my mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, but overrated by the IMDb-users</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cidade de Deus" is the breakthrough of Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles ("The Constant Gardener"). It tells the unbelievable but true story of the gang life in a poor neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro. The neighbourhood is mostly ruled by kids and young adults, who doesn't play cowboy and Indian like most kids of their age do. No, most of the time they are busy dealing drugs, robbing local stores or killing other young adults in order to extend their territory.The story is told by Rocket, a young guy who tries to live an honest life and not to be involved in the gang life. Fernando Meirelles made an amazing movie of an exceptional story. The story is disturbing and chocking. If it wasn't based on true events, this movie wouldn't have been such a big hit either. It's the combination of an objective style, fast filming, a great soundtrack and the chocking story that made "Cidade de Deus" a revolutionary movie.Although the events are tragic, don't expect a melodramatic story. I don't think the purpose of the director was to move us. I think he wants as to be chocked after seeing this movie. Although we are confronted with violence on TV every day when we watch the news, the fact that kids are involved in this kind of gang life is really chocking.Although I really liked this movie, I think it's highly overrated. Personnaly, I don't think it deserves such a high ranking in the Top 250. Nevertheless an excellent movie. 8/10</fullReview>

Yesterday I wanted to see it again, because may be i couldn't understand it when i was 16 or 17 when i first saw it. I played the DVD tonight, and yes, i really hadn't catch quite the movie 5 years ago. Now I did, but that doesn't made me love it. Yes, the story was quite original and the director did a good job, but in my opinion this isn't enough for a movie to qualify in the top 20 of the greatest movies here... Leandro Firmino(Li'l Ze) performs great and deserves a high praise, but can it really compare to the performance of, for example, Al Pacino in Heat (160 positions under City of God in Top250). This is ridiculous. It is quite unfair that foreign language movies are rated so high, just because they are not American. I really don't mean to offend anyone. I still think the movie is good, but still cannot compare to much more valuable movies which even didn't make it to the top250. As I already said it is just an average gangster movie. And please don't judge my opinion, cause everyone has the right to like or not like a movie, no matter if it is in the top20...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it's not from Hollywood, it must be good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain people who have developed a very negative view towards Hollywood movies and U.S. cinema. In this mindset, any movie coming from the US is automatically lambasted, while non-US cinema is praised without merit. City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is one such case. Its serious overvaluing can only be attributed to a cloudy-eyed sentimentalism for the real situation behind the movie without even considering whether the movie itself has value in portraying that situation. And the unfortunate case is, no. Meirelles and Luns' generic directing is completely devoid of feeling and insight, and the actors are merely going through the motions, lacking any emotional impact in the actual proceeding of the screenplay. For these failings, the film collapses into a jiltingly generic mashup of violence and crime, with nothing to tell. There is no shock value, there is no empathy, there are no thoughts evoked. Perhaps this movie has some appeal and bearing to people who are more closely connected to Brazil and the kind of events portrayed, seeing as they can draw from another experience to put some weight into the matter, for this film by itself has none. It takes a special kind of pretentiousness and self-delusion to rate this film highly on its own merits, and the kind of a critic that dares not criticize a film with a sensitive subject. Yet this film desperately needs more of a voice of reason to call it for the empty shell it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real shot to the heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God (2002, ***1/2) is a brutal look at the drug wars fought in Rio de Janeiro's slums over a period of several decades. It's not always an easy film to watch, but it's utterly gripping and (improbably) humorous at turns.The movie centers on a boy/young man named Rocket (Buscapé in Portuguese, the spoken language in this movie) in the titular slum, the wrong side of the tracks in Rio. Rocket's older brother is in a gang called the Tender Three; this trio commits armed robbery but gives at least some of the proceeds to their impoverished brothers and sisters. The gang's not for long in this story, as one of their sidekick Little Rascals, Li'l Dice (Douglas Silva) has higher aspirations; soon he ? under a new moniker, Li'l Ze' ? is the top kingpin in the City of God. Ze's chief rival, as time goes by, is a ginger-top named Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele). As Carrot and Ze' fight each other for control of, well, everything, Rocket tries hard to stay above and out of the fray. He's not entirely successful.The movie is quickly paced. If you don't pay attention you may lose track of who's who, if only because there are plenty of supporting characters. Alice Braga, niece to one Sonia Braga, plays a one-time love interest for Rocket. Hers was the only familiar face for me, but many of the fine young actors (or nonactors, as the case may be) offered compelling standout performances.And this was all based on a true story, as they say. During the closing credits news footage, including interviews with gang members, is shown. The real Rocket appears, as well. Most striking? Might be the group of little kids known as the Runts; this cohort robs, maims, and kills everyone they can ? ostensibly under the control of Carrot, but truthfully subservient to none. Close your eyes and imagine a five-year-old kid shooting someone in cold blood. That was this slum in this time period.</fullReview>

Such as it being too violent, not appealing to everyone or it being in Portuguese, therefore being subtitled. Without these factors 'City of god' is an almost perfect movie. I don't mind those factors. I don't mind it being violent or being in Portuguese , just that some people do. Its a long movie, that makes a lot sense, its incredibly interesting and its got a bit of everything ,due to the unclear plot. The child actors in the movie are also very good.This makes it even better. You can tell the film was very well thought out, with great ideas and really well made with an obvious large amount of effort put into the making. The ending is really good an ends the movie perfectly.'City of god' also widens your awareness massively of the poverty, drugs , police abuse and general danger young adults and children experience in these environments and developing countries. This film was set in Brazil. Despite all the violence, the movie is being looked at from the perspective of a non-violent individual.I recommend this movie for any adult , due to it being a bit too much for children.

		<shortDescription>Extremely somber and violent, but overall incredibly riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many crime films come as dark, gritty, or even violent as this one. And unlike most crime stories set in America, this film paints a brutally honest picture of the harrowing lifestyle that dictates the third-world country of Brazil. With the visceral direction by Fernando Merielles and Katia Lund, viewers are dragged into a grueling but significantly honest experience of the difficulties in growing up in a world where violence and crime is practically a way of life than an obstacle in society. Set in the 1960s and 1970s, the film takes place in Rio De Janeiro which most people refer to as City of God, a poverty-ridden city in Brazil where employment is very low, the crime rate is devastatingly high and just about everyone from young elementary-school age children to adults carry a gun. Those are not employed resort to robbery and murder for financial support. Enter Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues), a young boy growing up in the violent slums of Rio De Janeiro with the dreams of becoming of a photographer but finds his future obscured by the everyday crime including the robbery and homicide by his brother Goose (played by Renato De Souza) and his gang. Competing with his gang is Lil Ze (played by Leandro Firmino), a young boy with a thirst of violence who grows up to work his up the crime ladder to become the leader of the most dangerous gang in Rio De Janeiro. As these two gangs cross paths, the result is a war that spirals gravely out of control.This film is in no means fun to watch, it is extremely violent, brutally somber, and at times incredibly difficult to sit through. But the most earnest quality here is: it's authentic. While most crime films deal with characters getting involved outside the law to achieve something of their desires, this film tackles crime as a natural societal lifestyle simply because it takes place in a town in Brazil where violent crime is a composition of their society. And it doesn't try to glorify violence but to show the inhuman consequences that result in such heinous activity. Whenever a character, major and minor, is killed you can't help but feel deeply for the character, and the emotional resonance delivered in these scenes never feel forced. As the story moves, you watch as the main character develop from a boy struggling from moral ambiguity and the overwhelming influence of his fellow friends who rely on firearms to squeeze their way out of unwanted situations, to a young man who begins to realize the damage it causes him and roots for a better future. The outcome is one powerful character granted by an ingenious performance by Alexandre Rodrigues. The most compelling feature of this character however, comes from his conflict with Lil Ze and his gang. Leandro Firmino gives a intriguing performance as Lil Ze, a sociopathic young man wrapped in his own bloodlust since childhood and with no desire other than to be the most feared man in town. If you are not disturbed by flashbacks of him as a little boy shooting a man and woman while laughing like a child watching a clown at birthday party or a youngster forced to shoot a little kid in the foot, I don't know what will. The conflict that embroils between him and the main character Rocket provides a visceral tension that moves the story very well while paying plenty of emotional investment. City of God is a deeply riveting drama that leaves a powerful impact very few can deny. This is a film punctuated with astounding performances, solid writing, and an ultimately uncompromising direction. It is disappointing that this film was overlooked for an Oscar for Best Picture nomination, though it is likely due to the grim material. The film is worth watching but perhaps not one you'll want again after first viewing due to the dark atmosphere and overall brutality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are awesome movies and then there's City of God. Whenever you think this brutal and devastating drama about crime in a violent neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro and 2 boys and the paths they take is dropping the pace, becoming unrealistic and going into cliché, it delivers another one of its many brilliantly directed, heart- stoppingly tense set pieces. Or another one of its quiet, beautifully written and acted character scenes. Or another one of its raw, blisteringly intense emotional beats each of which knock you out with the force of an onslaught of ballistic missiles. The actors here put many far more well-known actors to shame with their convincing, brilliant performances, while the visuals are endlessly inventive and compelling. This is a drama which doesn't hold back on any level and is filled to the brim with thought-provoking moments and compelling characters. It's a tough watch, but it's not completely depressing. It has many moments of warmth and humour, and thanks to all that tension even works as an enjoyable action movie. A fantastic film which demands to be seen. There's a good reason why this is so high on IMDb Top 250, and I hugely recommend seeing this instant classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of God is Not a Movie, City of God is a Living, Breathing World.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A while ago now, someone was professing to me how well done "The Lord of the Rings" is. They said to me, "You know, JRR Tolkien didn't just write a book, he created a world." Although I agreed with him that that was true I retorted that the Peter Jackson films failed to create a living breathing world similar to that seen in the books. My friend agreed but said that I shouldn't hold that against the movies because it is impossible to make a celluloid, living breathing world. At the time I begrudgingly agreed to his statement. A couple of days ago I picked up "City of God" and gave it a try, and I can now profess that not only is it possible to project a living breathing world onto film, but it is also makes a stunning storytelling tool. While "City of God" takes you on an intertwined adventure through the past and present of poverty stricken Brazil it also takes you along with several important characters who are each fleshed out and real believable people. I've heard this film described as an open world experience and I feel as if that is an apt description. Depending on where you chose to cast your attention on screen (Usually at the subtitles for us non-Portuguese speakers but never the less) you garner more depth into individual characters' lives and purpose. That kid in the beginning of the film who doesn't want to stand guard is his own individual character and way more than just one thing. Depending on where your attention is at any given moment you can pick up on clues that will relate later down in the movie based off of how characters act and preform in certain situations. Even Shaggy who is one of the first characters to die in the movie is a believable character and we understand his campaign, short lived as it is. Every character is considered their own unique human being and shows tremendous realism to their character."City of God" is not only a master piece of characterization but it is also filled with top class cinematography which evokes the feeling of a living, breathing world. From the stylized split screens which show the extent of the world outside of our lead characters to the quick whip pans which allow the camera to have personality and depth we really feel involved this time. More on the camera feeling like a character, when the world is disoriented and a lot is going down the camera motion feels the same. In many ways the cinematography breaks the fourth wall, but instead of characters coming out of this film we are transported in to live and breathe with these lifelike characters.Another aspect worth noting is the lack of introductions in this movie. A scene will often begin in the middle of a conflict that has been going on off screen for a while. This shows how the characters in "City of God" do not live in front of the camera but rather they continue about their normal lives even when they are not the main focus. While many films use such techniques they are often implemented in a half-hearted way, as in the writers are saying "This character isn't doing anything of importance right now, hence why they are off screen." In "City of God" this is quite the opposite, where characters who are off screen are often in the middle of some of the most important aspects in the plot. This unique style of editing once again makes the world seem so much more alive and vibrant than other films. In conclusion I believe that "City of God" is the biggest accomplishment in cinematic history as both the most realistic portrayal of life ever put on film as well as the biggest argument for film being considered an artwork. I find it hard to see "City of God" as a movie per say but rather as a world that we as the audience are invited to live in. 9.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'City of God' is A Place Where Life is Cheap, But Humanity is Richly Vibrant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brazillian director Fernando Meirelles' splashy feature debut is a dynamically exciting portrait of Rio de Janeiro's violent gangs - a blood-spattered, non-stop ride as much into the life of a 'favela' (squatter settlement) as it is into the lives of the youths who inhabit it.The methodically constructed screenplay is narrated with subjective clarity by Rocket, a young aspiring photographer caught between his deadly surroundings and his treasured sense of ambition. The movie's principal characters, growing up in the Brazilian slum 'Cidade de Deus' in the 60's, are a bunch of drug-peddling, gun-toting hoods hell-bent on revenge - with the notable exception of Rocket, who would rather aim a camera than a shotgun. But Rocket's tale is only one of the dozens of stories 'City of God' juggles with equal aplomb. From the breakneck opening involving a chicken on the lam, the film throbs with several stories: two and a half hours fly by fast and bloody. There's Knockout Ned, a quiet ex-soldier who believes that education and honest work will get him out of the slum. There's Li'l Ze, a vicious drug kingpin with a frozen heart, who erases the Tender Trio's early thug-life template with a psychotically itchy trigger finger. There's Benny, the grooviest hood in the slum, who attempts to retire from Ze's drug game and then there's the hood with my favorite moniker, Steak'nFries, all locked into a headlong dance of sex, drugs, and violence.City of God is an unmissable cinematic triumph, peopled with affecting characters that avoid cliché, and a familiar story signposted with brutally shocking punctuation. Basing the story on real events and people, the makers employ a host of young non-professional actors residing in the slums where the story takes place, who perform a spectacular job under Fernando Meirelles' brilliant direction. Meirelles illuminates every frame of this fresh, ferocious and indelibly moving film that moves at whiplash velocity thanks to a terse script. He endows each chapter with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum. In a film of battering audacity, no shock hits harder than the way Meirelles choreographs murder to a dance beat, an exuberant form of kiddie recreation.But for all of the story's violent subject matter, there is also much natural beauty to savor thanks to the dynamic cinematography that captures Brazil's magnificent landscape. Every aspect of the filmmaking exists as a virtuosic symphony of theme, character, context, and style. The style is all dazzle and in-your-face pizazz, quick titles, cuts, and digressions, split screens and smash zooms, while a remarkably complex story unfolds and the funky soundtrack grooves along - all that dazzle serves a purpose.To watch 'City of God' is to become submersed in a hidden culture where life is cheap but the humanity is vibrant. It is a devastating epic about the roots of criminality and the ironic cruelties of life that also works as an intimate personal drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say this is one of the best movie I ever seen. when you talk about cinematography, editing and story etc.it amazed me how many different characters plays in this film and how well it has been structured.one of the styles I find fascinating is that it started from character and it passes to the other. Styles its amazing. I really how like how their friends leads to different life styles. the main protagonist Rocket, when he first saw photo camera that how that turns a different path in his life. and in the last scene when he(Rocket) was stuck in-between the cops and goons. I love how the effect and transition which goes to flashback, it was really nicely done. I didn't know much Rio but after seeing movie I would say it gives me overall information about how the people in Rio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the slums of 1960s and 70s Rio De Janeiro, this masterpiece somehow manages to be both a romantic coming-of-age tale, a brutal drama, and an action-packed gangster movie all in one. The cinematography is a visual feast and the palates used for the different eras of the film help define the climate and mood of the neighborhood at that particular time. Very well done. The visual style of the film is both exciting and innovative. Not the controlled camera movements of a slick American mafia flick but instead seems to be inspired by the rhythm of neighborhood in which the film takes place- very frenetic, raw, and loose camera-work that feels like a documentary at times while seamlessly sneaking in extremely stylish homages to gangster films of the past.The cast- which seems to be full of mostly non-actors and unknowns outside of Brazil- seems to be expertly chosen. There isn't a single second of the film that isn't believable.If you haven't seen this film yet it should be at the top of your list. Easily one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard that much about this movie before I saw it. But I think that was a good thing. When I saw it I didn't have any expectations, which is rare when you are in to movies. Usually I look up a lot of information about the movie, watch the trailer a multiple times. I'm gonna say that I was pleasantly surprised. It was really captivating and I'm gonna say it's one of the best movies I have seen. Because it's in Portuguese it feels so much more authentic. Foreign movies can be a little bit more difficult to understand, because they make movies differently in different countries. But this movie was one of a kind. It feels so real and it shows how life in a different part of the world can be. Even if you come from the same place you take different paths and that leads you to totally different places. As long as you want to do something you can do it. Because it's in Portuguese it make the movie as good as it is. I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Side Of Brazil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among countless merits it enjoys, this is a most conspicuous one: It shows a strong sense of reality. Since it is based on a true story, it demonstrates another side of Brazil, one which consists of chaos, crime and death. Despite several objective reasons on how "City of God" come into existence, people's ignorance is the main cause. By this I mean, Neither rich people nor the government want to have anything to do with "City Of God", thus their deliberate ignorance of poor people should be held responsible for all the misfortune that happened. In this deserted city, poverty breeds crime and crime leads to more poverty. As a consequence, it is hard for people to leave the city and even if they do, they always get dragged back.As we can see, the only way to break this wretched cycle is education. Fair and quality education will enable kids of the next generation to have more options other than become another gang member.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exhilarating on the first viewing and constantly rewarding there after. City of God epitomizes bold and invigorating storytelling both in its cinematic style and its narrative. The film expertly depicts the chaotic favelas of Rio De Janeiro, a place otherwise referred to as the 'City of God' ? ironically so due to its complete lack of justice, laws or sanctity. An epic story of crime, drama and passion unravels through the eyes, ears and camera lens of protagonist Rocket ? an adolescent man in his appearance, equipped with the innocence and moral fibre of a young child. Fuelled by his own desire to survive and chasing his dream of becoming a photographer, we follow his journey on the brink of life and death as he is caught smack-bang the middle of relentless and violent gang discord. Technically, the film is second to none, displaying a flawless combination of cinematography, editing and sound. Its cuts are rapid but sleek ? possessing some of the most innovative and exemplary transitions in contemporary cinema. City of God's filmic style puts our eyes deep within the perspectives of the favela, entrenching us with the climactic and high-strung nature of the surrounding characters.Overwhelming is the film's ability to so rawly portray the brutal nature of the world and setting, but even more astonishing is its capacity to harmoniously intertwine these elements with the feel good nature of Rocket's coming of age story. Our heartstrings are toyed with time after time, never knowing what to expect; danger, hilarity or sweetness? Our expectations are in a constant flux of surprise. If any analogy were to accurately fit such a feeling, it would be alike to the two directors Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund placing us in the front seat of a rally car with no seat belt and GPS ? leaving us to guess in an anticipation as we're helplessly thrown about by the momentum of the narrative, never knowing quite where the bumps and falls will appear.This stands as a recommendation to anyone who wants to be blown away by a compelling story, set in a unfamiliar and hostile world. Or alternatively, individuals who are yet to be wowed by the magic that foreign films can possess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell is Raised, in the City of God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Brazil in the 1970s, the film tells the story of Rocket (Alexandre Rorigues in an excellent, understated performance), a teenage boy living in an extremely violent area of Rio de Janeiro called The City of God. Like most boys his age, all Rocket wants is to get laid, smoke a little blow and chill with his friends. However, the violence around him not only complicates this it throws him smack dab in the middle of it. When he loses his low paying job, he watches with envy the carefree life of the drug lords Lil Zee and Benny (Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) who run the ghetto. They flash money and ride brand new motor scooters through the streets of the hood. When he loses his girl to the more enigmatic gangster Benny, Rocket declares in frustration, "It was like a message from God: Honesty doesn't pay, sucker." Seeing delinquency as the only way to prosper, Rocket decides to pursue criminal ventures of his own. Fortunately, Rocket and his equally square buddy, prove to be the most inept of criminals. They don't even have the heart to rob a lost drunk who has unwittingly gotten lost in the slums. Rocket soon resigns himself to the fact he's no criminal. He's one of the nobodies. One of the thousands whose fate is in the hands of a few crazy fools with guns. Luckily for Rocket, fate was waiting around the corner with a better hand for him to play.Thanks to his love and expertise in photography, Rocket is given a brand new camera by the violent Li'l Zee. For Rocket, the camera is a life changer. It doesn't matter that the camera was bestowed upon him simply because none of Lil Zee's lunkhead bangers knew how it worked. He's been given an identity, something to separate him from the masses. A possible way out of the slums of the city. When Lil Zee "commissions" Rocket to produce a series of photographs of his gang, the pictures mistakenly fall into the hands of the local newspaper. When the pictures of Lil Zee and his gang make the front page, Rocket fears that his life is over. Instead, Lil Zee glories in the publicity and sanctions Rocket to take even more photos of his criminal inner circle. Soon, Rocket has becomes the City of God's chief correspondent. City of God is filled with a hefty supply of violence, including some pretty cruel things done to children and women. However, the film still manages to leave the viewer mesmerized by, or despite, the chaos and anarchy. Along with the grand performances of Rorigues, Firmino and Haagensen, City of God is filled with memorable characters and performances, such as Seu Jorge as Knockout Ned, who becomes Lil Zee's nemesis for control of the ghetto. Young Douglas Silva, who plays Lil Zee as a boy is spellbinding as well as a little scary. Performances such as his and the others is what makes this film a casting masterpiece. Due to the lack of black actors in Brazil, Directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund decided to use untrained youths and kids from the actual City of God. This obviously adds to the sense of realism that is the film's strength. Credit must also go to screenwriter Braulio Mantovani, who paints a vivid and honest picture of a violent, desperate world very few outside the slums, would ever see or know existed. Telling the story through the eyes of a young dreamer, who's day-to-day existence was never a guarantee is a stroke of genius. The story doesn't attempt to pull on the viewer's heartstrings with melodramatic scenes or narration. The audience is simply allows to flow with the story, as one would in real life. The viewer is transformed into an unseen companion to the hero Rocket's actions, vision, and emotions as he navigates us through violent menagerie of the City of God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with well-written characters and powerful scenes of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is a very violent, moving, and heartbreaking movie about gangs in the slums of Rio De Janeiro.This movie details how crime affects the people who live in the slums of Rio De Janeiro. Rocket has witnessed violence by both gangs and he wants out of it but he finds that he can't escape.This movie does a great job with making itself look violent. I think that the main reason why this movie is so hard to watch is because most of the violence is happening to kids. It can be hard to watch so many kids brutally die off so young in their lives. Slumdog Millionaire did this too but I think that this movie did it better because it displayed violence more brutally with greater buildup involved.The different backstories are all entertaining. They are violent, well-written, heartbreaking, and even a bit funny every now and then. They show us how all the tales are all connected to each other. This movie is non-linear because of that.Nowadays, it's hard to find a good child actor but many of the actors in this movie carried the movie with expertise. Most of them were unknown too which made their acting performances even more unexpectedly good.This movie gives nods to Quentin Tarantino by featuring techniques such as time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts. It drew inspiration from Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas but this is original in its own way. It has its own techniques which it featured throughout the film.In conclusion, this is a very well-done film. It's violent and it also has great characters and backstories. This isn't for people who are sensitive but it will appeal to you if you like violence in movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I taught from this movie is that you need to believe in yourself and your success whatever the circumstances are. You may be surrounded by criminals and killers in a village where few got out, you may be called a loser and weak but as soon as you know it, you are an overall winner because you followed your dreams and actually made something of your life. Karma is unforgiving for the bad but it rewards the good in any which way. It's something everybody underestimates. As a European, I find it completely incomprehensible that people live this way. I judged them the complete movie and it's really hard to watch all of those lives get wasted for actually nothing but I guess it's something me and my culture (in general) can't realize. I found a connection with Rocket. He was a guy which was aside most of the time, has some friends but no enemies. I believe many innocent people like him get killed in favelas, which is frustrating, but surely you have much more chance in succeeding than gangsters and drug dealers. Anyway, an inspiring story, it was easy to watch as well even though a lot of people were involved in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God" was stunning and powerful feature, and it's the film that changed the way that I watch film. Everything about it was stirring and emotional, and it taught me about the realities that other people experience in other nations. The vibrancy of the film is only matched by sharp acting on behalf of the child actors, who deal in violence, survival and power in Brazil. The movie is truly unlike any other I've ever seem, and it's almost insane that the movie, based on the book by Paulo Lins, is based on the writer's life...and his experiences amid the slums of Brazil. This film most certainly deserved to win bigger award than it did because it's a movie that someone can walk away from feeling disturbed, but educated. And that's powerful.</fullReview>

From raw excitement during some scenes to sadness in others. The story is very well presented, with realistic characters. The good guys aren't 100% good, nor are the bad guys 100% bad. For me, every character had at least one thing I could relate to, even Zedje. Some may consider the film to be too violent, but I think the violence is needed to realistically portrait the hard life in the City of God, or any other slum where drug cartels are present. A well shot and edited film, with uplifting music, an evoking story an ensemble of characters, uplifting music. What more could one wish for in a movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Brazilian "Goodfellas" ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of "City of God" is inhabited by a voodoo-like trance, as if the whole spirit of Rio de Janeiro's titular suburbs was translating its turbulent and tortured soul into one of the most thrilling pieces of editing you'll ever see in a film.A chicken is watching a former friend being prepared for meal, someone cuts a carrot, feet in dirty sandals follow the music, and the poor animal is visibly worried watching in live-action its fate to come. But we don't have time to empathize for there is a quick glimpse on the most emblematic character of the film, "Lil Ze", a sociopath killer, King of the City, who doesn't know yet that his reign is coming to an end. To a certain extent, the chicken mirrors his destiny, a bad omen covered by the frenetic rhythm of the Samba. But as if was applying to itself the city's motto: "If you run, the beast catches; if you stay, the beast eats" the chicken takes its chance and flees from the human beasts.Meanwhile, 'Rocket' aka Buscape, a honest boy of "City of God", in other words an outcast, finds himself caught between the chicken and Lil' Ze's gang. He turns back and finds the Police behind him. At this time, the cornered Buscape becomes the chicken, living in microcosm what he's always been: someone with a foot in the criminal world and another one in Civilization, with a befitting profession as a photo-reporter. And he's naturally the narrator, embodying his eternal position as someone active enough to plunge us in the deepest roots of "Cidade de Deus" and passive enough to stay a witness, a privileged position for the audience, not quite for him ? not when we meet him anyway.And in one of the most beautiful ellipses, the director Fernando Reilles takes us back to the 60's, where boys are playing football and when the 'Tender Trio' leads all the criminal activities. At that moment, it's impossible not to connect "City of God" with another gangster classic. Actually, if there is one film that definitely established the status of "Goodfellas" as a classic, it is "City of God", also adapted from a novel, a dramatization of real-life events written by Paulo Lins. But in this Brazilian "Goodfellas", the protagonist never wanted to be a gangster, Lil' Ze did but his character borrows more from Joe Pesci's character... and calling him a sociopath is an understatement.Indeed, Lil' Ze makes his bones by killing the occupants of a brothel. He was the Trio's lookout and they all agreed not to kill anyone. Visibly, Lil' Ze had other projects and his exhilaration while shooting his first bullets becomes the film's defining picture. One of the trio leaves, one is killed by Lil' Ze. The last one tries to leave but the beast taking the form of police officers catches him ? whoever lives by the gun, perishes by the gun. We know that, but nonetheless, there's a sort of idleness and anarchy in these 'favelas' that makes the criminal option almost inevitable. We're far from New York streets, this is not the American Dream, this is Brazil, the white bourgeoisie lives the great life, and Black people are stuck with unemployment and poverty.The temptation of easy money becomes contagious and can even strike the Police. Generally, they don't care much when one of the City dies, and it's only Lil' Ze's outburst against the upper-class that brought their attention. The irony carried by the title is another similarity with "Goodfellas", if there ever is one absent from this city, it is God. We might be in the grandest Catholic country, people have no more faith in God than they have in Law. Gun and violence are the true assets of power and Lil'Ze understands it. He gets rid of his opponents, consolidates his power, and keeps his childhood friend Benny as a partner and adviser. A new decade, a new generation ? sex, drugs and Samba.And for a little while, stability governs the City of God. But the beast never sleeps, it's only taking a break. On his side, Buscape, a wannabe protograph, lives a sweet romance with one of the favela girls, but his incapacity to defend her against the 'Runts', the littlest ones, makes him appear as a weak person, no gangster stuff anyway. So, after the beach incident, the girl loses her interest and falls in love with Benny, the most popular guy around. Later, they want to leave the city to become honest ? but a strike of fate reminds us that we can't never leave City of God, as if there was still a sort of moral debt to pay, as if God was still there after all.The action in "City of God" is fast-paced, the narrative driven by a gallery of unforgettable characters, and with an exciting documentary value to emphasize the social commentary, showing every single detail of the drug-business, gang wars, murders, robberies, rapes, shoot-outs... and naturally, Police corruption. Some scenes are particularly upsetting, the most infamous one shows Lil' Ze assessing his power over the 'Runts' by executing one of them. Some scenes like this are necessary to remind that the first victim of (gang) war is innocence. Meanwhile, Buscape loses his with a journalist and starts as a trainee before we get back to the first scene, culminating with the revenge on the Runts on 'Lil'Ze'.Buscape is confronted to his first professional dilemma : a picture of cops being bribed or Lil' Ze turned into Swiss cheese, his practical choice highlights the fact that he still knows where he comes from, so better to take some precautions. The ending proves him right with the new generation taking the power. Indeed, as long as there are people, there is hope, and when there's no hope, there'll always be crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first ever review, combine that with the fact I'm talking about a film considered to be modern day classic for which I'm almost certain everything that needs to be said about this movie has already been done so. Be that as it may I wanted to write a review and this is one of my favourite movies to date. So on to the movie. The movie unfolds with an almost constant narrative by the main character 'Rocket' A young photographer who grew up in and around the slums of Brazil. The story he tells chronicles the events that took place affecting him, his family and his friends growing up. Much of the story details the violent rise and fall of several gang hoodlums from their childhood to (in some cases) their deaths. Fernando Meirelles delivers beautiful cinematography, capturing amazing detailed believable environments with excellent use of extras (many of whom actually live in the slums)creating a thriving busy Brazil, best exampled in the leaving party club scene. In my opinion this movie is close to perfect, a brutal depiction of Brazilian slums wonderfully acted and creatively captured. Hows that for a short cliché review? Facts not opinion :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime doesn't pay for anyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is a movie about the idea that crime doesn't pay for anyone. It goes about demonstrating this idea by showing a succession of people trying to take over the ghetto with violence. Some of the candidates are kind-hearted Robin Hoods (Tender Trio), some are accidental gangsters (Knockout Ted), some are simply evil (Lil'Z) and some are a bunch of prepubescent kids (Runts). They all use violence to pursue crime. They all fail. Even as the Runts seem to rule the day at the end, having killed Lil'Z, you know things can change tomorrow (they're like, 10 years old). These four external plots are joined by an internal plot of our protagonist, Rocket, successfully avoiding a life of crime by luck and some fortitude.The movie seems to want to be more than an episodic chorus of violence. It strains to show that the ghetto and a broken system makes crime and criminality inevitable. It shows this mainly through the reluctant criminal of Knockout Ted who is basically forced to become a gangster after trying to live virtuously. But this idea is relegated to secondary importance for me: much of the violence is glorified, and our hero does escape a life of crime (even though he is no where near as virtuous as Ted was), providing contrary evidence to the idea that crime is inevitable.A change of protagonist from Rocket into Knockout Ted might have gotten this movie onto this bigger idea.That's not to say the movie doesn't have some pretty memorable scenes, locations and the fact that it's a Brazilian production based on true characters is pretty awesome. I just think it could have mixed its potent ingredients together towards a bigger idea.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For almost 4 years now, Die Hard had been the greatest film I had ever seen. It was top of my list of films, and it always shone as the top film, I never questioned it's position. I still do not question it's position today, simply because it is most definitely the second greatest film I have ever seen. City Of God is sensational, a masterpiece emanating from the slums of Brazil.The film starts off in a newly built City Of God, a favela in seemingly pretty good nick. The narrator, Rocket, is introduced. Rocket is a Nick Carraway from Great Gatsby sort of person. He does his best to stay honest, even talking to the audience in a way Nick Carraway does. He also tries his best not to be involved in anything, yet finds himself having a weak connection with every character in the film or book. In fact, Rocket's story is so close to that of Li'l Zé (legendary antagonist) that it becomes a plot point how far apart their lifestyles dictate them to be. Never has a film spoken so much to me about so many things. The physical and emotional power of drugs, crime and murder. The gang of Li'l Zé could be a band of misfits, composed of ginger haired cocaine addicts and aggressive 9 nine year olds, but more sinister gangs are we unlikely to come across in real lifeI often seem to have problems with the way death is treated in Western films. I remember the copious amounts of deaths, and it feels so dehumanised that I never fully enjoy western films. Clint Eastwood just shoots bandit after bandit, and never gets anything coming to him. In City Of God, every act, every murder of a person has a family behind it. A family that will seek revenge, and no matter how primary the antagonist or protagonist is, it will not make them any harder to kill. Clint Eastwood has Chuck Norris like abilities of invincibility if any of his Westerns are to be believed. These acts of retribution come as a shock to every character, as it does to the audience. It is so well made and true to life, that one cannot pick out who has what agenda. The film also uses flashbacks to now important dialogue, to enhance the facepalm at your own stupidity effect.Finally, the film making. This is what nails the film as being head and shoulders above the rest. Even Matrix-style bullet time shots are used, but they finish by being melted into a shot of the same character, but 20 years previously. Magic. We also get many scenes shown together in real time from different perspectives, and it never seems to be too much for the human eye. It beats 3D images any day of the year as well.The list can go on, but not without spoilers. If you are OK with themes such as drugs, murder, rape and heartless 8 year old psychopaths, then watch this film as soon as possible! Actually, even earlier if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God is certainly one of the most exceptional foreign language films in movie history! The movie excels in every level. The captivating camera shots make a truly fascinating cinematography. Editing was brilliantly done with some Pulp Fiction influence added into it. No single actor's performance particularly outshine the most, but the ensemble performance, from the street kids to the crime masterminds, is remarkably convincing! The screenwriter made the story so suspenseful, bold and daring, that you would not want to miss a single scene. And the truly best aspect of the movie is its ingenious film making. Watch out for the "apartment scene" where the genius director shows how one small apartment drastically transforms as its inhabitants change through the years.I would not recommend the film though to people with a weak stomach. I must admit that watching this film was pretty difficult to me because i have no experience of residing in the slums or what other people calls "the ghetto." Everything might come extremely shocking if you are not aware of the reality drug trades and gang wars. There are very graphic violent scenes so watch it at your own risk.I would recommend it though to people who wants to see something honest, bold and dare. It is one of the, or probably the, most brutally honest film you will ever see! What this film achieved is boldness, directness, and honest filmmaking at its finest!</fullReview>

Many people told me that this movie was a MASTERPIECE (agree), others said it was too exaggerated (shut up), well, here's what I think! This movie is EXCELLENT, period. Shows what life is like in one of several favelas of Rio de Janeiro for these children and young people growing up in a world of violence. Buscapé (main character) is a boy like any other that has dreams to realize: be a reporter; having a girlfriend; cash in his wallet. Dreams difficult to achieve in this slum standing gang war between Zé Pequeno (also main character) and Mané Galinha, for reasons both territory and personal revenge. Where we see also the lives of many people in this slum, his experiences and his thoughts on life as they have. And the most impressive in this film is the casting. In the film we can only see a maximum of 2 actors, because all other characters including the main character, are even people who live in the favela City of God, and they make everything real (the film is based on true events if you do not know). In the end, this movie is fantastic and truly a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, I don't enjoy movies based on true stories, but this one is an exception.The gritty, dark, dirty, and violent depiction of the favelas was great and I really got a good feel of the slums.The intro sequence, I feel, should have been left out, as it helped give me the solace and knowledge that the main character was alive and free from death throughout the whole movie.Characterization and acting were great and it really showed how dark and evil it can get in these areas.Also, what I thought was great was the ending where they show a new rise of youngsters ready to step up into the world of crime, thus indicating the existing cycle of violence which was to continue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Moves of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of my own sentiments have already been echoed by other posted reviews here. As my rating indicates, I consider this one of the finest movies of all time. It's something of a Brazilian "Goodfellahs." A coming of age story, a mafia story. An urban "Lord of the Flies." There are a myriad of virtues to single out in such an epic triumph such as this, but I'd like to simply draw attention to one of the most gripping pieces of acting I've ever seen in film -- and it's that of the young boy who faces the drawn gun of another young boy. The scene comes in the middle of the movie and it is mesmerizing and horrific. It's a representation of the intensity of the film as a whole.That the events of this story aren't stretches from the reality of the slums of South America is a simultaneous testament to colossal film-making and blemish upon the history of civilization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Remarkable Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what fine cinema is all about: motivational, probing and ultimately thought-provoking. This film scrutinizes the gang lifestyle in the Rio suburb of the film's namesake, City Of God, and along the way, captures the audience with its strong performances. This is one of the most influential and beautiful pieces of film-making one will ever see. This is a film that stays with you long after viewing it. Truly a benchmark in modern cinema, proving that the cinema of today still has hope. One of the greatest films, if not the best, of the '00s. If you only watch one foreign film in your lifetime, make this it. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is now #17 on Imdbs all time list of greatest movies, and deservedly so. It is a realistic and gripping view of gang activity in Brazils, Rio De Janero. The realism is brought out by the amazing performances of the authentic and unknown actors. The movie is based on the true story of gang activity in the slums of Rio De Janero. The story follows the main character Rocket as he struggles to get away from the violence and drug activity of the slums he lives in. He tries to use his love of photography as a way to achieve a life away from the slums. If you are a fan of foreign movies or movies on gangs and crime, this is a movie you can not pass up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew nothing about this film before I actually saw it. Considering it was one of the first foreign films I had ever seen I was shocked that I enjoyed it that much. The acting is brilliant, the story is delightful and very understandable. Everything has been put together and made a compelling finish. The camera work helps the film to be so gratifying especially for someone who does not understand the language the film is made in. Every angle tells a different story so you never draw your eyes away for a split second as the film captivates you that much you do not want to a miss a single shot. The director has admirably captured the idea of the poverty, crime, drugs and violence and throughout that you follow Rocket (the one ounce of hope of escapism from the favelas). Considering I had never really enjoyed a foreign film before I would say this was a great one to see and I found it very satisfying and would definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Too Much to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One must step back from an absolute sense of repugnance at the violence and look at what the filmmaker has done in this movie. Once you tune yourself into the lives of this cast of characters and their ongoing effort to stay alive and maintain dominance, you can reflect on the amazing cinematography and overall effect of the film. There is an ebb and floe that we watch, almost a dance in the slums of Rio. There is so much poverty that factions have grown up and the people are continually victimized by them as are there individual members. The police are perpetually on the take, so a military state is eventually set up. The main character is a participant early on and then an observer. His photographic skills are his ticket out and his ticket in. There is death and destruction, drugs and murder around every corner. Perhaps the scariest thing are a group of young boys called the Runts who are making a seamless transition into the horrors of the place, keeping things going for yet another generation. I think the most dominant theme of the whole thing has to do with the indifference toward death. Even those who are friends early on will kill their friends because a drug lord says so. It's an unforgettable film.</fullReview>

I was pleased to see that others enjoyed this as well.Though it's been a while since I watched Cidade de Deus, it makes me squint my eyes in thought and I become intrigued all over again. From the pulsing music and lights of the outside discotec scene to the irony of opportunity mixed with corruption, this is a fantastic film. To all of you who are nervous to watch films with subtitles, unless you can't read quickly at all, don't be afraid to check a movie like this out. If you have any sense, you'll be so entranced that you forget you're reading the subtitles altogether. I wish there was a way to rate this in between a 9 and a 10. A 10 is hard to come by but it's damn close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of "City of God' until two years after it's release. It's a masterpiece. This is definitely excellent film making. The story is very well told and explained about youth gang wars in Brazil. This movie is based entirely on fact and doesn't sugar coat any of the grisly or horrific details. It's fascinating to see that this was seen and filmed through the eyes of one who wanted to go straight laced and avoid being drawn by the gang wars lair. These kids are practically all teenagers from 16 to 19 years of age. They are armed, street wise, crime savvy and drug addicts. The narrative is quite clear without ever getting abundant. Some scenes are done in the hyper fast forward motion to illustrate a typical day for these kids whether discussing drugs in the slums, having sex, or getting shot and beaten. This movie is like the South American version of "Boyz in the Hood", only better and more true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of God is the Portugese version of Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas and is as good if not better in every way possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard from people that City of God feels a lot like a foreign version of Goodfellas and so, I've been dying to check out this movie as I loved Scorsese's Goodfellas. And I'm finally glad I did...City of God really just follows the life story of two boys that grow up in the City of God. It follows the story of a young boy who wishes to be a photographer, Rocket and another violent, drug dealing murderer nicknamed Lil Ze. The film is pretty much told in the form of a biography with the story going into the past.Everything about City of God was pretty much fantastic. The characters are very interesting, amusing and keep you excited for the story. The acting in the movie is very good by young children. Douglas DeSilva as Lil Ze was absolutely fantastic in the movie giving a very bold performance. The story is told extremely neatly, easily showing proportions to Tarantino's film making technique and feels a lot like Goodfellas and even Pulp Fiction.Overall, I absolutely found this movie brilliant and as a film deserves more than one viewing. Definitely a worth watching such a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect movie about terrible things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cidade de Deus is the movie with perfect camera, scriptwriting, editing and acting (a lot of actors were non-professionals but they are really great) but for whole time of watching I wished one and only thing: to see the end titles. This movie forced me to thank the destiny that I was born in calm and prosperous Europe. The other world - that which Cidade de Deus is all about - is like from another galaxy. But unfortunately, it's not. Grand story of the movie is wisely pieced together from several mini- stories told by the main character. It's about life (but is it really a life?) in a slum of Rio de Janeiro. Through the eyes of "the Rocket" - one of those few who were able to escape the misery of the slum we are told about the story of a gangster and local drug lord called Li'l Zé and his gang in a period of 60s-80s. The story...OK, what story can it be about? Killing, raping, drugs, crime, gang wars...that's it, that's the story.Quotes like "A kid? I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man"andscenes like that with hardly 10 years old kid being forced to kill one of other two small boys are terrible. But worst of all is a title "Based on true story" at the end...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunningly good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City of God" is a quite brilliant film that portrays three decades - the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s - of child and adult drugs gang warfare in the slums (favelas) outside Rio de Janeiro. Its quality is all the more astonishing given that many of its stars are non-professional actors who seemingly act out their own personal experiences for the camera. The film is set in a crime-ridden housing project known as Cidade de Deus (City of God). It focuses on two young boys - Li'l Dice (who becomes known as Li'l Ze, when an adult) and Rocket - whose lives develop in opposite directions. Rocket attempts to escape the crime, violence, drug-dealing and killing that is the norm for young men and adults who live in Cidade de Deus. He is fascinated by photography and attempts to pursue that as a career. Li'l Dice opts to go with the flow, and with his determination and ambition for power and control becomes a ruthless drugs dealer and eventually the head of one of the gangs that control life in the favela. The plot highlights the turf war that is waged with ruthless violence between the different gangs in Cidade de Deus over drugs, money and (to them, perhaps most important of all) influence, control and power. "City of God" is absorbing and extremely thought-provoking. Living as I do in the relative comfort of middle class London, I can only imagine what life must be like for the people portrayed in the film. "City of God", which seems from this relatively safe distance to be infused with a gritty realism that few feature films possess, makes one realise in no uncertain terms the extent to which all our lives are governed by an accident of birth. How would any of us cope if we were born and brought up in circumstances like those of the characters in the film that are almost impossible to escape from? The narrative structure of the film is excellent. The principal characters are introduced to the viewer one by one and at a particular point in their lives, usually when they are relatively young. The film then returns to their story later on in their lives when they have become more adult and have been exposed more fully to the difficult circumstances which they have to confront head on. There is a judicious use of narration and of flashback, both of which help to explain what motivates each character's actions. The acting, the cinematography and the direction are superb. What is more, the film does not romanticise the violent lives on display. And, (how can I put this without giving too much away?), it does not - as many films of this sort probably would - opt for a wholly redemptive and hopeful ending. Indeed, one of the many messages of the film is how difficult it is to escape from a life of poverty and violence, on a generational as well as an individual basis. "City of God" is a brilliant, almost faultless film. It's a masterpiece of modern cinema. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brutally honest and crude, Fernando Meirielles movie, born and filmed in the Brazil slums, raises above pure cliché and inevitability. You can either be a hood, a policeman or a worker, routinely victimized and barely able to scrap a living. The experience is hard to watch at times and at others artful and fun. This is brilliant storytelling through the combination of editing, vision and narrative. The result is how personal the story becomes through the eyes of young Rocket, our protagonist photographer, whose simple desires seem to be cruelly thwarted as if this is what all kids in the favelas experience. Following the decades' trends, we see the rise and fall of the angry and insecure gangster, Ze Pequena, possibly the scariest of gangsters ever to make the big screen. Gritty and a real as it gets, City of God translates as a cool gangster film as well as a very well told universal story of survival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is it. The Top. Cannot Get Better. Nothing Surpasses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first time reviewing a film in IMDb or any site. This seemed liked the perfect title for me to start with. The reason is because no other film has ever effected me like City Of God.To start off I want to say that like anyone that uses this site on a regular basis,,,,I've seen a TON of movies. From American classics all the way to disturbing Japanese gorefests. City Of God takes every single aspect of modern cinema and storytelling to the peak of what a film can be. A lot of "normal" people will immediately stop watching once they realize they will have to read through subtitles. This is one of the most unfortunate mistakes a human can make because of all the amazing foreign films that people miss out on. Fernando Meirelles needs to be recognized as an elite director for making this masterpiece. The film's opening scene with the kids chasing the chicken and shooting at it to catch is perfect. I think the important point of the films shows the innocence of all the characters mixed with the brutality of the environment they are raised in. The violence of it is powerful in certain parts showing how there is no shame or feeling in the outcome of their actions. The scene where Lil Ze catches up with the runts is still one of the most disturbing scene I can think of.The cinematography is in every way what you want. A distinguished look. The colors of every room and street mixed with the time lapse scene in the drug apartment is fantastic.The sound editing and score are perfect for everything you are seeing on the screen. This is really a movie I would and do recommend to anyone that wants to take a change on a foreign film. I have a lot of fanboy movies i love like certain big budget scifi movies from Cameron and Lucas of course,,,but for some reason when someone asks me what my favorite movie is I always come back to City Of God and say its the best. It's not necessarily my "favorite" movie because that would be too hard to generalize. So if you come across this online or see it at a video store and your wondering what this is,,,,please give it a chance so your not missing out on a true masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cidade de Deus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "City of God" for the first time when it was initially released on DVD in Brazil (didn't get a chance to see it in theaters, but followed its gradual and glorious popularity, which started when it premiered at Cannes 2002, out of competition). Since it was officially released in the US only in 2003, it was eligible for the Oscars the following year (but no longer for Best Foreign Film, since it was the previous year's submission and it got snubbed), earning four nominations in categories no Brazilian film had ever been recognized before: director (Meirelles, co-director Lund didn't share the nod), adapted screenplay (Braulio Mantovani, based on Paulo Lins' book), editing (Daniel Rezende), and cinematography (Cesar Charlone). I saw it again in 2007, after living in the US for one year, and the impact was even bigger; just rewatched it last week, and now, more than ever, I agree with the instant classic status this hell of a film earned.That does not mean I didn't like it the first time I saw it. I did - a lot. But, at the same time, it felt like deja vu - Brazilians like me grew up used to watching horrible stories like this on the news since we were kids, and although I was fortunate enough to have been raised in a small, peaceful town and never suffered from violence or extreme poverty as the people shown in the film did; Brazilians tend to grow callous of our country's status quo of violent third-world nation. Things are slowly changing for the better, but there's so much work that needs to be done; still, one never loses faith in their country's future.The first paradox is the movie's title, which is the actual name of the largest 'favela' (slum) in Rio de Janeiro, a beautiful city most regarded internationally for its postcard-perfect beaches, the statue of Christ the Redeemer and the classic "Girl from Ipanema" tune. You would expect "City of God" would be a beautiful place, and although it's part of beautiful Rio, it is far from it. It is a place where hell breaks loose (has had since the 1960's, where the action starts), and the movie focuses on two boys, Buscape and Dadinho, who grow up to be, respectively, a photographer (earning his way out of the favela, not without a price), and one of the most feared drug dealers/assassins in the history of the town.Another paradox is the frequent misconception of the movie's relevance. The non-linear narrative and stylish, frantic editing are reminiscent of Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction', and the film was heralded as a "South American Goodfellas". These are fair comparisons, but they can also undermine the film's devastating impact and social relevance behind all the cinematic pyrotechnics involved. "City of God" may be considered a spectacle victim of the MTV fashion (which ranges from the quality of a "Trainspotting" to the stupidity of Michael Bay's extravaganzas), or a movie that uses such modern narrative conventions to tell a painfully brutal real story (that's been repeating itself for decades) in a palatable way. The polished visuals may remind you that you are seeing a movie; but the raw cruelty of seeing little kids having to choose whether to be shot in their hands or feet, just to cite one of the film's most scathing moments, won't leave your mind.This is not just a film, but a story of chaos on earth, a human tragedy that shouldn't be ignored or forgotten. Some may see "City of God" as an 'action movie', but they will be missing its real meaning, and the power that a good film can have to make us see beyond our general scope of reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark descent into Brazilian ghetto struggles...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a darkly profound film. Really gets down into the nitty-gritty details of the street gangster life (at least as it was in decades past) in Brazilian slums. The subtle storyline shifts involving various characters throughout the film may be slightly confusing for some viewers, but the general focus is on Rocket (Buscapé), who wraps up the entire plot of the film nicely at the end. The plentiful violence is never gratuitous; it's always believable. Even when casual cruelty is depicted, it makes sense in the world of the story. In spite of the constant drug dealing shown throughout, it really makes your heart go out to the ghetto denizens of South America, and hope that things ultimately will change for the better there.I am compelled to strongly congratulate the entire cast, and particularly the directors (Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund) for creating such a masterful work, and truly capturing the needed atmosphere of fear and tension to make this movie believable, while also sprinkling in a (very) few lighter scenes to offer a sort of 'let up' to the relentless rush of the storyline forward to the jarring conclusion. Just enough of a surprise twist at the end to (almost) nudge this black gem of a film into the 'thriller' category. But not completely, because this is essentially a street gangster tale, though with a different plot than most, and a somewhat different execution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gee! A great masterpiece! As soon as the film started, I instantly thought it was a violence film I am not very fond of, but soon I was fastened on the screen. I viewed the film twice in a row.The story is based on the real situation 30-40 years ago on the slum named "City of God" in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and children or teenage gangsters. It must be seriously miserable and gruesome, but, needless to say we are interested in sensational unknown world, the story-telling, camera work, and editing are exquisite. Because all the shots are composed just as if a storyteller verbally tells us, I could easily understand the complicated relationship of people and their background. In that sense, the narration by a hero boy is effective.This film may give many hints to people who want to produce movies, write scripts or even write fictions / non-fictions. It is full of effective methods for telling stories.Personally, I prefer this to "Godfather." I strongly recommend it to everybody, even to people who dislike violence in the movies, like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ironic title for an artistic movie about crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God refers to a crime-ridden slum suburb in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This movie follows the lives of several children and teenagers living there from the end of the sixties to the start of the eighties. I found this crime drama more shocking and disturbing than many traditional horror movies. Why? Because most of the characters in there are totally amoral and compassion-less, even enjoying their foul deeds. Worst, some of the offenders are children. There's not much gore but it's very violent and feels very realistic.Most of the actors are unknown and their acting is not noticeable as acting, feels very natural. It's like you're a voyeur of something you wouldn't want to be stuck in. All the characters except perhaps a couple are not likable at all yet they're fascinating to watch. The story based on a book based on true events is gripping and really well told with separated titled chapters (such as the Story of Knockout Ned). The directing is top-notch with some dynamic camera work and sharp editing (already visible in the chicken chase introduction). If you're interested in organized crime movies a la Goodfellas mixed in with some Tarantino style (not the dialog though) in a poor Brazilian hood, this powerful movie is for you. I always find it ironic how gangsters are so religious yet commit atrocities. It's even more ironic in this seemingly god-forsaken ill-named city of god. Rating: 8 1/2 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing! The plot is strong and very thick without ever becoming pretentious or slow. The action scenes are very gritty and real and not full of Hollywood overindulgence and the violence is framed more for poignancy than shock value. It is obviously very influenced by scorscese but has a modern twist. It seems like a blend of Scorscese's camera work and storytelling with the backdrop of urban ghetto dramas like New Jack City or Boyz N the Hood. Even though the movie is subtitled you never feel like you have to watch the bottom of the screen to stay in the movie. You could almost watch the movie on mute and still soak up ninety percent of the film.I hope that everyone that thinks of themselves as a movie buff sees this movie. As far as I'm concerned it rivals anything in IMDb's top ten.As a sidenote: I heard about this film when I worked with some Brazilians for a short time. Seu Jorge (knockout ned) is a huge star in South America. He is an actor and musician, and Brazilians worship the guy like a god. I ripped some of his songs from one of the guy's Ipods and have been a huge fan ever since. Seu also has a role in The Life Aquatic, he is the black guy who plays all the music throughout the movie. All the songs are David Bowie songs sang in Portuguese. If anyone wants to try out his music, download "Mangueira", it's my personal favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, a classmate of mine told me for years I had to see this movie, and since we like the same kind of movies, I just knew it had to be great. Still, it lasted for about 3 years 'til I actually saw the movie.Well, I was totally blown away! I watched it with my boyfriend, and nothing could prepare me for the realistic feeling this movie gives you. Normally, I really don't feel like watching a movie for 130 minutes, (I really think movies shouldn't be any longer than 90 minutes tops, but that aside) but by this movie I didn't want it to end. And that's rather crazy, because it's horrible what you see. And it makes it even more horrible to know that this is what's happening out there. You just know it by watching this movie.I'll never forget a certain scene, involving two little kids and a couple of older kids, where one of the little kids starts to cry so intensely, it breaks your heart. I almost started to belief that this was no longer acting, but that this was what was happening at that moment, but then I thought: no way the director would do such a thing to this little boy, especially when you think about the reason why he even bothered to make this movie.Well anyway, the thing is, you've got to be kind of prepared for this movie. It's no happy ending like we all see in those Hollywood-blockbusters, it's no horror like we see in the same movies, it's no thrill like we see in the same movies and it's even no humor like we see in those movies. Yes, even though the topic of this film is horrible, there's still a sense of humor in it too. And why? Because the director didn't direct this movie from one side of the story, but from both sides. You get to see the reason why those kids do what they do, what happened to them, why they choose to be with this man rather than with the other, why their lives are so bad, they really don't have another choice than this one. And all this time the director stays close with his people; he's not overdoing it. He knows why he's filming this and he knows how he wants to film this and he stays with that. You'll never get the feeling that this is such a Hollywood movie about a terrible topic, that in the end wants you to confess your sins and say: 'Yeah, you're right, we should do something about this, I should give my own life to do something about this.' None of that crap in Cidade De Deus: yeah, sure, he wants you to know what's going on and he's so straightforward that you'll feel like he's slapping you in the face, but nowhere you will find that thing Hollywood-movies do to you; he lets you think what you want to think. Just see and undergo this. Be one of their neighborhood for once. And he did a damn well job! Go and see, really, you'll be blown away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of Brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This saga about kids growing up in a violent and drug-infested neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro is fresh and vibrant from its droll opening scene to its riveting finale. It is brilliantly directed by Meirelles, who fuses an innovative story-telling technique with a fine script and terrific camera-work to create a memorable cinematic experience. The tension is palpable throughout, specially in a heart-wrenching scene where one child is prodded to shoot another as a gang initiation ritual. Although the subject matter is violence, the film never dwells on it, focusing instead on characters and circumstances. There is fine ensemble acting from a cast of non-stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What should have been swift revenge turned into an all out war. The City of God was divided."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planned and executed by the state government of Guanabara, the quarter of Cicade de Deus (City of God) was built in 1960 as part of a policy to remove all favelas (shanty towns; slums) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. "We came to the City of God hoping to find paradise," reminisces Rocket, our narrator. "Many families were homeless due to flooding and acts of arson in the slums? the big wigs in government didn't joke around. Homeless? Off to City of God!" Nowadays, Cicade de Deus is infamous as a high crime quarter, rife with social problems. "There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation. But for the powerful, our problems didn't matter. We were far too removed from the picture postcard image of Rio de Janeiro." Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund's acclaimed Brazilian film "City of God" dares to veer from this "postcard image" of Brazilian life, creating an intense and uncompromising glimpse at life in the violent and drug-infested slums at the heart of the city.The story, which spans the 1960s and 1970s, follows two parallel lives in the Cicade de Deus. Rocket is a quiet, honest boy who dreams of becoming a photographer. Whilst nobody in this city is truly innocent, Rocket perhaps comes closest. His father was a fishmonger, and the older brother he respects, Clipper, is a hood (short for hoodlum) who ? with two other close friends, Goose and Shaggy - forms the Tender Trio, who acquire their money through theft.The second child is Li'l Dice, who will later rise to be known as Li'l Zé. An ambitious young boy who often trails the Tender Trio, Li'l Dice attains his first experience of murder via a shockingly revelational flashback. Li'l Dice subsequently grows to become the dominant drug dealer in Cicade de Deus, after successfully eliminating most of his competition and taking over their businesses.Perhaps the first thing you'll notice about this film is that it is visually stunning. César Charlone's beautiful hand-held camera-work perfectly captures the beauty and horror of Cicade de Deus' chaotic everyday occurrences. Whilst sometimes you feel that the camera darts all over the place unnecessarily, this also offers the film a documentary-like feel, brutally reminding you that this is based on a true story.'City of God' is an unapologetically intense film, and it certainly is not for the faint of heart. The overwhelming combination of violence, drugs and rape (and the very idea that children as young as ten or so were taking part in all of this) made me nauseous at times, and I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was a rewarding experience, and I'm glad that I did watch it, but I can't say it was fun. In fact, I felt quite depressed afterwards. Yes, I suppose this just isn't my sort of movie. For what it's worth, I much preferred watching Fernando Meirelles' follow-up film, 'The Constant Gardener' (2005).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can make human beings inhuman to this extent?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a literally terrific movie. I was drawn as soon as the opening scene started. The barbecue party on the roof in a crowded houses. The scene they edge a knife and open the chickens with sense of exhilaration gives you feeling of a mixed atmosphere of festivity and cruelty of the whole movie. Then a chicken runs away, and the scene the lead character is flanked by a group of gang and the police immediately turns to another scene of 20 years ago. A breathtaking opening.This movie is based on the story written by a man who is the model of the movie. Though the original story is 550 pages long, the resulting movie looks flawless, with masterful screenplay and camera work. I read that most of casts are not professional actors but chosen from the modeled slum, but it is hard to believe. Take Li'le Ze for example, both in his boy age and youth age, their act of countenance is so impressive. The acting of the boy who is hit his shoe is so vivid that you can hardly watch straight. Anyhow, from the viewpoint of movie making, this is a masterpiece.This is based on real story, and they say such situation still exists in Rio de Janeiro. Then, what is the society that makes human being inhuman to this extent? Poverty could be one of the background. But, in the countries like the Philippines for example this neat town is not even called a slum. It can be said that guns can change human mind. What happens if a brat has a tool to kill a man with a finger? Then how come such tools are handed to the brats that easily? Well, I can not answer just after seeing a movie, but I can say this movie is not a simple accusation in Brazilian society but food for thought for all people in all countries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A film set in Rio De Janeiro's infamous City of God, an area in which combat photographer's fear to tread, police rarely go and residents are lucky if they live to the age of twenty. The film opens in the 1960s, where a young Rocket, who is too scared of being killed or hurt to become a gang member, dreams of becoming a photographer later in life. In the meantime, a street gang which includes his older brother, rules the streets, holding up gas trucks and stores. But this doesn't provide enough money, so his gang, along with a young boy named L'il Dice, engineer a raid on a fancy hotel, planning to make off with a good deal of cash but not to kill any one. This plan, of course, goes pear shaped and in the aftermath, the police launch a major sweep on the slum to catch the culprits. But things really heat up when Rocket's older brother has an affair with the wife of a local man and, when it is discovered, is forced to flee the slum and, unfortunately, he doesn't make it out alive.A decade later, Rocket is now older and a bit more guided. But the terror of the street gangs continues, with one drug dealing (where the real money is) gang lead by the irredeemable L'il Ze, who used to be the boy L'il Dice, and his best friend from childhood Benny, and another, ruthless but more rounded gang of drug dealers lead by Carrot. But when L'il Ze gang rapes the girlfriend and kills the brother of a local pacifist, everything culminates into a brutal final confrontation between all the gangs dominating Rio de Janeiro before the cycle of violence starts up all over again.Brazil's Rio De Janeiro is probably one of the first places that springs to mind whenever anyone mentions the subject of gangs and gang violence. And with good reason since it is certainly one of the worst, with such shocking statistics as mentioned above. And, in spanning three decades of trouble and strife in the area, film maker Fernando Meirelles has crafted one of the most extremely thorough, unbelievably engrossing and totally satisfying films you are likely to see, a searing, powerful and at times very disturbing examination of characters caught up in the violence. We have a character, warped and twisted from a young age (who may well have become as bad as he does if he was raised in Swindon instead of Rio) and who grows up to show no signs of changing down his road of evil (managing one or two distressing scenes along with it.) Another character part of the cycle of death and violence but who still manages to come off as a nice, affable guy all the same but who's fate is sealed when he tries to find a way out. Another character who, even on the path of retribution, tries to stay ethical and remain a good person but who circumstances dictate ends up becoming as bad as those he's going after. And one last character whose own weariness of violence and single ambition is probably what keeps him on the straight and narrow till the end and produces probably the only happy ending in the film. Other than that, we finish on a scene of a group of young street orphans roaming the war-torn streets, talking about how the money's not in robberies but drugs, and that the mostly tragic events we've just seen are about to repeat themselves in a film that could be exactly the same.IMDb users generally know what they're talking about, and they've voted a most satisfying film in at #16, a mostly downbeat and disturbing but still sweeping, soaring and utterly absorbing account of a place where misery and bloodshed is doomed to continue, which sweeps by at just over two hours (even quicker on second viewing) and also boasts a fine soundtrack to boot (including the ultimate one hit wonder Kung Fu Fighting.) What film-making is all about. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very tough movie portraying the lives of kids/teenagers in one of Rio's favelas. What I liked most about the movie is the way in which it is told, through the eyes of one of the kids who manages to escape the harsh reality of the favela. I also like the flashback following the opening scene in which a group of kids tries to catch an escaped rooster. The freeze-frame shots are very nice as well. It is a very fast paced movie and sometimes it is hard to keep track of all that is happening especially because the movie covers a couple of decades. I saw this movie after visiting Rocinha in Rio the week before. I did not realize until after having seen the movie that Seu Jorge plays the role of Mane Galinha. He makes beautiful music these days and one of his quotes is really frightening "The other actors were ... curious. They wanted to know if the favelas are really like that. I said unfortunately they're much worse."</fullReview>

The terror that inspires a place to us like that. It is very difficult to escape to that terror and that feeling is the one that dominates the film throughout. It gives fear us, scares the reality to us, because we, as much as you readers we lived in a bubble, in a privileged world, where we have everything , or at least all our basic necessities within reach of our hands. Then we see films like these, that they show another reality to us and we were scared, and we are thankful to have the sufficient thing to live and to be able to give our pleasures us. This film is documentary an extraordinary one on the misery of the world, misery that we deal ed with not watching to be able to live peacefully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life &amp; Death on the mean streets in "The City of God"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** The movie "The City of God" starts where it ends with a bloody showdown between the Li'lZe mob and their very young allies "The Young Runts" having it out with the Carrot and Ned Knockout gang. Sandwiched between those two scenes are a number of brutal killings that dull your senses and condition you for the movies ferocious and climactic bloodbath. Savage and surrealistic movie about life and death in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and how great the odds are for anybody surviving in that "Hell on Earth". The movie starts out with eight young men growing up in "The City of God" with only one of them remaining alive by the time the movie is over. Rocket is by far the most sympathetic of those in the movie as he tries all throughout the film, and in the end succeeds, in overcoming the odds against him to become a productive and law-abiding citizen but also a top Brazilian newspaper photographer. I felt that it was Ned Knockout who was the best example of how those mean and deadly "City of God" streets drive both young and old alike into a life of crime and violence even, unlike Rcket, if they do their best to avoid it. Ned a quiet and peaceful young man was publicly humiliated by the brutal and vicious thug in the movie Li'lZe. Not having tortured Ned enough Li'lZe and his gang came to Ned's home where they murdered his brother Gelson when he tried to defend and protect Ned. This tragedy was compounded when Ned in a rage killed a number of the Li'lze mob and then joined up with the Carrot gang to battle the Li'lZe mob and their Young Runt allies. During a bank robbery by the Carrot mob Ned shot and killed a bank guard who's son Max later joined the Carrot mob to avenge his fathers death. In the final street battle in the movie Ned is shot and killed by the son of the man that he murdered Max as he was trying to save his, Max's, life. All this after Ned was shot and badly wounded by the Li'lZe mob .Both Ned and Max were at first innocent bystanders who turned to crime because of circumstances beyond their control and ended up both killing and getting killed in the whirlpool of violence that engulfed the "City of God". The movie plays like one of those 1930's and 40's Warner Brothers crime movies where neighborhood crime becomes a part of the lives of those who live there and the theater audience can only accept the violence on the screen since there's no way for those in the movie to get out of that brutal environment. The acting in the film by mostly a cast of unknowns is surprisingly good with a very skillful directing effort by L. Mireiles. Mireiles keeps the story flowing smoothly and keeps the violence in check and at the same time makes it very effective and realistic. The ending of the movie with Li'lZe getting blasted to pieces by a group of the members of "The Young Runts" his allies who turned on him, many of them then under 12 year old, showed how the cycle of death and violence continues. A none ending cycle of death and destruction that effects those living on the mean streets and knowing nothing else. Even at a very young and impressionable age in the pitiless and merciless horror called "The City of God".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids With Guns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'City Of God' is not an easy film to watch, nor is it an easy film to like. Were it not for the stark reality that permeates most of the production, this could have been a modern zombie flick. None of the characters in this movie are really alive anyway. They're the walking dead, living each moment with the threat of death knocking holes in their front door. The actors do the best they can with powerful material that offers them no real hope. As I said, zombie flick.After 2002's searing documentary, 'Bowling For Columbine', it seems a little ghoulish to see a movie filled to the brim with shots of kids with guns. And they use their guns oh so casually, killing at will. It's not easy to make a viewer immune to the sight of a child brandishing a gun, let alone firing it, let alone shooting it at people. Repeatedly. After a while, I wasn't appalled anymore. 'City Of God' is relentless in its offhand violence, proving once again that ghetto conditions breed desperation and murder. Perhaps that's truthful. In fact, I have no doubt that this movie is bang-on.That's the rub. For every moment of authenticity, there's one of over-the-top brutality. Is it over the top, however, if it's trying to be factual? I'm not sure. See, I can't say I liked this film, but the energy and raw power brought forth is admirable. Certain audiences should see it (not children, not the weak-stomached), but they need to be forewarned of how rough things get. Director Fernando Meirelles puts the camera literally into the action (think 'Saving Private Ryan' in Brazil) and doesn't allow you to view the horrors from a safe distance.So why am I reserved about this film? Violence in movies doesn't usually bother me. Maybe it's that I found it difficult to relate to the characters. I have never experienced the squalor or pain they experience on a daily basis. And---I have to be honest---I had a hard time keeping everybody straight. Once the film gets going and it settles into the '70s time frame after jumping around a lot, that problem goes away. Still, I was supposed to be engaged from minute one and it took a little longer for me to get warmed up.The young, unknown cast is solid. They're not good enough to be etched in my memory, although Alice Braga (as Angelica) is one of the most beautiful girls I've seen in years. Since the actors are portraying biographical characters, they're already limited in what they can do. Meirelles rings genuine emotions from the legions of kids in this picture, who probably had a blast pretending to be a kill-crazy street gang.I think I'd get into the story and the characters more with a second viewing. But is it worth seeing again? Perhaps. I'd probably never enjoy it, though. There's something cynical going on here, a gloomier resolution than what's in similar subject matter (such as 'Boyz N The Hood'). That film is a tragedy, this one is a tragedy of such extreme proportions that you know nothing can save the people---especially the innocent---in the city of God. Judging by how popular the movie is with audiences worldwide, I'm in the minority here. All I can hope for is that this film illuminates this gangland mentality that we see in all downtrodden cities. If the film helps to correct that issue, it will indeed have served a valuable purpose. I recommend 'City Of God', just not very strongly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Me so not worthy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be damned!Last week, in the Singapore International Film Festival, I had a revelation.I experienced a movie like nothing I've seen before.This movie was ambitiously inventive and viscerally beautiful. This movie packed so much kinetic energy; it literally rocked me from my seat. On top of that, it completely incapacitated my senses with its explosively awe-inspiring sights and sounds.Most surprising of all, amidst its kaleidoscopic brilliance, this unbelievable film was still able to firmly hold on to an unexpected avalanche of universal truths &amp; sincere, profound honesty. Such an amalgam of integrity and virtuosity is beyond priceless. Which was why I was beyond speechless.Most importantly, said film incited in me, a normally staid personality, a never before seen passion and a deliriously unknown height of adulation. Thus, imagine my feeling of impurity and unworthiness in its revered presence.To encapsulate all that's been said prior to this, based on that night alone, I am very much prepared to herald this movie as one of the very best film unleashed upon us film lovers, in this young new millennium of ours.And ladies and germs, with enough(or too much) suspense, that film which I will henceforth so revere, is City of God aka "Cidade de Deus"On a rational front, my beliefs in the greatness of this film stems not from mere prepubescent infatuation (though in jest, I may sound like it). It resides in the most basic of below decision criterias --I have seen CITY OF GOD with my very own eyes.-I have decided on its greatness with my very own mind, and-I know what I am championing for, and why I doing so.Truth be told, exhilarating discoveries for something so kick-ass spectacular, comes only that many times in one's life. It's thus understandable how I can hardly contain my excitement from sharing with the world this serendipitiously rejuvenating find of mine.Which is all the more important that I chose the hard, hard decision to hold for one whole week, before I write this piece. I do think I need to cool down enough in order not to regretfully launch into an uncontrollable torrent of incoherent (unbleeped) expletives, albeit swear words of sheer joys and jubilation in my unwavering praise for this magnificent, superlative film.(phew...)But one week has since passed, and that moment of high is still as sustained as ever, I am infact now suffering from withdrawal syndrome for not being able to immediately see "CITY OF GOD" again (and again and again).....It is thus with the highest regard I have for IMDB, that I shall stop right here and now and hopefully revisit this thread with some other of my fawning posts on this fantastic movie, in future. Well, it'll have to be at least long enough for me to sufficiently composed myself (again) and touch on the other positive goodness of City of God.For if I am to continued unchecked right now, afraid I'm gonna turn into a stark raving canine crusading against detractors big and small of this great, great film.(I am so not worthy as I bow before you.)Anyhoo, while Poor Ole Sinny wonders off to one corner to ingest some prescription elephant tranquilizers, my kind fellow posters, watch this space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulp'ish Goodfellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Godfather,Goodfellas were the best gangster movies ever made.This movie was comparable and at places even better than Goodfellas.But considering Goodfellas was released 13 years before Cidade de deus puts Goodfellas in a different league altogether.Cidade de deus has awesome cinematography ( Cesar Charlone - Oscar nominated ),totally offbeat editing ( Daniel Rezende - Oscar nominated ),scintillating screenplay (Braulio Montavani - Oscar nominated ) and some good direction.The audio was in Portuguese but the subtitles were pretty good to follow the movie.The movie is styled similar to pulp fiction since the answers are given first and questions asked later in almost all the anachronous sub-plots ( like chapters in pulp).The movie is narrated by Rocket,a journalist who takes just a minor role in the movie ( btw. this is a true story).The story is set in 60's Rio de Janiero and revolves around a ghetto.Its very powerful and disturbing with kids carrying guns and robbing motels, shooting to kill,sniffing n selling drugs.Its somewhat reminded me of Black Hawk Down but this is a war amidst drug lords unlike the war in BHD. "I sniff,I steam,I kill.I'm man" uttered by a 12 year old speaks of the way the kids of the ghetto use their pistols as toys. Overall, a beautiful masterpiece that will take you on a time travel to the 60's Rio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming from being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings series because of its epic and powerful impact, I watched City of God that was set in a closer to modern time and a poverty-stricken location. Even knowing that, the realism and powerful impact that City of God had upon me was at the same epic level as Lord of the Rings. The acting was not the best I have ever seen, although it still was excellent and didn't hurt the movie at all. The emotions that it brought out and the realism that I felt while watching every moment of it was incomparable to any other movie I have watched. It really brought me fully into the action and to the story, and I felt like I was truly experiencing it. It drew me in fully through the end with its Tarantino style story-telling and captivating recollections through the eyes of Rocket the photographer. In all honesty, I almost can't believe it was a movie. It was so realistic and so well done, that it felt like a documentary capturing the true occurrences of every scary and powerful moment of this story. It was that realistic and that powerful, that I couldn't believe behind each scene there was a director coordinating every moment; as it all just flowed so smoothly together from start to finish. Every scene was perfectly detailed and constructed and the director's brilliance emanated from the screen during every minute that passed by. All in all a brilliant creation worthy of the recognition and appreciation it has received from those who have been privileged enough to see and enjoy what is City of God.</fullReview>

The locations in which the film was shot are almost a character unto themselves and I left wanting to see more of this slum of Rio de Janiero. There is nothing that I can say about this movie other than it is a masterpiece of storytelling and setting...

		<fullReview>With a Dickensian plot (if the content is un-bowdlerized), a child nicknamed "Rocket" (as translated in the English subtitles) relates his rise from a ghetto-dweller to a successful photojournalist who exposes the harsh world of his origin to the complacent Brazilians who live in the picture-postcard world of its upper and middle classes, and his entry into their world. "Rocket" is effectively the narrator.This masterful filming establishes the human condition wherever people are neglected because they are 'inconvenient'. The place could just as easily be Soweto or even Detroit. The poor try to survive by doing the dirty work that the bourgeoisie needs to have done but won't do itself. Parents may have aspirations for their children's improvement and insist that they go to school, study, and prepare to do honest work. The easy money of illegal activities, whether robberies or drug dealing, intoxicates some, and draws them into a trap. Personal 'honor' is to be protected at all costs to others, and thus the vendetta. But such is the sociological angle, and most of us have seen that story in a newspaper.It's an exciting tale of survival and shaky success -- and of the ultimate dangers of crime. It's also a romance and a tale of the richness of the popular culture which on occasion brings some brightness into the dreary slum. But such brightness results from successful crooks getting control and showing off their success with the monetary fruits of their drug-trafficking. Not surprisingly, it erupts into a local civil war."Rocket" demonstrates that with some sensitivity and some usefulness he can beat the odds stacked against him. Does he? To give the answer introduces a spoiler. Just watch the movie; except for the sexuality it might as well be a Brazilian version of-Te Godfather- with a few plot twists.The cinematography is spectacular, but beware: there is much violence, and much sexuality. It is rightfully rated 'R'; nobody in his right mind would want his children to imitate any of the criminal deeds shown in this film. Overt sexuality, including interracial sexuality, will offend some people. (Note that interracial sexuality in American movies is ordinarily exploitative. Not here!) That said, the filmmaker has chosen to not make any preachy comment on whether the social conditions are at all tolerable, whether drug use is desirable, or whether the violence that results from 'turf wars' or retribution against real or imagined slights to one's 'honor' are excusable. That's for the viewer to decide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cidade de Deus" (City of God)is the story of how children who "live" in one of the forgotten towns near Rio, have no other choice but to resort to drugs, guns and the realization that they can not expect to even hope for a real life.It is a grim, intense, disturbing and emotionally draining film, made all the more upsetting by the fact that it is based on a true story. It is all the more impressive when considering that the majority of children who "act" in this film are amateurs, and many of them actually come from the town depicted in the film.Director Fernando Meirelles creates an air of desperation and despair right from the first frame. The film tells the story of how gangs, violent gangs are a way of everyday life for those who live in the town. Children, no older than 8 - 10 are used to commit murder, and be murdered everyday.Meirelles does not spare us the details of these child murders either. He wants us to see all of the viciousness that these children experience everyday. One scene in particular, where a gang leader shoots two children from a competing gang in the foot, then has one of his child gang members kill one of them, is one of the most disturbing scenes I've ever seen in the movies.I don't want to go into anymore details, but it is clear that this movie is well worth the ratings that it has received on this board. I wish that it received the type of praise and rewards that it deserved at the time of its initial release. How it could not have won or even been nominated for best foreign language film, is beyond me.Go, rent this film. It is a masterpiece that deserves to be seen.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story like this cannot be written. Only true circumstances in life can generate a tale as the one depicted in City Of God. The simple fact that this was a true story makes this movie even more dumbfounding and astonishing at the same time. This movie is a visual masterpiece in it's crispness and story telling. The format in which the story is told is unique through the eyes of Rocket. The actors pull you into a world that most don't know exist and even through their vile nature and ways of thinking, there is something to love about everyone involved. Watch as Bene becomes a playboy, as Knock-Out Ned becomes a legend and Rocket becomes a man. I have watched this movie numerous times and find myself watching scenes over and over again. Few movies compel one to do so. Sit back and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heavy Cloud Over Heaven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A popular surge swept the land just prior to the 2003 Oscars and "City of God" became a critical success with the Academy. The popularity is somewhat misleading though as this production has tons of problems with its Oscar-nominated script and uneven performances across the board. The setting early is 1960s Rio de Janeiro. A ghetto just outside the city limits is the breeding ground for dangerous gangs of thugs who are little more than adolescents who go around and create chaotic violence. One of these youngsters grows to become Leandro Firmino, a heartless miscreant who toes the line between just being cruel and being down-right psychotic. He is kept somewhat under control by his top assistant Phellipe Haagensen, but in their world both are in as much danger as those that come into contact with them. As all this goes on another youngster (who grows to become Alexandre Rodrigues) from the same neighborhood looks to take a different route completely by trying to become a photographer. Rodrigues, like his contemporaries, also has a life that seems to be on a tight time table. The picture advances to the 1980s and the ultimate fates of the primary characters come shining through in vivid and ironic fashions. Directors Fernando Meirelles (Oscar-nominated in the category) and Katia Lund develop a technologically interesting picture that benefits greatly from landmark cinematography by Oscar-nominee Cesar Charlone and highly difficult editing techniques by Daniel Rezende (also Oscar-nominated). The camera-work is enough to give this film a high mark, but once again the performers are not as good as advertised and the script by Oscar-nominee Braulio Mantovani is unsteady and a bit pretentious. The fact that the tale is based on fact does not really give the picture any more credibility than it would have if it had been from the mind of a foreign screenwriter. The characters are not always believable and are usually not worth caring about. Many problems, but still a noble and overall intriguing product. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sitting here having trouble coming up with the words for this film. From start to ending you're thrust into such a great story (beautifully shot and directed as well) that keeps getting better and really has no slow spots. Another thing I loved is that the subtitling was masterfully done in the aspect that it fits perfectly in the scenes so its nearly impossible to miss action due to reading the titles. The characters are excellently portrayed and you'll just love Rocket, the main character who narrates the whole movie. I just can't describe in words how this movie makes me feel and how just so incredible it is. Everyone needs to see this now for it cannot be missed. Its got drama, comedy, violence, action, everything. So let the screen saver on your comp kick on and head to your local theater and see it NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cidade De Deus is Hell On Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that this film is extremely difficult to rate (for me, at least). I have been known, on many occasions, to purposely and graciously ignore a film's shortcomings in favor, say, of cinematic excellence. If I could just bring myself to do that for "Cidade De Deus," it would probably rate tops from me.But I cannot ignore the literally horrific, ultra-violent content of this film; it is just too shocking. Yes, I know it is undoubtedly there to make a "strong" point, but this just sickens me, literally; I felt nauseous.There is nothing angelic or heavenly about this City of God, the name of a notorious Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, ghetto slum. This is the "other side of the postcard"; it is really Hell On Earth. Hell for the gang members who deal in heavy drugs, and protect their turfs with the heaviest guns available on planet Earth. Hell for the police, who have turned satanic in their war against the drug demons. Hell for the dwellers, who get caught in the high-caliber crossfire, and must turn into demons themselves to have any chance of survival.SPOILER --- SPOILER --- SPOILER --- SPOILER --- SPOILER --- SPOILER The scene which almost made me vomit: the initiation of an extremely young gang member. He must choose which of two even younger boys, members of "The Runts," to kill, after each has been shot in the foot by the gang boss. The Runts are the antisocial kids who disrespect society, but who are too young to be in a drug gang yet; they don't really hurt anyone, but their transgression is to cause minor crime trouble on this gang's turf. Too bad for them. They are both crippled, and one is shot in the head, right there in front of us.The point is valid I suppose: At the end of "Cidade De Deus" we see the Runts take revenge on the gang leader by shooting HIM about three dozen times... And then THEY become the next terror-breeding drug gang from Hell in that neighborhood. The cycle of violence continues, with no end in sight.One of my figures of merit for a good film is the "watch-it-many-times" test. I know now that this is only one factor in rating a film. I will probably never watch "Cidade De Deus" more than once; I couldn't stand to do so.Cinematic excellence, including direction, artistic production, acting, etc.: 9 or 10 out of ten. Gratuitous Violence: 1. Average it out. Sorry, but that's the way it goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Degraded perspective about degradation in a polished videoclip packaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion on this movie has rapidly degraded as hours and days passed by. I too, as the movie progressed, got involved in the neat technical package, and violence in itself was not so disturbing... you know, we are civilized 21st century men! we love violence (when we are not directly involved with it), plus we love violent movies and this one, well,was just a punch to the stomach a bit harder than the previous ones. And then the story, ooh, it was so wisely penned! with that delicious ironic look ?-la Tarantino to smooth the edges of the bullet holes.But after a couple of days I focused my thoughts and decided that I did not like it. I found it disquieting. Not because of the violence and degradation depicted. I'm partially editing my previous comment just because I know that the average 20 y.o. boy (who is, I think the average and perfect audience for this movie) is not able to understand a subtler critical stance about violence in movies and only thinks "hey, violence exists so why movies should not show that?", and that's the reason why such a movie is currently ranked as the 18th best movie in the History of Cinema. Makes me think that when internet will be accessible by all 6 y.o. children, "The Lion King" will quickly surpass this pretentious movie.So what's wrong with violence in THIS movie? It's the way that the director has chosen to treat it. Can you show kids aged 8 that roam through the streets killing light-hearted and selling drugs? Yes, it's not shocking to show that, it sure happens for real in some damned place of humanity. Can you show kids aged 8 who smell death with terror in their eyes (the real terror, like only kids can feel) before getting shot because they have crossed paths with some leading gang? Yes, it's horrible but it probably happens for real. Can you take all this nauseating stuff about our refined societies and bring it on screen packaging it like an MTV videoclip? big show, hip music, special effects, frenzied camera movements? Yes, you can, but you risk total failure in delivering your message. If Meirelles' and the like's intention was to point their fingers at this degradation and tell the world "Look at what it's happening! How can it be possible that we are not able to change all this?", and they wanted to attain this with the lighter feeling of irony... well, then they totally failed! With their opportunistic art they have just shown to be a mechanism of the social processes that lead to that same degradation.How many of these "10 star-brilliant-astonishing-movie" people still bring in their stomachs the look of those kids after the coke and pop-corn have been digested? This is the point: this movie is just like a fireworks show with no moral queue, and the only sensational thing about it is the way it misses the real targets... politicians, police, businessmen and foreign governments. And as for the presumed realism... please, don't make me laugh: just learn that "spectacular" and "realistic" are antonyms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily One of the Best Films of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They would never make this film in America.I don't mean that it's too sexual or too violent for American filmmakers and filmgoers, though it would be unusual to see an American filmmaking, which fetishizes both topics, be so frank about them.I mean that it's too real to be an American film.I don't mean it's real like Boyhood. That's a different kind of real. American films are, by their nature, full of posture and preening. That's not inherently negative, but it prevents the kinds of conditions that created this film, a steady, unflinching, inward-pointed look at Rio's worst favela, Cidade de Deus, the City of God.American films' desire to take themselves so seriously often gets in their own way. They are often boring and monotonous. This film, while showcasing some of the most serious and dark themes out there, is tremendously entertaining. It can be fun. It can be energetic. It can be delightful. It knows when to go dark and when to explode into color.More than anything, it is captivating. Nothing is predictable, thanks in large part to the film's structure, which alongside Casino is proof that great films can be structured around narration. Actually, Casino is a great film to compare this to. Both films take place over relatively the same amount of time. Both films are about cesspools of corruption and violence, though one cesspool is obviously richer than the other. Both films feature a lot of cursing and explicit violence. Both films feature betrayal and paranoia. Both films feature astonishing grasp of cinematic wizardry. Both films end on relatively quiet final notes.One's about rich Vegas mobsters, and the other's about poor Rio gangsters, but they have a lot in common, not that you would notice that while you're watching either film. They feel fundamentally different, not least because the Scorsese flick is intoxicatingly introverted and psychological, while this film is punishingly vast and open. It reminds me of Slumdog Millionaire in a way, though with all due respect to the incredibly talented Danny Boyle, this is the better film by far. More than that, though, it reminds me of a classic adventure movie mashed up with a 90's- early 00's action movie, like a perverse, distorted Lord of the Rings/ The Fast and the Furious crossover.MM:FR contrasted its frenetic action and pace with a linear story. It's a grand antithesis that is a big reason why that film works so well. This film, with its propelling but non-frenetic action, is free to zip around the entire narrative space. Casino did not take advantage of the fact that its structure allowed it to double back and go on tangents. Scorsese, despite or perhaps because of his detailed background in film, stuck close to the playbook. I like to think of it as a limo driving crosscountry down the highway.City of God, meanwhile, is more like a truck swiveling and swerving down back roads. The opening scene is not the only occasion where the filmmakers take liberties with the timeline of the film. In fact, these liberties form the majority of the first two acts. The film sets up the framework for this right after the first scene, where it essentially argues 'If you want to understand X, you have to understand Y, and if you want to understand Y, you have to understand Z, so we're starting at Z.' But it does not proceed from Z to Y to X. During the Z storyline, the narrator, our protagonist, Rocket, might point out that W is important and come back to it after the film finished storyline Z.Conventionally speaking, this sounds like a recipe for disaster, but it turns out brilliant. The narrative structure is far better assembled and more interesting than almost any other film, proving that often, the unconventional way is the best way. The same can be said for the film's masterful editing and cinematography.The early 2000's were a gold mine for visual craft, producing the most beautiful-looking movies of all time, including the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Amelie, which not coincidentally are the only two films I would say look better than City of God. But in a way, it's even more beautiful than those movies, which are often pretty in the same way a painting is pretty. This is pretty in a way that only a film can be, in a way that cannot be fully scene from just looking at screenshots.This film has a wide variety of showstopper scenes, scenes where plot, character, and craft come together to create a spectacle the likes of which I have never seen before. The greatest of these comes at the end of the second act, at a crazy party that is extremely 70's, extremely Brazilian, and extremely entertaining. As a film critic, I knew something was going to go wrong, but I was shocked and awed by what happened. The visual craft during this sequence is haunting. Thanks to the strobe lights, it is like reality itself is blinking in and out of existence.After that scene, the film's structure changes, and it settles into its final act. It stops jumping around so frequently. The color fades away, and it becomes an urban war film akin to The Hurt Locker and Mockingjay- Part 2. Bombs go off. Good intentions are squandered. Lives are lost by the bucketload.There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.There is only darkness.There is only war.There is only the City of God.</fullReview>

A bit jarring to have a story told in an order known only to the director but I dutifully followed along as it tied together and everyone connected.I'm positioned by the camera too close to faces of people in the apartment and I don't like the smell of fear and sweat. While this repetitive tale was overkill on murder and machismo,I don't complain for some reason. Perhaps in my drive-through bank and sushi world this is what I needed to see in order to understand life doesn't change in the city of god,everyone dies and childhood ends when you can walk and hold a gun.A going away party and then you die....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life of children amid-st violence and drug-abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie Review: City of God (2002) -Ayush Tulsyan Director: Fernando MeirelleBased on real events, City of God is the story of children who grew up in a violent neighborhood of Rio De Jenerio, a ghetto by the name "Cidade De Deus" which is Portuguese for "City of God". Told from the viewpoint of a boy named Rocket, this movie which spans over more than two decades of violence, depicts a lot of drug-abuse, mafia war, crime led by the motive of revenge, and amid-st all these, the desperation of our narrator to become a photographer. Though the movie is in Portuguese, and you might not identify any of the actors, it is real fun to watch, especially for those people who enjoyed watching Gangs of Wasseypur.The movies begins somewhere around the late 1960s where our narrator is 8 or 9 year old kid who idolizes his elder brother but isn't brave enough to follow him into his hood-lump activities. During one such activity, because of another kid named Lil' Dice, Rocket's brother and his gang end up in trouble. Around mid 70s, This kid Lil'Dice changes his name to Lil'Z, grows into power and takes over all the Drug lords of the town. What follows is Lil'Z regime in the City. The movie revolves around Lil'Z, his friend Benny, Rocket and a former army-man Knockout Ned.There are a lot of indigenous sound tracks in the movie. The opening track aptly does the job of engaging the audience. The expressions, the enthusiasm in dialogue delivery and the music aptly conveys all the emotions. The Cinematography is amazing. A lot of wide frame shots have been taken stunningly. The color scheme has been maintained throughout which ensures continuity and absorbs the viewer in the movie, which is further supported by camera movements. They areas intuitive and thought out as they could be. The direction and the set design also have a constant taste throughout the movie.City of God is something which gives you an insight in the lives of people living in violence affected regions and the effect of this violence on the local children. If you're comfortable with cuss words, then this movie is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In City of God, the brilliance in movie making is rivaled only by the brutality.It seems every technique known to man has been utilised in making film, which makes it feel like a masterpiece in the original medieval sense of that word. In particular, there is a lot of hand held camera and quite close up shots, which make sense and make the film really tangible and personal.The writing is brilliant. A kid asks another kid what his name is during a brawl and the narrator uses that opportunity to tell the audience his name. A lot of smart little things like that, but the story itself also has a good structure and smart turns. I watched a whole lot of Oscar-winning Hollywood movies and they have just been dwarfed by this Brazilian one, but this crime drama is a really heavy movie to sit through. There is some really really messed up stuff here. Be warned. And in that regard, I have been a little bit sceptical about how believable the extreme villainy of some of the kids in this movie is (and characters in general), but after reading and seeing some of the recent events in the world, I guess I have to adjust my views of reality.This film puts me in a strange position. On the one hand I cannot deny the brilliance of the film. One the other hand, from the entertainment perspective, the film left me feeling kind of uncomfortable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas of Brazil!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is by far the best film about the underdeveloped areas of Brazil and the fact many of the actors, producers and crew were from the district of the same name gives to the flick much more faithfulness to its source. In summary go watch for it is amazing, brutally honest and it doesn't fear to be funny, make the characters likable and to show the more day to day problems of life, like as the narrator say" find a girl".This is important because a lot of people believe that ,in areas with high crime rate life is 24 /7 miserable ,well it has its dark moments yes, but humans are adaptable and can find happiness anywhere they live and this film shows that in an excellent way. The performances from even the little kids are great and you almost think that you saw a documentary with the realism in the scenes. That's because is partially true for the film is based on the accounts of the real life inhabitants of the City of God in Brazilia Brasil.Here we see the story of this area from its foundation in the sixties to the urban and dirty environment of the eighties as we follow our narrator Rocket who lives in the area and we learn through him the history, the habits ,the inhabitants and status quot at any given moment in the story. For a film made with only 3,3 million dollars it is amazing directed and thank God ,dispite the low budget no sake camera! The people we meet in the City have their flaws and redeeming qualities, which is awesome, for it makes them totally human.The only sad part isn't that the film isn't known or praised or even didn't make money ( it make 30,6 millions). The tragedy lays to the fact that thirty years after the events of the movie took place, the urban centers of Brazil and in general South America haven't ,with the exception of Chile and Ecuador, got better and crime, drugs ,police brutality and corruption still ruled these areas and unfortunately the problem doesn't show and sign of recovering.I really liked it and I am total to my title "The Goodfellas of Brazil" for this historic gangster flick has influenced it and the writers have said that took inspiration from "Funny how?", but they didn't copied it, they studied its best parts and applied them to the story while being faithful to their own vision of how to make a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film received worldwide critical acclaim, receiving four Academy Award nominations in 2004: Best Cinematography (César Charlone), Best Director (Meirelles), Best Editing (Daniel Rezende) and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) (Mantovani). Before that, in 2003 it had been chosen to be Brazil's runner for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but it was not nominated to be one of the five finalists. City of God (Portuguese: Cidade de Deus) is a 2002 Brazilian crime drama film co- directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund, released in its home country in 2002 and worldwide in 2003. The story was adapted by Bráulio Mantovani from the 1997 novel of the same name written by Paulo Lins, but the plot is loosely based on real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l Zé and vigilante-turned- criminal Knockout Ned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in Brazil in the 1970s, the film tells the story of Rocket (Alexandre Rorigues in an excellent, understated performance), a teenage boy living in an extremely violent area of Rio De Janeiro called The City of God. Like most boys his age, all Rocket wants is to get laid, smoke a little blow and chill with his friends. However, the violence around him not only complicates this it throws him smack dab in the middle of it. When he loses his low paying job, he watches with envy the carefree life of the drug lords Lil Zee and Benny (Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) who run the ghetto. They flash money and ride brand new motor scooters through the streets of the hood. When he loses his girl to the more enigmatic gangster Benny, Rocket declares in frustration, "It was like a message from God: Honesty doesn't pay, sucker." Seeing delinquency as the only way to prosper, Rocket decides to pursue criminal ventures of his own. Fortunately, Rocket and his equally square buddy, prove to be the most inept of criminals. They don't even have the heart to rob a lost drunk who has unwittingly gotten lost in the slums. Rocket soon resigns himself to the fact he's no criminal. He's one of the nobodies. One of the thousands whose fate is in the hands of a few crazy fools with guns. Luckily for Rocket, fate was waiting around the corner with a better hand for him to play.</fullReview>

I mean seriously,first of all the movie has no story,no plot.It serves no purpose.Is this so highly rated because it shows poverty and how difficult life is in these neighborhoods?I just don't get it.Second,the characters...its like there is no protagonist whatsoever,its just a big mess of guys,that you don't care about,not even the protagonist,he is like non-existent,they are like to many that you don't even remember who is who during the course of the film,and some poor dialogue,its just not even amusing to watch them talking.Third,I actually like violence in my films,but this one,the scene where they shoot the two little kids,I watched it in disgust.It was cold and not pleasant to watch.And before you say, "yeah but this is what happens in the Favelas" how are you sure?So you tell me the local drug kingpin goes around and kills innocent little kids?Its not even realistic.In general for a gangster movie it was really not great.There were some good scenes and moments in the movie,but that's that.And the worst thing is that this movie could actually be really good.There is no charm in poverty.You like watching poor people and small time shitty gangsters in a movie with no plot?Then this movie is for you.5/10 might seem a big high after witnessing my negative opinion,but I rated it as such because it was watchable...a bit and was not entirely terrible.Surely it was bad but not terrible.For the finale,don't watch it.You are not going to miss something,there are better 2 hour long movies you can watch out there</fullReview>

Meanwhile we also see the power struggles in the neighbourhood, how they developed, who the main protagonists are and the state of their feud.A superb story, well told.

		<fullReview>City of God is an exciting, action packed, and breath taking film. Large amounts of colors and thrilling camera angels are used to tell this tropical story. The film takes place in the slums of Rio De Janeiro, where the people party and police are long away. Director Fernando Meirelles does an awesome job of bringing the crime filled, poverty-stricken, gangland to life. The movie opens up with a group of young men on a wild chase after a chicken. This is when Rocket, the narrator, enters the film. The film flashes back to show Rocket's and his peers' crime filled childhood. Then a young child named Lil' Dice, later known as Lil' Ze, is introduced into the story. Lil'Ze's story will be told along side Rocket's. Rocket becomes a photographer when he receives a stolen Camera as a gift. From that point on, he builds a love with the art of photography. Rocket gets a small gig working with the newspaper in his city. His camera roll gets in the hands of another photographer and they use the pictures Rocket took of a terrifying gang leader. When the head gang leader, who happens to be Lil'Ze, sees he made the newspaper he becomes excited from the publicity. Rocket on the other hand, thinks it the end of his life, but actually gets recognition from both sides. The newspaper starts to pay him to continue with more pictures of the gangs. Rocket ends up scoring big when he gets some pictures of a death of a young gang member that was killed by a cop. Rocket becomes a professional photographer and makes it out of the "City of God." City of God is more than just an action and crime filled story. It is the tale of a young man making it out of a city where no one ever makes out. The contrast of Lil' Ze and Rockets lives are powerful among each other. It shows the reality of the slums of Rio De Janeiro. You either gang bang or hope you make it out with a talent. With the whole film being in Portuguese it gives it an authentic feel. Despite having to read the subtitles the film is easy to follow and stay connected to. The different culture amazes me but also shows it has a lot of similarity to the US crime movies. This is a great film and I highly suggest it. To me it's a classic must see gangster crime film.</fullReview>

From the beginning of Rockets flashbacks, you see the poverty that surrounds everyone; the small shorts worn with shirts that barely cover their stomachs or don't even have a shirt, the small houses crammed together that are falling apart, rusted old cars, and the run down shops shape the poverty of the town. There were only two ways to get out of it. One, leave the City Of God, but that's virtually impossible, as seen when Benny was preparing to leave but was shot. The other way, become part of the drug world and get to the the top. This is what Lil' Ze did, and what all children aspire to do. Ze, like many other boys, saw how violence and drugs would give people 'great' lives from a young age. Ze demonstrates how this lifestyle of a drug dealer ultimately is not your rise, but actually your fall. He was born in violence and died in violence. But the brutally honest part isn't in the amount of violence seen throughout the entire movie, it is the last scene that truly captures the horrors of the City of God. The kids that killed Ze, were now 'in charge' of the business that all kids want to be in, and as they walk away with guns in their hands talking about making a blacklist of all the people they are going to kill, you realize that this vicious cycle never ends. History will keep repeating itself over and over again with the next generation, and unless you have greater dreams in life like Rocket, you will become what everyone does, a drug consumed man controlled by violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, story, and cinematography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true favela (slum) named 'City of God' in Rio, the film does a great job at creating a realistic looking depiction of the life there. A little trivia: The location in which they filmed at was a neighbouring favela, as the actual favela was too dangerous to film in. Another trivia: Filmmakers actually recruited children from the favela to produce an authentic feel for the movie. Based on this fact, it is deeply disconcerting that these children are able to act out violet scenes so well, as if they already possessed the persona of their characters. The acting overall is very realistic, and the whole cast does a fantastic job, probably because they have been exposed to this reality all their life.The story was set in a unique way, with many flashbacks and initial introductions. That slightly annoyed me, when they would introduce a new character and then say that it wasn't time for his story yet. But it was interesting to have so many characters in the film, as it was used in a way to cover more aspects of the favelas. The introduction of so many characters and how they changed could also be a way to generalize these characters, as a way of saying that these characters can be found in any slum (Felicia Chan, and Valentina Vitali). However because Rocket is the narrator, it does come into question how he gains knowledge of the events that unfold to these characters when he isn't present.The cinematography and editing does well to complement the authenticity of the film. With its fast pace and well planned shots, the film right from the beginning establishes the action, fear and danger of what is to come. The explicit brutality of violence is not hidden and for this film and what they wanted to depict, it is probably necessary. However, I am not sure if is accurate in its representation of violence and the drug circle as it does seem excessive. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychological thriller that expands traditional thinking of growing up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is one of the first movies I ever watched, or at least remembered watching. This foreign film (to America) depicts what its like growing up in poverty, near Rio De Janeiro, and what it takes to survive these conditions. The lead character explains what it was like being in the trio of "bad" kids from his neighborhood, running from the cops, and stories of his friends at a young age committing mass murder. Our main character finds solace in photography in opposition to gang-banging, which seems to be the norm the rest of the children fall naturally into. The story pans out to illustrate that no one leaves the gang or Rio De Janeiro for that matter, unless they're in a body bag. A structural system of family and friendship does not trump money or greed and is a beautiful picture of how these deadly sins abolish your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Li'l Zé and his gang is having fun chasing a runaway chicken in a Rio favela called the Cidade de Deus "City of God". The chicken comes to Rocket with his camera. Then flashbacks to the 60s tell the story of Rocket who becomes the photographer of his friends. Li'l Zé and his best friend Benny grow up to be the crime boss of the city. There's Carrot who is a criminal leader tolerated by Benny and there's Knockout Ned who turned away from crime.It is truly a new Godfather. It is the harsh brutality of the slums. It's the randomness of the world. It beats with a human heart. It's a little messy. It's visceral. The kids are played by kids. The criminals are remorseless. The amateur actors are authentic. The cinematography is terrific. The location can't get more real. It is a new crime masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adapting the novel by Paulo Lins, who grew up in the Cidade De Deus fa vela and based the story on actual events and characters, screenwriter Braulio Mantovani has condensed the mammoth 600-page tome into key chapters, titles of which appear on screen, and split the action into three specific periods: the late 1960s, the 1970s and the early '80s.Despite comparable use of gangland kids stepping before cameras for the first time, Meirelles' film (co-directed by Katia Lund) has far less in common with fellow Brazilian Hector Babenco's crime saga "Pixote" than with "Goodfellas" thanks to factors such as its use of music and voice-over, distinct feel for each period and frequent narrative digressions and backtracking.However, "City" is no cynical, hipster account of criminal bravado, instead spinning its bruising tale around a tenderhearted center in aspiring photographer Buscape (Alexandre Rodrigues). Clearly representing author Lins, Buscape exists in the thick of the action but is the one significant figure to maintain some purity, providing the sprawling, multi-character story with a unifying voice.Bracing opening places Buscape face to face with the gang led by Ze Pequeno or Little Ze (Leandro Firmino DA Hora) as the group chases a runaway chicken intended for supper before they take on members of a rival band. Action then rewinds to the '60s, when the city was a shantytown of low-cost housing without electricity, paved streets or transport. The 11-year-old Buscape recounts the rule of the so-called Tender Trio. These adolescent amateur robbers were looked upon as the toughest hoods imaginable but were angels compared with the more ruthless criminal corps that would later evolve, to be led by then Pr- teen Ze, known at the time as Little Dice (Douglas Silva), who quickly exhibits an appetite for power and killing.In the '70s, Ze consolidates his empire, flanked by trusted buddy Bene (Phelipe Haagensen), progressing from robbery to coke-dealing and wiping out all the competition save for rival dealer Sandro Cenoura (Matheus Nachtergaele), who's protected by his friendship with Bene. This central section is perhaps the film's most enjoyable, with a richly colorful character in Bene, who transforms himself into a bleach-blond playboy and whose mellow nature provides a useful counterweight to Ze's hard, cold ambition. Planning to bow out of crime to grow weed on a farm with his girlfriend, Bene throws a farewell disco party but is killed in a skirmish before making his exit.His departure leaves Cenoura suddenly vulnerable. But before Ze can eliminate him, he makes another formidable enemy in Manu Galinha (Seu Jorge), whose girlfriend is raped and brother is killed by the now 18- year-old gang leader. Teaming with Cenoura, Manu goes up against Ze in an escalating war, as Buscape's photographs contribute to spread their notoriety in national media.Creating a complex, non-linear narrative construction while maintaining a clear through line, the eventful mosaic is given a lively dynamic by its constant shifts in focus to foreground different characters, often fleetingly introduced with a promise to expand on their stories later. That liveliness is further enhanced by d.p. Cesar Charlone's knockout visuals and Daniel Rezende's machine-gun editing, both of which make stylistic transitions to differentiate between the three periods.In addition to shooting style, color is used keenly. Early section when the fa vela is an undeveloped series of box houses divided by open, sandy stretches is bathed in golden light that gradually intensifies into richer, darker tones as the area becomes more built up, overpopulated and dominated by crime.Devices such as split screen, slow-mo, jump cuts and whiplash pans add to the visual texture, with all the technical prowess bordering on show- offs at times, particularly early on. But the film's pulsating rhythms, narrative heart and the intense faces and itself-conscious work of the non-pro cast ? who went through an extensive workshop process before shooting ? make this a hard-edged, taut and compelling crime odyssey, all the more powerful because its protagonists rarely reach the age of 20.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I have watched this film several times by now and I'll probably watch it several times more in my lifetime. I'm not the kind of person who watches films more than once. If I remember what happens I don't need to see it again.There are only a small number of films I can watch over and over: - The Shining; Warriors; Leon the Professional; Golgo 13; Ninja Scroll; Jungle Book; Southern Comfort and of course, City of God.The film is so engrossing. I remember when I first watched it I was sucked into the storyline and forgot everything happening around me. The way it's been directed really feels like you're watching real life. The slums feel like slums. The cast all look like they belong in their environment (the director apparently cast a lot of people who weren't actors and actually came from the city of God). The dramatic movements are genuinely moving. I can't put any spoilers here, so all I'll say is the moment at the end gave me goosebumps. If a film can do that to me, I applaud the writers and directors.I recommend this film to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A disturbing compelling film that I will never forget; City of God (Cidade de Deus) is a moving and captving story that goes far beyond "just" a great film. Main protagonist, Rocket (Buscapé) is a non-violent adolescent and inspiring photogher making ends meet in the violent and dangerous, City of God. Rocket tries to stay out of conflict but is often in the middle; because of friends and acquaintance in the gang scene. Rocket narrates the story from his point-of-view. Starting from the beginning, with the overcrowding of the lower class quarter west of Rio de Janeiro, the rise and fall of the "Tender Trio", the introduction of Li'l Zé/ Li'l Dice (Zé pequeno, Dadinho) and his partner/childhood friend, Benny (Bené); to the deadly end of the "Vietnam" of the City of God, and the start of the new beginning, Commando Vermelho (Red Command). Benny and Shaggy shared similar traits throughout the film; both were inspiring for an out of the city and starting new lives. Unfortunately, violence led to their deaths along with many others in this film and in real life. I recommend this film to only mature audiences. Not for the easily disturbed or children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Paulo Lins who based the plot on real events having taken place in a favela, Brazilian slum, called City of God. The story is one of lost, unforgiving odds, bleak chances, little to no chance of escaping and of friends turned enemies.City of God is a unique experience and a unique film. Only a couple of the actors had had any prior acting experience, all of them in relatively minor roles. All of the rest, including all the main actors, were picked from actual favelas, many of them from the actual City of God. And yet, if I hadn't been told this, I couldn't have told. They're that good, that deep into their characters, and they bring this manic energy into everything they do on screen. You can sense the raw emotions churning under their skin, because they've been there. They know what it's like.The film doesn't pull any punches either. It tells the story about young street punks, looking their slice of heaven and riches through robbery, drug dealing, racketing, murder and mayhem. It doesn't shy away from the harsh realities, it doesn't try to sugarcoat it, nor does it offer any excuses.Aside from the unprofessional actors, the rest of the film is very professional. The cinematography is brilliant, as is the whole style, the whole vibrant yet muddy feel they give to the City. The story spans about a decade of time, yet it feels cohesive, like we never lose anything because of a jump in time.City of God is unforgiving. It's brutal, bloody, unpleasant and showcases that we still have a long way to go as a species. But we need films like it exactly for that last part. We need to be shown what's still wrong with the world. And I admire this film for having to guts to do just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>un, don't walk, to the cinema is all I can say. This electrifying picture is part tender coming-of-age film and part gang-warfare epic from the Brazilian slum, or favela, told from the viewpoint of the children who manage to be both its underclass and its criminal overlords. It's a movie with all the dials cranked up to 11, an overwhelming, intoxicating assault on the senses, and a thriller so tense that you might have the red seat plush in front of you - or even some unfortunate's hair - gripped in both fists.Crime has, in a nauseous reversal of liberal social thinking, almost been "designed into" the City of God, but any foreseeable conventional breakdown of law and order has evolved one or two steps further into the corruption and degradation of children. Li'l Dice, a tiny kid, plans a staggeringly audacious hold-up of a brothel, but in a fit of pique at being relegated to the status of lookout by his older comrades, returns to the scene of the crime to murder every single innocent customer and employee of the "motel" - it is a truly chilling moment of unalloyed evil.Meirelles's storytelling rushes forward at a full, breathless tilt, swerving, accelerating, doubling back on itself, amplifying the roles and experiences of incidental characters. A bravura narrative moment reveals itself when he discloses the history of one single apartment, showing how it becomes degraded and denatured as it ceases to be a family home and becomes a drug-dealer's den. Meirelles's film flashes and sweeps around you, dizzying, disorientating, intoxicating.His mastery of his material consists not merely in the adaptation of Paulo Lins's novel, but a direct engagement with the ghetto itself, and his triumphant recruitment of a veritable army of non-professionals is the result of an almost military raid on this dangerous territory. This is something that combines film-making with oral history. It is a compelling piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah yes, City of God what a film, what a film. If your not a fan of subtitle films and won't watch any at least make sure this is an exception because you definitely won't regret it.Alexandre Rodrigues plays Rocket (the nicknames aren't the only good thing about the film) who like everyone else in the City of God lives between rival drug gangs in a world of sex, drugs and violence as a way of life. Rocket, has a story to tell and glorious one at that, almost everyone in the film gets their own mini-biography with different main characters being woven in and out each others stories.Obviously this isn't a lighted hearted or jolly 130 minutes, it's cruel, intense and doesn't let the minute details of the plot become insignificant - as the end proves. Meaning there is a hell of a lot of satisfaction to get when all the pieces of jigsaw beautifully fit together. The shoot-outs, drug taking and massive amount of betrayal all ultimately make a culture undeniably worthy a trip of those regular and not so regular film goers.</fullReview>

The film is without doubt one of the greatest films I've seen, along side the infamous, Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. The city of God, cannot only been seen as a metaphor for freedom, but more having the need to succeed and have ambition and dreams.City of God, can be first seen as a very complicated film, but once you get into it, you will soon see its true colours shine through, and why there are so many fantastic reviews.my overall conclusion, would be if even this film doesn't seem like your cup of tea, its a must see for all as it not only teaches the realism of culture and greatness, but also how it can be related to everyones every day life.10/10</fullReview>

It is very much comparable to other very acclaimed Gangster movies like "The Godfather", "Goodfellas" and "Pulp Fiction".The cinematography is excellent and the flashback sequences are mind blowing. I'm an instant fan of REAL cinema and 'City of God' just stands out against others in terms of the depiction of reality in purest form. Its really mind numbing &amp; troubling to see the extent to which bribery, corruption &amp; disorder prevailed in 1970s in Brazil. The movie is a must watch for those who love REAL cinema. Those who liked "Blood Diamond" or "Lord of War" are definitely gonna love this movie. My verdict: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film based on facts. A story of crime in the City of God outside of Rio de Janeiro. Drug-related crime in which young people and children are heavily involved. To show it in a film format is not easy, especially since the book is very complex. And making that film truly fantastic is even harder. But it has been done. The film is not one in which you can gaze at the CGI, or go all 'awww' over a romance, or laugh at the silly slapstick. Here, it is the characters and their stories that make the movie. Nothing to distract you from any flaws or ridiculous or absurd moments. But there needn't be any distractions-the film hits you right in the face with the facts. Because even though it's unbelievable-it is based on a true story/ies. It's brutal, it's honest, it's unbelievable, it's impossible to turn away from and it doesn't stop until the end. And after the credits you are left thinking about what you had just seen, still trying to get your head around the fact that 7 year old boys received guns and were parts of gangs, dying for them. You think about the decisions those people made. Not just Rocket, but every one of them. The answers are not thrown at you-you are required to think. It's strong. It's thought provoking. It's one of the greatest films of the decade, if not of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a measure of how untouchable Quentin Tarantino was once considered that City Of God director Walter Salles was compared favourably to him on the film's original release: pre-Slumdog, world cinema wasn't usually associated with breathless, hyper-kinetic camera-work.Set among the gun-happy gangs of Rio De Janeiro, this explosive drama grabs viewers by the scruff and tips them into the middle of the Brazilian favelas, aka 'Hell on Earth.' This writer also recalls (almost literally) dragging his unwilling ex into the cinema to see this, after catching it a day before. Afterwards, she was extremely grateful. That's how good City Of God is: a film you'll happily see twice in two days. But more impressively, a movie to win your girlfriend over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cidade de Deus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies try to recreate the real world, giving us a "true" story that's supposed to be gripping, gritty, and scary but never completely accomplishing the goal. Other times we get movies that would appear to give us what we were expecting if it weren't for the fact that they've been done over and over again. In 2002, though, Fernando Meirelles gave us a new story that showed us a new world. Focusing on the true story of Rocket as he grows up around the gangs in Cidade de Deus, a neighborhood in Rio de Janiero where gangs of children ran free to rob, loot, and deal drugs, City of God feels more like a documentary than a dramatic theatrical film.Narrated by Rocket (Alexandre Rodriguez), City of God begins with the story of the Tender Trio. The Tender Trio, a teenage gang that pretty much ran Cidade de Deus in the 60's which also included Rocket's brother Goose, robbed gas trucks at gun point, stealing the money and giving the propane to the people around them. They never made much off the money, so a young hanger on named Li'l Dice gave them the idea to rob the rich in a local hotel. Things don't go quite as planned and everyone in the hotel ends up dead, with the Tender Trio hunted by the police. Fast forward to the 70's and Li'l Dice, now Li'l Ze, is the most respected hood in Cidade de Deus. Having killed all the members of the hotel in the 60's robbery, and Goose, Rocket's brother after that, he got a taste of blood. As Rocket tries to avoid him, Li'l Ze kills off all the drug dealers in Cidade de Deus making way for him to be the only hookup in the slums. But, as he gains control of the slums, he kills the family of one man who is going to try his damnedest to take him down.City of God is a gangster movie through and through, but while you might see some things that remind you of other gangster movies you never feel that this movie is being derivative. The director does borrow things from, say, Martin Scorsese (e.g.: the talk of how drug dealing works in the slums reminded me of Casino), Meirelles always makes it his own. And while the movie is a gangster movie and does deal with a gangster making his way up the chain and ruling the crime world in a neighborhood, the movie never feels like it's taking the usual route, giving equal time to the rise of the Li'l Ze and to Rocket's venture in becoming a photojournalist and staying out of the crime world.The film looks absolutely amazing. The cinematography gives everything the feel of being in the sun drenched City in Rio de Janeiro. On top of that, the camera moves gives the film a sense of urgency and a certain freshness that makes everything feel that much more real. The writing reminds me a bit of Quentin Tarantino, it's a bit all over the place, but in a good way. As you meet a character that's important to the story your whisked away into the world of who they were before they entered into the story. It works in much the same way as Tarantino's ADD addled films, but never takes away from the story as it has in other films that have tried to copy the "Tarantino Method" so to speak.While all of that works to make an amazingly gripping film, there would be nothing without the actors. Typically, in my reviews, I would prefer to point out great performances, but in this movie that's nigh impossible. From the Runts (young groups of children who loot and rob people and businesses in the slums) to the main characters, everyone works as a team player. The point is that they're performances are so genuine, so unique, that everyone feels like the live and breathe in this world. When watching this movie you feel like you are visiting Cidade de Deus, and that's what you really want from this type of movie.In this movie I can see no bad, but there are things that you should know before you watch the movie. The majority of the violence is dealing with children and teens, which makes the violence more frightening and disturbing. Meirelles doesn't shy away from anything, even murdering a six to eight year old child. One of the great things about the way the violence is handled though, is that you never want the violence to happen, you always feel disturbed by the violence that does happen and prefer to stay away from it as the movie goes on (the way it really should be in movies). The movie is in Portuguese so you will have to read subtitles, but I have to say, if you choose to do so, you'll be rewarded by the story you receive. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Foreign Cinema at its best! This movie is so strong, so hard hitting, it's able to leave a very strong mark in your memory, which is the best compliment for any movie. Cidade De Deus was on my list for a very long time, but it takes me a lot of time before I brace myself to start a movie with subtitles, but I'm glad I finally saw it! Based on a true story, set in Brazil, movie covers every essence of a "Drug movie", violence, sex, blood, and the extra topping in this one, Children Gangsters. If you thought you saw it all about Children holding guns in Blood Diamond then watch this, it'll definitely prove you wrong. With all the bloodshed and gore, movie does have some really heart wrenching moments as well. The cinematography of this movie took me aback! Especially while introducing new characters, and adding extra angle to the story, brilliant! Same goes out for the performances by every single character in the movie. The only glitch was the movie feels a lil dragged and I was starting to feel the movie is overrated, but just as you start to feel that, BOOM, it picks up the pace! Look out for the kid who portrays young Lil' Dice, one of the finest performances by a child artist I've ever come across. This is a must watch for everyone, especially for those who thought Slumdog Millionaire was the best movie to be shot in slums. Time to discover underbelly of Brazil, real dark!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfection, a word that describes Cidade de Deus in the best way. I ain't gonna talk about the story and the plot cause it's not necessary. If you watched the movie you know it. If you didn't you would probably just scroll through it. But I am going to talk about the things that make this movie what it is, one of the greatest feats of cinema ever. With great characters, absolutely convincing acting and a story that is told incredibly well by at the same time being so interesting that it drags you in and brutally shocking. Movie making style is also great, a bit alike to Tarantino's. Almost everything in the movie is Oscar worthy.This movie is not for everyone, but the ones who see it will not regret it. If you enjoyed it, I highly recommend Omnibus 174</fullReview>

The camera work is interesting and superb. If you haven't seen it, see it. But for the full effect I find it's nicer to watch it in Portugese with subtitles. My mini parents guide (below) contains possible spoilers. It works on a 1 to 5 basis, 1 being soft, 3 being mild and 5 being extreme.Sex/Nudity - 4 Violence - 5 Alcohol/Drugs - 3 Intenseness - 4Basic information - City of God is suitable for adults and less sensitive teens. If your child wants to see it and is under 15ish, I would advise you to see it first as some aspects are quite graphic. The film is in Portugese with subtitles (although an English dubbed version is available). Cidade de Deus is a brutal drama about life in the Rio de Janeiro slums.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a marvel at depicting criminal behavior in youth microcosms, but it's also one of the ugliest films I've seen. It's very dark and dreary set in the dismal and bleak streets of Rio. I was nauseated after a while by watching the jerky often disjointed plot. The editing was effective, but it looked like they made things difficult for themselves to cram so much info and footage with the various subplots. Pseudo-documentary is alright. But I agree that I also didn't care for any of the characters except for Rocket. None of them inspire any sympathy. But then again who would want to depict these people as anything better than the dregs of the earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The City of God is the name of a city slum in Rio de Janeiro. The movie is so shocking in the amount of violence that takes place in these streets, that it is one place you must not go. The movie follows the lives of several kids who grow up in the slums during the 60's, 70's, and 80's. Some kids took the path of crime, violence and the drug trade, and others tried to escape the slum. The senseless violence in this movie was so brutal that even the cops wouldn't go into the slums without a squad of men. It looked like all the teenagers had a gun, and they would use it if anybody looked the wrong way. One of the kids, Buscape became a photographer for a newspaper, and this story was described and seen through his eyes. The movie is a real eye opener on how little life is worth in other parts of the world. The movie is not in English and has subtitles. (Miramax Films, Run Time 1:30, Rated R) (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whirlwind of virtuoso filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cidade de Deus" (City of God) begins with a chase after an escaped chicken and it's a mad rush from then on in this mind-boggling autobiography of a favela dweller who works his way out of the slums into mainstream Rio de Janeiro by becoming a photographer (in the original book he's a writer but this change toward the visual is a smart one). Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund have forged a truly amazing movie: people are absolutely dazzled by the vibrancy of the action and the sheer brilliance of the filmmaking. Indeed, "Cidade de Deus" is a technical wonder, bursting with virtuoso effects that never distract from the action. True, there is a degree of violence that sometimes makes people walk out of the auditorium midway. Some viewers and some critics complain there's so much killing that you're numbed. But whether we like this movie or not, we have to acknowledge its stunning craftsmanship. And observers say that though the slums of Rio have cleaned up and quieted down in the last decade, what the movie shows is true to life.And here is what's most remarkable: that the movie tells an extraordinarily well-organized and coherent story; that with a large cast and a dizzying onrush of scenes and despite the underlying madness of this Brazilian slum life of poverty, drugs, and violence these scenes show us, everything in "Cidade de Deus" is lucid and logical. The technical flash isn't a matter of confusing us, but of conveying the hopped up, bloody action precisely and succinctly: this is what the dissolves and jump cuts, fast cutting, freeze-frames, and speeded up film are all for: to condense events without loss of vividness; to tell the complex story without losing our sense of its vivid texture."City of God" is a masterpiece of editing.Essentially it's a series of short stories (indicated by small onscreen titles) focused on a group of interrelated favela figures of the narrator's generation. At the end of the chicken sequence, the camera revolves around "Rocket," the narrator ("Busca-pé," Alexandre Rodrigues), and as it revolves the background fades to sandy color and we're taken to his early youth and the "Tender Trio" hijacking a truck and throwing cash to kids, which introduces us to several of the most important characters, "Bennie" (Bené, Phellipe Haagensen as the older boy) and "Little Dice" (later to become "Little Zee," "Zé Pequeno," played by Leandro Firmino da Hora), a team whose last moment together in a strobe-lit Seventies disco teeming with dancers is the emotional climax of the movie. This powerful scene is the triumph of the homicidal, mad drug lord, Zee, over the "hippy" "playboy" Bennie, who is about to take his girlfriend Angélica (Alice Braga) to the country and live in peace, and it's also a moment of extraordinary sexual tension and sadness. Of all the senseless killings, this is the most senseless -- and yet the most meaningful.But before the disco climax, there's the "Miami Motel Robbery," when a brothel holdup by the fledgling gangsters turns into a grizzly, sensual bloodbath. It's only later that we learn why and how. Characteristically, the movie always goes back to dot its i's and cross its t's, with an assertion of narrative control rather like the style of Tony Richardson's 1963 film version of Fielding's "Tom Jones." The motel robbery fixes the seal of violence on the generation. The next major story is "The Death of Shaggy." Shaggy too tries to escape the favela with a girlfriend to live the hippy country life of "paz y amor" that Bennie later envisions. Shaggy is a handsome, charming, lazy young gangster who's clearly much too young and too pretty to die, but down he goes, and seeing a photographer at the death of Shaggy is what first leads Rocket to get a camera for himself.The underlying personal thread is the story of how Rocket becomes a news photographer and escapes from the slum; a minor one is how he loses his virginity. He loves Angélica and the first freeze frames we see are his shots of her on the beach, where he cunningly casts her current beau, Thiago (Daniel Zettel), in shadow. Even in this first appearance Thiago characteristically expresses his taste for coke: this will later lead the relatively suburban, well off (and redheaded, Jewish) boy to become a close associate of Lil' Zee in his final days. The constant killings as the favela scene becomes wilder and more violent turn the streets and houses into a grim, dark slaughterhouse, but there's still a stunning sense of the resilience of youth in, for instance, the way Thiago manages to survive both his addiction and his closeness to the most murderous people in the slum. When Thiago leaves the beach in this early scene is when "The Runts" first appear, delaying Rocket's initiation into sex just when it might have begun.One of the virtuoso devices is to slide visually through time while Rocket narrates and this is notably illustrated by "The Story of the Apartment" sequence where we instantly see the locale become more rundown and empty as it devolves from somebody's home into an increasingly active drug dealing headquarters and ultimately Zee's center of evil power. It's the Story of Lil' Zee that goes back to the Miami Motel Robbery to show the first shocking evidence of his love of killing even as a child. "Cidade de Deus" isn't just full of young men but of children with guns. The final gang that takes over is Las Cocotas, The Runts, a band of lawless sub-teen and early-teen boys. Lil' Zee maintains rigid order, but The Runts mess up security because they rob at will. To discipline The Runts, in one of the most pathetic and gruesome scenes, Zee forces one of them to choose whether he wants to be shot in the hand or foot, and one of Zee's own youngest recruits must kill one of The Runts then and there.With the increasing focus on Lil' Zee's story the camera movement speeds up and rapid handheld pans become the rule in every scene of violence. The passage of time and the progression toward greater violence is cunningly indicated in the gradual changes in visual style that the movie goes through before our eyes. There are speeded up sequences shot from far overhead to show Zee's evolution from random killer to ruling druglord, as if we are looking at a map, which in fact here we are, a map of the city to show an expanding sphere of control.And (again the logic is crystal clear, not to say relentless) since Zee's power comes through dealing drugs, the next sub-section is a small treatise on the nature of "Drug Dealing," again illustrated with a rapid succession of narrated scenes and shots.Rocket's personal story becomes interwoven with Zee's again (as it was when they were young) after a revenge feud involving the handsome "Knockout Ned" becomes such a war that it gets the favela violence into the papers and Rocket, who works as a delivery boy and befriends a photographer, does portraits of Zee and his gang that wind up on page one. True to the neatness of the whole movie's construction is the finale, which returns to the opening chase of the escaped chicken and spins out from there to a last shootout, bribes, and a takeover of power from Zee by The Runts, all of which Rocket gets on film, securing his hiring by the newspaper as a photographer."Cidade de Deus" comes out of a great tradition of Brazilian movies about favelas and street boys whose most notable example is Hector Babenco's 1981 "Pixote," but it is more a virtuoso piece of filmmaking than anything heretofore. It's not only a triumph of editing (and storytelling) but of casting: the youthful actors drawn from the actual milieu of the film are essential to its extraordinary energy and life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God (Cidade de Deus)" may be the most violent movie I've ever seen.And just when I thought I was inured to the shooting and the murders, such that I couldn't even keep track of them anymore or who was getting killed by whom for what reason or carelessness, it topped itself and got more violent and made me start caring again.It's not just the socially conscious Brazilian true story line of abject poverty creating an army of desperate children with guns that makes this so captivating and meaningful beyond the endless bloodshed.Directors Kátia Lund and Fernando Meirelles have a relentless, in-your-face camera style that circles around somewhat similarly to "Amos Perros." The story, based on a novel based on true facts, if I could figure out the non-translated credits correctly, whips around in time to show us how each mini-gangster in the huge, differentiated ensemble of extraordinary amateur actors got to be the way he is. The voice-over narrator, and what happens to him as a budding photo-journalist, is a bit precious and is virtually the only bordering on cliche element, but he is a convenient window into a world of children who literally cannot separate fantasy from reality, (who have no access to violent TV, movies, or video games as a scapegoat) and have no impulse control whatsoever. The pulsating samba, funk, and Brazilian R &amp; B music helps push the pace even faster; the action mostly takes place in the '60's and '70's so there's no hip hop though it's like illustrations of gangsta rap's most extreme tendencies. Props to the distributor for black outlining the white subtitles, as much of the visuals are a bleached-out landscape of hopelessness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit up front that "City of God" is technically stylish and innovative filmmaking. But as storytelling, it leaves a great deal to be desired. And talk about violent! After two hours, I felt as if I had watched a year of American television. I lost track of the shots fired and the bodies piling up. I suppose "City of God" is meant to be a shocking commentary on the state of Brazilian society, but I very quickly stopped caring about any of the characters or what happened to them. If the film had been less scattered and more focused, and if it had been less cynical and more hopeful, I might have sat up and paid attention. As it is, I spent much of the film either wishing it was over, or sleeping through it. (Mind you, I'm probably the only person who ever slept through the D-Day sequence of "Saving Private Ryan". But that's another story.)I came out of the cinema thinking of various alternative titles for the film. Here's a few to give you an idea of my state of mind:Gods and Mobsters Brazil .66 Nobody Gets Out Alive (apologies to Jim Morrison) Boys from Brazil in the 'HoodYou get my drift ...

		<shortDescription>a shallow story, all be it a well told one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the Brazilian version of `Boyz N the Hood' ? but City of God is two notches better, yet with a few shortcomings.The initial scene of a chicken running away is masterful. If one has had the experience of running after chickens, then one must admire how the cameraman managed to keep up the pursuit until the poor thing disappeared under a police van. Surely, the Humane Animal Society was present ensuring the humane treatment of the bird ? although the miraculous escape from underneath the wheel could not have been planned.Now is the film depicting reality and is it providing some incisive criticism? Not quite. The favelas surrounding Rio and always perilously close to sliding off the sides of the hills after a rainstorm contain masses of people. Increasingly, it is the favelas or the outlying quasi-cities/slums -- built to remove the pressure off Rio from the migration from the Northeast -- that cast ominous shadows over the rest of the city. They are cities because their populations are huge; they are part of the bigger city, yet a city apart. The same repeats itself in the rest of Brazil. The crime rate is legendary, and it paints a rather bleak future for the country unless something is done on the double.City of God is about the internal dynamics of a quasi-city/slum. The city is portrayed as devouring itself ? suggesting the bitterly ironic name of the city. Gang vs. gang with the occasional corrupt opportunistic intervention by the police. Crucially the spillover effects of this criminal culture don't envelop the posh areas of Rio. Any well-to-do Brazilian watching this film won't sweat too much ? the violence is happening elsewhere. Here is where the film is a bit weak ? it is hardly a political statement or an indictment of the Brazilian model. It is just internecine warfare, not a crime wave descending on the middle classes by the beach, and the film doesn't make a political statement by suggesting that the inequality has anything to do with the problems depicted in the film. Unfortunately City of God is a shallow story, all be it a well told one. One more thing is evident in this film and it is a problem affecting all of cinema. All films must fall within the commercially imposed time limits, i.e., the absurd two-hour mark. Unfortunately, it is impossible to weave a rich story in such a limited time slot. Several characters are developed early on, although one can hardly empathize with them or understand them. The first five characters are introduced, but soon afterwards, several are bumped off. Then right smack in the middle of the film another important character is introduced ? errr? isn't this a bit late? Whoa! Mr. Meirelles man, you only have two hours to tell a story! This would have been acceptable if the film were a wee bit longer, but suddenly it is difficult to discern who is who and what makes them tic. The way this film handles this is by having `chapter headings'. The story is compressed and explained by these subtitles. It may be borderline-effective, but what this film needed was another half hour developing the `smell' of the place. This was wonderfully achieved and portrayed in the initial football (aka soccer) scene in a barren field. A few more scenes of the open sewers or the fermenting garbage and Meirelles would have had a masterpiece (although another hour to make a political statement would also have been necessary!).My score = 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ambitious and impressive must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is a movie that tells a fictional story inspired by the non-fictional book by journalist Paulo Lins, portrayed as the central character, "Buscapé" Rocket, and former resident between the 60's and the 70's of the ghetto that shares its name. It develops in a flashback with alternate points of view that disassembles and exposes the parts of the cycle of violence which hasn't yet passed, at least not until the year 2015 when I write this critic. Foreign viewers can compare it to a documentary. For the Brazilian, it offers a production comparable to a great American action movie with good plot, but in a universe with which we can identify. The most shocking scenes can haunt some people for some time, but do not overlap in the movie, being well dosed with funny and uplifting moments. The pace is frenetic. The camera movement is agile and spontaneous, though it seems precisely planned. The soundtrack is a compilation of popular music that must be subtitled in foreign versions to fully justify its part in the movie.It's undoubtedly one of the best movies of this generation in Latin America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An iconic narrative which entertains while providing a societal statement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When examining the cinema of Brazil, the first thing that comes to most viewers' minds is the criticism of the country's political and societal structure. City of God is greatly reminiscent of these ideas from both a stylistic and aesthetic standpoint. The portrayal of violent slums near Rio strongly depicts an atmosphere of an imperfect society which not only appeals in an artistic way, but also gives the audience a sense of sympathy towards the main characters of the film. Due to director Fernando Meirelles's exposure to the urban culture of Brazil, it can be inferred that this film was largely reflective of similar experiences of his own. Unlike most films of this genre, Meirelles was able to present the audience with a gang-oriented society which focused more on the daily struggles of surviving rather than showcasing a false sense of glamor within it. One of the most unique aspects of this film is the way the narrative presents everything in a non-sequential order, leaving the audience in constant anticipation. City of God's creative storyline and proficient film elements are what make this film the perfect balance between art and entertainment. LightingThe most aesthetic display that Meirelles was able to utilize was the type of lighting used throughout the entire film. It can be seen that the daytime scenes in the slums were excessively lit in situations where crime was committed. An example of this was seen when the oil truck was attacked by the teenage gang. The high amount of sunlight in the scene made it seem as though these types of events represented nothing more than an ordinary day for the citizens of the city. In contrast to the daytime scenes, the nighttime sequences portrayed very dim lighting which provided the audience with a sense fear. The presence of darkness in "Knockout" Ned's house expressed a sense of unpredictability which made it easy for viewers to foreshadow how his character would later evolve in the film. Screenplay and Film ElementsThroughout City of God, the display of a slum-like environment was greatly ignited by the use of specific film elements. Perhaps the most underrated factor behind the realism of this film was the presence of silence in emotional situations. An example of this was shown in the scene where one of the new recruits in Lil Ze's gang was ordered to shoot two children. The combination of the actors' expressions along with a sequence of silence was able to make the audience sympathize towards the events occurring in the scene. One of the most unique aspects of this film was the way voyeuristic angles were used to show intense scenes of violence. The use of the steady-cam in the final gunfight gave the viewers a feeling of uneasiness which was reminiscent of the characters emotions. Another strong use of angles was used in the scenes where Lil Ze would be shown as an unattractive brute. This was especially noticeable in the nightclub scene when he asked a girl to dance. The high-angled use of the camera perfected in showing his insecurity with himself. Story and EditingPerhaps the strongest attribute behind this film was its complex plot. The most appealing factor applied in the narrative of this film was the use of the flashback. Fernando Meirelles creatively began the film with the highest action-packed scene and quickly implemented the flashback to show the audience what the reason was behind the occurrence of the intense violence. Another proficient use of the flashback was shown in the scene where it was revealed that Lil Dice was the one who shot up the people in the hotel. The unexplained shootings provided a feeling of anticipation which was later fulfilled by an astonishing revelation. The sense of clarity in the script was reinforced by the frequent captions which enhanced the transitioning and made it easier for the audience to understand that the setting has changed. With a creative style of narration, City of God was able to captivate audiences with an entertaining and realistic portrayal of the dangerous environment surrounding the country of Brazil. Based on the film's exquisite narrative along with its effective film elements, City of God proves to be an artistic and entertaining experience for audiences everywhere. Genre of the filmThe genre of gangster films is nothing new to world cinema. The approach that City of God takes is far different from the traditional crime drama. This film is influenced by a message geared towards society which was movingly efficient in giving the audience a feeling of sympathy and awareness towards the lack of law enforcement in countries such as Brazil. Instead of expressing the glamor behind the life of the underworld, Meirelles utilized a down-to-earth method in providing entertainment. Unlike the traditional popcorn film, this film preached a message through the use of emotional appeal was heightened by its strong use of film elements that expressed the characters' state of mind effectively.Final Verdict As an overall film, City of God explores the idea of an apocalyptic society which consists of horrible crimes. The portrayal of a lack of morality was realistically presented by the actors' performances along with specific film elements such as voyeuristic angles that excelled in providing a universally emotive appeal. The events occurring in the film were touching to the heart of the audience. Meirelles's deviation from the typical crime drama proved to be an effective approach in the script of this film. Due to a strong collaboration between the film's storyline and film techniques, along with the film's ability to appeal to a universal audience I give City of God 10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>original Gangster film, but gets boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins in the 60's and when you're watching this part, you have high hopes for the rest of the film, as it shows a lot of promise, however don't get your hopes up. Little Ze's killing spree's in the 70's and 80's become over the top, and the amount of deaths are ridiculous. However the cliffhanger ending where the kids talk about their own killing spree , leaves a nice, but horrific cliff hanger ending. It is very different to most gangster films as it contains some type of background story as it's based on a true story. The story of Rocket is also very endearing, as throughout the film you find yourself willing him to do well in his photography, so this for me makes up for the over the top violence ,so brings the film up from a 5, to a 6 out of10.One to watch if you're into international cinema or/and violent films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a story about some people living in a Rio de Janeiro favela called A Cidade de Deus. It's an actual place built about 50 years ago that's one of the most well known favelas in Brasil.It's more than a story about gangsters. It explores the feelings and motivations behind the characters from the guy who seemed to be born to kill to a guy who worked hard at a job, had a girlfriend and nice family but joined a gang for revenge after becoming a victim of crime. It explores the different people living in the neighborhood from the kids to the gang members to the parents working hard at menial jobs trying to make ends meet. It's an interesting introduction to the culture.The movie is in Brazilian Portuguese but is available with English subtitles which is why I wanted to see it as I am trying to learn the language.An interesting fact is that a resident of this favela just won the world judo championship in her weight class. A decade ago while living in a Cidade de Deus, Rafaela Silva and her sister Raquel were discovered by some guys interested in developing the sport in Brasil. Over ten years later she becomes the first Brazilian woman world judo champion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Godfather' of Brazil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of god shows a harsh but true view of the slums of Rio and the reason for this being true is because this film is in fact based on a real life story. It is quite shocking as most would see this as unrealistic drama just to be powerful but every disturbing part happened for real. That is what mostly makes this film unforgettable but it has also a stunning story on what could be considered a gangster/ drama film with twists and turns as it goes on and delivers with a lot of depth. This film is subtitled so you must keep up with dialogue fast but that also was well written and despite the actors being relatively unknown, they all performed really well. A true masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of the New Millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is one of the most fascinating movies of the new millennium, a masterpiece in all aspects of film-making: cinematography, editing, writing and directing, assisted by solid performances by amateur child actors from Rio de Janeiro's slums.This movie, based on a novel by Paulo Lins, is about the history of the Brazilian slum City of God, where people born there have little alternative to crime and violence. Through inventive storytelling, the director Fernando Meirelles and screenwriter Bráulio Mantovani show the slum from its earliest days when it was just a suburb distant from the tourist attractions to the present days, when it's no longer invisible and has become an embarrassment for authorities.To show the development of the slum, the filmmakers follow the lives of two distinct young men: Rocket, a nice kid who wants out and dreams of becoming a photographer; and the ruthless crime lord, Li'l Zé, who takes over the slums and engages in open warfare in the streets with other gangs. Rocket and Zé's history is intimately connected from their early days as kids, when Zé, eager for killing, kills Rocket's brother, a member of a famous gang. The new takes over the old, that's the law of City of God.This movie is cruel and uncompromising. Armed children kill themselves in street wars, police corruption is everywhere, and, as Rocket discovers, being honest may not pay off. Zé's rise to power is meteoric as he uses the only language understandable: violence. He's one of the most charismatic villains of recent years; mean as snakes, without a single redeeming feature, enjoying evil for its sake, either you'll love him or hate him.The movie also benefits from other great characters: there's Benny, Zé's only friend, who behaves a bit like what remains of his consciousness and possibly the only person who can calm down Zé. Benny is the cool criminal, he doesn't want to get rich for its sake, he doesn't want to kill people. He just wants money to have fun and party with other people.Then there's the street vigilant Knockout Ned, a good man who just becomes fed up with the crime and decides to make matters into his rifle-holding hands. A trained soldier, he organizes an army against Zé in a war without truces to get control of the streets. It's amazing how a movie shot in the streets of Rio de Janeiro can acquire an epic feel that many epics lack nowadays.In the middle is Rocket, trying to live a normal life, doing what teenagers do: falling in love, trying to get a job, hanging out with friends. For a grim movie, it's amazing how the filmmakers also capture the finer aspects of adolescence, with a maturity that American movies sadly lack.All in all, City of God is one of the best movies of recent years that can't be ignored. I also admire it for having introduced me to a lot of fine Brazilian cinema being made nowadays. City of God is just the beginning, really. Movies like Tropa de Elite and The Man Who Copied await those who give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Fernando Meirelles gets credit for bringing this amazing story to life, after reading the novel written by Paulo Lins.This movie is amazing for several reasons. Many of which have nothing to do with directing. First, the music supervision is amazing. The score features some of the best classics, from Brazilian music. If you aren't a fan of this music, then this movie may make you one.The cinematography is breathtaking. César Charlone is rarely mentioned when this film is discussed, but he should and often. I've never seen a movie that has been shot like this.Bráulio Mantovani did the amazing job of creating a screenplay from the book. The book includes many characters which are not mentioned in the movie. I'd advise anyone who is interested in the book, to read it after they see the movie.The movie exposes you to both the beauty and the brutality that exist in the cities of Brazil.This movie is an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God" is a really awesome film. I enjoyed it. I have not, however, watched it since viewing it for the first time about 6 months ago. I haven't felt the need.I suppose it's the kind of movie you only need to see once. The acting is outstanding and the story is amazing too. The child growing up in the slums in a third world country who somehow manages to escape a life of crime and goes on to achieve greatness through photography. It really is a moving film, you can't argue that. Here is where I get annoyed...This film is NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING like "Goodfellas" or "Scarface." Why it is always compared to films like that, I cannot even begin to understand. A large part of the plot surrounds gangs in Brazil, but it is also very political and extremely human. It is not about organized crime. It is, however, pretty violent though.In short, I dig this movie but if I hear one more person compare it to "Goodfellas" I think I'll feed them a few copies of each DVD for good measure.8 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the abundance of handguns says it all.they are very deadly, and the scene where the young hood kills all the people at the hotel and smiles in a flashback is typical of the motivations of far too many hoodlums. they kill not in the course of committing a crime out of necessity to carry out the deed, like shooting an armed security guard, no, they kill for fun and because no one can stop them in the moment.I have fired handguns but not recently, and only at a target range, so I understand the dangers of the bullets flying out at a thousand feet per second. once it leaves the barrel anyone in front is doomed. and the finger pressure to make that happen can be done by a child.city of god should be a warning to us all on the costs of crime and violence. building a city, educating the young and creating conditions that give them job opportunities takes a long time and a lot of work; this is why so many choose the 'easy' way of crime.it is also telling that at one point you start to lose track of who is in what gang and what they have done, and then all the even younger hoodlums get guns and start shooting up the place. and then subtly the action moves into the big city, they are no longer in the shanty town.a depressing film but one that should be seen at least once.I definitely wouldn't rank it so high up in the top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an American living in Brazil for 5yrs now. I watched the movie on TV the other night and was very impressed with it. The quality was very good and gives you the feeling of actually being there and viewing it first hand. The movie depicts life as it was and still is. The people here are generally extremely poor and desperate. The corruption within this country can be found in ever level of Government and under the table payoffs are a way of life for many. Life is cheap and large numbers of people across the country die a violent death every day. Drugs are prevalent and a big money maker for the drug lords. Every kind of drug can be found being sold on the streets. The poorest of the drug users use a cheap drug by-product which make them easy to identify as their front teeth are missing or black and rotting away. Others walk around sniffing glue. Certain areas of Rio de Janeiro are controlled by the drug lords and their followers just like it's depicted in the movie. They have a small army of very young children working as runners taking orders and delivering the drugs to the waiting customer. In those areas it's not uncommon to see even the children walking openly brandishing a firearm. Even the military and police hesitate to enter these areas as it closely resembles a war zone. What you will see in the movie, believe it, because it is NOT an exaggerated fictional movie. These things are happening in cities all across Brazil every day. On the flip side the majority of people here are very kind generous loving families. They are very religious are honest hard working people. The students work extremely hard to get good grades so they will be able to win a full scholarship to attend the best universities in the nation. Just because someone lives and grows up in a favela (slum) it doesn't mean they condone the lawlessness. Some do become great leaders in every walk of life. I can honestly say I know some of them and am very proud to be able to call them my friends. Watch the movie and I can guarantee you'll be stunned and left thinking about it for day with a sad heart that this exists in our world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best foreign film i've ever seen including "Y tu mama tambien" &amp; "Crouching tiger hidden dragon". Though set in the slums of Brazil, the ideal of lost youth and dead-end circumstances are experiences world round. But this film also revels in it's depiction of Brazil as a universe. A place most of us see as serenely beautiful, but underneath it's post card image lies all these dangers.You follow a young man as he tries to find his way through all the tragedies surrounding him. A maniacal young drug dealer, a righteous hero who somehow becomes the own evil he tries to fight. It's also amazing because this is all based on actual events. You really can't help but feel each gun shot as if the bullets were piercing your own flesh. There are some brief periods in the film where i was genuinely uncomfortable, but comes with the territory i guess.Wonderful film, greatly recommended.</fullReview>

It's fast-moving enough to never dwell for too long on the sadder moments.Great acting by a largely unknown and amateur cast helps add to the brilliance of this work.

		<fullReview>"City of God" is about making your own way really! No matter in which conditions you're living in the life you lead is not always conglomeration of what you've lived always but it's something you pick and choose in a life you lead. The more you have power to direct yourself, to choose for yourself, the more decisive and decided you are the more successful you will be. Of course the society always shapes people and it's not the linchpin for your destiny. The movie is such a story. While Rocket dreams of being a photographer and makes his way into that dream Lil Ze is a hoodlum who satisfies his thirst for murder, who plunders and who desire more and more power. City of God is totally realistic! I am impressed by the fact that most of the actors in the film had never acted before and were, in fact, residents of favelas(slums)such as Vidigal and the "City of God" itself. The setting and the time fiction seems totally realistic too.If you wanna a realist piece of story do not forgo watching until the end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic and indelible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This Brazilian Portuguese language film set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called "City of God," is a mesmerizing coming of age gangsta drama second to none you'll ever see. At the same time it is a tale of redemption and the triumph of relative good over relative evil.Representing evil is the psychopathic L'il Dice/L'il Zé (Douglas Silva/Leandro Firmino da Hora), who kills people just for the joy it gives him. Representing the good is the story's narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who will grow out of the slum to become a newspaper photographer. And representing something in between is the charismatic Benny (Phellipe Haagensen). The acting is excellent, including that by the "runts," actual kids from the City of God; but what carries the film is sharp direction by Fernando Meirelles from an outstanding script by Braulio Mantovani from a novel by Paulos Lins.I think Hollywood directors ought to note well that it is the authentic realism of the film as seen from within the City of God by one of its own that makes this such a compelling experience for the audience. None of this can be faked. True, the story is a bit romanticized as a (very talented) kid might tell it to his friends, but that is all the better because the world view of those kids is part of what makes this film so effective. Additionally, all the little side stories: the woman at the newspaper who takes Rocket home with her for, shall we say, personal reasons; the story of the girl Rocket loves; the desire of the "runts' to be men, etc., add layers of genuineness that also can not be faked or dreamed up by any filmland script writer. These things have to be lived.Last time I looked Cidade de Deus was rated #17 at IMDb, ahead of hundreds of great films. There's not much I can add to that. Is the film over-rated? I think so, and I think it will fall in the standings as time goes by. Good recent films tend to get a lot of attention, and then reach their level after some years have passed and they can be evaluated more objectively. Regardless, this is a watermark film for the Brazilian cinema and especially for director Fernando Meirelles who because of it rocketed from obscurity to world-wide fame almost overnight.</fullReview>

The changes in time makes you follow the movie more carefully, you don't want to miss the action. The violence in the movie, yes, it is a very violent one, is not the same kind like in the Hollywood-films, or in some raw European modern movies. It doesn't play with the amount of blood: When they shoot someone, you get the idea without slowmotion close-ups! It's better this way. I like the simplicity of the Brazilian actors. No over-acting is needed, this is a movie of the life in favelas as it was, or even is today, as I have heard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit of the old ultra violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it's been a while since anything with the violent intensity of "city of god" has come out in the united states. this film definitely marks a good start for the director Fernando Meirelles and his use of film technique that is very similar to David Fincher, David o Russell, and Guy Ritchie. lots of frantic energy and cinged colors. one of the movie's main antagonists Lil Ze runs around like a miniature rabid Samuel l Jackson circa pulp fiction. the story centers on the criminal lives of children and young adults in Rio de Janeiro. i think that the movie while never making a political point of it lends a good amount support about just what type of anarchy results from the failed international war on drugs, including but not limited to: the creation of a black market, that gets increasingly violent as it is cracked down on, corrupt police tactics, an excess of wealth and desire for firearms for criminal purposes, international civil unrest, and a broad tool that the have-not in society may use to fore-go education in favor of black market profits. all that nonsense aside, this film is powerful in several ways.the young actors really really manage a tremendous job of translating raw emotion directly to the screen. i'm not sure to many young American actors could have pulled off such a feet of acting. is it even acting? the wonderful pacing and extensive use of flashback to move the movie through a great narrative direction. the setting itself, much like the french setting in ronin, adds a lot of detail and quirkiness to the way the film looks and the overall feel. all these things come together quite wonderfully for one of the best movies i've seen in a while. the only thing i missed is the fate of the lovely angelica is never revealed or mentioned, she simply disappears from the narrator's life and from the film. with the exception of that i i think the film was nearly flawless. this in comparison with the recent viewing of the french movie "those who love me can take the train",and it looks like France's future as a leader in good cinema is uncertain at best and unimaginable at worst.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrenching film is both harrowing and exhilarating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few films that can capture what life is really like in virtually unknown areas and even though I have never been to the slums of Rio de Janeiro audiences will undoubtedly get a sense of the horror that takes place there. Story is about the drug wars that take place in the isolated slums in Rio and the central character is a young man named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) who acts as our narrator and tells us early on that he always wanted to be a hood. In flashbacks we see in the 1960's that the brother of Rocket who was in a well known gang ended up getting killed which convinces him to try and stay clear of the hoods.*****SPOILER ALERT***** In the 1970's as Rocket has gotten older he has a dream of being a photographer for a newspaper but the only thing that he can do is help deliver papers. In the slums the city has been divided in two by the drug gangs where on one side you have Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele) and on the other is Li'l Ze (Leandro Firmino) and a tremendous amount of bloodshed occurs when Li'l Ze wants to kill Carrot and have total control of the city. Rocket takes some photo's that the newspaper ends up publishing and he ends up being the principle photographer when the two sides collide to try and eliminate each other.This film is directed by Fernando Meirelles who with this effort has made such an impact that only Orson Welles compares with it. This is one of the more violent films that a viewer can watch and at times it is repellent but what really makes this work is the combination of the story and it's exciting visual style. Meirelles can be described as a combination of Quentin Tarantino and Jean-Pierre Jeunet as he shows us the senseless violence but also takes his time giving the back story on each character. One of the more incredible things about the film is the casting of non-professional actors in pivotal roles with some of them actually being real gang members! This film is considered so important that the President of Brazil applauded it and went on to try and start some reform to clean up the crime in the slums. With it's violent and unflinching look at a part of the world that most of us could never conceive of Meirelles still manages to enthrall us in this extremely well made film and shows everyone that he's a director of rare talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Made with a very low budget. A movie that made Tom Hanks say he was in awe of. Outstanding. Touching. A movie also about hope. But I'd like first to address the two bad comments out of the over 300 in the board. One gentleman complains about the subtitles. Well, it really is frustrating to see in this day and age this kind of comment. It is so revolting to hear this sort of statement. Everybody else in the world when they watch American movies watch them with subtitles. But there is an anti intellectual bent in America (quite ethnocentric) in which movies made in other languages have to be dubbed to obtain any kind of box office success. To this gentleman I'd like to say that the Iliad, The Odyssey, the Bible, Crime and Punishment, 7th Seal, and many other works of art were not done by Americans. Yet we all enjoy them. So I'd encourage him to expand his mind and enroll in a Spanish 101 class in the local community college. Specially considering that the idea behind the global market of ideas is if we want to be heard we must hear others. This sort of dumb a** bs I read on these boards just p** me off. If you are an idiot without any kind of appreciation of what's good and beautiful stick to War Bus and Beach Babes from Beyond. If you don't like a movie because it is in another language don't watch any foreign films! (stay ignorant about the world) rather than watching a movie and giving it a bad review because it was not in English. There is another cat calls himself webmaster 49. The guy gives every movie he reviews a bad rating (including The Pianist, Chinatown, Taxi Driver). But he gives Mr. Goodbar an outstanding review calls it one of the best movies of the 70s. Dead man walking he also praises. So don't be tricked by these two. Their sense of aesthetics cannot be defended with any sort of rational argument. Don't be fooled by them. This is an outstanding movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Powerful. Exciting. A fantastic storyline. Impressive dialogue.All quotes that have no relevance to the film whatsoever. This film was nothing more than a director trying to sponge off real life events, to play on peoples emotional side with regard to children. "Oh no a child holding a gun!". Honestly who cares; if this film can't be bothered to create unique or remotely interesting dialogue, create more of a story than people who chase chickens and deal drugs, and won't do more to create meaning except using handheld shots to make the film seem "realistic", then he doesn't deserve to call himself a director.To put this in perspective, who can't say to themselves "I know! If I make a film about kids who deal drugs and use guns, then it's bound to be considered powerful". That is a complete cop-out. To follow on from that, anyone could actually shoot the film the same way this director has done; just random handheld shots with the defence of saying it makes it seem realistic - with that theory, any person is actually more than capable of shooting a film, providing they are aware of the single rule of not going beyond the 'magic line' in a two shot. Anyone, and i mean ANYONE could have shot this film and wrote a screenplay for it - had there at least been a script of some interest, then I could believe somebody had taken time to come up with this idea, but it appears even that was overlooked.To its credit, the film does have good acting (though im not overly sure that is certain as I can't speak any dialect of Spanish), and has accomplished a very clear form of characterisation (not really unique characters, but you can tell effort has been put in to identify them as individuals).But unfortunately, I gotta say I find it somewhat of a disgrace that people could see this as #34 on the top 250 Greatest movies. A film should have the ability to entertain; suspension of disbelief, classic quotes, lovable characters, intriguing/interesting/fun storylines, and a display of uniqueness all can accomplish this. City of Gods does not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most powerful dramas of the decade is 'City of God.' Fernando Meirelles proves that he can run with the most acclaimed directors in modern cinema with this film. His disciplined style is vigorously enchanting as much as it is appealing. For his furious and violent tale, 'City of God,' he portrays, with shocking realism, the slums of Rio de Janeiro from the late 60's to the mid 80's, where crime was the way out and those not involved were the suckers. But among these criminals and suckers is a minority of those dedicated the goodness that is often overlooked in cities as torn as Rio, and Meirelles exemplifies that notion through a young photographer and the story he comes to tell.The film follows a boy named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), whose dream is to become an accomplished photographer. Growing up, Rocket was raised in a lower-class quarter of Rio's Ciudad de Deus (City of God), in which most of his peers had aspirations of becoming the City of God's next big thing ? whether the path they led was bright or familiar. Among them was Lil' Dice, a young boy who ran with a gang of hoodlums whose main intention was stealing, though had killed before.As years progressed, both Rocket and Lil' Dice meandered down very different corridors; Rocket found fulfillment in honesty and kindness, whereas Lil' Dice eventually found himself the city's most infamous drug-runner, Ze Pequeno, or Lil' Ze. Soon before long, the City of God is ravaged by unseen violence, led by Lil' Ze, and Rocket is capturing the horrific footage via his hand-held camera. While Rocket's intentions focus on keeping down an honest, clean path, he finds that he can make amends with both Lil' Ze and the local police, by submitting photos of Ze and his entourage to the tabloids. Win-win for both, eh? Not quite. Even those who find success, struggle in the City of God, and by film's end that fact is recognized by all ? and it's not soon forgotten either.The screenplay, adapted by Braulio Mantovani from Paulo Lins' novel of the same name, allows viewers to relate and reside with its characters and surrender their absolute emotion to a film that exhausts each and every emotion imaginable. Retrospectively, Meirelles' demand for the viewer's attention, through unwavering brutality and almost dizzying camera-work, makes for intense movie-viewing and enthralling entertainment. Additionally, the film carries a surrealistic beauty ? and is shot with an overexposed lens that brightens the photography and implies perfectly the authenticity of the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro ? that elevates the heart when the movie reaches burrowing depths. All in all, 'City of God' is flawless; and with an array of resonating performances and flawless direction, it is sure to be one of the greatest films one will ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just one of those films with furious and intense energy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God falls under the pile of unflinching movies, movies that aren't afraid to be brutally realistic. If you are going to tell a story about gang wars, corrupt police, and hardship, you can't make it PG-13 and turn your camera every time someone gets shot. That just feels so fake. It is fake! This film tells it like it is. It is true to the story and to life. That is one reason I think City of God is great - its upsetting and powerful because it is furiously real.The other reason is simply because the story telling is excellent. Very excellent. Fernando Meirelles does an excellent job weaving the plot between the many different characters, and time periods. Not to mention the great acting, cinematography, and pretty much every other technical aspect.City of God is a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this on a countdown show, then we watched most of it in Film Studies as part of some coursework, and ultimately I found it listed in the book 100 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was glad to watch the whole thing, from Oscar nominated director Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardener). Basically the story takes place in a slum of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, and we see the lives of two boys as they grow up in two decades and choose two different paths in life. Zé Pequeno - 'Li'l Zé', formally knows as Dadinho - 'Li'l Dice' (Douglas Silva) as a child, grew up surrounded by and embracing crime and violence. His best friend Bené Criança - 'Benny' (Phellipe Haagensen) (Michel De Souza Gomes as a child) growing up on the good and more sane side of the law, and not trying to get involved with the activities of The Tender Trio or any other gang culture. The story of the two decades, and from his own perspective as well, is seen through the eyes and narrated by Buscapé - 'Rocket' (Alexandre Rodrigues) (Luis Otávio as a child), a young man who has the ambition to become a professional photographer, e.g. for a newspaper. The 1970's and 1980's see the crime rate and gang culture rule most of the slum city, but Rocket tries to stay away from it, only being drawn into the madness by his photography, which prove very lucrative. Also starring Matheus Nachtergaele as Sandro Cenoura - 'Carrot', Jonathan Haagensen as Cabeleira - 'Shaggy', Seu Jorge as Mané Galinha - 'Knockout Ned', Jefechander Suplino as Alicate - 'Clipper', Emerson Gomes as Barbantinho - 'Stringy' and Renato De Souza as Marreco - 'Goose'. The non-professional actors and the characters they play are all intriguing in their own ways, the story I did find difficult to follow in small moments, but overall it is like another GoodFellas style concept, where one of the characters anyway wanted to be a gangster since they were young, and it certainly has eye catching visuals of violence and torture, and it has a good dark tone style, it is a crime thriller to be seen. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. It was number 3 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is as real as it gets...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess that I had no idea whatsoever about the movie before I saw it. Thanks to Adlabs Olive Entertainment, who have brought quality international cinema in my city, Pune.By the title, and posters I could figure out that it is somebody's life story and struggles. But haven't we seen so many of them already? So, what makes this movie different from the rest. The answer, I believe lies in the charecterisation. Each and every character in the film seems to be carved with intricate care, and all of them have a story to tell. The story begins with our protagonist, who is stuck in a cross-fire between police and hoodlums, and has no intention of running away because he knows well that in the City of God, if you run, you get shot. Then begin a series of flashbacks, which tell the story of Rocket and his humble life and humble ambitions. Of how, when everyone in his neighbourhood he knew dreamed of becoming a gangster, he was smitten by the shutterbug. Even as he grows, his school and his mates become his sanctuary and he does not allow himself to be drowned in the growing bloodshed and drugs that is prevalent in the City of God. His desires were simple but mellow.Like owning a camera one day, or losing his virginity to Angelica. Li'l Dice and Benny are two best friends who land up becoming the toughest hoodlums in the city. Li'l Dice is ruthless, has ideas, over-ambitious, and ugly. Benny on the other hand is the cool-head. He is the only one who can influence Li'l Dice. In fact Benny comes to be called as the coolest hoodlum in the City of God. Together, they were in a way indestructible. But when Benny decides to leave, Li'l Dice loses his head. In his rage, he picks on Knockout-Ned, an ex-armyman. He rapes his girlfriend, and kills his uncle and cousin. Knockout-Ned, then seeks revenge and there are some foes of Li'l Dice who will help him out. Then begins the bloodiest gang-war, in which the city is divided, and new recruits join in on either side, for the most petty of all reasons. Its great to see Karma at work here, when Knockout-Ned gets shot by his own recruits, because Knockout-Ned had shot his father in a bank robbery. As for Li'l Dice, he has lost everything. His gang, his friend Benny, and all his wealth to the police. He seeks to begin again, but is cut short by a gang of wannabe hoodlum kids, who follow Li'l Dice's own idea of eliminating all competition and taking over existing businesses. Everyone's dead, but for our protagonist, who has all the pictures, and a job as an intern at the newspaper.This movie is a must watch. As far as gangster movies go, this should way on top. Even above Godfather, because truth is far more stranger than fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but tough to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are exactly two characters in this movie -- Rocket and Knockout Ned -- who are in any way sympathetic. Everyone else is a villain or victim, usually both. The film does not contain a single frame that relieves the brutality, violence, poverty and degradation which are its themes. See it but understand what you'll be seeing: drug trafficking and casual murder (mostly done for "business" reasons but also for the sheer pleasure of killing) by young people and even by children in a terrible, terror-ridden Rio de Janeiro slum. In its way it is harder to watch even than Hotel Rwanda because of its apparent "artlessness." You have more of a feeling in City of God that you are actually there, witnessing unbelievably awful events without the small distance that Hotel Rwanda afforded because it was scripted and acted and "directed," because it was art. This movie, on the other hand, feels like you are watching it happen in front of your eyes without a scriptwriter's story telling or a director's mediation. Those illusions are helped along by the fact that there's not a single actor that I recognized from any other movie. The actors ARE the drug dealers, the killers and the victims -- not, as in "Traffic," well-known actors "playing" at being drug dealers, killers and victims. "Traffic" was very well done. This movie is harrowing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a delight to be watching. When i say delight i don't mean i like seeing people get killed over nothing but it was so masterfully done. I have heard only good things about this movie so i was prepared for a excellent movie, and let me tell you i was not disappointed at all. The movie shows how little a human life is worth in some people eyes. The scariest part is to see the young kids, probably not more than 7-10 years old, carrying guns, thinking it is cool to kill others. The thing i remember best is when one of the young kids says: I smoke and snort. I have robbed and killed. I am a man! What kind of life do you live when you can say that sentence and believe it? Anyways, this is a very good movie and i give it the best rating i can. 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people have complained of the "Hollywood treatment" this story (inspired by real events) received, and it can't be denied that most of its stylistic flourishes resembles senseless action films. Somehow, though, the violence depicted in the movie has no ultimate sense, no other purpose than to follow the flow of daily life in the slums of Brazil, even more when it has been decided to disconnect the events from the social and economic structures of the Brazilian society. (Compare this movie with Héctor Babenco's "Pixote", and you'll see the difference.) It is obvious that some persons who are not aware of those conditions may find the images too raw or blame them on the characters' psychopath behavior. But then (I hope) neither we find reasons for the behavior of Quentin Tarantino's or John Woo's characters only on individual psychological terms. In the end, it's such a harsh reality that the cynicism of the filmmakers and all their flashy and effectist resources (like the change of music and the introduction of a strobe light in a party, just before one of the less repulsive young criminals is killed) end buried below the piles of dead bodies of Brazilian children and adolescents.</fullReview>

How, by making sure that the movies are loaded with many special effects and CG to woo the film watchers. However, Story and Screenplay that are recycled stuff such as from T2 , Raiders of Lost Ark and Jame Bond Movies.'City of God' has all the elements that most modern day Hollywood movies do not have 1) Creativity in cinematography/ film editing 2) Kinetic movie making that surprise audience with no usual re-cycled staff 3) Strong in Story Telling department. 4) Surprise and Unusual ScreenplayInfact, 'City of God' is the best movie that I have watched this year and I bet that future 'Hollywood style' movies for this coming year will not able to compare to this foreign Brazilian movie.</fullReview>

Each chapter has a title and the stories are expertly intertwined, to reveal a incredibly powerful ending.I recommend this film to everyone, BE AWARE that it is brutally realistic(Scenes of gun violence involving children).

		<fullReview>One thing is for certain, City of God didn't back down on the shock value. From the random killing of children to the more organized gang violence, City of God is more of a testament to the failures of capitalism rather than a failure of law and order. Either way, the film was a stunning depiction of a world no one really gets to see. This is a world you don't see in the tourist guides or in the movies.What was especially incredible about this film was the dirtiness and authenticity. Instead of making this film on some back lot or recreated set, this film was actually made in the slums of Rio. In fact, the slums themselves become a major character in the film, illustrating how disgusting this world truly was. Adding even more authenticity was the use of non-professional actors. While many critics have panned films that have used this paradigm for acting, the lack of false reality made for a rather well acted film.Years from now, this will be considered one of he best foreign films to hail from anywhere, and it is time to take some notice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is basically the story of a bunch of criminal trash who grow up robbing and murdering in a makeshift ghetto for the homeless (in which the government has tossed them) at the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Predictably, they grow up to become only more sociopathic and parasitical on society. Some might call them "gangsters," but really people like these are merely low class, low IQ garbage that deserve death.The one good thing about this movie is the beginning. For once, you see dangerous sociopathic scum get what they deserve from the cops. One of them gets shot down in the street running like a dog while his psychopathic girlfriend "cries." The rest of the film develops in predictable ways: the glory days and the requisite downfall. You can kind of think of this movie as the "Good Fellas" version for the kind of subhuman garbage they must deal with in Brazil. Decent piece of entertainment, if you're not too revolted by their sociopathic criminality, not to mention their ugly faces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film, but waaaaay overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched City of God a couple of years ago and was blown away on first viewing. I recently decided to watch it again the other night and was rather disappointed. Basically, COD is a massive case of style over substance - there's basically not much underneath the flashy exterior. For this film to be rated at number 18 in the top 250 is very hard to believe and I would presume that this is due to younger viewers being taken in by its easy charms (I'm only 24 myself though).On the positive side, the film looks amazing. The cinematography is beautiful, from the warm feel of the 'Tender Trio' story through to the bright colours of the later parts. The camera-work and editing are also first class and give the film a great immediacy, there are also some wonderful montages which really stick in my mind.The basic plot and milieu of the film is attractive, a potentially excellent base for a great film, but unfortunately it doesn't deliver. The most important problem with COD is a lack of any meaningful structure - the film simply doesn't 'go anywhere'. The only thematic development in the film is the perpetuation and escalation of violence to such a point that you just don't care anymore. I'm not sure how many killings there are in this film but it must getting on towards about 50, and the more this goes on the less impact it has. I understand that the film was making a statement about the 'reality' of life in a notorious favella - that violence is the norm - fine, make the point and move on, integrate the message into a meaningful piece of art. Instead the film just keeps on offering us another 'shocking' killing, and pays as little attention to these acts of violence as the thugs who commit them. Its overkill in more ways than one.The characterisation in COD is another one of its major downfalls. I just didn't care about any of them, or even have any basic interest in any of them (except maybe Lil Ze). The main character, Rocket, was a nobody in the City of God and also a nobody in the film, City of God. He hardly had any defining character traits - he was scared of guns and wanted to lose his virginity (this basically puts him on the same level as Scooby Doo who was scared of stuff and liked sandwiches - but at least Scooby is funny!). Rocket is dull, he is not funny, not cool, has no passion, little emotion - there's just nothing to care about in him, and the actor playing him fits the part perfectly. I felt that the best character in the film was Lil Ze, mainly because the actor did a pretty decent job in the role. But he is still a hugely underdeveloped character. Lil Ze is a psychotic thug who murders as casually as you or I might pick our nose, he kills about 10 people in a massacre in a hotel at about the age of 10. The deep insights that the film offers us into the creation of such a monster is that he is too ugly to get a girlfriend - is that it?! surely loads of people can't get a girlfriend? There are loads of other characters in the film with much weaker characterisations (e.g. Benny - 'the coolest hood in the COD', who isn't cool at all, just an annoying ponce; Tiago - a loser who hangs around trying to get drugs, he also has a bike; Carrot - a big dealer who doesn't like trouble). One character who did have potential was Knockout Ned, but he ultimately became just another (mostly) mindless perpetrator of violence.My intention is not to completely trash COD, just to point out its (major) flaws. It is a good film and I can understand its popularity, but no way the 18th best film ever! The film is lovely to look at, and guns, drugs, gangs and Brazil are cool - right? But the film has no emotional core. At no point do you feel anxious, sad, happy, affectionate, uplifted, empowered - you may feel shocked near the start but that soon wears off, and then you don't really feel anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really slick and impressive gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the slums of Rio de Janeiro is an area called the city of God. In this area children often do not make it to adulthood. Rocket is a young man looking to use photography to get himself out of the slums and away from crime. We follow his story from a child through the 60's and 70's in the slums where he is witness as children Lil' Dice and Bene grow up to become the heads of the gangs, using violence and murder to increase their power.I had missed this in the ONE art cinema in the city I live in and had to wait for the DVD to come out. It was very much worth the wait. I wanted to resist the urge to call this film `the Brazilian Goodfellas' simply because everyone else has said it - but it is a fitting description. Like that film, this is a sprawling story of crime and violence across several decades. And like Goodfellas it is violent, stylish and a great story that is engaging. The overall plot focuses on the rise of Lil' Ze and the violence around him, as seen through the eyes of Rocket.Opening with a stylishly shot standoff, the film jumps back over twenty years and begins to introduce a range of characters who come and go throughout the film to give a back story of violence and crime. The film jumps around quite a bit but it serves to build up a picture of the area and the characters involved. The violence is not gory but it is sudden and shocking - children killing children, bloody sudden deaths and so on; but it is not sensationalised but rather very depressing and down to earth.The direction is very slick and the overall production and feel of the film is one of style and imagination. The opening of a 360 pan around Rocket is an indication of the style than runs through the whole film. It even manages to have a mix of styles - fast cutting edits work best in moderation, which is exactly what this film does. The soundtrack is great and the film definitely owes a debt to Scorsese.The cast are very talented and very natural considering that few of them have any experience acting. Alexandre Rodrigues is great as Rocket even if he gets overshadowed by Leandro Limrino attention grabbing Ze (in the same way as we all remember Joe Pesci over Ray Liotta). The rest of the cast is almost perfect to a boy. Even the young children are convincing and powerful and there are no bum notes in the performances - it is very impressive but the sad thing is that I suspect that for many of them, this was not a stretch as this is really their life.Overall this is a tremendous film - easily the best of the year. It is slick and stylish but not at the expense of the story, which is a dizzy collection of characters and action. If you like Goodfellas then you will simply love this film. Hell, if you like cinema - you will like this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen some documentaries on how Brazilian police can storm homes with no warrants. And Brazilian shop-owners will pay to murder homeless children because they steal from them. The movie has an 8.7 of 10 rating on IMDb.com. This is an incredible rating, needless to say. I found the camera work far above the norm. The direction was good, but I felt they stole a bit from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Also, the story has been done before...poor community, drug dealing, corrupt cops, etc. I think the movie could have rocked if it was 25 minutes shorter, the characters more descriptive and understanding. After viewing the movie, it's difficult for me to understand how it received such high ratings. I found this movie no where near the top 100. It has no place among the best. The photography alone should not justify an 8.7. The story was full of holes, and again, it had been told before in hundreds if not thousands of other cultures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the near universal praise from critics and viewers alike and my interest in Brazilian culture, not to mention the buzz about the cinematography, I was eager to see this film, despite my lack of interest in violence as entertainment.I was disappointed on all counts. City of God seemed very amateurish to me, and I am still trying to figure out what is so great about the camera work. Done in a cinema verite style, it never seemed to rise above someone walking around with a video camera. I suppose that is the point, but it was very slack and unintriguing to me.None of the characters really got under my skin, they were merely shrill and unpleasant, and not in a "good" way.Most surprisingly, the hype about the violence is unfounded, and I am very sensitive to violence. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, killing, and depraved behavior, but it was presented in a way that oddly had little impact, let alone gore. I felt like I should have been utterly horrified by the scenes portrayed, yet it came across as not credible or realistic.City of God is certainly not a bad film, and it did have some moments of genuine truth and power, most notably in interactions with various girlfriends.My overall impression of the movie: - a noble and decent attempt at movie realism in that "cinema verite" style that does not succeed due to the lack of skill of both the director and the actors. Yes, I hear many of the actors were amateurs - but it doesn't work here.Guess I am pretty much alone here - but I will admit that I don't like very many movies made in the last 15 years or so, although there are a distinct minority that I will watch over and over again such is their quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that everything about box office is often very very wrong (slight spoilers, I think it should be safe to read if you haven't seen the movie)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only has this film earned an insulting profit (just over 18 million dollars in worldwide box office and just over 7 million in US box office) in retrospect to its quality, but the budget is also shockingly small, 3.3 million dollars for what is an absolutely stunning work of camera, very realistic gunfire and bloodshed (not too much bloodshed-and that is good), however there is gunfire in the vast majority of the scenes and is essential to some important moments of the film). The Godfather cost nearly twice as much at 6 million dollars, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest cost 5 million and while those are two of the greatest movies ever made you can hardly compare those two to City of God in terms of visuals and effects. I know it's immature of me to spend 10 lines complaining about box office, but it's just one thing that baffles me. Anyway, down to the important things. I don't care who you are, this film will be hard for you to watch, doesn't matter if you're used to watching disturbing films, doesn't matter if you're someone who doesn't even try to focus on films, but watches them anyway, doesn't matter if you're someone who likes anything and everything in a film and rarely stumbles upon something to complain about, doesn't matter if you're a bit of all three, nothing about you matters to find this difficult to watch. You have children holding guns and firing at innocent people and other children, because they know no better, because they've been taught and witnessed that there is no hope, because they are told to by psychopaths who have one and only solution: kill. Three scenes in particular-when the boss of all these psychopaths shoots two children in their feet and then gives another kid a choice to kill one of them as he does; the final scene (one of the best albeit most brutal endings I've seen) where a group of kids talks about killing, they say that they're going to make a blacklist of people to kill and the most brutally disturbing scene of this film-when the main antagonist who was just a child at the time kills every single person of a motel and thus starts his journey to becoming one of the cruelest villains of Brazil, the world and one of the numerous contenders for the greatest villain ever in film. This isn't even close to everything worrisome about this film, most of us have already seen The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger's brilliant Joker and his way of flipping the heroic Harvey Dent to the villainous Two-Face, Se7en as well has John Doe make the main target of his 7 deadly sins masterpiece, Mills, complete his masterpiece for him by unleashing his wrath, this film has such conversions of good people to bad, many of them, most notable being that of Knockout Ned, but besides him you have lots and lots of children joining the separate armies at verge of war for vengeance, power and other things one child needn't ever seek. Another thing I found disturbing was everybody's desire for drugs, there are scenes where children are using drugs and asking for them, then dealing them etc. But alas, there are exceptions to everything and there are people (besides policemen) who understand that with this type of life they cannot long endure, interestingly most of them had been some of the most beloved people among these outlaws before giving up that lifestyle, and in this group belongs the main protagonist, Rocket. Rocket is the narrator in this movie and I quite enjoyed him both as a narrator and a character, as a character he only wanted to become a photographer and lose his virginity asap to a girl called Angélica and succeeded in both more or less (both around the same time, in the latter he wasn't able to do it asap nor with the girl he wanted, but he did it) and he is the perfect narrator as though he has never wielded a fierce passion to the outlaw world he was indeed informed of their complete system and had grown up with these people, and in the end he became very successful hence the perfect narrator characteristic, he says the last sentence in the movie and to be honest I do not see how it fits with the whole scene (that group of kids I discussed about earlier), but as an independent sentence it is a helpful piece of information. Overall, the 8.7 rating on IMDb is very accurate in my opinion, it is a watch at your own risk movie, you're almost definitely going to think far less of this world once you've seen it, but I strongly recommend it to anyone, but especially those of you who think they are unlucky, to see that it could be much, much worse.</fullReview>

And such an exquisite authenticness! We are actually watching people who live(d) there.We are taken into a world where violence and manhood (as they know it) come so early in life, where your choices have to include the possibility of getting killed; or take lives, instead. Although the environment is drenched in blood, drugs and crime, the existence of loyalty, respect, responsibility, and even happiness is right around the corner.Tough film with a powerful message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this and then try to complain about your "first-world problems."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kept hearing that this movie was good, but I never got around to watching it. Having glanced at its cover before, I was expecting something different?more of a sappy romantic tale. Instead, I discovered one of most poignant, suspenseful, exciting, and action-packed tales of a place that I've only heard stories about. It catapulted me through a wide range of emotions. Watch this and then try to complain about your "first-world problems." The City of God is shockingly poor and frighteningly dangerous, yet culturally rich and unexpectedly beautiful.Meirelles and Lund manage to convey a stark realism through a cast made up largely of actors from Rio favelas who had never acted before, but who stepped up to the task in an amazing way with some intense coaching. The film even features some takes which were not scripted, as well as real coverage from true events. The music masterfully complemented the mood of each scene, while staying true to the beauty of Brazil. The camera work was top-notch (especially for 2002), both in César Charlone's skillful employment of the equipment and in the scenery that he captured. Daniel Rezende, the film editor, presented Charlone's vision at a wonderful intersection of deliberate and thrilling, ensuring that the viewer's attention stayed captive throughout.This flick is so good, I wanted to watch it again immediately after the credits rolled the first time around. You will be hooked from the moment the chicken starts running for its life. Make this film the next one you watch.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

Very crude film, manages to combine good stories of love, friendship and delinquency. Never predictable and slow, shot at a fast pace that does not weigh more than two hours in duration. Many of the players were taken to the road, where poverty is real and there is no need to recite the despair you live daily.

		<fullReview>Captivated for 130 minutes. I was riveted and couldn't take my eyes of the screen, constantly wondering what was going to happen next. It was so real and raw that you do not think that these are actors at all, they are dregs in the slums of Rio De Jeniro. I am convinced that Lil' Ze is in fact a homicidal gangster thirsty for power who will do anything to keep control and his rule with an iron fist, or brass knuckles. Throughout this whole movie you will see the pattern: for every action is a reaction...tit for tat, you killed my brother now I'm gonna f*ck you over, you insult me I'm going to humiliate you, you killed my Dad now I'm gonna join this gang and exact revenge. Overtones of power struggle and egoism that plague humanity on the deepest levels not just in the ghetto's of Brazil but here in present day Detroit or New Orleans, Atlanta, LA, etc. As many were killed in City Of God, what did it solve? Nothing, in the end, the two "leaders" were both dead and a new younger gang took over and someone will probably off them and a new more virile gang will replace the last and so on and so on. It's a vicious cycle that youth get caught in but the one boy was able to break the cycle and use his mind instead of fist and become a photographer. Great story and cast. Cannot find one flaw. Edgy true life drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Er, As I start writing this review I got a lot of thoughts about how people think about my county that I hate and love at the same time. The best here is the people, the place, the feelings that we all get that we are loved and that we have a amazing life, but then it comes the worst part, that is the peoples mid in here. Everybody thinks so little about themselves and agree even when it's not right, we are so complacent about everything that's wrong here and the others getting well on other people shoulders. I hate the fact that we are so accommodated that not even thinking straight about what's going here and what can we do to change the chaos. To change is never a idea. Sometimes I think Brazilians fear their governments, I don't know why, maybe is because they have a degree in law or any other diploma, so, people here are afraid of other people that they say is smarted than them? So, We will never grow to a strong country. We are ashamed of what we produced and we don't love what we have in here, people give more value to foreign than to each other. I never liked City Of God, I always said that it was too much, but, hey, I watched this film first time when I was twelve years old, so I indeed was too much for a child that the only mean haven seen in her country was what her father said to her, like - "Some mean people robber your uncle cellphone" or, whatever, things that happen everywhere, but What I'm trying to say is - "I'm not proud of this movie" Even if it shows what's the real reality of my country, still it makes me sad. Is nice film, but I always wished it was film in another place. So this is my first review, it's a weak, but I'll try to get better and hey, English isn't my first language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God is a bloody, exciting thrill as much into the life of a "favela" as it is into the lives of the youths who inhabit it. Although the bulk of the movie narrates the all-out turf wars between two rival drug dealers, the story is told with the energy, liveliness and enthusiasm of a child's tale, somehow managing to leave us hope amongst the corpses as the credits roll.It is Rocket, who dreams of becoming a photographer, who leads us through a world which no outsiders dare enter. The other inhabitants may be living their own quiet lives, however Rocket is on the periphery of the action and lives through the turf wars in a deeply personal way. From his first crush to his first camera, Rocket shares experiences both touching and humorous as well as his losses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visceral, dark, but tremendously compelling film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is truly incredible. It's basically a picture of the lives of a group of boys as they move from pre-teens to young adults and it's startling yet simultaneously exciting to watch.The acting in the film is superb, both the older actors and the child actors turn in memorable performances, especially those playing the three leads. Character development is crucial to this film's success and this is down to a great script and some nuanced acting - which in turn creates some very likable characters, although my favourite performance was probably that of the 'villain' Lil' Z, who I feel was able to make us even empathise with him occasionally despite some of the cruelest behaviour possible. The storytelling is quirky and almost fun (shining through the darkness, I guess) - with the narrator, Rocket, guiding us through the events in his life in an unconventional, practically omniscient way. Twists and turns are not overused - on the contrary they are used to great effect at just the right points. Nothing really feels out of place as everything is pretty logical.The direction and cinematography also deserve high praise. There are some great shots (which I shan't spoil for you) and the dark, green/blue tinted colour of the film is equally noticeable.All in all, the film is exciting and is one of the best gangster flicks you're likely ever to see - so buy the DVD/Blu-Ray and get watching! You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God" it's a movie which has to do about two different children who take different paths, one becomes a photographer and the other one a drug dealer. It's based on the true story of the photographer (Buscapé - Rocket).Alexandre Rodrigues as Buscapé - Rocket and Seu Jorge as Mané Galinha - Knockout Ned made a really good interpretations. It worth mentioning that "City of God" nominated for four Oscars (Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay), in my opinion "City of God" has to win at least the Oscar for Best Cinematography, because I think that this movie show us a really good images throughout the length of the movie."City of God" is a movie that shows us how is the true and well hidden face of Rio de Janeiro. In this movie we can understand how the things work in these neighborhoods and how drugs are controlling all the system of the city. Drugs controls and manages the relationships between the people and makes them believe that if they have a lot of them they are kings. This happens until they found out that there are not alone and in the middle are another problems and interests.I liked it very much because of the above reasons and it is really worth seeing it. If you have free time it really worth to spend it in this movie, you will be dumbfounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkably Disturbing Portrait Of Life In The Slums Of Rio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best contemporary films of its or any other time, City of God (also known as Cidade de Deus) is an exceptionally disturbing portrait of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro that covers the birth &amp; flourishing world of gangsters, gang-wars &amp; drug deals spanning over 3 decades, from 1960s to 1980s, and is narrated from the viewpoint of a young photographer named Rocket who continuously finds himself in the middle of all this despite wanting no part of this world.There are several main characters introduced in the film throughout its runtime &amp; the film expertly covers the evolution of each one of them. The direction is brutally honest, the script is absolutely uncompromising with its content, cinematography is raw, evocative &amp; stylish, editing is tight &amp; inventive, music is a huge plus and the performances by its entire cast is outstanding, especially the show-stealing stuff by child actors (my favourite being the one who played Li'l Dice).Based on a true story, City of God is a brutally violent, intensely shocking &amp; downright merciless cinema that will leave its viewers gasping for air from start to finish with its highly potent combination of fierce storytelling, explosive pace &amp; aggressive style of filmmaking. Unquestionably one of world cinema's greatest films &amp; certainly the finest to come out from Brazil, this genre-defining masterpiece is strongly recommended to every cinema lover around the globe. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen crime glorified in this way. Frankly, a little psychopath in me giggled at the end. Godfather and Goodfellas were great but they seemed to be more white collar when compared to our IT lives. City Of God (Cidade de Deus) is what crime is, means and should end like. Crude, naked and gory. Set in Cidade de Deus in Rio de Janeiro and based on novel by the same name, movie showcases the underbelly of crime in its crudest avatar.Movie is woven around few characters and shows their rise and fall. Lil Joe and Bene are the main criminals, Knockout Ned is the antihero and Rocket is the protagonist who is a photographer. The story revolves around these central characters and a number of small characters who play their valuable parts as the story progresses. The language is crude. Crime is almost guilt/remorse free. But the most important fact is the convincing power of the actors as they play their role.Even if story is kept apart, the film is technically brilliant. The shots of the Brazillian suburb are simply brilliant. Be it the initial chicken scene, the chase scene, scenes of brutal murders in den and the climax. Everything is brilliantly choreographed. Art direction is equally compelling. Bets thing is that one can see the locality first hand without any shade of artificiality. Direction is obviously awesome. Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund brought out a sensation on screen. Accolades attest that.</fullReview>

As the character meets more people he ended up in the middle of a drug war. There is of course the love interest, which feels very genuine.The plot is very good.

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking demonstration of cinematic shocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aspiring photographer Rocket (Rodrigues) recounts the story of the Brazilian slums and the times run by Li'l Ze (Firmino) and his gang When Slumdog Millionaire was released a few years ago it was critically praised for its sharp depiction of the African slums and the difficulty of Dev Patel's character's life and encoding that with a popular TV programme and heart warming love story, and so if you were a fan, prepare to have your mind warped by one of the darkest and violent slum films arguably ever created.Released 8 years ago now the story plays a reflection on Paulo Lins' novel which is based on a true story of the real gangs in Brazil during the 1960's and 70's. Which I hadn't realised till afterwards which honestly, makes the entirety of this production seems unbelievable. As much as Danny Boyle demonstrated a wisdom in India, Fernando Meirelles has shaken up something gob smacking original and authentic that will entertain, shock, make you laugh and cry and to tell a story of such violence and drama, of such childhood troubles and such forces corruption, blows the mind.The story opens in the present with a well executed quick cutting chicken chase that has the central character in the middle of the street and the Brazilian gang on one side and the police on the other, a cinematic piece of art that sets the tone for the style of the director and the execution for the start of a brutal yet enjoyable narrative.The plot shifts back in time and walks us through the formation of the notorious gang leaders of the slums and how childhood ignorance and neglect can form one of the greatest criminals ever. The hotel violence sequence is an effective hand-held camera montage of brutality and force that shakes up what should be a normal environment but works on so many levels of shock. From seeing teenagers with guns to the violent rampage of attacks this is a unthinkable collection of representations.There of course is unsettling teens all over the world, particularly aggressive in the UK and America thanks to media influence but within this setting of the Brazilian rural areas, shows us how peer pressure of a creative and influential power can ultimately upset a childhood's youthful ignorance and freedom.As the film shifts through different character stories, the pace maintains its steady pace of drug and weapons dealings and the power of authority and how violence upsets the established order. The dialogue is assertive and precise from all characters and though the novel should not be touched in my opinion, you would like to think it is a great adaptation, gaining an Oscar nomination.The cinematography is one of the big winners here with glorious lighting and hand shaking shots and using multiple twists in a story of childhood subjection to the surroundings is a winner and as before, like Slumdog? You will be aghast at this piece of perfection cinematic construction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cidade de Deus" is one of those it's so crude but it's sad but true movies that will exist.The viewing experience is haunting, disturbing, dark, but at the same time is reflexive, positive, and gives you the idea of how life is extremely hard for some people.At the same time, the movie focuses on the "Gangsta" way of living in the most dangerous places in Brazil, and in "the favela." What intrigues me the most is the exceptional research that the Director Fernando Meireles did on displaying the horrors and false honors as a consequence of making a living out of gangs.The Brazilian settings are beautiful, breath-taking and contrast with the dark tone of the movie. I really dug the main confrontation between the most important gangs and how it became too political.Through the eyes of our lead character, we learn that since childhood, through teenager years, then becoming a young adult, things seem to get more complicated if you don't get into crime. The sad result is that narcotraffic or drug dealing whatever you want to call it, is the only chance for a specific social class to have a decent life.But also, the movie reminds us that not everybody who sadly lives in the gangsta style are bad or ambitious. The main character is the prime example as he tries to get a decent job and not take a part on the black business.Oh but we get memorable characters like Ze Peque?o who is the most evil badass I've seen on any movie recently! Heck, he's the Brazilian Joe Pesci from "Goodfellas". I mean, his performance is wicked, scary, and excellent.Some situations are memorable like the motel massacre, the sunrising in the beach, the ghettos, the final confrontation, and the whole photographs subplot.Drug dealing, weapon dealing, crimes, murders, stealing are the common words in this movie but not on a negative note, no, these elements happen to be constructive on the reality bites factor. The movie is not a critic, it's only a display of a hard reality for those who get involved in mafia, no matter where and when. But don't take my review as a moral critic, please be objective and give the recognition the movie deserves. It's a fantastic structured tale of crime and how life in general is just the sandbox for it.The movie also has space for love, family, and even redemption interests. I truly liked the ending because it leaves us satisfied but without a real solution. I mean, we get the elements to make an opinion but anyways we know that nothing will possibly change.A memorable, haunting, and brilliant piece of a dark cinema. Thank you Fernando Meireles for producing this movie.Also, I have to get this off my chest... but Alice Braga is possibly the most beautiful, hot, sexy and charming woman I've seen on any South American film. She's just breath taking. Her beauty is impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful film that succeeds in paying homage to the American gangster film genre whilst at the same time creating a distinct world all of its own.An unknown cast is brilliantly Directed by Fernando Meirelles to offer a stunning insight into the world of the slums in Brazil, and in particular The City of God.Although telling the story over the decades of a group of slum children, and concentrating on one who made good, and another who made very bad,an Everyman story also emerges of poverty, survival and quick wits.The stunning Cinematography contrasts sharply with the grimy tale that unfolds told almost exclusively through the eyes of the young protagonists.A body count unfolds which would make Tarantino blush, and we quickly become desensitised to the casual deaths, often of children.Yet a richness of spirit emerges which , helped by some gallows humour, keeps the story bounding along at a brisk pace.few films justify a 130 minute running time, this does.Told in episodic fashion each section is produced in a highly disciplined manner.With little in the way of special effects the narrative has to triumph, and it does.A particularly noticeable feature is that unlike in Hollywood, when rounds are fired, people are shot, and stay shot.A foreign language tour de force.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fight and you'll never survive...Run and you'll never escape."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on true events of a Brazilian slum in Rio de Janeiro, 'City of God' tells a harrowing tale of one boys fight to escape poverty and crime. Over the course of roughly two decades, the story is told through the eyes of our young protagonist; 'Rocket', who desperately wants to make something of himself and free himself from the violence, drugs, robberies and corruption of the 'City of God'.It's established very early on in the film that the name of the slum, 'City of God', is blatant irony being that the place is completely overrun with all forms of crime and immorality. The first 20-30 minutes depict how the young citizens of the slum view crime as a necessity, and the only way in which they can make something of themselves and claim respect amongst the local population. It is clear that over time to some characters their "necessities" have started to become entertaining, and sadly this is passed on to the younger generations who then also aspire to such crimes. 'Rocket' introduces us to many important characters that are well respected in the community. One of which is 'Lil Zé', 18, and the sole king of the 'City of God'. An inhumane and immoral character who only received maximum respect through murder and drugs. 'Lil Zé' is an immensely frightening character; it's very hard to find a soul or a shred of humanity within him. He is a prime example of an underlying tone of a vicious cycle; influenced by older boys when he was younger, he aspired to become something greater than those who looked down upon him as a child and made himself the most feared member of the slum. There is one particularly devastating scene which demonstrates this, it is also likely to stick with you forever.Everybody fears everybody within the community, 'Lil Zé' has a large gang, and to join his side is a symbol of respect, and this is the ideal that all the young people of the slum have been taught. All except 'Rocket', who hopes to become a photographer one day, to form a legitimate career and to escape the hold the city has over him.'Rocket' is a sign of courage and hope, he even quotes that the slum is purgatory at one point, and 'Rocket' highlights this by being the only, or one of few, young people to hope to have aspirations of becoming something worth while and legitimate, where others view money as their only form of escape. During the course of the film, however, he becomes influenced by his surroundings and attempts to turn to the world of crime, but he has too much heart to commit any such acts. Each guy 'Rocket' met on his attempted descent was a "cool guy", and he couldn't bring himself to do any harm.It's amazing how someone as young as 'Rocket' (also 18) can think like he does within his surroundings. Whilst everyone else desires respect through crime, he desires it through legal methods. This can either be construed as fate, some form of intervention from 'God', or it could be because of the underplayed idea of his brother, 'Goose', wanting better for him and this ideal being subconsciously active throughout 'Rocket's life.Amongst all the various crime and drug use and dealing, it is made perfectly clear that all the main characters involved are but only teenagers. They like to party, hang out on the beach, and our protagonist has a crush on a pretty young girl called 'Angélica', who he wants to sleep with. These are simple lives made extraordinary, and for the most part, nobody wants that. 'Lil Zé', however, is displayed to be purely business orientated and has very little interest in anything other than his respect and power. If his hormones kick in, he will act upon them illegitimately.Though 'Zé' appears to be devoid of emotions and humanity, a small amount is shown during the film. He displays a little envy, aggression and a small amount of sadness in one scene, however this is quickly ended. This makes you wonder as to whether he is actually instinctively psychotic, or perhaps just badly damaged from a tough childhood.Visually, this is quite a strange film. It has a somewhat light-hearted aura surrounding it which is sometimes strengthened by an excellent soundtrack. This makes for an extra punch because it highlights how natural and normal this life is for all the residents of the city and can be quite a tough thing to think about. Some of the imagery, however, is very powerful and graphic making them often hard to handle. This imagery is made strong by a wonderful young cast who give excellent performances throughout. I'm sure if I were fluent in Portuguese, I'd find some small discrepancies within their line delivery, but as it stands, everybody seems very natural bringing about very strong characters.The soundtrack is superbly chosen, at certain times of terror, the soundtrack adds an oddly ambivalent sense of joy around the actions going on. It's as if, through the audiences perspective we see tragedy and brutality, but for the characters they see necessity or entertainment.The film is brilliantly paced, very fast, with some excellent cinematographic choices. The pace and overall intensity of the film encourages you to keep involved, and despite the tough imagery in certain parts, it's hard to look away. I can't seem to find much wrong with this film, and feel that it deserves 10 out of 10 for its courageous story matter and the confidence to not shy away from any details of, sadly, what many slums still are today. Even if this doesn't accurately portray life in certain slums, as a piece of art, this is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Story, Fantastic Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When listing the world's great film industries it is inevitable that one will mention the United States, India, France, perhaps even Germany and Italy. One nation that is not often mentioned is Brazil, a shame considering films such as City of God. This story of aging and maturing, both of Rocket, the main character, and of the slum known as the City of God itself, is a true masterwork of film making.City of God is without a doubt a thoroughly modern film in almost all aspects, but it also builds on a tradition much older than itself. The film was shot in an actual Rio de Janeiro slum using non-professional actors, some of whom actually grew up in the City of God itself. These characteristics are very reminiscent of the Italian Neo-Realist movement of the post war period who also used amateur actors and real locations to convey a strong sense of realism and truth through their films. In a way mirroring theirs City of God feels incredibly real, looks incredibly real, and thusly better conveys the story that it is trying to tell. This particular style is very well suited to the content of this film, as it is based on the true story of a drug war in the actual City of God slum, and so conveys an appropriate sense of realism.The editing of City of God is of particular interest. It is jumpy, fast-paced, and travels rapidly between narrative threads. This technique achieves two ends. Firstly is adds a sense of urgency and movement to the film, perhaps playing up the aspect of a "life flashing before your eyes" flashback that the majority of the film seems to be composed of. The second affect of the techniques employed, along with the use of narration and titles, is to give the film the feeling of being told orally, complete with tangential references to things that will come later, and references to that which has come before.Overall City of God is a great film that dives into a story of poverty, drugs, and desperation and never looks back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The city of God is one of the best best films that I have ever seen. This film is about the true story of the violent slums of Rio de Janeiro aka city of God. The screenplay was well done because the film has so much stories with in it, different characters and places have their on tale to tell. The main character telling the story from his point of view and it goes back and forth through time. The story kept me interested the whole entire film, there isn't any part of the film where I felt bored or confused. In this film the director wanted to give people a little taste of what it would be like living in the city of God and he wants to show the vivid violence. Being that the story starts out with gangsters running the town and new people always taking the last gangsters place. The director wants to say that this will never end, it only repeats. This unique film had some great cinematography, and the acting was really good. In one scene where a little boy was shot in the foot for stealing in the slums, he cried so much and it looked so real as if he were really hurt. The setting was amazing, many daylight shots where people were brutally murdered in the daytime. The director successful makes this film to have an effect on people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So you thought Hamlet or Tosca were violent?I struggled for a while with how to rate this movie, as well as how to review it. Considering cinematography and acting, it is very well made (as most viewers have acknowledged with its high ratings). But, it is soulless, with unremitting evil, betrayal, corruption, and mayhem. Ze Pequeno is the vilest character I've EVER seen portrayed (which is saying a lot). It's worse because he's very believable -- we all know there really are people like that. One spends much of the movie hoping that someone will do him in, but the film douses any satisfaction with that.I prefer my films to have some inspirational values to them. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of the fight between two gangs for the control of a "favela" called "Cidade de Deus" (City of God) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The story develops against a background of poverty, squalor and lawlessness where the values which are obeyed are those imposed by the gangs. We see even children possessing and using guns, killing and robbing at ease. The images are extremely realistic and the cast without exception does a superb performance. The cut was made in syncopated scenes with lots of short flashbacks with the intention of conferring a vivid rhythm to the movie but revealing themselves sometimes excessive. The dialogues are also very realistic and full of strength. A good movie almost a masterpiece of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie deals about children and adolescents factions in Favelas Rio Janeiro for 1960 and 1970 years .And centers upon a teen who tries to leave that world by the means of the photography. The final confrontation between the gangs for Favelas control is pretty violent and bloody. Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and for that isn't bored but it's enjoyable. The picture is similar other film 1981 year:¨Pixote¨(Hector Babenco) that was likeness in atmosphere and reflection of delinquent vagrants. In the motion picture there are emotion ,shocks,sex violence and a little bit of critical social. It's a thought provoking and clever studio of juvenile paupers and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro city where teens and children become in burglars and assassins. The motion picture has got Oscar nomination and and obtained success in the box office of all the world. Principal actors interpretation is outstanding in spite of are novels players. Fernando Mereilles Direction is awesome and stylish , he has contracted by Hollywood yet. The movies is produced by Walter Salles ,Director and Production manager number one of Brasil. The film has classify ¨R¨ by crude murders and sex and isn't apt for boys but old people (+18)neither squeamish.The flick will like social drama and thoughtful lovers. Rating: 7/10.

I gave it a 10 because it deserves it and because it is a unique movie which shows people in poverty which try to earn money to live. Also this movie has a lot of violence and also shows in some parts children doing drugs.This can affect some under aged audiences ( they will think that you can smoke weed / do cocaine and nothing will happen to you).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of God -- One of 2002's greatest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City of God" is a masterful film about the criminal world of one of Brazil's most notorious slums. "City of God," as the name suggests, was sold as a paradise to Brazilians whose former homes had been destroyed by floods and acts of arson. But this slum turned out to be a purgatory on earth and eventually became a burning inferno filled with violence and grinding poverty. This slum also served as a microcosm for a cynical policy of moving the poor and their problems away from the more prosperous urban areas and then forgetting about them -- unless, that is, the level of crime and violence really got out of hand. "City of God," aside from its highly original camera work and musicality, is also a brilliant piece of story telling. This film not only has wonderfully constructed, multi-dimensional characters, but it also puts these characters in exciting, dangerous, funny, and often unbelievable situations. We can predict that many of the Brazilian kids and teenagers, who begin a life of crime, will eventually come to grief, but we cannot anticipate how or under what circumstances they will meet their fate. In addition, this film also pays unusually close attention to human nature. To take just one example, the subtleties in the friendship between self-styled boss of the "City of God" and drug lord Lil Ze and Benny (both played brilliantly by Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) are fascinating. Lil Ze is obviously a psychopath who kills and maims people with his gun almost on impulse, but the most intimate and enduring relationship in his life is with his friend Benny. As a result, Benny is often able to use his friendship to steady Lil Ze and prevent him from losing control completely. Another example is how Goose acts as a kind of father figure to Rocket, telling him never to touch his gun, while he continues his life as a hoodlum. These character studies are far more complex and interesting than the cardboard characters that come straight off the assembly line in most Hollywood films. Moreover, this attention to human nature reveals the countless little details that make us empathize with the characters in the "City of God" to varying degrees, regardless of whether they are good or bad. As a result, this movie is much more than just entertainment; it teaches something about slum life, crime, and the human condition. "City of God" is one of 2002's best films.</fullReview>

Hey how you doing'? good rate pa 'enjoy. The house is in order. Lets get it started. See you later alligators! On the bonus DVD, it is revealed that the only professional actor with years of filming experience was Matheus Nachtergaele, who played the supporting role of Carrot.[1] Most of the remaining cast were from real- life navels, and in some cases, even the real-life City of God Havel itself. According to Meirelles, amateur actors were used for two reasons: the lack of available professional black actors, and the desire for authenticity. Meirelles explained: "Today I can open a casting call and have 500 black actors, but just ten years ago this possibility did not exist. In Brazil there were three or four young black actors and at the same time I felt that actors from the middle class could not make the film. I needed authenticity." Beginning about 2000, about a hundred children and young people were hand-picked and placed into an "actors' workshop" for several months. In contrast to more traditional methods (e.g. studying theater and rehearsing), it focused on simulating authentic street war scenes, such as a hold-up, a scuffle, a shoot-out etc. A lot came from improvisation, as it was thought better to create an authentic, gritty atmosphere. This way, the inexperienced cast soon learned to move and act naturally.</fullReview>

So good Brazilian movie. I think it is the best Brazilian movie I've ever watched, or ever made.The very first thing I love is the action cinematography and the camera. They used "vibrant-recording" or maybe I should call it "pro-amateur- recording". I call it because almost all cameraman used to record with "vibrant-recording". It is not good for such a film like drama. But, what I watched was different. This vibrant makes another sense of film. A chaos but deep sense. It is how they try to make the movie problem become more problematic. A good and smart idea it was.Another hand, I like the way they translate the social and dark nation- history to a movie masterpiece. Because, mainly developing countries need movie like it. Movie that criticize the government, the police department, and also a deep social problem in every side in the country.It is critical and irony, but in the same time, it is fantastic, very dramatic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning, harsh, and beautiful look at life in a favela</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-off countries have a habit of sweeping the issues of small countries under the rug, unless helping them can benefit us. Some movies like to give you a look at what you're unaware of in the harshest way possible, and jam the issue into your face until you feel bad for not helping people in these conditions. This what City of God tries to do, and it succeeds admirably. Everything about this movie works to make it more powerful. The acting, the story telling, the directing, all make you feel like you're living in this world of filth, crime, and poverty. Many of the actors in this movie were actually from The City of God, a very crime-ridden and poor part of the Rio Favela. They embody their roles well because of this. They do a wonderful job of making small parts into interesting characters. Another crucial part is the story-telling. The movie is filled with flashbacks that give characters back-stories. These serve to not only inflate the narrative, but they help make memorable characters. The movie also juggles several stories at once, but manages to keep your attention and understanding. For instance, the final scenes deal with Rocket trying to further his photography career, Carrot and Li'l Ze going to war, a young boy killing Knockout Ned for murdering his father,the police being corrupt, and the Runts taking over. All of this happening at once helps to absorb you into the action on screen But the most important part, in my opinion, is the directing. Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund did a truly amazing job of filming even slower scenes to make them seem fast-paced and intense. The way some shots are done are inventive and almost fun to watch, much like the work of Sam Raimi. This makes the movie seem frantic and energetic the whole way through. So, this movie that I can't understand a word of and I bought for 3$ at my local video store impressed me beyond words. It quickly took a slot in my top 10 favorite movies, and should be regarded as one of the best foreign films of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films about violence there are aplenty. Many of them are purely fictional and are glamorized bloodbaths made for special audiences. Necessary are only a few. For your consideration: Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles' "Cidade de Deus" dealing with the eponymous "City of God". Initially the name of a housing project created by the Brazilian government in the 1960s, the result was abandoned by the authorities after its creation and turned out to be anything but what its name suggests. Taken over by drug lords crime is the way to get by in these favelas. Killings are everyday business, and they happen on the side of the police, on the side of the drug dealers, or among the people in the slums themselves by exchanging their arguments with weapons. Since its creation, children growing up in these areas have learned to be part of the violence - they are on the receiving end and they practice it without questioning. They live to survive.Meirelles's film is basically a documentary cloaked as film, based on Paulo Lins' real life accounts of what he witnessed himself, shot with actors who were picked from the slums. Unashamedly it covers full 20 years and shows all facets of violence that advance the spiral of death and destruction in the favelas. Meirelles uses state of the art cinematography combined with intentionally changing directorial styles in order to follow the various stages of despair and hopelessness. From the days of petty delinquents starting out where anything goes to gangs who commit mass murders, but are inevitably trapped in their doomed existence, Meirelles portrays the vicious circle with brutal honesty. "City of God" is best appreciated in conjunction with the documentary "News from a Personal War" (Lund/Salles) on the subject showing 10 year olds carrying AK-47s and police men who admit that they work in a war zone. Lots of funerals on both sides, no hope in between.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was intense! I loved it as it really showed the reality of what happens in the slums of these places. It was full on, kept me hooked, it was brutal, no holds barred and it was a fantastic film that shined a light on what really happens in isolated, war ravaged countries. The structuring of time blew me away, although it may be confusing to some people, it was simply genius to me. The 'true story' effect made it even more engaging to me.My favourite character was Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) This man could have easily been corrupted by the war, the drugs and the people as he lived in that environment. His passion for photography led him away from the madness that the City of God went through and gave him hope. You have to give this young man credit for the harm he put himself through just to get the photos of the mobsters. He was a generous and lovable man which really shined in the darkness. Easily the favourite of the movie. Great actor too!However I would recommend it to a selected few only. This is a great film but a rather intense and brutal one. I will only recommend it if I feel they will benefit from watching it.This movie was just fantastic. The directors and writers did the most amazing job in constructing the timeline as it only added to the tension. The details of the characters and their actions was carefully crafted and focused on heavily. This allowed the audience to get an inside look on what goes on in the City of God and it really opened my eyes. One of the best films I have and will ever see in my life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violence and brutality abound in this passionate story of a city and its crime wave. City of God tells the story of this city, the City of God, which sits just a few miles away from Rio de Janero, but it's no paradise. It's a dangerous and crime ridden world where gangs run the streets and guns and drugs are the things which give a man power and control over everyone else. We learn the story of this city from the eyes of Rocket, a quiet young man with hopes of being a journalist one day, assuming he can survive that long in such dangerous conditions. Through crafty editing, engrossing cinematography, and a plethora of disturbingly real performances we witness a most unsettling yet uniquely fascinating story unfold in City of God.This is one of those films that has one word to describe it. That word is memorable. The film is absolutely memorable above everything else. It has its own incredibly unique style and it tells a story of a world unlike anything the common man lives in. The atrocities committed in this film by adults and children alike are a lot to bare and a lot to take in, especially knowing that this is a true story. The world operates differently in little places like this, and City of God gives us such an unabashed and unrelenting look at just what a brutally different world this is.Everything about this film is some kind of excellent. It's well directed, well written, and well acted. The film comes together to be a truly engaging story with an unforgettable stylistic way of telling that story, one that works extremely well in its own special way. The story is told in a linear fashion while also jumping back in time every once in a while to catch us up on the vast modern history of this city. The city itself becomes a character, morphing and changing through the years, adapting cultural phenomenas here and there while still retaining its violent upbringing. A sort of mythos and lore is built around the city, and this is a tell all tale about it.All in all I was just incredibly impressed with City of God. It's a film of very pristine quality, never missing a beat amidst all its chaos and the vast amount of characters that are all part of the story. It's a story about a part of society many of us don't know about, and the film really boils down to just that. There isn't much hidden metaphor within the film or anything particularly special to look for. It's just for the purpose of telling an immaculate and moving story about a city and it's inhabitants. And that story makes this film a fantastic watch from start to finish and it leaves you with unforgettable memories about what some people are capable of. It really is a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>College students love this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have shown this film in my classes at Minnesota State University Mankato and offered it as an assignment and extra credit. Either way, it is perhaps the only film of the dozens I've shown that my predominantly Midwestern students have universally liked. For some ? maybe even most ? it may be the first non-English language film they're ever seen.And for a bonus it is a great educational tool: Yes, it demonstrates vividly that great films are made outside of the U.S. Yes, the cinematographic and editing choices offer a cornucopia of styles. Yes, the music and soundtrack are not secondary but help drive the film in its relentless pace. Yes, the ensemble cast, many of whom are amateurs from the favelas where the film is set, bring each character to life with compelling definition.Yes, the film exemplifies the classic three-act structure with hook, plot points, Shakespearian-style midpoint, climax and denouement. Yes, it sails thru its 130 minutes yet ends at just the right time. And all this in one film.With an educational tool like CITY OF GOD, my job as a film professor becomes astonishingly easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but certainly close enough!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this was not a perfect movie but it still was a very good one!For some reason this movie really gave me a sort of "Goodfellas" type of vibe. Both movies are of course crime movies and both movies pretty much chronicle the life of a young, wannabe(es) gangster(s). I'm not saying that movies are also the same in style and story though, since this really isn't the case. "Cidade de Deus" is an original movie on its own and is taking its own approach on the genre.It's a movie that on the one hand is showing how cool the life of a gangster is, while at the same time its throwing in some pretty heavy and dramatic stuff as well. Because of its sort of lighthearted approach, the more heavy scenes make an all the more greater impact. I think this is why the movie and all of emotions and drama work out so well.The movie also really doesn't picks sides or condemns anyone. It just shows things how they are and how much more easy it is to make a living as a criminal, as opposed to by going to school and try to make an honest living, in the Brazilian suburbs. It's also not trying to look for any answers or solutions, it's simply showing the craziness and hopelessness of the whole situations as it was and still mostly is at some places, not only in Brazil of course.It's a pretty raw and straightforward movie, mostly with its violence, starring also mostly young non-professionals in it, which adds to its overall realism. Also the story feels like just a couple of random pages out of the lives of some Brazilian youngsters, each trying to make it in their own way. But this at the same time is also a bit of a complaint I have about this movie. I would had preferred some more focus at times and that the movie featured a better- or at least more clear, main plot line in it. It now feels a bit like a fragmentary movie instead, also because it's following multiple different characters at the same time. Perhaps one main character, which the movie could focus solely on, would had been a better choice.But obviously it didn't bothered me all that much, since I still really 'liked' watching this film. This was also really thanks to the way it got directed. It has a great style to it, which is often fast and adds both to the craziness and realism of the movie at times. It besides also makes the movie unique and 'pleasant' to watch, since it's also giving the movie a lot of pace.So while not perfect, it still is a really great and quite effective movie!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title is from Augustine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film. It is named after the Rio de Janeiro neighborhood where it is set. But there is a second meaning. The neighborhood was named City of God after a concept in Catholic and early Christian thinking.City of God was originally the name of a book written in Latin in 410 AD by St. Augustine of Hippo, a Roman Christian philosopher. The book was written at a time when the then-Christian Roman Empire was in decline and in threat of destruction. Many Romans believed that the original Roman gods were punishing Rome for abandoning them in favor of Christianity. Augustine did not agree.In the book, Augustine states that the fate of the City of Man, the earthly city, is insignificant. The City of God is built in the afterlife by people who are dedicated only to serving God. God's servants will not mind the destruction of the earthly society since they will live forever in heaven.How this applies to the movie, I am not quite sure. The events seem a bit reminiscent of the fall of Rome what with the corruption, violence and drug use. It might be an ironic or sarcastic sense, or perhaps a reference to the fact that many in the film do not seem to fear death. I am sure there is some connection beyond the neighborhood name.As an aside, the concept of the City of God was referenced by both Reagan in his "City on a hill" speech and Mario Cuomo in his "Two Cities" speech.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gut-wrenching look at Brazilian street crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God shows the evolution (and de-evolution) of Brazilian favelas from the sixties to the eighties. It follows Rocket's turbulent life, and Ze's descent, as well as showing a few other characters and places stories.A big part of City of God's success is it's style and atmosphere. Actors pulled from the streets, Portuguese dialogue and nearly- on- location filming make City of God a sickening look at urban violence.The story is incredible. Starting with the main character's older brother's shenanigans in the 60's, we see life around Rocket change with the times. While America thought of Vietnam, Brazil thought of partying and drugs. It's interesting to see a different perspective of the world, and that's certainly a reason this film is so high on the 250. If this was the same film, but about LA gangs, it probably wouldn't be so high.Technically, the film is great. Swooshing camera-work looks awesome, and the entire apartment scene is amazing. The cinematography of the opening scene is really something.City of God is a great foreign film that should be seen for its exposition of slum life. It's well paced, perfectly told, and has a satisfying ending. And it's true. 8.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITY OF GOD ? 9.8/10 Director: Fernando Meirelles &amp; Kátia Lund(co-director) Writer: Bráulio MantovaniI can get into the technical aspects of the film and destroy it or I can just leave you to do the hard work. I think I'll go with the latter. An ensemble cast with only one trained professional actor, the film is the finest I have scene when it comes to depicting lives of those living in situations so unfortunate, that most of us forget to be remotely thankful or remorseful. The screenplay though, needs special mention; we constantly but seamlessly cut back and forth in time throughout the film ? a special thanks to Daniel Rezende for the razor sharp editing ? but never is the viewer lost, so refined is the choice of sequences and finessed the flow of the film. There is also a reason why the film is cyclical, the point of which I am hoping to get across by the end of review (enough of technicality).The story progresses from the point of view of Alexandre Rodrigues (Buscape ? Rocket), the only individual to escape the violence but not the favela. Through his camera and narration, we see the lives of several children/individuals, who grow up in the City of God, a housing project in Rio de Janeiro quite notorious for its criminal activity. The film casually depicts how children get absorbed into mindless violence and are perpetually condemned to it, their lives spiraling towards an endless state of human tragedy. The plot is too lengthy to narrate and it wouldn't serve a purpose to serve up spoilers either. There is something this film evokes within me, which I feel is worthy of a mention.There is a prevalent belief that if a film is nominated for Oscars, it must be good. That is a dangerous belief. What is even more dangerous is the belief that if a film did not win an Oscar, it must have not been "that" good. To understand the complexities of a film like City of God, there is no given formula; but if you are from a third world country and have had first hand knowledge or even worst, experience of such a life, there is a good chance you might not relegate such films to award ceremonies.Social structures are complex. We take what we get (at birth) as a given and live with it for the rest of our lives. The marginalization, is a given. Wealth disparities, cultural and behavioral differences across strata are all a given; it is what we use to separate "us" from "them". The "them" &amp; "us" &amp; "us" &amp; "them" perpetuates. We never imagine what our lives would be if we were not born to the fortunes we were. Instead of our parents, if our guides were our peers who were gun wielding, drug churning maniacs, whose lust for power leads to failed societies and absolute chaos, the very same power the civilized societies so tacitly condones.The director wants us to ruminate, to ponder, to reflect. Take the directors intent too seriously and all coffee table discussions about poverty, crime, brutality and the children who are victims and perpetrators of such intent, might seize into oblivion. The "us" &amp; "them" might fade and disappear, the same "us" &amp; "them" which gives us our superior identity and allows us to take pride and reason in what we do. Well? if you dare to fathom the film City of God, all the superiority complexes, the fragile mirages and concocted illusions might just get shattered and the unreal reality ? debunked. You have been warned. That is the power of City of God.</fullReview>

Based on a novel, it should have been a nightmare to paint so many characters on screen. But this movie never falls apart; instead, moves on so fast that you are just glued to what's happening around you One of the 'Must Watch' world movies.

		<shortDescription>Realistic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of god or also known as Cidade De Deus seemed to me like a boring, overlong, not worth watching kind of movie but surprisingly I actually enjoyed the film for its realism. The setting for the film is gritty and painful, in a way, if you look at it from a different perspective. IT seemed desolate yet full of life as well. It is not my favorite film nor is it my worst but somewhere in the middle because it is slow at times and gets really exciting when the story takes a new turn or when a new character is introduced. The narration made the film for what it is and it was really needed because without it it would have seemed like a waste of time but, thankfully, it didn't reach that. The film explores violence, innocence, and sexuality so some would not like it e.g. old people. Sorry! Had to say that. It is just that they are frightened so easily and are so fragile with the exception of Clint Eastwood. The film also made me realize that Rio de Janeiro was different and more psycho than it is now. Guns are now festivals being held in the street. It also made me realize what gangsters and gangster-wannabes would to in order to cause havoc and chaos along with making kids and people lose their innocence. The part where they shoot the kids on their legs and hands was gruesome and disturbing but what was even more disturbing was that a 12 year old kid had to finish one of them off. So sad and honest! The film does not hold back it's violence because if they did the film would have less of an impact on me and some other views. Fernando Meirelles was a great director and the City Of God is without a doubt his best work so far. His great sense of direction and casting made this film work for me and it didn't disappoint. But of course he wasn't perfect and I felt that some scenes were unnecessary and could have been done without plus it would have made the film shorter and sweeter. Who hates nothing more than a slow boring movie that has no point? The great acting from Alexandre Rodriguez was enough to make him the star of the show. Phellipe Haagensen was second so don't you worry about.................anything!?Cidade de Deus (City of God) is a housing project built in the 1960's that--in the early 80's--became one of the most dangerous places in Rio de Janeiro. The tale tells the stories of many characters whose lives sometimes intersect. However, all is seen through the eyes of a singular narrator: Buscapé, a poor black youth too frail and scared to become an outlaw but also too smart to be content with underpaid, menial jobs. He grows up in a very violent environment. The odds are all against him. But Buscapé soon discovers that he can see reality differently than others. His redemption is that he's been given an artist's point of view as a keen-eyed photographer. As Buscapé is not the real protagonist of the film--only the narrator--he is not the one who makes the decisions that will determine the sequence of events. Nevertheless, not only his life is attached to what happens in the story, but it is also through Buscapé's perspective of life that one can understand the complicated layers and humanity of a world, apparently condemned to endless violenceMy favorite scenes were: When the group robbed the hotel and the little kid later brutally murdered everyone in it. My other favorite scene was..........ummm......let me think........I know! The part where the gang run after a chicken through the streets because it provided amusement and laughter. One other good scene was the little gang full of three year olds have enough of Lil Ze's b*llshit so they murder him by shooting bullets all over his body! The film is enjoyable but it will not appeal to everyone for its slowness and a lack of captivity. Pretty good so go on and try it! 7/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>viewers are humbly advised to look beyond the stylistics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cidade' has its merits. The photography is unmatched and the editing/structuring is extremely clever. Its an effective and pretty bewildering film, but on subsequent viewings this looks more like a barrage of cinematic tricks and literary devices rather than a study of human nature. All those dazzling stylistics are a knockout on a first viewing, but they also allow passive and ignorant viewers to vicariously enjoy the violence, like an action movie or a cartoon. Thats why this film is so popular. After having recently viewed Slumdog Millionaire, I seriously doubt this film's pretensions to realism. Though I'm sure its still far more factual than SM.When you watch the film again with some care, you'll notice how contrived it really is. All films and all stories are contrived, I know, but there ARE films that overcome this problem. Even purely theatrical films like 'Glengarry Glen Ross' and 'Quiz Show' are far more realistic, convincing and illuminating than 'Cidade' ultimately manages to be. The filmmakers succeeded in their primary endeavor, but they forgot to stitch up the seams. Examples : In Brazil, motel = whorehouse. Rocket sleeping with the white journalist was ridiculous. And not being detected by the cops in that barely concealed hiding place was equally unbelievable. Also, the Runts kill Lil' Ze like what, FIVE SECONDS after the cops leave the place ??? Knockout Ned's death seems to be the hokey "violence-begets-violence" message you can expect from a film like this.This is an unnerving, mind-boggling cinematic tour-de-force meant for one viewing only. Its exhilarating and visceral. But for me its not a perfect film because it doesn't make me think too deeply about any substantive non-filmic ideas. Surface shock seem to be the goal here, rather than any art or psychology. Also, the English chapter headings &amp; subtitles (with Americanized slang) indicate that this was made with foreign viewers in mind, intended as a vehicle for voyeurism. It worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word: Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of god is the most powerful movie I've seen. Period. Is it the best one?. No, but it should be considered as one of the best.Seldom we the viewers have the chance to experience something like this film. From the beginning to the end, this masterpiece allows no time to breathing. The storytelling is restless, the descriptions of the favela and its inhabitants are ruthless, and the hope of a better future is scattered after the sound of a bullet (from the thugs' guns or the police's guns)The story starts in the 60's and right away we see the city of god as forgotten and desolate place, with its inhabitants debating of which way would be useful to earn some money: by working hard or robbing. Here we find our two main characters: one is Rocket (buscape)and the other is Lil' Dice (dadinho).Rocket is a well intentioned boy who tries to carry on a normal childhood (and he is the narrator of the story). On the other hand, Lil Dice is a wannabe gangster who hangs out with Rocket's brother gang. Lil Dice is merciless, psychotic and has a strong ambition to become a well known criminal.Ten years later, we find this two characters in the same place but in different situations. Rocket works as a photographer in a local newspaper and hates Lil Dice for having killed Pato in the past. Lil Dice (now Lil'Ze) has become the greatest drug-lord in the City of God by erasing his opponents. The only opponents left is Carrot, who albeit being a smaller scale drug-lord, he threatens to displace Lil 'ZeFrom then on, the story becomes bloodier as a series of related events between major and secondary characters (Knockout Ned, Carrot, Steak with Fries)leads to a gang war.To sum up, City of God is powerful in both of its side: the human and the brutal. Its depicts the reality of a forgotten place where its people try (in their own way)to not be left behind. Pretty much what is happening in the slums of my country right now.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God is like Shakespeare. A powerful movie that takes us through the world of drugs in Rio de Janeiro. The film is full of rich characters, and an even richer story (or stories). Fate and chance occur throughout the film, letting you decide what is it really. The editing of the movie is done very choppy at times and like that of the ridiculous Jason Bourne movies, but this movie makes it work. It needs that choppy editing to keep the viewer on their feet. By no means is the storytelling here slow or lacking. The film has an energy from the beginning to the end. The editing works too because the shots are not overly shaky. We can see what is going on so the quick editing at times works because of that. The film is a morality tale. Each character is tested and tempted by the villain, Li'l Ze (a metaphor for pure evil). Rocket, the main character, is tempted but ends up the only real survivor at the end. Everyone else succumbs to the pressures of the dark side. Knockout Ned, a noble man, is out for revenge on the shooting of his family by Li'l Ze's gang. He ultimately joins a rival gang and kills an innocent person (purposefully). His lust for revenge turns him into a killer, which ultimately gets him killed. Benny is the opposite. He is a thug, and good friend of Li'l Ze, but decides the life of drugs and crime are no longer for him. He wants out. At his own "goodbye" party he gets shot accidentally. Was he being punished by God for his previous sins, or was it just a freak accident? The intertwining of characters and events in this movie are that of a Seinfeld episode. Everyone is connected in the city of god. And everyone has a choice. Kill or be killed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles did an amazing job directing the film City of God. He didn't just direct, he sculpted the lives of the characters the viewer sees on screen and allows the audience to know them. He almost makes it possible for a viewer to even feel what they feel. It is a dark world in the City of God, but it is also a loud one.It is no wonder City of God won the Golden Reel Award. Not only do they use cinematography to draw viewers into the world of Rocket and Lil' Ze, but they also enhance the experience with an incredible score and soundtrack. The score heard during the raid of the prostitution house by the Trio served to intensify feelings of excitement and assists the viewer in feeling the excitement of the young men committing the crime. The audience is given the tools to feel what the characters feel in that moment in time. Narration, while overused by some, was used well in City of God. Meirelles did not use narration to tell the story, but to supplement and enhance it. It only serves to assist the audience further into Rocket's tumultuous world. While life in the City of God is indeed ear shattering at times, Meirelles also utilized silence brilliantly. A moment of silence just after Benny's murder is key in bringing the audience into the depth of exactly what this turning point means in the world of the City of God and it's inhabitants. City of God is well done and high on my list of recommendations (to those who can stomach the violence). In my opinion, it is a masterpiece of delving into a world unknown and the lives of those who live there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie lacks sensibility? Unfortunately, so does reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read many comments complaining that this movie doesn't do much to make you care about the characters and therefore doesn't connect you emotionally with the plot. I just want to point out that this lack of sensibility doesn't represent a flaw from the director or the script. Do you really think that people who grow up trying to be constantly high on drugs to escape reality, struggling to survive and numbed down by the omnipresent violence manage to become very sensitive or deeply caring? Unfortunately not. As a Brazilian who had his share of experience with violence, it's clear to me that the state of mind in which these "gangsters" live don't leave much space for meaningful emotional development. I am sure the director wanted to show us how does it feel to be there and how small is the presence of sanity and hope (portrayed mostly by Rocket) amidst the chaos; and the fundamental importance to nurture them.If you can't feel connected to the raw emotions that drive the characters in this movie, that might just mean that you don't understand it because your life isn't so chaotic or hopeless. It doesn't mean that these emotions are any less powerful or that they are not present to some extent in each one of us.In my opinion this is one of Brazil's most important achievements. It's a powerful portrait of society that should be watched by anyone who wants to broaden its view on the world and then learn to care more about it. Our society needs movies like this to shake us off our numbness and indifference. And as a movie it's incredibly well-done, entertaining and clever. I am very proud that this movie has been made and I try to show it to everyone I care about. I would also like to praise the German synchronization of the movie. While I mostly prefer subtitles, due to the frantic nature of City of God, a good synchronization allows those who don't understand Portuguese to focus on the acting and cinematography. And the German voices really captured the spirit of the characters. I was really impressed.Don't miss out on the chance to watch it, and if it disturbs you, that's a good thing. It means that you care. And that's the first step towards change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best crime movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by true events, this is one of the best crime movies that I have come across. The beauty of it is in the impeccable subtlety with which shocking series of events are presented. They seem totally digestible. City of Gods is a narrative movie based in the slums of Brazil. It is about children. Children who get guns in their hands at a tender age. They run around in groups looting and killing commoners and each other. Many of them die early and others die a bit later. Out of an array of brilliantly characterized people, 3 stand out. These are Little Ze(Leandro Firmino) who is main 'gangster', Benny(Phellipe Haagensen) his right hand, adviser, best friend, style guru and Rocket(Alexandre Rodrigues) the boy who narrates the story. All 3 do their best to survive through the unbelievably chaotic rush of wannabe gangsters all around them. Not much is to be told about the story, cause it unfolds time and again with twists that add to the interest. The overall aura, locations that are used not only are very authentic, but blended with the colors and lighting, lend a very realistic and unpredictable touch to the story. This is very distinct from the typical American crime movies. Its unique, well executed and definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

However while doing this, it portrays people (mostly children)too cartoonish, it feels like a tale more than a real life story.I must admit that I could not make it till the end cause I got bored..</fullReview>

Some films in it are good but many are terrible.I found the plot to be very muddled and shallow and the story difficult to follow due to the large number of new characters that kept appearing in the film often for a short time.I gave it 4/10 despite the confusing shallow story because it does show the painful realities of grinding poverty in Brazil and how it even compromises the innocence of children with hard drugs and serious violence.

		<fullReview>City of God is a fantastically made film filled with memorable characters all mixed into a story that will hold your attention from beginning to end. There's seriously not much wrong with this movie at all and has some of the best performances I've seen to date in modern cinema. Fernando Meirelles certainly makes his mark here, creating a realistically brutal rendition of a true story based around a violent neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro in the 60's and 70's.I don't know if such ties have been mentioned before but this movie reminded me very much of The Godfather movies, filled with violence, crime, drugs and money with each gang trying to survive or gain a bigger slice of the pie. The one major difference between this and the Godfather however is that the main theme here is simply that these people have been made to live like this. It is their conditioning, and usually not always is it a choice for such people to make such choices. This theme is recurrent throughout the film and is poignantly displayed with great effect with every bullet that is fired.Although obviously not as grand as such movies, City of God nevertheless does its job brilliantly, building up characters with a perfect pace and balancing the plot all the while so that things don't slow down beyond interest. Perhaps what the film does best however is depict the nature of disorder and corruption to a degree only someone with direct experience could do. Throughout the film I did feel like I was watching real events take place, never feeling like I was watching a scripted movie, and I have to say, every few films achieve this with me. This is probably why I have so little to say about the movie! I also have another theory that the best movies need fewer lines to review than the bad ones. Or more accurately, the best films cannot be reviewed well enough to do them justice. So it is simply my job to say "watch this movie and be as amazed as I was". The rating says it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it is not easy to break away from violence in hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the slums of Rio de Janeiro, where the police is either corrupt or absent, the cycle of violence seems without end. Children witness and participate in drugs and crime at an early age. Here it may be harder than anywhere else to choose good over evil, to break away from the violence. The story is told through the eyes, and lens, of Rocket. Through him we see Li'l Ze rise to power, the showdown with the rival gang led by Carrot and Knockout Ned and his demise. This movie has great characters, superbly acted.There is Li'l Ze, sociopath, who enjoys killing already at an early age. More ruthless than anyone else, he becomes the most powerful drug dealer in the area. However, his ruthless violence backfires almost literally. His power is threatened by Knockout Ned, who joined a rival gang after he kills people dear to him. Finally he is killed a group of small children, with the bullets and guns that he gave to him. Now the circle of violence seems to be complete. Despite his ruthlessness, there are times when Li'l Ze seems vulnerable. The only way for him to get a woman is through violence, and he dies at the hands of some little kids.Then there is Benny, more easygoing than Li'l Ze who eventually tries to escape the violence, but the violence catches up to him.There is Knockout Ned, who tries to do good initially. But after Li'l Ze abuses and kills people close to him, he swears on revenge. Slowly he is seduced by violence and starts breaking his own rule not to harm innocent people. He is killed by the child of one of his victims.Finally, there is Rocket. He tries to stay away from the violence as much as possible. Also he flirts with violence, but his conscience wins every time. With a great deal of luck, he is finally successful in breaking away of the violence.After seeing this movie you may ask yourself: what causes evil and violence? Are some people born evil? This seems to be the case with Li'l Ze. Do people turn evil because of the circumstances, like Knockout Ned? Does poverty lead to violence? It does seem like one need a lot of luck to break away from violence in a place like this.This is truly a great movie that no one will easily forgot. The violence, often by young children, is quite disturbing. One of the best movies I ever saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Paris,France after having met Katia Lund in 2006,it was difficult for me to fathom that this soft spoken charming lady has made a very violent film depicting the rise of violence in Brazilian slums.She told the audience that it is quite normal for Brazilians to live with violence as they have adjusted themselves to it.This is a very serious statement which in some way reflects the honesty on the part of Brazilian filmmakers. They are showing what is happening in their society and by doing so there are being truthful.The violence of City of God is realistic and no makeup has been done to it.The three key elements of the film: melodrama,violence and music compliment each other well.This film also has a procession like quality to it.It is as if the audience is watching some sort of procession going on and willy-nilly,they also decide to be a part of the crowd.On watching this film,I had the impression of a fun activity happening before me. May be others will experience that too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw City of god two days ago on the national TV. I was shocked. For me it's more than massacre, that's what I read on a Hungarian site. The critic also said that poverty and violence are cheap export merchandise. It's good fuel for any film and keeps you in your seat. I can't argue with that. Definitely it kept me in my seat, but not only because it's extremely violent. The most important for me is atmosphere. And Cidade de Deus really has it. Pulls you in, and won't let go. I felt the choking air full of dust in the favella. The story is fast, the characters are great. Real? I don't think so. But it gives you a strong feeling, an impression about misery and you think: that's like when god leaves his children alone. If you watch closely you can find humor and irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people say this is a fantastic film for its striking visual achievements, however I personally feel that they alone would never carry a film, especially a film as epic and grand as this. Of course, every time you see Lil' Ze's rampages or Rocket caught in the middle of the shootout in the streets (literally) it startles you with its sense of grandeur and bravado, but really the achievement is carrying such a brilliant story, where the hero does not actually do much but look on and try to survive. Fernando Meirelles pushes the boat out and, in fact, you get surprised in your own personal emotional involvement with the story. Just for example, the scene where a young boy has to choose between being shot in the hand or the foot is particularly poignant. I certainly would recommend it any discerning film lover or, in fact, anybody looking for an emotional roller-coaster. Take a deep breath and put the DVD on, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With pseudo elements of The Godfather, this motion picture is one of those movies that will hold on to you from beginning to end. In this tale of poverty, corruption, and death in the seedy underworld of one of the most beautiful countries on earth: Brazil. This tale is of a young man by the name of Rocket, and as the narrator he is reluctant to tell you every bit of this story. Tracing from his days as a young boy in the sixties to his days as a freelance photographer in the disco era of the 1970's all in the City Of God. But do not let the name fool you because in the City Of God you only find devils and demons. The story follows the tales of the most notorious gangsters, hoodlums, and family all somehow linked to each other. Any fans of the Drama Genre would enjoy this cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the front cover of the DVD, Roger Ebert proclaims City of God is: One of the Best Films You'll Ever See! I don't agree with some of his reviews but man, was he right on this one! It blew me away! It is an amazing true story of a young Brazilian man living in the slums of the City of God and who dreams of becoming a photographer. The camera not only keeps him in the slums but also serves as a way out. The story is told through his eyes and in the process we're introduced to some of the most interesting and complex heroes and villains to ever appear on screen. It is a tour-de-force production that has merit in many areas. From the vast array of amateur actors who did a splendid job realizing each character with raw energy to the ultra-kinetic editing and camera movement. This type of frantic editing actually contributed greatly to the effectiveness of the film. Despite some dark and even disturbing moments, director Fernando Meirelles brilliantly puts it all together. It's fast-paced, realistic, and superbly written. Without any doubt, City of God is one of the greatest foreign films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is very well put together and it offers viewers (especially for international audience) a close look to the daily challenges that favela residents (mostly displaced people) have to face outside of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The storyline revolves around 2 main characters growing up in the 60's and 70's in favela (the Brazilian equivalent of a shanty town, which are generally found on the edge of the city) and how one becomes a professional photographer and the other one becomes the most infamous drug dealer.The documentary "News From A Personal War" comes with the DVD of the movie and it definitely worths the time to see. It shows us perspectives or insights from the residents, the policemen, the prisoners, the young gang members and gang leaders how the drugs and guns are part of an on-going fighting between different groups of gangs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture this: You are slowly walking towards a boy no more than 10 years of age ? someone you have played soccer games with and joked around with. The boy reaches down with his hand, brings a gun back up, and pumps you full of bullets. In the multiple Academy Award nominee City of God, not only does this happen, but it does not even come as a surprise. This Brazilian epic takes the iconic movies of the '90s and creates an intense blend that utilizes the fractured structure from Pulp Fiction, the hard-hitting style of Requiem for a Dream, and the ambitious storytelling of Goodfellas. The oddity here is not that director Fernando Meirelles mixes parts from these films together, but rather that in doing so, he has created a modern masterpiece that will surely be remembered as one of the defining films for the millennium decade. Taking place during the 1960s and into the 1970s, City of God is set in the Brazilian city of the same name. Located close to Rio de Janeiro, the two places could not be more different. Rio de Janeiro, virtually a tropical paradise, contrasts starkly with the seedy slums of the City of God. The structure of the film is almost like a tangled skein ? following a loosely chronological order, the movie often doubles back on itself to retell a story from a different perspective and it often takes detours to tell stories of the varied and fascinating individuals in the city. The result is a sprawling tour-de-force with a massive cast of characters ? some who triumph over their enemies but more who fail. The film makes use of one of its many characters as the narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), but he is not so much the protagonist as he is a center for all the stories to meet. As an aspiring photographer that is always on the sidelines, he is the perfect character to take the audience on the journey through the decades. In fact, the main character of City of God is arguably not a person but rather the city itself, portrayed as cruel, relentless, and endlessly bloodthirsty. The closest thing the film has to a main character is Li'l Zé, the brutal and power-hungry man who quickly rises through the ranks (generally by shooting down the competition) to become the czar of the drug underworld. Brilliantly portrayed with wild abandon by Leandro Firmino, Li'l Zé's unpredictable and chaotic nature is counterbalanced by his closest friend, Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), who is like the yang to Li'l Zé's ying. Less temperamental and more relaxed, Benny is considered the coolest gangster alive by residents of the city and can save the lives of many people with a word to Li'l Zé. Stylistically, the film exhausts just about every film-making trick one can think of on the spot: split-screen (used sparsely but effectively); 360-degree camera turns; slam cuts; slow-motion shots ? all of these and many more are present in the film. In one instance, the absence of sound during a key scene helps to heighten the impact. In another, a flashing strobe light enhances the haunting quality and atmosphere of the empty nightclub to a startlingly memorable result. City of God is most successful however not because of its stylistic choices, or its many interesting characters, or its score (which is also impressive). All of these contribute to the making of a great film, but what elevates City of God to the level of artistry that only a handful of films such as Schindler's List and The Shawshank Redemption achieve is its uncompromising screenplay. Not only is the structure brilliantly conceived and not only are the characters extraordinary well developed, but the screenplay is also able to bring in a sense of the never-ending and continuous cycles of war without ever trying to moralize. Simply put, the film is a window into a world, not a path, and it simply views rather than changes. In this way, what the audience sees in that small window shakes them to the core without any feelings of manipulation whatsoever. In a film in which despair and brutality are so common, the irony of the title is not lost. City of God is a masterpiece in every sense of the word ? a stunning and merciless film that portrays the era, the people, and the sense of hopelessness honestly and without compromise. I would not have it any other way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i was recommended this movie, i didn't know that i was about to witness a masterpiece. Every scene fit in the puzzle, every mystery unraveled as the movie progressed. And i could not find any incoherence, such was the perfection of the director. The portrayal of Lil Dice was chilling to say the least. The fact that a child at such a young age chose a life of crime and enjoyed murders the most was something that reminded me of The Interpreter and sent a shiver down my spine. Especially the scene where he kills the people in the motel and laughs off after that. The deep rooted corruption increases my disgust for all such acts. And despite the fact that i would like the conditions in the City of God to become better, the final scene made me sad that everything would be repeated again. And that gives me little hope. Nevertheless, everything in this movie deserved a 10/10 and i doubt if a movie of the same genre can be made better than this.</fullReview>

And the story is so well told you are not even sure who is the bad guy or who is the good guy. But in the end, everyone is the bad guy.This movie shows you the horror of the world we live in now. Kids walking the streets with guns in their hands. People killing people for no reason.The camera shots and editing is brilliant. The atmosphere is perfect with each scenes. The acting is great. The gun fight scenes are perfect. It is so perfect that it looks like it is taken from a real life shootout. It will put you on the edge of your seat. It is truly one of the best film of the year. It's hard to find such movies nowadays. It is hard to find a movie that makes you feel like you are in the movie nowadays. Many film tried that and most of them failed. But this movie has done a magnificent job at it.This is a MUST see for all movie lovers. Hate it or love it, you still have to watch this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Truly masterful film. I caught it on TV last week and was awestruck. The cinematography was unique and strangely fitting considering the gritty nature of the movie. Most directors would have chosen to shoot the film on 16mm to make it as 'real' looking as possible, but Meirelles and Lund have taken a risk and reaped the rewards. I was amazed to find out that the runts were not actors but genuine street kids. The characters of Benny and Lil'Ze were particularly well drawn, two best friends composing a yin/yang relationship which keeps the ghetto in order.Anyway, this film is a modern classic, no movie-lover's collection is complete without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles portrait of gang life, 'City of God', has been likened to Martin Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', but it's far more visceral, and less stylised, than that film, and underpinned by a portrait of the appalling poverty of the Brazillian slums. Fast-paced, superbly acted, uncompromising and without a whiff of glamour, it's a movie that re-invents the tired old gangster genre by actually telling it as it is, and not as the clichés tell us to expect, and a serious piece of social and political history on the side. This is a very fine film, one in which shreds of tattered humanity gleam through the cracks of the doors of hell.</fullReview>

I was waiting at tower at midnight the night that it came out and I bought two copies (one to lend out and one to keep). The documentary that came with the movie was also great "News from a personal war". I can't believe that the director followed this up with "the constant gardener", which I thought sucked in comparison. It was a decent movie, but next to City Of God, it failed to even compare. Brutal reality brilliantly shot and acted would probably be the best way to describe this movie. The Soundrack is also incredible. I was never aware of the situation in Brazil with the crime and corruption until viewing this film. This flick was a powerful way to get that message out to the American and international public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God was made to be remembered, it was made to rivet its audience with every frame, it was made to evoke all emotions, and it was made to be an epic. It succeeds in all of these areas, because it avoids any point where there could be a dull moment. Most films allow gaps in pace with the confidence that they can be made up for with other fantastic points. City of God has you so wound up in it that it leaves you wanting more.It's made in the vein of Scorsese's crime dramas, with lots of jump-cutting, a jukebox soundtrack, flashy camera and editing styles, wildly entertaining yet ardently realistic violence, and a large amount of characters that are all strangely balanced, some fading in and out and showing up at surprising times when we've forgotten all about them, some driving the story. The film was revered by scores of critics, but also panned by many of them, surprisingly, for its tinsel style and flashy visuals. I say that it's ridiculous to look down your nose at such a grandiose and spectacular film such as City of God for what is the focal point of the art of film. Films are initially something to look at. They're designed for you like what you see.City of God is not only one of the finest films to come out recently. It's a milestone. More movies should be made with the same ambitions and goals from their makers as this one. Then, maybe we'd have some better ones out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

Cidade de Deus takes us to a reality we try to hide from our minds, a place where drugs, murders, betrayals and so on are common, a place where the good and evil is distinguished only in the minds of each ones as there are nearly no rules. It was amazingly performed, the director made a uber masterpiece. don't take attention to those guys who said this was a bad movie... as a movie addict and as a student of this I assure you... this is absolutely AWESOME!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God would have to be one of the most important films that has come out of this current decade. It is visually stunning and the acting is some the best acting to come out of non-actors. The film is in the mold of Goodfellas, just a chronicle of crime from youth to adulthood.The film begins with a symbolic chicken hunt and a gang come across the young photographer, Rocket and his friend. They tell him to catch the chicken but the police come and then the flashback begins. It takes you to when the City of God was first built in the 60's and shows the first gang, The Tender Trio, a gang consisting of three teens including Rocket's older brother. You also meet the future criminals in the making Li'l Dice and Benny. Then is moves to the 70's when Rocket is a teen and starts to become interested in photography. At the same time Li'l Dice (Now Li'l Ze) starts to take over the all the gangs in the City of God with Benny. Their gang becomes big and they are at peace with rival Carrot's gang. Ironically this causes peace in the gangland until the sensational scene at a dance party where Benny is accidentally shot by one of Carrot's man. This sends the slum into an all out war and now Rocket wants out of the City and tries to make ends meet until a brush with Ze when he wants a photo of his gang to show the media not to mess with him, that this war is not about Carrot and his vengeance-seeking rival Knockout Ned. The movie continues with the war until its stunning climax of twists and it shock ending show that City will only get worse and worse.The movie pleads to the viewer that even if the the people who started the violence are now gone, the descendants will continue it. Rocket can only have one explanation for this and he compares the whole situation to Vietnam, young men die each day but more sign up to join. It tells the viewer that violence will get you nowhere and you should take the right path to success, like what Rocket did. It is an outstanding film that is filled with color, fast action, interesting plot, brilliant acting, characters than will become part of movie history and shows the wonderful culture of the area. City of God is a must. You have to see this movie before you die!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Brazil in the 1960's there was a place called the City of God. In the movie the Trio robs motels and gas trucks for something to do and a quick way to make some cash. Younger kids watch them because they want to be apart of the Trio but the older kids wouldn't let them. Lil Ze went in and killed everybody in there thus getting his taste of the bad seed. In the 1970's, Lil Ze has grown up and took over his former comrades and now he owns the city. He causes violence and fear as he wipes out rival gangs without mercy. His best friend Bene is the only one to keep him on the good side of sanity. Rocket has grown up in the same settings but has taking a different route. His goal in life and dream is to take pictures and become a big photographer. He seems to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time though. Well in the 1980 there is still the continuing battle that is control and affecting the City of God. From my study in Latin American History, Brazil is the largest country in Latin America. It was one of the Portugal colonies sugar was one of the most important crops in the country. This country was declared independent from Portugal in 1822. "Brazil's problems -- poverty, crime, environmental recklessness -- can seem larger than life, too. Although it is one of the industrial powerhouses of South America, Brazil has trouble feeding its entire people. And deforestation of the Amazon basin proceeds at an ominous rate. But in fits and starts, the country is taking on some of its seemingly insoluble problems. Most noticeably, improvement is being made in the dangerous crime situation in Rio." This is the modern day report from a well know International travel agency about some of Brazil's problem's within the country. This movie in my opinion was rather accurate and ties in directly into the history of modern times in Brazil. It gives a real life visual to the actually life of some Brazilian natives. In contrast gives almost an unrealistic feeling about the whole city and everyday life of Brazil so with these to combine you get a distinct feeling of curiosity and wonder from the film. In my opinion if there would have been a brief introduction about the times in a narrative tone it would have help with the suspense of the movie? The movie was enjoyable to watch on the fact that the plot was good and the character where reliable and the quantity of scenes throughout the movie. Yes good for entertainment and great for education and addressee to the problems in Brazil. I rate this Movie 8 and half star on a (1-10) scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Co-Directors Fernado Meirelles and Kátia Lund have crafted a stylish and engrossing film about the exploits of children in the poverty stricken ghettos of Rio de Janeiro. The story centers around the story of two young men, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who has taken the path of becoming a newspaper photographer and the psychotic Li'l Zé (Leandro Firmino) who rises to the head of the drug trade in the City of God.While the story is certainly well written and engrossing, what really stands out in this film is the style with which it is told. It was quite simply a joy to watch. Most directors would give anything to be able to tell a story with the kind of style that Meirelles and Lund exhibit here. It is easily one of the best movies of the year, period. Not one of the best American movies, not one of the best foreign films, but simply one of the best of the year, no matter its origin.When watching this film one of the first things I thought was that the director(s) will be making films in America soon. Sure enough Meirelles is now directing a movie starring Ralph Feinnes. Since Lund is not included on this project it will be interesting to see just how much of the style of City of God came from Meirelles and how much came from Lund. We should have the answer to that question once The Constant Gardner comes out. Lund is now working on a short film that will be included in the anthology All the Invisible Children. After having viewed both these films, we should have the answer to just how much of the visual style of Children of God came from Meirelles and how much came from Lund. I know I will definitely be checking out both as soon as I can. Definitely two hours very well spent! ? Deanna Carmichael (www.2-hours.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of gangsta movies anyway, i thought that i would find this film enjoyable, expecting typical conventions like Blood and Gore, conflicting gangs, Crime, and a slick super-stylish main character. However this film actually follows a true story, and the main character, telling the story and managing to see all the different perspectives, a photographer. The movies has several story lines linking together explaining how it ended in the way it did. The movie follows a non-linear storyline going backwards and forwards in time, Rocket's life from being a child to his age in the story is explained in some detail. This movie is more than a gangsta movie, it is the story of someone's life in the slums and the lengths that people went to to get money. A must see,although it is in subtitles you quickly get used to reading them and stop even noticing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have an opportunity to see Cidade de Deus in the theater, but even seeing it on my 20" TV screen, there was NEVER a moment that I felt like I was watching a film. Like nothing before it or since, I was mesmerized, enthralled, and ultimately transported to another world.There are plenty of excellent reviews about Cidade de Deus on IMDb... and they'll all still be here when you're done watching the film. If you haven't seen it yet, I encourage you to stop reading, go rent it, and watch it immediately! You'll need a break between your first and second screenings, and these user comments make an excellent intermission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, not only was I stunned at the events that took place, but struck by a much more superficial thought. People like editors and cinematographers don't get enough credit. People always laud the director for his great accomplishments, but the average person doesn't realize how much of what they call direction is actually edition and cinematography, two things this movie is near perfect in. The shots are so perfectly composed and angled. They put you in a perfect perspective from which to view the movie, be it the eyes of the narrator or some omnicient bystander between a killer and his victim in an alleyway. The editing takes advantage of every moment, strobing during a tense fight or slowing the film just a bit, pausing movement and panning around so that you can see an entire scene. The control of situation is excellent. While much of that is owed to direction, I think that the cinematography and editing, aside from the great writing, acting and content, are what makes this movie for me. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it is based on a true story a lot of the elements are truthful. This amazing film gives you an insight into the slums of Rio De Jineiro. This was my first movie I have seen with subtitles all the way through, however after 5 minutes I forgot about it as I was lost in the power of the movie. Although the film is graphic in many ways the movie has a comical side to it that adds another dimension to the picture. The film has an excellent storyline with great acting and intense power. This is a must see for anybody but if you like powerful films such as Godfather and Fight Club this is just your sort of film. It is just another example of the fact you can make an astonishing film with a low budget and unproven actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ravaging and compelling insight into Rio's mean streets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles has orchestrated a fascinating piece of movie making to establish not only himself as a fine director, but also to establish a film that surely deserves its place among the best of its kind. The story and characters seem to revel in the distinct Brazilian surroundings and every character relishes their roles; Leandro Firmino flourishes as Li'l Zé, as he shows a menacing and devilish streak to his psychotic character. Alexandre Rodrigues (Rocket) tells the story how it is and before we know it the sun is scorching down on us while gunfights of gang warfare smother the streets in broad daylight. Violence is present only when necessary, and when it surfaces it is quite extreme. Don't let this deter you from viewing this flawless film - even if you happen to feel uncomfortable at the sight of blood - because the film has quality in abundance; the camera work vividly captures the intensity of the script, and the raw dialect of Portuguese adds an extra punch (if you speak the language). The story revolves around a young man whom dreams of becoming a photographer. His struggle to contend with everyday violence - which seems to be a recurring theme throughout the film - sets up a tense and intriguing atmosphere. We are brought to the streets so we have an idea of how the drug situation works and what it takes for gangs to protect their business. With a beautiful view of a landscape,sadly bearing the vast and derelict Favalas, we are intentionally made to explore just how poverty stricken these people are. This film defines just about every emotion possible and with fluid skill. I don't need to recommend this film as you have probably seen it advertised everywhere, but I will say don't avoid it because you would certainly be missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cinema Ahead Of Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cidade De Deus is an excellent 'Docudrama' on the lives of the victimised and self victimising street children in the City of God ? Rio De Janeiro.The screenplay is unique, despite the rapid shifts between the past and the present, and the stories of so many characters told together; it does not leave you confused to stop and think. Everything falls into place so well, that you can immediately catch up with the 'exceedingly fast pace' of the film.The script doesn't spend much time establishing facts or characters, although it gives glimpses of each character's life to establish them. Yet, the entire procedure is not at all contrived. It simply flows. But, the pace of the movie is a little fast keeping in mind even today's cinema. "Cidade de Deus is probably five years ahead of its time".The performances are so naturalistic that nobody is 'acting', despite the profound intensity of so many exacting scenes. Small children have acted so realistically, it makes you believe that you are actually watching a documentary shot on the streets. One scene I wish to highlight is the scene in which Ze shoots a small boy in his foot and the way the boy cries. That was EXCELLENT! Director Fernando Meirelles simply proclaims to the universe his directorial prowess.The drug use and the shootings' scenes are very realistically executed. The sound department has done a commendable job to embellish the visuals.The cinematography is exquisitely executed giving a feel of a European location with regards to the light and density of colours. Most of the day scenes have been shot during the Golden Hours to avoid the harshness of midday sunlight. They have very intelligently tried to avoid exposing shadows on the ground wherever possible.But, some shots are taken with so many camera jerks (for cinematic effect), that it tends to irritate the eye at a point. This is something I want to emphatically mention: Cinematography is the showcase of a film. Bad costumes, bad locations, bad acting can often be cleverly manipulated by using good angles and dramatic lighting. But, such jerky camera work actually creates even more disturbing visuals in an already disturbing subject/movie. It does add to the effect, but it also gets confusing at times; more so, irritating. I do not advocate the use of traditional film making with fixed camera angles and trolley movements, but there has to be some consideration for the viewer, for whom the movie is being made.All in all, it is almost a modern day classic. The Director, Actors, DP, Sound Department, Editor, all deserve a standing ovation, but it is the Script that Rules!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believable and welcome South American life-in-the-ghetto diary, but ultimately too character cluttered, repeating and limited.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The violent, and often shambolic, life and times of the Rio de Janeiro favela (or slum) told from the point of view of two contrasting former schoolboy friends. Filmed in the modern "shaky hand-held camera" fashion to give it a documentary look-and-feel. (Something we will return to later.) The great problem with the English speaking mass cinema audience is that they rarely go anywhere abroad outside of tourist traps and have little interest in the Third World. Well outside of outrageous disasters - whether man-made or natural - which quickly slip from our TV screens or newspapers within days of their conclusion.Therefore when cinema takes a stroll down these new avenues it comes as a complete surprise to the virgin audience who get the full head trip. So Brazil is not all long beaches, endless samba beat and sexy girls in dental floss thongs? Well I didn't know that! Shock! Horror! Something must be done!(IMDb always seems to give a bonus mark for a new and different location - Cidade de Deus being only the latest recipient.)For most this product will be the only education about the Brazilian favela (slum) that they will ever get - but at least it is a believable portrait. Nevertheless it is not the last word on the subject and covers only limited ground. Indeed it is a classic example of a film that starts well - loses its way in the middle section - before it arrives at the only climax (and closing impression) which is conceivable. A bit more social context about Brazilian class society would have been welcome - but maybe the budget didn't run to it. Not travelling back in time. This film's idea of background detail is a lone period car! We needed the "other Brazil" - but, baring a few voice-over references all we get is a few token scenes in a supermarket or in a newspaper office.(The media types are shown as friendly, warm and caring in perfect contrast to the police who are shown as being totally corrupt. Almost on a parallel to the gangsters. I wonder which camp the writer comes from?) This film has been compared to Goodfellers, and I can see why, but it isn't really in its league. If anything it is a home movie version of the Scorsese classic and needs constant voice-over and subtitles in order for it to make sense. Even with it I was lost several times, but that may have been trying to keep track of too many characters that looked - because of the passing of time - nothing like they did when first introduced!The plot is curiously male orientated when sex is not involved. Do these gangsters not have mothers, sisters, social workers, teachers or sensible relatives? The types that crop up in 40's Warner Brothers gangster pictures to give balance to the criminals and their life views. Overall the script spends too long in the gang hut with the venom-spitting hoods who alternate only between loading weapons and smoking dope. There is no real conventional acting in this movie, there is no need for it. Ducking, diving, shooting guns and looking scared is not that hard. Yes it convinces, but stupid/reckless/desperate Third World people are hard to pin down, how can you say anything is wrong? They march to a different drum.Here leadership seems awarded for recklessness as much as brains, but they have nowhere to go and little to say. Why should they? They have no education. There is only one business (drugs) and there is only one punishment for those that go against the interests of that business.(Once you establish life is cheap and taken on a whim, you don't need to go there again unless it is essential or part of the grand climax.)I am not all that fond of hand-held camera work. It allows you run around and this only results in lots of scenes of people running around. This establishes it as a real location, but doesn't really add any sense of composure. There are times when I feel I was running with the gang as part of it - while I really wanted to be a cold and distant condemning witness. Yes there is lots of questions, quibbles and short comings, but it is a powerful and thought provoking film. But it rather suffers from the Holocaust syndrome: It is hard to criticise the film without seeming to attack the honourable subject. Maybe director Fernando Meirelles has something - he certainly includes some masterful scenes here - but the limited characters overstay their welcome. I wouldn't want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing story further enhanced by the fact that it happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first milestone at IMDb occurs (50th review) with this amazing movie. The plot of City of God revolves around Rocket (an aspiring photographer) as he grows up in the slums of Rio De Janeiro and the events that occur there. The cinematography is simply amazing, from the various "action shots", to the way the story is broken up into anachronous mini stories. It is also amazing how intertwined all the stories are. You get an idea of the cinematography from the opening scene where a chicken escapes from a restaurant and a whole gang of people go chasing after it. The scene is comical at first and then turns serious very quickly as the chicken ends up in front of Rocket with a gang of approximately 30 members armed with guns on one side and the police on the other side (Rocket and the chicken caught in the middle). This movie is very intense, but feels realistic. The violence does not seem over the top but indicative of a plausible situation. The movie is also wrought with social critique : from the drugs use, to the crime (murder,theft), to the poverty and the widespread corruption of the slums in Brazil (and the similarity to slums everywhere). There are similarities to other movies including Scarface (1983), Boyz in the Hood and Menace II Society. This movie seems more gritty, more real than those movies. This might be due to the fact that those movies dealt with adults and young adults (16-35 year old), while this movie deals primarily with children. The ending is a mixed bag of optimism and pessimism (good things do happen, but also history does repeat itself). This movie MUST be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God" is clearly one of the most aesthetically complex and viscerally charged motion pictures ever made. There are many scenes here for students of film to take great joy in simply in terms of aesthetics. The cinematography, editing, and pacing is inventive, mind-blowing and lovingly inspired by the best work of Scorsese. I could go on and on about the opening "chicken run" sequence, "Shaggy's" death scene, the disco shoot-out, or any number of other "WOW" scenes of pure cinematic adrenaline.It's this kind of movie magic that breathes life into the myth of the "greatest film of all time."But be warned, as much as this film can be "enjoyed", it is clearly far from the myth it jolts to life with its "look, mom, no hands" style of film-making. It's also highly disturbing, more so than anything Scorsese has done. One sequence involving a child who couldn't be older than ten having to shoot another child who looks to be half his age as some sort of gang initiation is so slickly done I felt like I was watching a snuff film. Based on a true story about Brazilian slum dwellers and the crime waves overtaking the town, "City of God" is an extremely hard pill to swallow as it wallows in violence, offers up a hearty dose of moral ambiguity, an almost pornographic take on the criminals it depicts, and leaves the viewer with no real solution or any sign of hope that this cycle can ever conceivably come to an end. The film seems to be saying that the only way to over-come such poverty and crime is to document it (witness our supposed hero who becomes a photographer). With its ultra-slick and highly addictive presentation, the film dupes unsuspecting viewers into witnessing all the depravity as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The City of God is a very good film about a God-forsaken place!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film recounts the story of a young Brazilian boy named Rocket who grows up in and around the 'City of God'. We follow his life, from a very young age though adulthood, as he narrates all the crazy adventures of his life and describes all the various characters he encounters along the way. His life is a tough one, filled with horrific violence, incessant theft and rampant drug abuse, which seems commonplace in his world. More than anything, this is a story of survival in a vicious community that chews people up and only spits them out if they are lucky. This existence is a vicious circle that seem to inevitably lead to short life or a life spent in jail or absolute poverty. The only way out seems to be to risk your life in the drug trade where things become assuredly more dangerous. Avoiding trouble completely is a very tricky accomplishment and we watch as Rocket does his best to make it in this God-forsaken world. But will he make it without giving in to the temptations of a criminal life? After all, honesty doesn't pay in the 'City of God'. The film is marvelously directed and edited. There is a kinetic feel that rivals Scorsese's work in 'Goodfellas'. That the material is also similar is not surprising. This film was clearly inspired by the 1990 gangster epic. 'City of God' definitely deserved its Oscar nominations. I am clearly recommending the film despite the brutality and the overwhelming sense of despair that the film conveys. I usually don't like films that refuse to feature even a glimmer of hope, but this film avoids that pitfall in the final twenty minutes. I won't reveal what happens, but the film offers a sliver of hope without selling out the reality and tone of the earlier scenes. Based on true events, 'City of God' is a visceral and shocking peek into a living hell that, by all accounts, still exists to this day. Poverty will always make crime a viable option... a natural human instinct. This film highlights that fact with brilliant direction and Oscar worthy editing. I am not sure anyone would want to watch this film multiple times, it's just not that kind of movie. But I strongly suggest you seek it out on DVD if you missed the limited theatrical run.</fullReview>

At first, I was a bit peeved at all the shots but realized it was a movie of parallelism. All those dark shots reflected what life was in Brazil for these boys, how dark it is for them, like there was no way out and that other people did not see them or refused to make an effort to see them and their situation. Fernando Meirelles is a genius. The way he directed all those shots, it tells me to view reality as it is, and not as it should be. It's so good, I just want to cry.

		<fullReview>The hype surrounding City of God has become enormous. It has obtained rave reviews here in America. Especially among the college professors and students that I frequently converse with. Unfortunately, this movie did not live up to the hopes I had for it. Having already seen "Harder They Come" and "All the Forgotten Ones," I assumed that this film was garnering so much praise because of a message that would go above what those other films portrayed. The cover of the DVD even has a quote mentioning how this would change my life. It did not. I personally feel both of the other films just mentioned did what "City of God" does, and with more originality. This film takes a lot of modern movie concepts, especially those made famous by Guy Ritchie, such as interweaving plots and jumping to different points of time as the film progresses. I highly recommend seeing those other two films before this one, and it should change how impressive it really seems.</fullReview>

Is there anyone who remembers that the story of one, only one, victimized character is more powerful than watching millions of people slaughtered.It was like watching 2,000 St. Valentines Day massacres in 2 hours. Horrific but not touching. We need to care. This film had too many stories. Tried to link Vietnam with corporate greed and the eternal reach for money and power. This could have been a brilliant film. Instead it was a two martini film (you had to wind down) but one which left even the photographer survivor, suspect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 Things I love About City of God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. Where to start? It's such a stunning, powerful and provocative film, to try and summarise it in 10 points is a little silly. And I'll probably still struggle. Let's start with the visuals. It's a real credit to Fernando Meireilles that he manages to make each new confrontation fresh and exciting. The editing, cutting and lighting all contributes to a visceral, involving experience. This isn't something I normally notice in a film, but as Dantes inferred, you can't help but notice it in City of God. But what is particularly noticeable, is that it doesn't lose passion or heart amongst the fancy visuals.2. City of God is a film that really invests in its characters. It treats the audience with respect, so that instead of shallow, two dimensional characters we have a morally complex menagerie of different people, each with a cool nickname, and each with a believable, sympathetic character arc. My favourite: Benny.3. Benny ? he's the coolest hood in the city.4. City is structured very episodically, and each section has a name to it. From this we can get a real sense of what life in the favela is like, but also we get a wide, all encompassing view of the slum. Yet somehow, despite the very defined sections, it never loses it's breakneck pace, and all the different fragments flow as one film.5. The fact that such a bleak, powerful story is interspersed with some genuinely funny comic moments is a marvel. It's great to see Rocket's attempt to break into the crime world, but failing because all the people he meets are too cool.6. It's such a heartbreaking story. The shocking final revelation before the credits roll, the sadness of seeing kids involved in acts of horrendous violence. It's not exactly something to love, but it's masterfully handled.7. Alice Braga.8. The performances are all stunning. Alexandre Domingues, in the central role, is immensely likable (as one of the few likable characters on show, that is). Seu Jorge (who I love even more since The Escapist) is brilliant as Knockout Ned, the icon of the resistance. I mentioned earlier that all of the characters are brilliantly created, and this is mainly down to the sterling performances that are too many to mention. But Lil Zé is possibly the strongest performance of the film. Leandro Firmino is unforgettable as the tormented yet powerful gang leader Lil Zé. He is a villain to remember.9. The section entitled Benny's farewell. It is one of the greatest scenes in cinema. Ever. It's just mind blowing. Particularly the strobe lighting. It's just magnificent.10. I couldn't stop thinking about Cidade de Deus a whole day after I stopped watching it, it's that effective. If you are one of the few people that haven't seen it, watch it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie FLOORED me! Without a doubt one of the greatest films ever. I will guarantee even Spielberg and Scorsese completely flipped out when they seen this.I cannot believe this was not nominated for best picture. This was easily the best film of the year. LOTR: Return of the King won that year and I can understand finally giving those movies their due, but to have Lost in Translation considered the second best movie that year (which I do adore) . . . but Translation is a script that easily could have been written in 2 days and filmed in 3. City of God is a towering achievement. What an unbelievable script with perfect casting and where they found all these actors (including the runts) and made everything feel so real - and like you were right there . . . gritty yet with beautiful cinematography.In this, there are characters you will love to hate (Li'l Ze), Characters you will admire (Rocket and Benny), and characters you will root for (Knockout Ned).City of God is just like the Middle East. You can always take out one leader but there is always someone from the generation younger waiting to step in and do the same . . . they learn it all from seeing everything around them. There will always be chickens (good metaphor used in film) and runts running around to catch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my PERSONAL top ten movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movies is absolutely AMAZING, and for the most part holds up to the hype that surrounds it. I won't get into the story as a few hundred people have already described the gist of the story, but I'll tell you what makes it so good. First the subject matter is important and timely. This movie brings attention to the rampant crime and homelessness in Brazil, especially amongst young children. All the characters are interesting but the editing and camera angles are amongst the best I have ever seen, definitely in my top 5 best edited movies. Hell, you even get the perspective of a chicken being chased by a dozen trigger-happy gangsters! At first your bombarded with scenes from different time-lines, but in the end it all comes to fruition and is explained in an ingenious manner. Everybody pretty much is a gangster in this film (even kids) leaving no one to empathize with, so you have to empathize with their SITUATION, meaning that you feel empathy for EVERYONE involved because all the characters seemed to have been abused and are dirt-poor, living in a barrio in which you have to kill and rob to survive. There is one scene in which a child is coerced into making a choice of killing one of two OTHER children about his age as an initiation. The younger of the two victims actually pees his pants and starts crying like the child he should be acting like. Mind you, this now victim had earlier been stealing and beating other victims himself, but when faced with death reverted back to a child-like state. Mind you, him AND his buddy have both been shot in the foot as punishment for all their stealing. The scene is so realistic that you almost think it's real. And the acting? Absolutely Phenomenal acting from EVERYBODY, especially the youngest children. That's saying a lot because almost everybody in the film ARE actually from the Barrio, with no formal acting experience whatsoever. In other words after filming these kids went back to the ghetto. After seeing this movie I'm positive Hollywood actors make too much money for the crap they put out and call a movie. Anyway, in no way does this film glamorize violence or the gangs as almost anyone involved in the gangster lifestyle pretty much meets a violent demise at the end. This movie in no way tries to preach or even offer a solution for the poverty and violence in Brazil, it's just a snapshot of a day in the life of the barrios and slums of Brazil, the cold hard truth of a region that basks in the sun by day only to hide from the overwhelming violence by night. This film is as important and telling to Brazil as Joint Security Area is to the Korean peninsula. A must see by any standard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I've finally seen the much hyped City of God, and while it is not a masterpiece, it is an exciting and well directed film.The story is very unoriginal, "the rise and fall of a criminal" may possibly be the most clichéd plot in movie history, right after "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back". Nevertheless it's done with panache in COG. The slums of Rio lends the film a faux originality; it seems fresh because of the exoticness of the locale, but the same plot set in the slums of Harlem would not have garnered nearly as much fanfare as this film receives. also, the gangstas are just children. this is what makes the film so powerful: its yawnworthy to see a grown man shoot another grown man, but a young boy shooting another young boy is immensely disturbing. Do these elements make a masterpiece? not for me they don't.The plot revolved too much around violence i think. yes, I'm sure life in the slums does revolve around violence, but that doesn't mean a movie where we just witness violent act after violent act is brilliant. it got a little boring after a while, as we wait for the inevitable fall of Little Ze, as he just kills and rapes and snorts coke and makes money for about 90 minutes. The brilliance of the direction kept the interest there for me though. Fernando Meirelles is an assured confident director: some of the shots in COG are pure bravado ie. they look cool as hell. I cant wait to see his next film "The Constant Gardener".So yeah, City of God is good, perhaps great, but no masterpiece. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Foreign and Gangster film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a powerful movie to watch. I've never seen anything like it. It seemingly takes from Goodfellas in terms of narration, Quentin Tarantino style of movie going on how he goes back and forth with some things, and Scarface in terms of brutality but it's a movie all it's own. Two people in the same city share a story with one that follows a path of crime and another who wants to escape it and it's very much a true story in Brazil spanning the 60's to the 80's. The thing that sticks with me is that it tells a story straight and up front and shows you what went on and still goes on. The shock is from how cold the movie may seem but in reality all it does is show the story straight up and front. It sends a message loud and clear through drugs flowing in the city to a war in which 9 year old kids hold guns to kill and be respected and all of this is put together through stories from all around that area that make up an excellent movie.</fullReview>

Its stylish, sharp, and hard hitting telling a story of what life is like in one of the world's most notorious slums. It reminds me of 'Goodfellas' in many ways, only it's a whole lot better. Fernando Meirelles has an awesome style, his directing is fast paced and stylish from beginning to end I especially love the way he skips back and forth through time in order to tell every aspect of the story. It is a very stylish film but it also has a heart, it has a story to tell, a story worth watching. 'City of God' is unlike any film I have ever seen, it is so rich is visual beauty, and is flooded with bold originality. You will struggle to find any better, it's a one of a kind movie, that doesn't cease to impress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear brothers and sisters:First: "City of God" isn't one "favela" - they are even worst. "Cidade de Deus", as a matter of fact, is homemade project built by Rio's State officer in the middle of 60's, for replaced people from "favelas". Second: This movie is very far from a gangster one. Is really based in a own experience contained from a book's writer. His idea was show what is a reality in a poverty place like that, so don't take as a gangster movie or some. I'd rather saw it as realistic third world vision of them ones. Third: translation to English or any other language don't catch it. Some gigs, idiomatic expression or passages are funny only in a Portuguese spoken in Brazil. I doubt about his force in Portugal...I don't think they can "really" able to understand it. We spoke very different Portuguese..just like English spoken in USA to UK, for example!!!!Bye!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a friend recommended I watch this movie, I wasn't all that excited. Subtitles? Call me when the dubbed version comes out. Against my will I watched this Brazilian flick anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The cinematography alone in this movie is worth watching it. Even if you are not interested in violence, Brazil, or (gasp!) subtitles, the camera angles, lighting, and innovative use of handy cams are stunning. The movie has a real documentary feeling to it and features characters that you actually care about. There was not one death that occurred in this movie that came as a relief. I was actually emotionally attached to all of them. (Even the ones that may have deserved a violent death.) To top it all off, the story is extremely complicated and in-depth but is told so well that it is never confusing. Go buy this movie, it's too epic for a rental!</fullReview>

Lil' Ze is without a doubt the meanest guy ever, and Knockout Ned is one of my favorite heroes. The only complaint I have is Rocket, he just seems kind of boring in some areas. I think that there is a true representation of the gang disputes and the fact that after a year of fighting no one even remembers why they are fighting for. That speaks a lot for the wars in our very own past. Without a doubt one of the strongest films that I have seen in a long time.

The gritty reality of city of god can be summed up with the shooting of the young child in the foot. with that it becomes very clear that this war extended to everyone, and that moment captivated the crowd into this reality. Then you have the constant hits to the style of the time within the seventies. where it was a time to be "groovy", and that is portrayed within Benny, as it gets you captivated into this culture. And yet the conflict with Benny and Lil ze is not mainly what resulted into his death. That feel of the seventies IMO is greatly portrayed within the movie, and sets up a great vibe.A great movie all in all, me being only 15 this is a great movie to see and be able to analyze</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give City of God a brilliant 10 stars. I rented this DVD solely based on seeing the high score it received here on IMDb. It currently ranks in the Top 20 movies on here of all time and rightfully so.If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino, then without question, you definitely need to check this film out. While Quentin did not direct this, the style is very similar to most of his flicks. In fact, "City of God" far surpasses anything done by QT.This movie has it all... action, suspense, comedy, gangs, mystery, drugs, violence and even a little romance thrown in here and there.The entire movie is subtitled, but the film is so good that you will be forgetting that the subtitles are there after 5 minutes or so.Finally, the film is completely original and there is nothing out there that closely resembles it. The characters and the acting are superb. These are seriously some of the best characters to ever appear on the Silver Screen. You'll love some of the characters, hate some of the characters, but you will be emotionally involved with all of them due to the superb writing that went into the script. It's a great movie and I highly recommend renting it ASAP.Happy Viewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possible the best foreign I've ever seen. I'm a fan of Fellini, of Bergman, they were artist and insightful philosophers, but the gritty reality of City of God is fascinating and unparalleled.The arch of the story and the complex interweaving of the lives we follow resembles mythology, yet this is true and it's modern. Modern Non-Fiction Mythology (which I do see is a contradiction of terms, but I don't know how else to verbalize what how I feel about it).The direction was masterful. Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund are equal to a Brazilian Sergio Leone. This is what Leone tried to accomplish with 'Once Upon A Time In America.' He failed. Meirelles and Lund succeeded.This movie will satisfy almost any film lover. If you like films for gangster action, if you like it film for story, or catchy dialogue or for deep philosophy on life and the surrounding world, you will love this movie. Even if you don't like subtitled movies, I will give my promise that you will like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw City of God late last night. I don't think I'd ever even heard about this film before seeing it. What a surprise! Let me tell you, this is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. It jumps out and grabs your attention right from the very first frame of film. The backdrop, the images, the directing, the acting...all incredible! Watching the acting, I thought to myself "this is amazing how well they are acting." I suspected that most if not all the people they used in the film really did grow up in that environment. They just acted too good. They were just too natural with it.One thing I kept thinking while watching this film was "I thank God I wasn't born and raised in this environment." The movie makes you realize how good you've got it. How would you like to live in a housing project where gangs of thugs walk around carrying "Rambolike" machine guns, with ammo belts hanging off them, openly without fear, ready to shoot and kill anybody just for the fun of it, having no remorse? How about kids 12, 13 and younger running around with real pistols out in the open, ready to blow you away for kicks? This is a housing project that truly is and looks like a war zone.The culture of these people just jumps right out at you. It's exciting, depressing, thrilling, chilling all mixed up well. I thought Rio was mainly just a huge beach with a bunch of super exotic naked women walking around, guys staring, and a huge statue of Christ overlooking it all. This movie showed me different. A lot different! You've got to see it! Viv</fullReview>

The movie shows an endless cycle of kids becoming criminals before they are even 12 years old. It seems that when these children are 18 years old, they will either be dead or in prison. This movie tells the story of one of the few who managed to get out of the slums alive. It is heartbreaking to watch children who are 8, 9, or 10 years old becoming criminals because it is the only way they can money for food. When they get older, they eventually start helping out with the drug dealers. The police only show up every once in a while and don't do much. The drug dealers pays the cops to look the other way. So long as no rich people get killed, nobody cares. This is simply one of the most poignant films I have ever seen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITY OF GOD (2002) **** Matheus Nachtergaele, Seu Jorge, Alexandre Rodrigues, Leanro Firmino da Hora, Philippe Haagensen, Johnathan Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Roberta Rodriguez Silvia, Alice Braga . Absorbing and compelling tale of young Brazilian boys who grow into gangsters/drug dealers and other dregs of society in the ghettos of Rio de Janeiro circa the late 1960s/1970s era that focuses on one attempting to leave his dead end environs by becoming a photojournalist and for pure survival at all costs. Astonishing in its matter-of-fact violent bluntness that sends a shock to the senses to see pre-adolescents brandishing all sorts of weapons and killing for the fun of it; rampant anarchy peppered with moments of innocence. Filmmakers Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles transcend the feel of a docudrama's trappings in their adaptation of Paulo Lin's true-life account of the mean streets of Brazil with a decidedly improvisatory screenplay adaptation by Braulio Mantovani. Kudos to the inventive cinematography by Cesar Charlone and energetic editing by Daniel Rezende that owe much to Scorsese, Tarantino, and PT Anderson for its storytelling through flashback cuts , title cards, character intros, and overall mise en scene yet has a unique, original feel altogether as well. A truly excellent piece of dramatic filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene set the tone for what was to come in the next two hours. What should have been a jolting and gripping experience, ended up underwhelming. The events should have made for a dramatic and even suspenseful sequence, but the ancillary movie elements added little to the scene. A chicken is tied to a post. We can sense its fear. It knows it has no chance of survival in this environment so it flees from this world of death and destruction. The tormentors give chase and we see the chicken desperately seeking salvation through escape. The metaphor is not lost. This is a corrupt and loathsome place, and escape to the safety of an outside world is the only way to live. Beautiful. I want to love this opening, but something just isn't quite there. I can see and comprehend the message, but I just don't feel it. Then a young man emerges and stalks the chicken from behind as a group of gangsters armed with machine guns watches him approach their target. More armed gangsters appear, and soon the young man and the chicken are surrounded. The young man surveys the area and hesitates. My heart should be pounding, but I remain perfectly tranquil. The ideas and events are in place. This quality of this premise is off the charts. We can already imagine that this film will be about choices that lead people down different paths in life. We envision the different themes emerging, such as the unjust suffering of innocents, like the chicken. This movie should have me on the edge of my seat and on the brink of emotional eruption, but it doesn't. Not much changes during the remainder of the film. The storytelling is phenomenal, aside from a few over explanations via flashbacks. The acting is hit and miss. The characters entice, but fail to completely generate the attachment to them that I wanted to feel. In the word, the film was underwhelming. So much potential, not completely wasted, but not completely utilized either. A good movie that should have been great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made, honest character study that takes its time; a rewarding and refreshing experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to seeing "City of God" I kept hearing it was like a Brazilian "GoodFellas," and Total Film Magazine said it was one of the best films of the year. Then Roger Ebert said it was one of the best films he'd ever seen and it got intense praise from critics everywhere. I kept wondering why critics continued comparing its style to "GoodFellas." Now I know why.Like "GoodFellas," this is an extremely visceral movie with a very hard edge; it kept me glued to my seat in a way that few movies do, and in fact - yep, you guessed it - the last time I remember being so enthralled by movie-making and a story was when I saw "GoodFellas" the first time."City of God" is about a group of youths growing up in Rio de Janeiros, where you're lucky to live past 20.It follows one character in particular - a young boy who wants to be a photographer, and abandon his brother's path of violence and bloodshed; he wants to be a respectable journalist, but only if he can survive the mean streets."City of God" is a complex film with many different narratives going on at the same time. This non-chronological, refreshing way of telling a story is something I've longed for in cinema recently; formulas are becoming so repetitive I know what's going to happen in a movie just by looking at the poster. Action movies: Stallone or Arnie take on bad guys like it's going out of style. Romantic comedies: Guy gets girl or vice versa. It's routine to the point of nausea.I don't know if "City of God" is the absolute best film in years, but it ranks pretty high up there. It's a refreshing experience and the only problem I see here is that based on its popularity, we're going to see a lot of American directors trying to ape the style; we all know how that works.</fullReview>

I didn't get the connection to GoodFellasbecause while those guys grew up together, they are older whenwe meet them, and their economic environment is very middle-class as opposed to the flavelas of Rio where the grindingpoverty is soul-destroying. The corruption that infects all levels of Rio society is sickeningfrom the drug and gun dealers to the crooked police and even thecynical media. The scene about the violence in the City of God hasbecome so bad, that the media is now reporting on it, thereforeforcing the police to do something, left me slack-jawed. This kindof insane lawlessness has to be answered. In the end, this is a movie with a message of grim hope,astonishing as Rocket has begun to fulfill his dream of becominga photographer. No such luck falls to Ned whose dreams arecompletely destroyed by the horrible violence of the flavelas withtheir drugs and their indifference to violence. Any movie thatshows children wielding guns as though they are toys should bea wake-up call. It shows how our own indifference to children'sneeds for a good education, loving families, and healthcare is justanother step in wrong direction of their futures. A though-provoking film that is also riveting in its intensity. Pleasesee it.</fullReview>

The boys go in different directions as they grow up, one becomes a photographer while another becomes the most powerful criminal in town. Over 100 people are killed in this movie and many of them are kids so it might not be for everyone.This story is so brilliantly told that I was breathless the whole 130 minutes of it.

I saw no real point to the story other than how terrible the life on the streets in Brazil is and how wonderful it was that the narrator survived it. Some of the scenes made me sick and if that's what it takes to be a good film these days, then I'd rather watch the usual rubbish that comes out these days.I'm also a little worried since I am a writer and like to write complex and interesting stories, but i will not add extreme violence to them.

		<shortDescription>a powerhouse crime saga, with a fierce, daunting fusion of style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God played for months on end at an the Angelika theater in New York City back in 2003, and I was hesitant whether or not I should go there to spend ten dollars and to sit in a little theater with a packed audience, or to wait in video. I gave in to my temptations to see the film, from what I heard from various reviewers, and by the end, I knew it was truly worth the admission, and then some. Director Fernando Meirelles, along with co-director Katia Lund, crafts a film that steams so much with a passion to tell this story, to reveal all these characters (most of which who wear their flaws right on their sleeves like badges of honor), and to be honest with how their tales unfold, that even the most die-hard of action film or gangster connoisseur will feel the visceral, hardcore nature of the City of God long after the lights come up, subtitles and all.This true story (from a novel by Paulo Lins, former resident in the slums) is told, much like Scorsese's master-work Goodfellas, in a kind of flashback format where the narrator takes us back to the City of God when the lower class were shuffled into the slums of Rio De Janeiro without much hope. Our narrator, who only calls himself Rocket until the end, lives amongst the Tender Trio, friends of his whom start out robbing oil trucks and whatever they can get their hands on to stay alive. An impromptu heist at a motel gets the cops swarming, and the trio becomes scattered, though not dissolved. As it proceeds into the seventies, we find out that some members of the group died, a few went to jail, and Rocket stays on the sidelines, hoping to become a professional photographer with little or no assets to become one in and outside of the City of God.Then there's Li'l Dice (played through most of the film by the equally terrifying and gleeful Firmino Da Hora), who in the first act of the film is a kid who's the smallest among the bunch of older teens who make more or less successful robberies, though as Rocket says "You need more than guts to be a good gangster, you need ideas." In flashback (not to spoil) we discover what went down at the motel that night, and from there in a brilliant stroke of editing we see how Li'l Dice became Li'l Ze, who rises up little by little in the drug dealing schematics of the slum and soon takes over a supplier to sell cocaine. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) may be the protagonist viewers can identify with, but Li'l Ze is as fascinating an antagonist as any I have seen in a long time, who masks his insecurities with boyish joy in all of the mayhem he creates. Otherwise without hope, Li'l Ze becomes the dominant supplier in the slums, something of a tyrannical businessman, and as his story unfolds as does Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who becomes Ze's rival in the eighties.The only way a movie like this could work is if we feel for the characters plights and heights and such, even if they're evil in nature like Li'l Ze, Carrot, and Knockout Ned. That's why the filmmakers plunge us right into the City of God, and the nature of the city, and while the narrator may pass judgment on people he's known his whole life, he like us know why they're up to no good. The thieves and dealers and killers became such by looking up to their role models, the older hoods of the region, and with each younger group of kids who want to smoke dope and vandalize is another and another. As long as you don't get caught with your pants down by the cops, or get raided by chance, the odds for anarchy are in your favor in such a place. We understand equally why Rocket wants to get out of the city his own way as much as we understand the wars between the gangs, and this crucial facet makes the film work extraordinarily well to its advantage. Indeed, we understand the tragedies of such minor roles as the Runts- the orphans of the streets- much as we would understand the importance of such roles as in a Dickens novel.Along with this technique of storytelling, is the way it's filmed that's eye grabbing. The first scene shows in fast action a chicken chase, and then our hero between the gang and the cops viewed in a tailspin fashion as we are sent back to the beginning. Then, we get all the energy of even the simplest of scenes, and the hidden passion (Rocket on the beach with Angelica, for example) all by the mostly hand-held photography by Cesar Charlone, and the break-neck editing (i.e. the montage of how Li'l Ze makes a name for himself, or the disco dance sequence) by Daniel Rezende.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>director in overdrive tells familiar story of poverty = a really awful existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is about a district in Rio or some Brazilian city where poverty is rife and known as the city of god. Told through the eyes of one of the inhabitants who witnesses the growth of crime amongst the young men and boys of the area, the story is supposed to be true and unhappily it looks an honest enough assessment of any rundown poverty stricken urban neighbourhood no body cares about. the cycle of crime sounds familiar, using kids as couriers for drugs, random killings, turf wars, addiction, hopelessness, squalor and filth. told at a fast pace in a episodic story character by character, the place soundslike one step up from a concentration camp [see the work of Primo Levi about what thats like] Oddly the storyteller goes on to leave the ghetto by becoming a photojournalist, a similar story was told here on Irish TV by a young man who was in trouble from age 8 till his early 20's when he learnt to write and became a journalist so he could break the cycle of damaging behaviour he had. the truth is to get an education seriously as characters in the film are constantly telling the storyteller but he gets out by luck mainly and having a strong character. not a brilliant film, a relentlessly told story, violent and depressing, though honest 10 out of 10 for that; it should be labelled a docudrama rather than a film but then less people would see it, but I wonder if I or anyone really know what it means? If this goes on in Brazil and Ireland why not everywhere in which case ....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To sum it up in one word: overrated.Let's face it, the story isn't anything new (I know most things have been done before, but still). There's no shortage of films depicting the lives of gangsters from their slow steady rise, to that inescapable fall. What's new here is the fact that we're dealing with kids. It certainly is a different take on a familiar plot, but otherwise there are no surprises. For most of the film, it's various gang members shooting each other when they're not busy doing robberies and drugs.One of the arguments for this film being a classic is that the actors are amateurs and that they are "real". OK, if that's what they want to show - do a documentary about them instead of trying to gloss it up with fancy visuals and editing. The latter has also been praised to great extent. My question is: why? There's nothing here that isn't in every other film these days, and certainly nothing that warrants that extra high rating. It only detracts from the story, making the characters all the less believable.It seems like the subject matter (i.e. the horrible conditions under which these kids live - and the fact that it's foreign) has influenced viewers into thinking that the film is somehow better than it actually is. It's really nothing more than a typical genre movie. What's best about the film, and not often mentioned, are some very entertaining humorous scenes that you'd not expect to find in a film like this.

Vengeance story is presented by turning back the time.Story about poor-life in a slump town in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Groups of young man is living by business of drugs, and there is always war between them, either by personal or by group. They kill each other for power of a region to do drug business. The killing will not end, because law has been bought. The police takes blood money. After the older generation is all-dead by their own killing, the killing will be continued by the younger. All young man character is end-up dead killed by gun-shot of another or by police, leaving only one man, who narrates the movie.The flow is fast but clear and obvious. Sometimes it is boring, because of repeated action.The music during movie is very good, supporting the action. It is a strange music, because the beat is fast, kind of disco-dance beat, but people are dead. I think the music is better than godfather have.This movie is quite similar with Godfather (1972), the difference, this movie is in slump environment. That is why i give score 7, exactly like godfather, score 7. Movies with perspective of death will never exceed 7 in my score. I prefer perspective of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very very terrific Brazilian film that is completely raw in characters, language and depiction.This is a crime movie about the hoodlums in Brazil and the drug mafia and the background of each case. How gangs form, how they get lost, are killed, what fate do they give to future and all that you cannot even imagine at times. This is the most raw film I ever saw and I can smell everything from the streets stinking to the perfume of the girl to the drugs taken. It's so very well taken that I even forgot all this was done by a camera. So fluid is the movie and hats off to the cinematographer, the art director and the director.Written extremely tightly and completely driven by various characters and is narrated by Rocket, our protagonist who is an observer, yes he is a cameraman in the movie and captures all he could about the mafia. Each character takes the story forward and each scene just keeps you as engrossed as the earlier one. There is no one frame that could have been cut in this extremely well edited movie. It's a rarity to see all things knit well up in this movie and I appreciate and would yearn for more such movies. The milieu, the slang, the topography all are so well compiled and choreographed. And to bring all this together, I would hail the director Fernando Meirelles who has brought raw energy into a film and makes it extremely powerful and in fact the most powerful movie for generations to come.This is a movie that one must quickly watch it. I cannot exactly tell what I liked coz I liked everything and this again is a must experience movie.Thanks Fernando extremely grateful for giving such a great movie.It's 5/5 and is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cidade de deus" (Famous Favela of Rio de Janeiro)Rober Ebert wrote, that this is one of the very best movies ever. It has a 8.7 Rating on IMDb. I'd rate it 8/10. It's a gangster epic about Brasils Favelas and how difficult it is, to survive there and how people get addicted to drugs, drug dealing, stealing and killing from childhood onwards. The movie is very violent and the atrocities perpetuated by and to children are stunning. You can see how things get worse and how corrupt and helpless the state of Brasil is. The way the story is narrated is incredible, you will love, the way it's been done. It all seems very real, drastic and grim - making it hard to really like it or love it. All gangster movies, like all war movies, fail at demystifying violence and the use of weapons. I bet, gangs love the movie too - and therein lies the the poodles core. That's my only explanation, why I only rate it 8/10, that and a the repetitive shooting and violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing portrayal of the slums and gangster life in Rio De Janiero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on Netflix one night and decided to watch it, because I'm into gangster movies. This is the best gangster movie I've ever seen, (beside watching The Sopranos on HBO). It is based on a true story about a kid who strives to become a photographer and stay away from the dark side of drugs/executions/rape in the slums.Rocket is the main character. His brother Goose is part of "The Tender Trio", which is a gang in Cidade de Deux, which is Portuguese for City of God hence the title of the movie.Things go downhill from there, and many of the characters you see are killed either by drugs or killing. I also found out this is based on a true story.The story also has two separate timelines: One is where Rocket is a little boy growing up in the City of God and how it affected his family and friends around him, and the other is Rocket as a teenager trying to survive in the slums.There are a lot of characters. The directors did a superb job fleshing out these characters and making you feel for them. I will say that to not get attached to the characters, because every character has something horrible done to them or their family which fleshes them out more.I would recommend everyone watch this. This is definitely NOT for children. It has graphic nudity, and scenes of graphic violence including young children murdering each other or being forced to murder each other.Overall, it is just an amazing movie and City of God has one of the most amazing twists I've ever seen. I won't say when it happens, but you'll know when it happens.And this really does happen in Rio De Janiero. It's sad but it's what these kids do to survive in the slums. There's two choices. Either you join a gang or you try to get out. Sometimes the latter doesn't always work.It is rare that gang members get out of the slums.Enjoy this movie. Take in one of the most realistic portrayals of slum life in Rio De Janiero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"City of God' is a mesmerizing and honest look at people surrounded by crime and the path's it causes us to lead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every location on earth isn't 100% the same all throughout its area. Brazil for instance has been praised as having some of the most vibrant beauty, fun people, interesting culture aspects, and fun times anyone can ever experience. However, in the City of God there is absolute chaos and tragedy. "City of God" is a compelling and tragic true story of about two boys growing up in the slums of Rio De Janeiro who are vulnerable to a brutal and indulging world and take on two different paths in life. Rocket is a good-hearted young man who despises the City of God for it's filth, violence, and misery. Rocket dreams about becoming a photographer in order to show the terrifying world in which he and others life in to expose the City of God to raise awareness. The gang he is targeting is led by Lil Ze, a ruthless drug dealer who owns the city and just so happens to be the other boy the story follows. Rocket tries to take him down, which proves to be even more challenging than growing up in this unrelenting city. People are destined to make a change in their surroundings no matter what moral path they follow. That's what we learn from this exuberant crime story, that people are motivated to do good and do bad in order to change their lives and earn respect and power. Rocket tries to use his ability to do good, where Lil Ze uses his power to do evil. The city in which the two boys live in appears absolutely awful, but deep down Rocket represents hope in not just a ruthless city, but in any devastating location. There is always a chance of hope. The two boys are shown as they go through their lives from a very young age to their twenties. The story reflects growing up and the choices we make as children can affect our lives in the future. Director Fernando Meirelles captures the slums of Brazil in an absolutely groundbreaking way. Meirelles portrays a hopeless city and uses a tab of hope in this wonderful script to represent how hope is always in the most depressing locations. On top of that you have spectacular cinematography with a beautiful musical score to help visually portray this devastating/beautiful story. Harsh violence and thorough character development get you so wrapped up in the main characters that you'll have extremely strong feelings for them once your just a half hour into the film. "City of God" is a tough film to watch, but if you look at it from a climatic point of view and see what the future of Rio looks like, you''l be relatively happy and realize that as long as their are people like Rocket trying to make a difference in the world, their will always be a brighter future stored in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you cant stomach extremely realistic, gritty and dark shades in a film throughout its 130 minute run-time, its best you don''t watch this film. As there are some movies which showcase only the sunny side of life and dancing among the tall grass and pretty flowers, this one shows exactly the opposite. It presents the true story of a few boys during three decades, the 60's the 70's and the 80's in the most infamous slum of Rio De Janiero - Cidade De Deus (City Of God).Rocket is the narrator and is a boy who wants nothing to do with crime and instead wants to be a photographer. Li'l Dice/Li'l Z wants to do nothing but crime and wants to be the ruler of the city. The film is mainly about these two opposite individuals and how their paths cross in the city of god where god forgets about you. Whatever you do, you will always get pulled back into the dark circles of crime.The palette of characters is extremely colorful and includes Benny, Li'l Dice's only friend and the nicest gangster in Rio; Carrot, The drug kingpin who goes up against Li'l Z in an all out war; Mane Galinha or Knockout Ned, who is an expert marksman and becomes a hero and a villain of the city. The Score is incredible and infuses the Brazilian spirit and also gives us the rush during action sequences. The direction is brilliant, Fernando Meirelles was nominated in the 2004 academy awards for best direction rightly. He can be said to be inspired by Quentin Tarantino. The film is like Pulp Fiction or The Goodfellas but with a unique Brazilian taste which makes it more interesting. The acting is perfect from every actor, even including the bit-part players. The child actors act older for their age, as they have to, and when the older actors come on the screen, you would think that they used the real deal for the true-to-life characters. The Cinematography also deserves special mention and doesn't let us go into a false sense of Brazil's beauty as the scenes of wondrously mesmerizing beaches are shot along with the dark and poverty stricken crowded slums.The film tells us a story as much as dissects the reason for crime without doing so obviously. The main reason for the crimes and the drug kingdoms seems to be over crowding and ignorance by the government. In this area of Rio, having a gun at the age of 6 is supposed to be normal and crime isn't a vocation but an occupation. It is seldom that films choose to tell such a tale of ugly crime and celebrated evil. The film does have its feel good moments but doesn't try to hide the fact that The Damned live in The City of God. Not for the oversensitive or easily repulsed, this film is truly one of the best foreign language films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An authentic, gritty and gripping film, encapsulating the real life problems faced with living in the slums</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is based on the novel by Paulo Lins, which follows Rocket and his friends growing up in one of Brazil's most notorious slums. A hippie at heart, Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues) made it his destiny to stay on the right side of the law and become a photographer, which would prove tough in a place where crime seemed the only option. The co directors: Fernando Meirelles &amp; Katia Lino have produced a masterpiece, which is both gripping and gritty. Spoken in the mother tongue of Portuguese, it leaves the foreign viewer reading subtitles, which although taxing at first, retains the integrity of the film, opposed to dubbing. Gratefully, the dialogue was kept to a minimum, with what seemed quality over quantity, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the story, which slowly unfolds itself through a series of tales within.With Rocket as the narrator, the small stories lead onto the next seamlessly and ultimately to an action packed ending. Each character is well introduced, although there is none more memorable or scarier than the boss, Li'l Ze. Played by Leandro Firmino, in a standout performance, Li'l Ze needs no introduction, instantly portraying a role similar to Nicky Santoro in Casino, just more psychotic! In other words, exactly the sort of man you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley, which unfortunately for some, was their fate.It was his psychotic ways that set the precedence for everyone below him, making for some very violent scenes. This is where my one and only criticism lies. With a personal viewing tolerance to violence rather high, I found on one occasion in particular, feeling deeply saddened and disturbed. It was a scene involving the runts ? a group of kids no older than thirteen, who partook in petty crime ? and a dispute with Li'l Ze's gang, that ended badly for some of the runts. I'd have preferred it hadn't been included, but I understand its relevance. With the shooter no older than fifteen himself, it was an opportunity for his mettle to be tested. As the bullet fired, the camera thankfully focuses on the shooter's face, which is oozing with remorse, though through a tough exterior. Knowing that this was based on a true story, made it even more harrowing to watch, but posed the question: how would I end up in a place like this? Would I have the courage to escape or would I too take the kill or be killed attitude?As for the effects, the rustic, dark toned screenplay depicts the poverty better than any words could, as well as giving a coordinated retro feel to the era it's based in. Filmed in what looks like the real City of God of the 60s and 70s, graffiti lines the walls, potholes appear on every pavement, power lines sprawl uncontrollably between makeshift buildings and hoodlums vacate the shadows. In sheer contrast, beautiful beaches lie below, where life doesn't seem too bad.If only Brazil's political, social and economical situation (which to this date brings masses to the streets in uproar) was as attractive as their seafront, places like the City of God would not have to exist, or at least not in such capacity.</fullReview>

The film has been compared to Goodfellas, and the comparison is accurate, in my opinion.Life is cheap, and power is temporary. But there is some hope amid the carnage, and some great characters like Benny (Phelipe Haagensen), Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), and Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), the narrator.It is another picture of what happens when the 1% get all the protection and services, leaving everyone else to fend for themselves.

		<fullReview>This movie is possibly one of my favorite foreign films that i have seen largely due to its outstanding cinematography, its detailed story, and the degree of shocking realism it was executed with. This movie definitely gives someone like me, who has never been to Rio De Janero, Brazil a taste of how dangerous and poverty stricken the area really is. This movie gives an insiders look of how local kids of Rio De Janero often easily get involved into gang activities such as murder, drug dealing, and drug use at an extremely young age. This movie also shows how one local caught in this mess of violence and drug abuse is able to improve his life and find his way out of this poverty stricken area. I recommend this movie to anyone who does not mind reading subtitles and likes a good gang movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spine chilling film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about the lives of the people in the City of God, a place full of violence and lawlessness."City of God" is powerful, partly through the shocking events, and also the effective story telling. There is not a moment of boredom or time filler. The events portrayed in "City of God" are so shocking. Lives are constantly lost due to random fights and shootouts. Lives have no value, and we only see a mourning scene once in the entire film. Towards the end of the film, I feel my spine tingling with fear and shock. I am left in bewilderment as to how people can be so ruthless and merciless. City of God seems to be a place where humanity descends to the lowest level possible. "City of God" leaves me entranced even after the film ended. It's really powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say about this movie is you are in for a treat, this is a wild blood bath with a great story, and some fantastic acting. It has a rated R rating which is tough to believe, I would have thought easily NC-17 but nonetheless, the Academy Voters would never nominate a film like this for best film, which is unfortunate. Although it did get nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Directing which it well deserved that at least. It's very well directed and written. It's even crazier that this is based on a true story and that the characters portrayed in this film really existed. City of God is kind of like the Brazil version of Goodfellas, The Godfather and Heat. Hold on to your seat, you're in for a wild ride of a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you cannot stomach violence, turn back now. If you can, know that this film is oddly enchanting while delivering jaw-dropping moments.Based in the "City of God", Rio de Janerio, is a true story of a time not long ago when drug dealers ruled the streets and children were packing guns by nine years old. The police were a corrupt joke, and few lived to middle age. It's told through the eyes of Rocket; a boy who is both tied to the slums but willing to rise above them with the help of a camera.The acting is wonderful; which is made even more true because of such a young cast. Dialogue is edgy while still being witty. Camera shots can be jarring-using freeze-frame and quick movements; but it only adds to the feel and ambiance of the film.The characters and plot are unique and unforgettable. The characters can be outlandish yet relatable and wounded. While the plot provide plenty of violence and action, it doesn't allow those scenes to overpower the film.If you can handle the violence (which remember, does not necessarily define the entire film-I just know it's not for everyone), please do not miss this unexpected, unique and oddly uplifting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles' poignant and somewhat bittersweet debut ranks among the greatest and most iconic films to be made. Cidade de Deus delivers a rather terrifying narrative of a person caught in the middle of two warring drug mules. The film's transition from chaos to utter stillness, the real to the metaphorical, escalated the feeling of disorder, panic, and euphoria. Interspersed with the story are tales of corruption, greed, innocence, and the primal nature of man. The film showcased the very definition of character development, with the flawless screenplay mockingly fixed &nbsp;on the first person account of the protagonist, every character experienced several surprising twists in their personalities.Cidade de Deus worked on several levels, the pitch perfect cinematography capturing the very best of the on screen chaos and the aridness of the setting itself, the brilliant direction, the fast-paced, engaging, yet structurally composed screenplay, even the morally convoluted context; all of which made the film as magnificent as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sin in the "City of God" Alexa JimenezIn the movie "City of God" the topics of violence, abuse and drug use are commonly portrayed and show the reality behind the scenes of a day at a slum. It is a Brazilian movie, directed by Fernando Meirelles in 2002 and it shows the problems that the inhabitants of favelas in these countries have to face because of the fact of living under these conditions. The movie shows crude, violent actions that take place almost daily in the favelas and how characters around this plot react and evolve because of this. The movie takes place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in a favela called "Cidade de Deus". Based on a true story, the story begins with Rocket speaking of what he lives through his point of view. Rocket's brother, Goose forms a gang with his 2 best friends, Shaggy and Clipper and call themselves "The Tender Trio". The Tender Trio are slums which rob and assault different places, but by the idea of a little boy named Lil' Dice they decide to rob a motel nearby. Left behind to watch out for any cops, Lil' Dice becomes enraged and fires a fake warning shot. After that he kills all of the people in the motel and since that particular crime, violence and cruelty are Lil' Dice's primary motivations. Once Lil' Dice grows up he becomes the boss of the favela , a place in which over the years, the crime has escalated from small robberies to an all out drug war. Lil' Dice changes his name to Lil; Z'e and kills all of his competitors along with his best friend Benne. Together, they begin controlling the drug business in the favela and wipe out everyone who disagrees with him except Carrot. Meanwhile, Rocket tries to leave the favela by following his passion and dream of photography. The drug business floods the favelas like a river but Rocket continues to stay true to his ideals and hangs out with a group of friends who smoke pot casually. Trying to escape from the temptations of the favelas Rocket begins to work and has a terrible experience in which he decides that honest work is not worth the while and falls into crime. However, the victims Rocket tries to assault are too nice and therefore, he fails to be a slum. Lil' Zé continues to get worst and at a specified time he rapes the girlfriend of Knockout Ned who looking for revenge unites with Carrot and begins to fight in the drug war that has been taking place in the favelas. Rocket has his pictures published in the newspaper and gets a job. In the movie all actors did an amazing job at communicating what the director wanted to say. Rocket and Lil' Zé did an amazing job at developing their character, not only in the movie, but psychologically as well. The way that these two characters are juxtaposed is very interesting since Rocket and Lil' Zé both had the same opportunities, same surroundings and yet they took 2 paths in life. Through their acting you can see the different personality traits of the characters and how under very similar realities their perspectives of the world are completely different.The movie is full of camera techniques. Some of these techniques are establishing shots, which present us with the setting of the scenes of the movie. These are seen when the movie changes settings such as when from the City of God the movie shifts to the beach or to another place else. Also, there is the technique of tracking when the camera follows a person walking or running. This is scene when the kids are playing soccer or when a character begins to run. The technique of low angle and high angle is also seen a lot in the movie. This technique is used to show the different times in which the character have or will use their power. This movie deals with sensible topics present in society today that make us stop and think how effective governments are with their population. The fact that in City of God kids of around 8 years old are getting high on marijuana and killing innocent people makes the viewer wonder in what conditions is the kid living in in order to make these type of things. The movie also portrays the lives in favelas, which are aspects of the Brazilian society that the government has tried to hide in order to prevent the negative image of poverty on the country.The group of people who would like this movie would be teens and adults. This is because it shows topics and aspects of society and of the world that a kid would not understand. Also, there are crude and impacting scenes in the movie that could traumatize a little kid. I would say that this movie is PG-13 for the violence and the drugs that it has in it. My final word on the movie is that it is an excellent movie, very original, well filmed, acted and has a different and interesting plot. It mixes criticism with humor and violence with love creating a very good way of entertaining the viewer. The genre of this movie would be a drama but also having action, romance and comedy in it. I would rate this movie as a 8.7Alexa is currently attending Lincoln High School in San Jose, Costa Rica. She practices Yoga as a hobby and likes literature and science.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Short Review of the movie " City Of God"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City of God" will change your perspective.As a movie critic I recently enjoyed a Brazilian fill called City of God or Cidade de Deus in Portuguese. There is always more to a movie than just the motion picture. There are components that make a movie a work of art. City of God captures this and made it amazing to watch. This move was directed by Fernando Meirelles in 2002. It is a Brazilian crime drama film. Meirelles incorporates his touch as a movie director and created a very interesting movie that brought more to the viewer. It created in the mind a new perspective and understanding of the reality that is hidden in Brazil. The movie beginning with the story of a young boy that lives in the flavela's during the 60's. Throughout the movie we begin to see a series of character that connect with each other and all together tell a story. The main character Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) narrates the story from his point of view. We see how he is different from other character. The story continues during the 70' and 80's in a place in Brazil called the City of God. This is where all the main events and the climax of the story occur. Rocket is a good kid, he continues in school and wants to become a photographer. He meets Benny (Phellipe Haagensen) and Lil Ze (Leandro Firmino). They also lived in the flavela's while young. They are both troublemakers but Lil Ze is much more dangerous than Benny. As Lil Ze grows with power in the city of God by managing guns and selling Drugs a feud between the other leaders begins to power up. Lil Ze drunk with power begins a war in the City of God and the good guy Rocket is right in the middle of it. During the movie we also see how Rockets live turns out, his love live, his passions and his problems. In this movie there are many characters that create the story, but there only a few main ones that are really the ones that are totally involved in the story. The first one is Rocket (Alexandre Rodriguez) in my opinion he is a great actor. We have to consider that this movie is made with real kids from the city of god; he did a great job with his paper as rocket. He engaged me as a viewer and made me fell sand, angry, happy, and excited. The Second one is Lil Ze (Leandro Firmino) he portrayed the roll of the bad guy in the move and he convinced me. He created such a strong and angry character that it made his scary. He was a troubled kid and also a troubled adult. The actor did a very ice and neat job as the bad character in the movie. The other bad guy in the move that was not at the end a really bad person was Benny (Phellipe Haagensen.) This actor captured my attention; he created a very nice and complex character. He was on the bad side but he was a good guy. He made the viewer understand the perspective of the bad but with a sense of the good. He was a very good actor and made it very realistic. Another important character in the story is Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele), he is the competition of Lil Ze and his opponent during the war. He represents the weak of the side of the war. His acting was not so good, but he convinced as the weak person and the one that was oppressed by Lil Ze. The Right hand of Carrot is Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge) I did not like the acting of this man. It was unrealistic. He did not reflect the image of a person who is hurting and wants revenge. There are many aspects of the movie that I enjoyed. The director captured my attention more than once. For example in one of the most harsh scenes of the movie where two children are shot in the foot and they are both screaming with agonizing pain it made me fell as a viewer so sad and depressed and angry at Lil Ze. Then another kid had to choose with of the children that where crying would he shoot. This showed and explicit scene where a child shoots another child. This made me think and reflect even more about the movie. Something that I did not like about the movie was that rocket never got to be with the girl he wanted, Angelica (Alice Braga.) He never quite got to be with her and he showed great love for her. Instead she went off with Benny. In the movie " city of God" the viewer can appreciate many aspects of the movie industry. The technical usage in this movie gives the viewer a complete different aspect of the movie. For example the establishing shot shows the poor and destroyed city of god. It gives the viewer the first example of the terrible conditions in which the people live in. It creates the main image of the place, the setting of where the story is going to take place. We also see the close ups in the move, for example when Rocket is at the beach with Angelica, the director emphasizes the faces of the actors. Also in this same scene we see the rule of thirds. In a certain shot Rocket and Angelica are sitting at the beach with the panorama of the beach also in the shot. We see the composition of them sitting in the lower right with the sea and the mountains in the back. The composition of the scene uses the rule of thirds. I learned one big lesson from this movie, only the strong survive. This message given directly in the movie creates a harsh environment. People had to be strong in order to live in the City of God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently watching the movie Ciudad de Dios I felt great pleasure. The story is very compelling to the audience. It focuses on a real story that shows the life in the favelas. This masterpiece is directed by Fernando Meirelles. The story first starts by introducing the tender trio. A group conformed by three boys: Bene, Rocket, and Lil Ze. They all live in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It takes place during the 60's where first the favela is seen as almost "desolated" compared to the picture of the 70's where houses are few inches apart and where it almost has grown twice what it used to be. The story takes you in the lives of two boys in one of Brazil's most dangerous favelas. As the boys grow up they take different paths one becomes a drug dealer while the other becomes a photographer. All the actors that take place in the movie do a fantastic job. Alexandre Rodrigues acts as Rocket while Leandro Firmino acts as Lil Ze. While Phillipe Haagensen acts as Benny. The entire story seems very credible. Using the same inhabitants of the favela as actors really helps to tell the story.I felt the movie was very entertaining as it had many parts that I liked. The part that sticks in my memory is when Lil Ze shoots a boy in his feet. It is very crude since the boy is very young. His performance makes you feel impotent, as you would want to stop Lil Ze.This movie takes us on a reality that many of us haven't lived in. It shows us how power can be addicting and can make you towards making the wrong decisions. As well it shows us how drugs can take you on an abyss.The use of the establishing shot in the movie makes a real contrast. The first establishing shot is in the 60's where there isn't much houses and isn't crowded. The 70's shot shows a big change where it is almost unrecognizable favela. In this later favela it runs for miles and more poverty is seen.The movie is intended to adolescents and mature audiences. As the language may contain profane comments at times. I would not recommend this movie to a young audience since they would get easily lost in the conflict of the movie. My MPAA rating for the movie would be rated R since any younger audiences would get insulted by the crudity of scenes and profane language.This movie deserves a 9/10 review. It could easily get a perfect review since it takes us on a life in the favelas. The movie overall was pretty enjoyable and appealing. Alejandro Godinez is a junior of Lincoln School in Costa Rica.

		<shortDescription>Review City of God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only godly thing the city has, is its name.I recently watched City of God in my Film Appreciation class and I believe that I am entitled to express my thoughts about the movie. City of God is a Brazilian movie that presents the audience with an inside view on the poor living conditions, injustice, and violence found in the favelas. Specifically in the slums called Cidade de Deus, during the 60's and 70's. It follows the life of Rocket, who is constantly surrounded by crime. His first encounter with this crime was with his older brother's gang called the Tender Trio. This trio was what created the monster of Lil' Ze and inspired him to become one of the greatest Brazilian gang leaders ever. The story begins with a opening shot over the city of god. At this time the city was nothing more than row upon row of poorly constructed houses and very restricted space for each family. Living here was the unsuspecting Rocket, his older brother, and his gang of friends otherwise known as the Tender Trio. Lil' Ze, as the younger brother of another member of the Tender Trio, tagged along whenever they robbed motels or stole gas from gas trucks. The Trio taught Lil' Ze well, but maybe just a bit too well. Lil' Ze went on to become one of the most notorious gang members in the City of God during the 70's and engaged in a bloody gang war during the 80's. Rocket is caught in the middle of this as he struggles to find his way out of the rats nest and fulfill his dream of becoming a photographer. The acting was spot on from the main characters such as Lil' Ze and Rocket all the way to the runts that were the embodiment of a lost generation in the favelas of God's City. The one scene that really showed the raw emotion in the runts was that of the young kid. After little Ze went looked for them he was encountered with a large group. Many got away but two were found. One seemed to be five years old and the other around seven or eight. At this moment the cruelty of the gangs leader went all out when he told the youngest member of his group to shoot one. The tension in this moment was almost unbearable as the kid raised his gun towards the crying five year old. At the last second he moved the gun and shot the eight year old. The crying of the kid was so realistic was so moving that I myself was hoping for the other kid to be shot. As his last act of cruelty, Lil' Ze shot the poor child in the foot leaving him in so much pain that it was almost unbearable to watch. One aspect the really tied the whole movie together was how it was arranged. It starts with the end so to speak, because the beginning is the start of the last battle between Lil' Ze, the police, and Knockout Ned. Then he begins to retell all the anecdotes of life from the moment of the Tender Trio to the rise of Lil' Ze as the leader of his own gang, and of his own career as a photographer. If we were not allowed the chance to infer things from the opening clip then the story would have been less interesting and it would have resulted in a bored spectator. Something no cinematographer ever wants with his audience. One thing that I didn't like was that it was difficult to compare to film to any particular time in history. Making it difficult to really comprehend if you were in the 80's or the 70's. There were even time when they could have easily been in the early 60's. An example of this is when they meet knockout Ned on the bus trying to find someone who they can rob. The movie teaches young adults that if you pursue the life of a thug or drug addict, then two things can happen. Either you end up in jail or you die. It is interesting how it shows that the violence in the slums consumes everyone except for Rocket, and even partially consumes him because he learned to smoke weed. The only reason that he was able to leave the slums was because the slum itself presented him with the opportunity to first take the pictures of Lil' Ze and later take pictures of the war between the two gangs. I think that most groups of people would enjoy this movie, but it should be for 13-year-old kids and older due to the amount violence, drugs, and obscenities. The MPAA rated it R for strong brutal violence, sexuality, drug content, and language. I thought it was a very good movie because the director found a very natural yet enticing way to grab the audience's attention without showing the outcome to soon. Also he found a way to make it interesting to watch again because the second time you watch it you see so much more to the storyline and plot than the first time you watch it.Scale 1-10 stars: 9/10 stars: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;Alejandro Finol is a 15-year-old junior.

		<fullReview>In my Film Appreciation class we just saw the Brazilian movie "City of God" directed by Fernando Meirelles. The movie takes place on the famous Favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The history is about two major gangs in this area that are fighting to gain the control of the business (drugs). This movie includes a lot of action and drama. Brazil, 1960's, City of God. The Tender Trio robs motels and gas trucks. Younger kids watch and learn well...too well. 1970's: Li'l Zé has prospered very well and owns the city. He causes violence and fear as he wipes out rival gangs without mercy. His best friend Bené is the only one to keep him on the good side of sanity. Rocket has watched these two gain power for years, and he wants no part of it. Yet he keeps getting swept up in the madness. All he wants to do is take pictures. 1980's: Things are out of control between the last two remaining gangs...will it ever end? Welcome to the City of God.The actors/actress in this movie are different as what we know. Some of the actors are professional workers, however, some of the kids/actors that appeared in the movie are residents of the favelas. Li'l Zé (Leandro Firmino) in my opinion was the best actor. He took the role of the "Big Gangsters" amazing; he represented respect in the favelas and also on the watchers. One thing, which clearly comes to mind, is Li'l Zé ear-to-ear smile, so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil. Bené (Phellipe Haagensen) also did a great job interpreting the "cool" guy in the favelas. At the end, when he meats Angelica his feeling change and wanted to leave the drugs business and leave with Angelica. That attitude change really impact me because he became in some way a friend of the watchers. Buscapé-Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) also did a great job. He was an "innocent" guy in the favelas, his only love was Angelica but he lost her. At the end he becomes a professional photographer and took all the photos that were publish in the diaries about the favelas. In my opinion, the only not as good job was Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge) he didn't took the role with the passion of others like Li'l Zé or Rocket who portrayed the real favelas residents. I have seen this movie only recently (2012) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen. This movie explains in a great detail what the Favelas look like during this three decades and what people suffer in "The City of God". I really like the camera techniques that were used in this film, they were very neat, some memorable shots that probably will be remember always. Maybe there was just one thing I didn't like and understand about this movie, Rocket was with Angelica (that was her precious love) and Bené just one day took Angelica and Rocket didn't said anything. Instead, it seem Rocket was a close friend of them, we can see this in the party scene when Bené gets killed. "City of God" is not the kind of movie when the viewers learned respect or honesty. However, although there is a lot of violence in the movie we can learn what will happen to you if you get in this kind of business. At the beginning everything seems very optimistic, they win a lot of money and don't have to work. Nevertheless, in some years the consequences will be dramatically negative, you could end up dead or in jail in the best of the cases. This movie can change everyone views of crime and the favelas, this movie can especially impact people who have poor economic level and are about to enter the "black market".Due to the violence and extreme level of crime this movie would be rated R. My final word of this movie is that is one the best foreign movies of all history and would have to congratulate the Brazilian government for the support that they give to film. In "City of God" many technical aspects are presented. Meirelles movie is cinematographically talking very neat job. A perfect example of it, is a basic exercise, when a low angle is presented in a scene of the movie. While Lil Zé was about to kill the child from the other gang, he was a seen as a superior object while the child look inferior, just by the camera angle. Establishing shots were also presented throughout the movie, some examples of it is when they present the favelas during the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Rating System: I would give the movie "City of God" a 9/10 due to the following reasons. Its and extraordinary film in the storyboard and script, a stupendous direction of Fernando Meirelles, and an neat camera job. Short Biography: Esteban Bola?os is a freshman in Lincoln School, Costa Rica. Some of his favorite sports are soccer, basketball, and American Football.

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a different movie than what you are used to, and you are bored of Hollywood movies, "City of God" is the movie you should watch. It is a Brazilian movie released in 2002, directed by Fernando Meirelles. If you enjoy crime and drama films, the movie will capture you easily since the very beginning. "City of God" portrays Brazilian life in the slums where drugs and violence are always present. We might never have had imagined the violence and crime behind one joint of marijuana, but this movie exposes us to the rough path of getting involved with drugs and gangs. "City of God" tells the story of teenage life in a favela of Rio de Janeiro called Cidade de Deus. Based on a true story, the movie recounts the events for over two decades from the point of view of a boy named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues). Rocket's brother, Goose, forms a gang with two friends, Shaggy and Clipper, called "Tender Trio". All the kids look up to the trio, and one day, a little kid named Li'l Dice (Douglas Silva) convinces them to rob a motel. Once they get there, Li'l Dice serves as lookout, and after firing a warning shot; he gets into the motel and kills everybody. Since then, he keeps committing crime with his friend Benny (Phellipe Haagensen). As the decade goes by Li'l Dice grows up and changes his name to Li'l Ze (Leandro Firmino). With the help of Benny, he becomes a severe drug dealer and eliminates all competition except for Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele). On the contrary, Rocket is not involved in the dealing, but he enjoys smoking pot with a group of friends to whom he likes to take pictures. Later on, Li'l Ze kills a guy's uncle and younger brother, and rapes his girlfriend. The guy's name is Knockout Ned's (Seu Jorge), who eventually turns to Carrot. Li'l Ze then asks Rocket to photograph him because he is jealous of Ned,s appearance in the newspaper. His photos are taken by a reporter and published, so he is able to get out of the slums and begin working as a photojournalist for the newspaper. He photographs the slums, and one day, when he was about to take a picture of Li'l Ze's gang, a gunfight breaks out between the two gangs, and Ned and Li'l Ze end up being killed by different kids looking for vengeance. Meanwhile, Rocket has photographed everything. The interesting things about the movie that caught my attention were the way it was edited, how the story was told, and the cinematographic elements chosen. The story begins in the present and goes back two decades to explain how the character, Rocket, got to where he was. In the end the story gets to the point it had left of at the beginning and continues from there on. Besides this general alteration of time and order, several events within the flashback of the two decades are retold more than once from different perspectives of different characters. The situations are repeated several times, but surprisingly it is not boring to look at the same scene so many times. Instead, it drives you in more into the drama. Another element about the narration is that Rocket is not only a character, but also the narrator. He is the one who tells the story, making the story have a different style. I personally don't like this element a lot, but it works for the movie. The movie is well accompanied by Brazilian music that goes very well with the plot and intensifies every time the situation agitates. When this happens, different camera angles are also used, which brake the limits of normality and common shots. Instead, the images and shots create an original and creative, artistically speaking, movie. The cinematographic aspects that caught my attention from the movie were the eccentric camera angles and effects used. Different compositions and camera movements are creatively used, making it more entertaining than the typical eye-level shot. One angle used was the Dutch tilt. It also mixed this tilted images with the point of view effect. Certain shots during the gunfight at the end, include these characteristics. Moreover, an establishing shot is also used to introduce Cidade de Deus, letting us know were the story will take place, and show us the warm colors of the slums during the sixties, which contrast to the setting in the seventies, which is colder. Furthermore, the effects with which they play are interesting as well. The pace of the image is sometimes accelerated and other times stopped. These effects are incorporated with the different angles and shots, making the movie the product of carefully thought elements mixed together. Cinematographically it is a great movie appealing to the senses. The images and music keep you attentive, but besides that, the content of the movie is also strong and profound. The movie opens up our eyes to a different culture, and a different world from the one we are used to. We are able to see how life in Brazilian favelas looks like. The movie shows how drugs can get you involved into serious, violent vices and issues. When we think of drugs, we usually think of their effects, and the consequences of using them; but we hardly think of the whole criminal trafficking behind them. It is a movie that will cause anyone to reflect upon the topic. I would recommend this movie to young adults, which can identify with the characters because of their age, and therefore, be more impacted by the images. Even though the movie is strong and rated R, it is important for a young adult to watch; still, anyone could enjoy it. It is difficult to tell what's a stronger element in the movie, its content or its artistic choices. It is not only a culturally rich movie, but it is also rich in color and imagery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie and I think that this is a great movie to watch, due to the rich amount of editing and composing skills that are shown on the movie. This movie creates great suspense with the use of editing; this makes the plot a whole lot interesting.The plot of the movie is the trafficking of drugs in the City of God and the problems that come with the trafficking of drugs. Some problems that appear on the storyline are extreme violence and crude images, which are caused by the wanting of power and size of territory. The movie at first takes places during the 60's, later on it flash-forwards to the late 70's. The main characters of the movie are Lil Ze, Rocket, Angelica, Carrot, Benny, Shaggy, and Knockout Ned.The actors that I think outstood from the others were Lil Ze and Rocket, not only because they play a major role in the movie, but because they also play it really well. Lil Ze really looks, talks, and acts like a real gangster. Rocket is the narrator of the whole story behind the City of God, which makes him a very important character in the movie. He also acts really well; his acting comes out fluidly as if he was really the person who he is acting but in real life.The part that I liked the most in the City of God is a scene where you see the police are seen on one side of the road, then the camera starts tracking its way to the other side of the road and on the other side you see the gang and its members, meanwhile rocket is standing paralyzed in the middle of the road not knowing what to do. This is a great scene because it is done with a perfect combination of suspense and time, if the tracking would have taken longer, then you would make the audience unsurprised, and if you made it shorter then there would be enough suspense.The major moral/lesson I learned from this movie is that; even though you feel safe and you think you are the "guy of the year" in the city of god, you aren't safe from being thought of getting murdered by someone else. Some people might think that this isn't the moral/lesson, but in my opinion I do belief that this is the moral/lesson.I think that this movie should be seen by everyone, because it is really interesting to see the ways in which the director uses the real life to produce a replica of the City of God played by the citizen actors. Although everyone should see it, it does contain crude scenes of killings, making it harder to be seen by everyone. The MPAA rating for the movie is R, because of strong brutal violence, sexuality, drug content and language.I rate this movie an 9/10.Johnny White is a high school junior that likes to watch movies in his leftover time and write critics about them. He likes to play basketball, watch TV, play games and eat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If "GoodFellas" were set in Rio de Janeiro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films either rely more on style and less on substance, or more on substance and less on style. Here is a film which finds the perfect balance. Set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, it takes the dreary atmosphere of desperation and poverty and breathes new life into it, giving it a pulse of color and rapid camera movement. This film follows the life of Rocket, a kid born to be into crime merely to survive, and how he becomes what he wanted to be. He is the narrator, and it opens with him being caught in what appears to be a scuffle between a local gang, and the cops. But he quickly interjects, telling us as the audience how we won't understand unless we know the entire story, and so it begins with one of the most minor and clever tricks of the camera. These little bits exist so completely in this film, you hardly notice them, they work so effectively. They work to bring you into the slum, and between the narrator and the director, you'll feel as though you've lived in a slum all of your life, and are merely used to the goings-on. This film is truly a spectacle to behold, and one of the best films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoa. Such an amazing start; gangs of boys start catching up on a chicken with GUN!!!! What kinds of story we are going to face? This bewildering introduction, coupled with vigorous samba music, is a comprehensive plot of the movie. A violent neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro where no police, no law, and no ethic is there: city of god. Doubtless, the Bráulio Mantovani's elaborated screenplay is one of a kind those does not ignore a smallest detail, so could easily form the logical sequences of story and relations between characters. Fernando Meirelles deliberately keeps himself away of going into drama or even tragedy, with not consuming so much time on the key scene of the movie, so the movie fellowship is really fast and keep on occupying the audiences' mind. Such an amazing of this style is the beginning of the Knockout Ned's story; the scene of attacking on his girlfriend, shooting on his family, and killing his brother and uncle is deliberately so short and sufficient. Eventually the death of Bene in his goodbye party, or even the scene of killing Li'l Zé follows the same strategy. Everything in city of god happens so simple, and it definitely is the strength of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mixture of Tarantino-esque narrative play, a fast-paced plot, and the talented direction of Meirelles and Lund make this an intoxicating crime drama that's almost impossible to stop watching. It's a movie about cyclical violence and the degradation of poverty in Brazil, but for all that it's fun to watch -- the characters are catchy if not particularly deep, and the crime is aesthetically pleasing at the same time as it never lets us forget the horror and evil of the violence we're watching.I'm slightly less certain as to whether the film stays with me after that initial rush of sensation, but I think it's worth thinking about as much as it is watching. Admittedly, the characters are sketched very thinly (with the female characters being especially egregious), but the overall arc of the story -- the kind of innocent, fooling-around crime in the first part of the movie slowly giving way to more violent gang crime and eventually urban warfare -- is something that works as both social commentary and a powerful, personal narrative arc. City of God may not be the perfect film that many of its fans claim it to be, but it's that rare film that's enjoyable regardless of whether or not you have your brain on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brazilian Masterpiece About Poverty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles' City of God is a sweeping tale of how crime affects the poor population of Rio de Janeiro.City of God,also knows as Cidade de Deus,is a Brazilian crime drama film directed by Meirelles and co- directed by Kátia Lund.It was released in Brazil in 2002 and worldwide in 2003. The story was adapted by Bráulio Mantovani from the 1997 novel of the same name written by Paulo Lins, but the characters are not fictitious and the plot is based upon real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the '60s and the beginning of the '80s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l Zé and criminal Knockout Ned.The cast includes Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora, Jonathan Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Alice Braga and Seu Jorge. Most of the actors were, in fact, residents of favelas such as Vidigal and the Cidade de Deus itself.Though the narrative skips around in time, the main focus is on Cabeleira who formed a gang called the Tender Trio. He and his best friend, Bené, become crime lords over the course of a decade. When Bené is killed before he can retire, Lil' Zé attempts to take out his arch enemy, Sandro Cenoura. But Sandro and a young gangster named Mane form an alliance and begin a gang war with Lil' Zé. Amateur photographer Buscape takes pictures of the brutal crime war, making their story famous.Meirelles' Brazilian slum epic is a profound, stylistically expansive depiction of three decades of child gang warfare on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro with non-actors playing their poverty-ridden lives for the camera.The living conditions it projects are as horrendous as I had feared, but the movie is surprisingly easy to take as a rollicking homicidal entertainment as Meirelles takes us to a real-life deathtrap and then proceeds to make us feel twice as alive for the time we spend there.Each chapter is endowed with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum which makes it great film.Added to that,the acting from the cast was brilliant.Overall,it is a shocking and disturbing film but it give the viewer compelling look at life in the slums particularly in Brazil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund just about get everything right in 'Cidade de Deus'. On the technical side, it's absolutely amazing, whether you're talking about the remarkable direction, the electrifying cinematography, the haunting raw visuals, the energetic yet eery score, the excellent editing, authentic art direction or stunningly real performances. Bráulio Mantovani's screenplay is rich in grit, dark humour and starkness. The eclectic cinematography varies from close ups, freeze-and-zoom to sweeping motion scenes, long shots and hand-held approach. The depiction of the title city is metaphorically described in the film as purgatory that transforms to hell and the way Meirelles portrays it makes it easy to draw the conclusion that it's one of the most frightening and dangerous places in the world. The fact that it's based on real events and that it still exists sends a chill. 'Cidade de Deus' is a film that haunts. It lingers in mind long after one has finished watching. However, the film, while intense and chaotic, is cleverly balanced with dark humour.Visceral, energetic, funny, unsympathetic, scary and metaphorical are among the few diverse adjectives that describe this stupendous film. There's nothing like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies ever made, based on a real story. The skillfully &amp; brilliantly written screenplay, accompanied by the excellent cinematography, editing and direction, makes the movie a well-paced &amp; interesting watch. The acting is convincing too. The background score goes quite well with the theme; it gives us a feel of the ghetto and prevents the movie from being too grim.The story takes us through an amazing journey of these characters; you really go into the world of hoodlums, guns, drugs and violence. It covers subjects of greed, power, ambition, hatred, vengeance, survival, etc. Remembering that it's a true story, you get appalled thinking of the conditions these people live in and the children, instead of having a decent childhood with education, roaming around with guns in their hands.The story-telling style may remind you of a few movies by Tarantino or Scorsese, but the wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles and bringing them up to date with flashy &amp; sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing, the film has its own style.All in all, it's a triumph of story-telling: Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling. A cinematic masterpiece which is a must-watch for an avid movie lover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notwithstanding it's reputation and viewer rating on this board, this is a tough movie to watch. It's not what I'd call an entertaining picture, and it actually takes some work to watch with it's non-linear style and the fact that it's a foreign film with characters having unfamiliar names. I actually needed paper and pen to keep track of the players using street names like Rocket, Shaggy, Li'l Ze and Carrot. But even that all takes a back seat to the sordid nature of life in a ghetto of Rio de Janeiro called Cidade de Deus, the City of God. City of Satan might be more appropriate, as the area where the story takes place is a literal hell on Earth, and life has about as much meaning as the insect you crush beneath your footstep. Most of the picture is visually jarring; watching with my family produced more than a handful of gasps as random street violence was presented as commonplace. The worst to my mind was the decision a pre-teen gang member had to make regarding which of his contemporaries he would have to kill to show loyalty to his leader. I'm just horrified that there are people in the world who actually live this way, with little to no hope of ever escaping to a less turbulent existence. For mere existence it is, with very little chance of escape, except by death which seems the the most viable way out for many of these troubled youth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God" (Cidade de Deus) is a foreign film that takes place in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The story follows an underworld tale of organized crime in the City of God suburb, which involves criminals and drug dealers. I personally thought that the movie was rather excellent. The movie was provided by an excellent director named Fernando Meirelles, and he used a lot of charm to the movie. I also enjoyed the use of cinematography, film editing, transitions, and music. To show an example, the use of editing and transitions can play back a character's story, or in other words, the story goes back and forth to talk about a particular character. Also, the cinematography was used to draw the audience's attention with all the zooms, pans, and wides, putting us in the middle of everything. Finally, the acting provided by unprofessional actors was brilliant in every way, bringing tons of heart and drama into the characters. To me, I think of foreign movies are pieces of entertainment in a different country, which is still fun to watch. When I heard about the movie, I had no idea that it was actually a foreign film, but since I know now, I respected the movie for what it was. The overall look of the movie was brilliantly organized, and it made the audience feel like they are walking the streets of the City of God. How awesome is that? "City of God", in my review, "a sudden miracle of a movie, with a piece of dynamite entertainment."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, the acting in this movie was outstanding. Many of the actors came from real situations similar to those in the movie, which made it easier for them to become the character. The way violence was portrayed in this movie was excellent. It showed the mercilessness of the killers and it evoked a sense of reality, unlike average Hollywood violence. The way people were killed made you think: "Wow. These things really happen this way." The relationships among characters, and the characters themselves were very realistic. They weren't stereotypical "Good guys" or "Bad guys." Each one had a complex mix of thoughts, actions, and emotions. The storyline, although very interesting and thought-provoking, was rather complicated. Every so often, the narrator stops the story to explain a character or situation by going back in time, and tells that particular story up until it's the present day, and goes back to the story. Also, due to how many characters are in the movie, it's sometimes hard to keep track of who's who. Especially when the story advances to years later, when characters have grown up, and sometimes change names. All in all, this was a very good movie; one that shows people what the world is really like. It shows how dangerous and depressing slums can be.</fullReview>

The camera shots were done in a very raw fashion, giving the film a realistic quality. Every smudge on the walls, every close glimpse at the sweat and grime on someone's face; it all jumped out as though I were right there.The story follows a few different people; most of whom are involved in gangs. As the plot unfolds, the film gives an in-depth look at each character's history, explaining the reasons why each person turned out as they did. There are some very disturbing parts with excessive death and violence, and no traditional happy ending. The film was moving, and with enough tension and twists to keep me engaged. Some of the twists and turns seemed a hybrid of Shakespeare and Tarantino storytelling.One of the most compelling films I have ever seen, and the fact that it's based on a true story is both frightening and sad. It gives a glimpse into the gang mentality, and shows that even the well-meaning person can become swept up in this lifestyle. Do yourself a favor and watch it; you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the first sixty seconds of the film, there are more than seventy camera cuts moving between sharpening knives, chickens, vegetables, musical instruments, and other abrupt scenes. Director, Walter Salles effectively introduces the audience to the tension and constant sentiment of impending danger in the City of God with the fast-paced cuts of images and sound. Cidade de deus is a fantastic movie set in the slums of Brazil where drugs, crime, domestic violence, and murder are almost mundane considering the frequency with which these events occur. The story of several boys who are outcasts of society because of their race and extreme poverty is narrated by "Rocket," following each child from near innocence in his young years to young adult life (which, unfortunately, seems to be the average lifespan in the city) filled with narcotic trafficking monopolizing the city based on this business conducted by twenty year olds. Without a political or social agenda, Salles provides for the audience the pure, raw, and gritty facts of lives of poverty in Brazil. His audience cannot leave the movie untouched by the despair and horror of the stories of these children, and in this, Salles achieves a captive audience, heartbroken by the reality, which is too unknown to the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God tells the story of two young boys growing up in a violent neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro: Lil Ze who becomes a gangster and Rocket who becomes a photographer. It is not an easy movie to watch as it addresses some very difficult themes. Throughout the film we see horrible gang violence that exists in the world among children as young as five and six years old. The children in the city are exposed to guns and drugs before they even learn how to read and it becomes the only thing they know. The violence and treachery unfold in what is filmed as a party-like atmosphere, creating a palpable sense of indifference among the gangsters for the viewer. The movie was filmed on the streets of Rio with hand-held cameras and a cast that includes many unprofessional actors which makes it appear incredibly authentic, allowing the viewer to understand the reality of the situation. Although the film makes it clear that such a cycle of violence is difficult to escape, it gives the viewer some sense of hope in the resolution of Rocket's story when he proves that escape is a viable possibility.</fullReview>

Fernando Meirelles' use of lightening and shadows and filmed snapshots is incredible and augments the symbolism of the camera in Buscapé's life journey. I enjoyed how the film progressed in a novel-like fashion, imitating the book that it portrayed with various "chapters," each of which described a particular character's story. Likewise, the development of a large number of characters is sometimes too daunting to attempt in a 2-hour film, but I thought it was well accomplished in City of God. Finally, the plot itself was simply an amazing and stark depiction of the violent reality that exists in the Brazilian ghetto, to the point that murder became even a normal part of daily life for young children. That's certainly a thought to chew on for some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film adaptation of Paulo Lins' novel has become one of the best foreign movies ever made. "City of God" is the name of one of the most notoriously violent slums that surround Rio de Janeiro. This movie was shot on location in the dangerous Rio favelas (slums). The casting does a good job showing the diversity of those living in the slums. Many of the actors actually grew up in the favelas. Luis Otávio, who is from the "City of God" itself, plays the main character Buscapé/Rocket. The movie follows a group of children as they grow up in the slum surrounded by violence and drugs and tells their stories. Buscapé is the narrator and we get an insider's perspective on the situation that has plagued the slums of Rio for quite some time now. It is through this character that the audience is able to enter into the violent world of the "City of God". Buscapé learned through the experiences of his older brother just what happens when you get involved in the drug wars that hold the favela captive and decides to take a different route in life. He is a very raw and real character, one that we can easily relate to. He is desperately trying to find a way out. Unfortunately the viewer is left feeling a certain amount of impotence with the whole situation. Many people die and the young children that survive are all ready to begin the vicious cycle all over again. There seems to be no end in sight of the violence. The one who does make it out ? Buscapé ? does so by absolute chance, just by being in the right place at the right time and being familiar with a camera. It seems that only with great luck is one able to escape from the poverty and violence of Rio's favelas.</fullReview>

After watching the movie the truth of this quote reigns supreme. The actors were amazing and it translated well to me even though it's a foreign film.

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time (In my top 15 for sure). I remember seeing it at an art-house with my brother in 2003 and leaving the theater thinking it was the best film I had ever seen.Cinematography, storytelling (in a goodfellas kinda way), violence, caring about the characters, all types of emotions, directing, uniqueness, were all TOP NOTCH.PHENOMENAL MOVIE: OTHER FAVS INCLUDE: Goodfellas, Godfather 1/2, Pulp Fiction, Big Lebowski, Lives of Others, Casablanca, A Prophet, Shawshank Redemption, Pinocchio/Bambi, Animal House, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon/House of Flying Daggers to name a few</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proves that poverty, crime and drugs come along with moral degradation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the excellent movies ever made, deserving 18th place in the IMDb TOP 250 movies list.An incredibly touching story doesn't seem to be a true story, but you are gonna be amazingly struck to know that this all is based on true events.The story just shows the sad history of Brazil, and the rest of Latin American underdeveloped countries. The poverty, crimes and drugs prove to be the reason of moral degradation. The disgusting thing is that children were involved in those events. Children were raised under these conditions, they didn't know that there was another side of life and the world. The terrible conditions, murders of innocent people, drug abuse were a daily life things. And that is incredibly moving, that some people proved to save their humanity and soul unharmed, depicting a young talented photographer living under these conditions and telling the story of his childhood.The film deserves applause for incredible acting and directing. The screenplay writer was great at his job too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the 5 best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is sure amazing. If it was a American movie, probably would receive higher rater here in IMDb. I fact, I am surprise the a foreign language movie receive so good reviews, because watch this movie in original language (I am Brazilian) is so much more involving than the dubbed version. The language itself plays a role, because there are a peculiar way of expression that the characters uses. Is sad to say that the power of words is lost in translation.Anyway, this movie is among the 5 best movies of all time. I live in Brazil, I know what I talking: it's is not fiction. Rio de Janeiro has a real problem of poverty, crime and drugs, as showed in the movie (the movie real history happened some 30 years ago.Fernando Meirelles, the director, is very nice guy, very humble e gifted.This is not a exploitation movie as some haters say. Unfortunately, it is real. If not, I would agree that there's a lot of violence on screen, but wait... there's a huge distance between the fetishism of violence and the exposure of a real problem.But above all the violence exposed, there's a felling of hope carried by the main character. Besides all the context of poverty that surrounds him, he not engaged to crime. Well, watch the movie...A courageous, strong e very well done movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'City of God' also known as Cidade de Deus is not just an ordinary foreign language film. It is one of those 'the' movies out of the several which I have seeing related to gangsters and drugs. I may call it the Brazil version of the 'Godfather' or 'Slum Dog Millionaire' not just for its style of storytelling or the mere similarities in the plot, but for how great those movies were. What's bonus for 'City of God' out of all is that it's based on true events. And realizing that such incidences have taken place and such societies exist is a good enough reason for you to be thankful for your life what you enjoy.Taking place in 70's in Rio de Janeiro 'City of God' is a story of two kids who grow up in the gang torn drug addict part of the city where violence is another way of living. From their childhood what kids want to become is some kind of a gangster and carry a gun. Starting from small crimes like theft and evolving up to massive scale drug dealing and murder, the story evolves between the two kids who chose to take different paths. Buscape aka Rocket chooses to live a normal life away from the gangsters and become a photographer and the other Ze Pequeno aka Li'l Ze starts the gang business from a tender age before 10. Even though it's simply said in one line the events they face in their life from being a kid to young men is not easy to digest.Incorporated with young yet very energetic cast 'City of God' is a wonder of performance and acting. And when it comes to story telling the movie does it pretty fast and sometimes you might slip out of the names and the background stories but it's essential to catch up to them. Especially when you run with subtitles! However every scene adds value to the story and the background information provided.I'm very much certain that 'City of God' is not the ordinary gang movie which you may see coming out every week. Its unique and it will keep a mark in your history of movies. You may hardly find it in the video stores these days as foreign language movies are seldom. Grab it the very first opportunity you get. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rio is a beautiful city, but the edge of the city lies in chaos. Your are what you live, and in this culture it is not what you would ever dream of. Kids, gangs, drugs, killing, sex, life, death, all before they are 15 years of age. The interaction and distrust of the gang members will turn your stomach upside down. I was mesmerized by this film. It was like Lord of the Flies, but with machine guns. The story was intriguing, but dark. I love photography, and I like how Alexandre Rodrigues who played "Rocket" was always taking pictures and trying to make a living. After you finish watching this great film, take the time to watch the two hour special of the actual gangs in Rio. I almost think that this biography is better than the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of a gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God's is a Brazilian turn on the crime film, Stylistically influenced by Goodfellas and Traffic it is one of the best crime films of this past decade.The difference between City of God and Goodfellas is that City of God turns the gangster genre on its head. It strips to its bare essentials and gives the audience a very cathartic experience in doing so.The movie is about a small shanty town in Brazil ironically called the City of God. It is a place of poverty and this invariably leads to crime since everyone is trying to earn a better living with more money rather than go the way of the fathers who are fisherman and the like.In this town most children want to become gangsters. Some are driven to it like Knockout or others are just plain bad and love to do it like Litte Ze. And once you are in you are never heading back. The film is told through the eyes of Rocket an aspiring photographer and one of the few people in the film that we say not engaging in crime. Rocket does all the normal teenagy things. he smoke pot, tries to lose his virginity and be creative in his spare time. One thing really going for him is he is always in the right place at the right time. For some reason he just observes the events as they unfold, as kids kill each other, as gangsters shoot and kill each other he just observes the carnage. At one point at the very end of the film does he finally show some emotion if only for a moment. It somehow adds to the whole thing because in the midst of so much violence there is no time for value judgements.There are many scenes in the movie where kids pick up guns, kill others, do holdups snort cocaine and generally behave unlike other kids. There is one line in the film where Steak and fries tries to prove he is a man by saying he does the above specified. Knockout gives him a smile and pats him on the back. the smile is a very knowing one. Like these kids are doing these terrible things in a playful manner , like everything is a game. Despite the killing they are still children because they don't yet understand the consequences and repercussions of their actions.City of God doesn't give answers or attempt to give answers for any of the character's actions because there simply aren't any. city of God merely observes and depicts. Much like Stanley Kubrick's film Full metal Jacket it tries to say that this is how it is. It just is.City of God is a brilliant achievement in terms of acting, direction, photography and various other technical aspects. The lack of production value that a Hollywood production would give it add to its charm and make the story that much more richer and real. There is a tremendous energy on screen and the film is very colorful due to the clever use of the multitude of lenses. City of God is one of the decade's best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Masterpiece from Brazil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A kid? I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man." Sometimes a movie comes along that is so unexpected and fresh that it takes a little while after viewing to realize what you've just watched. "City of God" is one of those movies. It will leave you with a feeling of utter satisfaction.Based on a true story, "City of God" takes a look at the life of Buscapé aka Rocket, a kid from the slums as he attempts to survive. The journey covers two decades and depicts the true way of life in the ghettos of Rio de Janeiro including drugs, violence, politics and sex. Buscapé's ticket out of this hell is his undeniable skill as a photographer. He decides to begin snapping shots of the local gang activity which has uncertain repercussions. The local paper gets their hands on his photo's and so begins the second act of this film. Rocket works to get the "next big shot" all the while staying out of the gang leader's radar.This is a violent movie but it is not overly so. It works with the atmosphere of the film and I found it a necessary aspect. Scriptwriter Br?ulio Mantovani did a great job interpreting the book by Paulo Lins bringing a haunting reality to the characters. We not only hated some of the characters but also felt a very strong connection to them. A task not easily accomplished. Rocket, wonderfully played by Alexandre Rodriguez fights to keep out of the draw of drugs and crime. In fact, all of the actors did a great job. I was amazed how well they portrayed the inner battle between good and evil.One of the best aspects of the film is in the photography. Cinematographer César Charlone and Director Fernando Meirelles used lots of dull browns, reds, blues and grays to pull the viewer into the setting of the slums. It worked magnificently contrasted with the vibrant soundtrack and the frantic editing. "City of God" goes full circle in the life of the gangsters, a feature I really enjoyed. I wasn't left with questions, something not found in a lot of current cinema.All in all this is a masterpiece of film making. The characters, storyline, script, editing, direction and acting are all superb. It is yet another shining example of how foreign movies are some of the best in the business.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there were no music cues and blending frames you'll be wondering if this is a movie you are watching. Camera and framing are quite explicit as you are one of the actors and that is quite compelling considering the plot and story. Photography is superb and fits the movie like a glove. Acting is beyond par and at the more than few moments it will feel so real you will be at the edge of your seat. I will not reveal any of the story as this movie is a rare breed, fast paced, action packed to the maximum. And do expect lot of gory scenes because this is not for a faint hearted part of audience. If you consider yourself a true fan of movie art, than this one is a must see. Superb and simply brilliant from the start till the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult to watch but very IMPORTANT movie to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We chose this movie for our monthly "Great Films" series. It's accurately rated "R" for violence, gutter language, drugs, &amp; sex. (One viewer left 1/4 way through because of this.) Roger Ebert said, "This is one of the best films you will EVER see."For many people, this will not be a comfortable film to see. BUT, it IS a very worthwhile, important film because it gives a close view of the culture, the relationships, the expectations, of those living in poverty with the opportunities and outlooks of living in a culture dominated by drug dealing and violence.In this instance, the culture is in Brazil's so-called "City of God"--a slum area set aside especially for the poorest people who were herded into an area just outside Rio de Janero.The narrative deals with many in this area who become involved with drug dealing, rival gang warfare, and short life expectancies--as well as one, "Rocket", who transcends all odds to become a professional photographer. It's based on a true story. The film jumps back and forth occasionally to view episodes in the lives of various important characters in the film.Although many people will find parts uncomfortable to see, yet (IMO) it's VERY deserving of its #19 ranking on IMDb's all-time 250 best films ever--and of wide viewing.It goes a long way into showing the culture, the experiences, the motivations &amp; expectations, the relationships in those communities in, e.g., Mexico, Colombia and everywhere that support the drug trade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While perhaps not the best film ever made, City of God clearly competes for top honors. While the heart of the movie is a tragedy about the effects of crime and poverty in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, it does not treat it's viewer as a torture subject. There are many tragedies, both minor and major, that befall the characters. The life in a Rio slum is not portrayed as a fairy tale world, however, there are moments of joy, love, and fun. The script itself would make City of God a great movie, but it was also very well conceived. The camera direction is fast-paced and modern without being overly jumpy, the actors all play their roles naturally, and the production value is incredibly high (especially considering the relatively modest budget.) At once a very serious and thought-provoking film, City of God perfectly balances serious subject matter and a high level of entertainment in a way I have not yet seen any other film achieve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all , this film look beautiful and really captures essence of the slums of Brazil. The pacing is fast, not one scene drags. You can't help but think that this film ripped a massive page on narrative off Goodfellas's book. It also takes some notes from Pulp fiction.The film is equipped with a young and inexperienced cast in which each and every one of them preform there role with sheer brilliance. credits has to go too leandro firmino who portrayal of Li'l Ze is outstanding.While all the technical parts, the editing, music and cinematography were excellent, it felt like the story itself needed more character development especially with Rocket. Even though you hear a lot from him. you don't actually see him on screen that often. While Li'l Ze had many scenes dedicated to him along with Benny, it felt like the main protagonist was pushed to the side leaving the ending some how dry. All in all, the film is very good and well worth the watch. Even if you turned down the volume and turn off the subtitles, you would still get some enjoyment out off it due to the way it looks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the movie and I think all the positive things about it are said in the reviews below, but I just couldn't resist adding some criticism to it.-The gang war in City of God gives the feeling that it's a war between the two biggest gangs in the whole city, and that the winner will own the entire city, or at least I had that impression while watching the movie. Fact is that it's just a very small part of the huge city, and situations in other parts of the city can be totally different.-I think the movie was too much based on action, which didn't always added something useful to the story of the movie.Please, let it be clear that I adored watching Cidade de Deus, but it's not worth 10 out of 10 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible portrayal of the environment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing look into the slums? here it is of Rio de Janeiro, but I can imagine it fitting a lot of other cities around the world, as well. It's a threatening, treacherous place, where innocence can only just barely survive, if at all. There are a lot of unconventional methods in this, it could perhaps even be called an experimental film, and it all pays off. The actors are unknowns, and a number of them grew up in the neighborhood this deals with. Not a single performance is lacking, and no one is miscast, and that goes for the children, too. The cinematography and editing also contain untraditional practices, and they aid in the magnificently storytelling. This is cut to evoke the frantic, gritty, and often brutal nature of the life in the slum, and it is unbelievably effective, involving and engaging. The use of music is excellent. This has strong and frequent violence and sexuality, and the language is harsh. The DVD has a well-done, 50-minute long featurette that goes into the process of making it, a nice and funny little 60-second animation, a theatrical trailer and a music video. I recommend this warmly to anyone who watches gang-movies. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i rarely ever see a film that captivates and engrosses me in quite the same way that city of god did. almost everything from the intelligent directing to the fascinating story to the brilliant acting help to emphasize the vicious and desolate nature of the story and the situation the characters are in whilst still portraying an idea of hope. the story had me in shock and awe throughout whilst offering some intelligent twists and somehow leaving me feeling good at the end. this film has the power to take you through a range of emotions and feel as if you are actually in the city of god and it gives me hope to know that despite some of the dribble we see coming out of Hollywood these days there are still some people able to give us majesty outside of LA. it is a film that shows cinema has the potential to not just entertain but to produce art. one of the all time great foreign films and even above such works as amores perros and three colors. a must see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've been wanting to see this for a long time, and it did not disappoint - to put it lightly. Gritty, snappy, charismatic and even beautiful, this movie hits you, the viewer, in all the right places. Indeed, this is based on a real story, and it is also in Spanish with subtitles, but all that just serves to the purpose of assuring that City of God is as realistic and jarring as possible.This film doesn't sugar coat things and it doesn't make them out to be more gruesome than they actually are; it's just an extremely well written and performed film relying solely on the strength of the writing and the direction, and every single camera shot counts, with a good many of them that will remain in your head long after the credits roll. The acting, the dialogue, the pacing, the narration, it all just works so damned well that City of God ends up as one of the most memorable and affecting movies you'll ever see, sending you spiraling through a torrent of emotions that ultimately climaxes in one of triumph and closure. Forget all my usual banter about how you should see movies if you like good film-making, just see City of God before you die. Absolutely essential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of films about kids in 3rd world conditions going down violent paths, but rarely are these accounts as first hand, expansive, and compelling as City Of God. There's a vibrancy, urgency, compassion, and scope that makes this movie so hard to pull away from. The story of a boy named Rocket trying to escape and being pulled back into the violent conditions around him, as well as the local history that created this environment. We see generations of slumlords few old enough to drive, come and go, in ages and empires, of drugs and fashions from the 60's to the 70's. Most of the performers here are not actors but children from the infamous slum, including Brazilian pop star Sue Jorge(seen in the Life Aquatic seeing David Bowie songs) who also grew up there. There's an immediacy, honesty, and energy to this film that 90 percent of films about gangsters, street life, and the 3rd world miss. No glorifications of excess, just poverty, desire, hope, and ignorance, put in a blender and set to f*^k all. Anyway, excellent from start to finish.

		<shortDescription>Numbingly tragic yet gripping at the same time, City of God is an ugly tale beautifully displayed on screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes in order to portray a harsh reality, one must embed vicious images into the minds of others, no matter how gruesome they may be. City of God is a ghastly movie full of things you thought you'd never see in a movie. What's even worse is how it's based off a true story. Even more terrifying then that is how the children in the movie for the most part have experience in the slums that are being portrayed. With kids being as skillful in murder as the average human being, City of God is a totally different look into the country of Brazil, one that you'd never see on the Travel Channel. Compared favorably to crime movies like Goodfellas, the only difference is in this narrative; you have no other choice but to be a gangster in the streets.City of God follows the lives of two people that tread down different paths from the moment their childhood is introduced. On one hand, you have Rocket, a mild-mannered, quiet, kind individual mixed up in one of the more hostile environments portrayed on film. The other kid is Lil Ze', whose psychotic behaviors began as a child when he started tasting violence and enjoying it. One would rise up to try to escape the warzone, the other would thrive in it and become one of the leaders. As the movie progresses however, Lil' Ze begins losing control of his life, while Rocket slowly but surely has hope in leaving the area. The movie also drifts away from the main storyline multiple times to present smaller stories of other characters; some that fight, some that try to leave, and kids whose futures look bleak from the get go.On a film like this, shooting on location and using people that have witnessed it all was a clever and well-executed idea. City of God uses kids, teenagers, adults, and elderly folks that have accustomed to the violent ways of life and present all their previous experience to this film. Tons of improvisation and a lot of dangerous cinematography later, this is one of the most brutally realistic movies about the drug world you'll ever see. The movie never focuses on main characters either, like a joyride you'll be taken through three different time periods and through the lives of multiple individuals and even the history of certain locations.The frenzied storytelling is accompanied by frenzied editing; which meshes that of Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Pulp Fiction, Run, Lola, Run, and even The Matrix. While it isn't as tightened as the gems described in the previous sentence, it remains riveting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The editing and directing is what runs the film, and with good results as well. Nobody is merely showing off their technical skills, the cuts distinguish the emotions of the scene, and just how frantic life is when bullets are ripping through the air. All sorts of cuts are strategically placed throughout the film; we get wipes, quick-cuts, cutaways; the works. You become a part of all that goes on, the camera-work and editing throws you right into the action.Brutal is the best way to describe this movie. Everyone has a gun, from the heroes to the villains to even the children. Nobody is safe, everyone is being double-crossed, everyone is being questioned and questioning the actions of others. Like the eyes of God, all are equal but unlike Him they are all equal for the killing, regardless of age or stature. The innocent are killed, and so are the guilty, and so are the children. In one very sad scene, a little child is forced to choose from two similarly-aged kids who to kill. It's anybody's game out there in the streets; and nobody is spared. The death count is alarmingly high and whenever you begin to sympathize with someone, they bite the dust, become a victim of the violence that erupts. This makes the movie just as sad, just as gripping, and just as memorable. The acting is great because, they all know what its like and can perfectly convey it on camera with little help.Bottom Line: City of God is an excellent mesh of editing, directing, cinematography, and re-creation of a bloody environment that few people know about. The story is sad and will tear your heart out, but will keep you watching as you root for a potential happy ending. What keeps you watching is the hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel, even when the characters are shrouded in uncertainty and darkness. There are few words that can describe just how good the story is; real-life events depict some of the best tales around, even if they can become very bleak in content. Like a kick in the chest, City of God unleashes an environment you'd never believe, simply because of how dreary and deadly the location is. Highly recommend, but be prepared for the grimness within.</fullReview>

The seamless intertwining plots of the characters gives a brief nod to pulp fiction and QT himself, but still feels genuine and original, and this is where city of god comes into its own.The editing and direction does everything a classic movie does, and that is to connect the audience to the movie intimately. After city of god your left thinking about the story, your left with thoughts and emotions. that to me, is what makes this movie a great one indeed.Quite possibly one of the best movies I've seen, ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of foreign cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Foreign cinema is not new at making great films. Akira Kurosawa, Jean Luc-Godard, and many others have all made films that stand the test of time as well as any American classic. For the Brazilian cinema, City of God is that film. It is a perfect blend of three separate stories that all come together in the end. Telling the tale of how the main gangs in the City of God came to be, the film superbly balances the subject material of each story, never giving one more than the other. The screenplay is terrific; it never falters or sags and continuously keeps us guessing what will happen next. The acting is very good, a surprise since virtually none of the cast had ever acted before in a film. The real treasure of the film, though, is the visual style. The directing is superb with an incredible blend of hand-held, dolly shots, and track shots among others. The cinematography as well perfectly captures the gritty street life with excellent lighting and sets. Overall, the film is a cinematic wonder. It is quite possibly one of the best films of the decade and certainly one of the best foreign films in quite a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God is a brilliant film in every sense of the word, perfectly constructed, with an effortless sense of style and a hard hitting sense of realism hammering home an important social message.The main character, if there is one, is Rocket a young boy obsessed with photography; though the film tells the stories of many of the men living in the City of God. Their stories intertwine for a decade or so and we follow each character through their every step. through the film however, no one is outright good, even Rocket seems to profit from the crime with his photos. However by the last act everyone has paid for their sins.The film works on many levels and the characteristics of many genres, social realism, action, drama and are all present in spades. The film begins with an intense scene as the group of 'hoods chase a chicken through the cramped favela streets, the film displaying a sense of wit (who wasn't on the side of the chicken) and being instantly accessible for the 'mtv generation' with quick editing and flashy camera techniques. The acting is fantastic, especially when considering that few of the stars had acted before. The 'hand or foot' scene sticks out as particularly heart wrenching.In all this is a perfect and beautiful mix of both style and substance and is well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City Of God (2003) Top 5 - 2003Number 1 2003 - Film In A Foreign Language Fight and you'll never survive..... Run and you'll never escape.THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORYWith its compelling direction, stunning cinematography and editing, 'City Of God' comes at you with its fearless pace and attitude, it makes it hard to forget easily.Like Sergio Leone's breathtaking, operatic 'Once Upon A Time In America' was a harrowing story about 4 friends in the Jewish Ghetto of New York over a few decades, 'City of God' is similar, but in a less romantic, harsher and more brutal environment - It follows the lives of a group of friends in a favela of Rio De Janeiro.The film jumps back and forth, in sort of chapters, following the inextricable involvement of a group of friends with crime and drug dealing. In City of God you have little choice. A place where politicians turn a blind eye on, there's barely any electricity, any essential supplies. The place will beat you to the ground unless you do something. 15 miles from the heavenly beaches and green hills of Rio, this urban hell is something horrifyingly depressing.This is the one of the very few crime dramas of a respectable calibre that show us the problems in other parts of the world. How we all suffer from such pressing issues. However, don't take 'City Of God' as this epic gangster film. It is also a very personal story about the struggles of one young man trying to escape the brutality of the ghetto and seek a better life, as a photographer.Impressively shot and often tragic in its profound and explicit nature, 'City of God' is not to be missed.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Best film you'll ever see." indeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the 130 minutes of this movie, one is transported into the brazen unyielding world of the slums where the characters live. The cinematography and editing accurately reflect life and the various point of view. Searing orange and yellow landscapes, cold blues and murky shadows- the color palette itself is a visual work of art. Even with the fast paced narration, it still brings a sense of depth, unlike other films where the fast pace and the director's style overwhelm the characterization and heart of the movie. It is well-shot without being stylish and incredibly slick. It brings you into the moment with the characters emotions without being mawkish. The scene where Lil Ze picks two of the Runts to teach them a lesson for example would definitely make your heart leap when one of them, barely 10 years old, starts bawling. But you're quickly drawn back into the world as it works- where respect and power rules. There is no god except for whoever claims that highest position. So it is doubly poignant when you actually see the gang members come together to pray the lord's prayer. The movie pretty much runs on parallel tracks- when both Benny and Shaggy die while almost making it 'out' (out where, one never really knows; there is no world other than the very real one of the slums), and when each new character is revealed through association with an earlier character. Quite mind boggling stuff.In line with that grittiness, the movie dips in and out of the various lives, painting a very solid impression of what its like to live in the slums through following the lives of the various characters. From Rocket to the Tender Trio to Shaggy to Benny to Lil Dice to Knockout Ned back to Rocket, the flow is seamless and clever. Until when you're brought back to Rocket, you feel like you've been dragged all over the slums and are ready for a release. Of course, the film doesn't end that predictably. You're left remembering the different people you met in the slums, the slum itself acquiring a character of itself, and your mind boggled, and heart touched. The film is more intricately pieced together than a single viewing might seem, but even that is enough to leave you breathless with a peek into the City of God. If there was a mandate saying that everyone could only watch five films for the rest of their lives, this one would take up a very worthy two spaces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowing, gripping and moving account of life in Rio de Janeiro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City of God" is an incredible achievement. Set in Rio de Janeiro's City of God, the film follows events in the lives of a number of gangsters from the '60s to the '80s.Beautifully shot and edited, the film is truly gripping and moving and is definitely one of the best movies I've seen. Life is cheap on the streets of Fernando Meirelles' City of God. We see a child, Li'l Zé, grow into a dangerous and unstable gangster and the impact of his actions on the lives of the people around him. The film is narrated by Buscapé, a budding photographer, who grows up in the same neighbourhood as the gangsters and who is always in danger of being sucked into their deadly world. I love the fast-moving pace and style of this film. It presents the action through a series of chapters, always keeping the viewer's attention hooked to events as they unfold on the screen.You can't help caring about some of the characters in the film despite their actions and it's a real emotional roller-coaster. The cast are excellent and very believable. The performances from the young cast are jaw-droppingly realistic. Unpredictable and shocking, "City of God" is an unmissable film.Brilliant. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While most people hail this film to be one of the all time greatest films of all-time I honestly couldn't understand it at first by looking at the slip-sleeve on the DVD. But after viewing the film I understood what the audience was experiencing. The story takes place in Rio de Janeiro, narrated by the main character Rocket. It depicts the intense crime problem in the Cidade de Deus (City of God). How his childhood neighbors and friends become his worst nightmares and enemies. He speaks of how he follows his dreams to escape his urban nightmare, of how he found love and barely was able to touch it, of how his life was threatened numerous amounts of times, and of how his brother was slain while he was still young. This is a story that some may not be able to handle, but most should watch. I highly recommend it to those who are interested in foreign films or films of a urban crime nature. While I would argue with most and say it is not the best film of all time, I believe that it deserves some higher ranking.</fullReview>

So I loved this movie because showed a reality that the most part of the people prefer to shut their eyes, than see it...so when you see this movie don't think you will see a bunch of people killing one each other, but a corruption and the killing of the mind and the respect of the human being living in such a condition, that no one, children, men, women should live...so when you see this movie, just think about it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In the hand, or the foot?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the hand, or the foot", the chilling choice offered up to the smallest of children by Li'l Ze, the toughest hood ever to rule over the City of God. As the children cry and the gangsters laugh we are shown a world so far removed from our own that we find it difficult to even comprehend the lives that face these characters. This is the moment when we realise that these characters are not figments of some writers imagination, but they are representing the conditions that hundreds of thousands of people face each day of their lives. It is this quality that contributes to the powerful message delivered by Meirelles' "City of God".We follow 'Rocket' as he tries to survive in the favelas without being corrupted like so many of his former friends and turning to crime, despite the advantages he sees it bring all of those around him. Pursuing his dream of becoming a photographer, turning his position of poverty into prosperity, as he is able to show the streets as they really are, the pointless deaths are harsh influence put upon each and every person living with the city's limits. The emphasis is placed upon the overbearing pressure in the favelas to turn to crime, to show the separate characters paths the film spans a vast time-line, following the characters through their childhood and through their years, growing, changing and for the most part dying at the hands of the violence they so desire to be a part of, underlining the perpetual cycle that grips the slums of Brazil. As he grows and edges slowly further towards his dream we are shown the path through his life that he takes, including his brother's death at the hands of Li'l Dice, a child who will grow into the perpetually feared Li'l Ze. During Rocket's young teen years we are introduced to Angelica, a girl he desires to lose his virginity to, a futile attempt that is stopped short by her growing infatuation with Bene, Li'l Ze's best friend and counterpoint to his sometimes manic nature. However their relationship is ended with tragedy as Bene is gunned down by one of Li'l Ze's many enemies. The death of the 'coolest hood in the City of God' signifies the removal of the final link between Rocket and Li'l Ze and where their lives, already separated begin to progress towards their inevitable conclusion. The director, Fernando Meirelles, has been praised for creating such a realistic feel to the theme, contributed to in no small part by the hiring of real people living in slums and shooting in the surrounding area (as the real City of God is far to dangerous to venture into, let alone film in). The atmosphere given by these non-professional actors greatly enhances the film to the point where the audience forgets the language barrier and becomes deeply immersed into the troubles that they face. The unique shooting style brought to the production, Meirelles' ability to quickly size up and shoot scenes lends itself perfectly to the fast paced nature of the story, with the hand-held camera work only adding to sense of realism needed to truly convey a story conceived and written by a man that lived in and survived the favelas, Paulo Lins. This streets-eye view of the writer matches the view we as an audience are given through Rocket, with no censoring of the violent nature of the city. A violence, however, that is never intended to be gratuitous in it's nature, but merely realistic.The film shows both sides of gangster life, the glamorous parties and advantages given, but also the downside, the corruption, violence and death that is brought down upon all those who partake in a life of crime. The film somehow manages to avoid any political agenda despite it's controversial subject matter, an aspect that, in an already brimming plot, would only further complicate things and not be critical to the message the film is trying to deliver. Overall 'City of God' is a poignant yet pragmatic approach to representing life in the favelas of Brazil and underlining it's key theme of the cyclical nature of violence with a final scene that leaves the audience knowing that though so much has changed for the central characters, it is not going alter the ways in which the people of the Cidade de Deus live their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frantic, violent, and depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies such as this present a problem for me in trying to rate them. I recognize the quality in just about every category, but I don't feel that I got a return on the emotional commitment I made to the story, about life in a Rio de Janeiro slum.There are many who seem to have little patience for slow-paced films, but I had the opposite problem with this movie. The camera rarely stays still for more than a few seconds. Even though that probably set the appropriate mood, given the subject matter, it was too manic for me. On first viewing I was so busy reading the subtitles that a second viewing was necessary to fill in a lot of missed details.The movie does bristle with creative energy. The telling of the story is ingenious. It starts at a point, moves to several flashbacks, gets back to the starting point, and then moves on. There is a main narrator, but many scenes are woven into the story more than once, each time filmed from a different point of view.The violence is unrelenting and intense. Just as one example, there is a scene where a gang member is instructed to shoot one of two young boys to prove his manhood, this after both boys had been shot in the foot for amusement. And then one of the boys is indeed killed. So, if you are thinking of watching this movie, that is the kind of violence to expect. The body count is high. A couple of scenes, like the big dance, hint at a spirited life that is going on behind the scenes, in spite of the grim backdrop. But the emphasis stays on the culture of drugs and violence.When enduring such an intense experience as this, I hope for some personally redeeming value. Yes, one man does escape from the poverty and hopelessness, but that is but one from many. Based on a true story the film makes a strong point about the pernicious effects of poverty, and we are led to understand that the cycle continues from one generation to the next, becoming more desperate and vicious with the passage of time. Not living in Rio or Brazil, where one might feel prompted to act, the movie left me feeling depressed and powerless. About the only good that I could see coming out of it for me was to increase my donations to the local homeless shelter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A whole lot of people die in this film, and they are not the weightless, clean, entertainment deaths of your average adventure, action or crime flick.They are real-world deaths. Pointless, tragic, bloody and disgusting. Meaningless beyond being a reflection of the constraints and conditions we humans create in some places, in interaction with the wide span of human personalities that must live in them. To put that better- deaths that occur, just like in the real world, because some few people see killing as the answer to business competition or emotional dissent and the wealthier society around them finds it unnecessary or even undesirable to stop the killing since it is happening to "worthless" people in the slums, or as in this case, the specially constructed residential area for the dislocated poor.But the movie is fantastic. Those dead people, before they die, they live vibrant, meaningful, realistically textured lives. The film is gorgeously shot. The script and story structure are the work of skilled craftsmen and left nothing to desire for me. It seems to me to be a brilliant study of humanity and society, and every bit as hopeful as hopeless. That pulls it up into great art.This is one of the very few movies in the world that I look forward to watching again for the sheer pleasure of watching it unfold, even though I know what it's about, where it's going and where it will arrive.A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The harsh , brutal , cold reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brazil is a huge, vast country with enormous amounts of history and culture but having said that would you believe that only 10% of the population own 80% of its wealth? City Of God shows us what you could say is the hidden side of Brazil away from its glittery night life and laid back attitude, it is a cold, hard knock to the head which shows that the words 'Life is Cheap' live up to its expectations. The tag line of the movie is Fight and you won't survive , run and you won't escape and it could not be more closer to that as the movie shows us the life of kids/teens growing up in the slums of Rio De Janerio. Don't mistake this for a hyped up ghetto and glamorising gun-totting movie! City of God is a pure , raw side of life in the harsh slums of Rio where truly only the strong survive . The main character if you may is a guy called Rocket who just like any other teen dreams of the better things in life i.e. a good job , house , babes ! But always finds him-self down on his luck as he can never truly escape the dangers and problems that he faces growing up (as if being a teen is not tough enough!) The movie is then played out in a Pulp Fiction format showing the lives of the people around him and like him all of them have hopes and dreams but are all sucked into the harsh void of reality . The acting was top-notch all round and the direction of the movie just made you want more but to some it up in general City of God is an experiment with the truth which makes the likes of Snopp Dogg and 50 cent look like a bunch of playground bullies as it holds nothing back in showing the life faced living in Rio's slums and to what extend people will go to , to get what they want from life when circumstances don't give the basic things we take for granted in our lives. A powerful film and pleasure to watch.CITY OF GOD 9 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOODNIGHT AND GOOD LUCK !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review I wrote for Comparative Civilizations 12</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City of God" left me feeling stunned, na?ve and slightly guilty about my lack of knowledge concerning situations like the slum gangs of Rio de Janeiro. The characters seemed to exist with a sense of careless brutality. They were a generation of children, adolescent boys, and young men so used to the violence around them that they had become desensitized. I was expecting to feel extremely emotional by the end, simply because of the amount of graphic violence the film contained and the final death toll, but instead I was left with a surprising sense of detachment. To me though, the gang mentality seemed exactly that: detached, emotionally disconnected from reality and trapped in a vicious cycle of urban violence. It was particularly disturbing to see, for example, a group of boys perhaps nine to twelve-years old, walking calmly about the streets with guns in their hands and discussing the next person they would have to kill to better their lives. This film also highlighted widespread corruption within the Brazilian police force, showing cops eagerly taking bribes from gang members instead of making arrests. The movie managed to successfully inform me of a raw hostility found in many of these favelas or slum cities, but the characters did seem to be a bit romanticized for emotional impact. Visually, "City of God" was very realistic and compelling, the filming executed in such a way that the viewer would have to fight not to be pulled into the horrifying action. Although the rapidly advancing plot and large number of actors involved made this movie somewhat hard to follow at times, the general effect was very captivating and thought-provoking, and the ending seemed to come much too soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through the eyes of the protagonist, in this case through the camera lens of aspiring photographer, Rocket, a story of violence, drugs and sexual exploit unfolds with an irresistible flair that makes 'City of God (Cicade De Deus)' impossible to ignore.This exceptionally executed film gives audiences a chance to view the life of those living in the slums of Rio De Janiero, where drug dealing is an esteemed career and mindless murders occur without remorse or reason.Based on true events, 'City of God' presents a subtly confronting and shockingly blasé attitude towards the value of life, but also explores the aspects of innocence and vulnerability found in the most unexpected places. The traumatic lives of the characters within the film are perfectly depicted through the extremely realistic performances by some highly able and talented actors.I couldn't take my eyes off the screen - this is an excellent cinematic journey.

		<shortDescription>great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film City of God is about a slum on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. The film begins in the 1960's and follows the lives of two boys who choose radically different paths. The boys are known as Rocket and Lil' Ze. While the boys share a common history of growing up in the slum (ironically called the City of God), fate and circumstances ultimately lead them in different directions. Rocket aspires to be a photographer while Lil' Ze becomes a drug dealer and the leader of a large and powerful street-gang. The film is dark and extremely violent, and does an excellent job of showing the absolute poverty and hopelessness of life in the slums. By watching the characters develop over multiple decades, one can almost empathize with the brutality of their situation. City of God offers an unflinching look at poverty and life in the slums. The film is also very moving and puts a human face on an incredibly sad situation.One thing that I found particularly striking about the film was the general indifference and nonchalant attitude expressed by many of the characters toward violence. The film is filled with extremely violent and graphic scenes. There are multiple scenes of brutal violence directed toward children. This is the worst kind of violence, and the scenes are truly heartbreaking. There are also numerous scenes in which children themselves engage in violence. Apparently the film is based on actual events, which makes viewing the violence all the more intolerable. The sad reality of the situation was excellently portrayed by the film. I have images of pre-teenage children carrying guns and traveling in gangs seared into my memory. Most of the kids probably wouldn't even know how to read, but they can carry a gun and apparently kill without experiencing the slightest amount of regret. The film does a very good job of using these kinds of images to demonstrate the hopelessness of the situation.Almost every character in the film has been born into extreme poverty in which they are continually exposed to crimes of all sorts, drug use, and brutal violence. The odds are stacked against them, and one could hardly expect them to achieve anything better. Indeed, it would take an extremely strong willed person combined with an incredible amount of luck for one of these children to resist all of the negative influences and escape into a life of better opportunities. In the case of Rocket, however, this is exactly what happened. Through a series of events and random circumstances Rocket was mostly able to stay away from the world of drug dealing and gangsters. It was largely through a lucky set of circumstances that Rocket became more interested in photography than getting involved with gangs. It was because of this hobby, however, that ultimately allowed Rocket to escape the fate of so many others who happened to grow up in the City of God. Rocket was able to use his photography in order to document the violence that he encountered on the street. He then began selling the photos to a Brazilian newspaper. His photos would shock the world, and ultimately give him the freedom to escape the City of God.While Rocket was occupying himself with his photography, Lil' Ze was quickly moving up the ranks in the world of drug dealing. Eventually Lil' Ze would become a powerful drug dealer and would command a huge gang following. Through a series of events, Lil' Ze became involved in a street war with a rival drug dealer who commanded a gang of his own. Their war would lead to an extraordinary amount of violence that would ultimately come to affect the lives of everyone in the City of God. While Lil' Ze was occupied fighting battles and pursuing vendettas, Rocket was beginning to realize his gift for photography that would ultimately lead to his escape. Their stories are effective at putting a human face on a terrible situation. While Rocket was able to pursue his dreams and escape, far more children from the City of God ultimately succumbed to the hopelessness of their situation.</fullReview>

When two rival gangs start a full out war.. the boy decides to leave but it just might be too late for him........ This movie is a must see for any movie buff, although be aware it contains very violent scenes thus it is not for all kinds of people that said.. it is a great movie..... what adds to it is the fact that it is supposedly based in real events.... I do not doubt it as I have heard about the violence over there in South America is out of hand...... the DVD contains a documentary about Rio De Janeiro's gangs which will give you an insight into the sad reality they are living under over there.

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Brazilian Ghetto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on real events and set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, City of God has a lot in common in the scarcely believable 'Scarface'. It too traces the rise of a psychotic coke lord and has its share of drugs, guns, gang warfare, horrifying violence, sex, memorable characters, more guns, some sociological points that don't have to be concentrated on too hard to grasp, and more drugs. Ultimately City of God is more exciting than Scarface, more colourful and ultimately more brutal and depressing. Not least because the killers in this film are very young-as often as not, just children. And it is all the more chilling because many of the kids are played by non professionals from the poorer parts of Rio. The narrator is Rocket, who is growing up in Cidade de Deus, a sink estate on the edge of Rio, a place where baiting the police is a way of life, every child is destined to be a thug and making it past 18 years old is a real bonus. The toughest kid in Rockets neighbourhood is Little Ze and, as they reach their teens, Ze embarks on a reign of terror when his killer instinct helps coke them over from grass as one of the few commodities Rio's poor can sell its rich. City Of God's chief success is in pulling off a crucial balancing act. It manages to survey a world that is wild and thrilling and full of great music and good parties, but never lets up on the fact that it's also a death trap where eight year olds tout semi-automatics and friendship counts for nothing. A lot more than a cheap holiday in someone else's misery. Anyone who ever chanced to watch MTV's cribs or Hello magazine's At Home With The Stars kind of stuff-will have noticed that all rappers, nu-metallers and pop punks feel obliged to own the DVD of Scarface blood soaked tale of guns and coke dealing and claim that its the best movie of the sort ever made. Maybe, just maybe, some of them will find shelf space for City OF God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one the best foreign films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films of all time. The reason being is that as soon as I finished watching the film, I was compelled to watch it again straight after(the only film to have made me do this was The Usual suspects). It's very fast paced and it really sucks you in to the characters and their situations. The film gives the viewer a real insight in to what happens in this city and how life really is for it's inhabitants. You do empathise with the characters which is surprising considering how they live their lives, but I suppose that's the beauty of this film; it made me like this notorious characters, turning them in to anti-heros I suppose!I would recommend this film to everyone and anyone, but unfortunately there are still people out there who can't watch a film with subtitles, but thats their loss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all of the movies that I have seen (yes i have seen a lot), this is one of my favorites. The good acting and the good camera shots and genius directing make this movie a top 50 movie.All of the characters fit their part perfect. They act, talk, and look exactly the way that they should. The violence in this movie is also an eye opener to the rest of the world. Some of the worlds most dangerous gangs(The Red Command)and drug lords reside here in the favelas of Brazil. This movie also show how Brazil is one of the most beautiful places in the world despite the violence.Its a shame that its not a more popular vacation or tourist spot because Brazil is one of my favorite places in the world.Watch this movie!!</fullReview>

And it is a lot more original than his lastest "americanized" flick (the Gardner dude).The treatment of violence (and there is quite a bit of it) is definitely more realistic than any American blockbuster... And it therefore makes it more real and harder to watch - the violence has more "meaning" to it (if you can say that) than movies like History of Violence for example.

		<fullReview>I was sceptical when i first sat down and watched this film for the first time. Basically because i have never really been into foreign films, with all the western films being thrown into our faces with English as the main language. However i sat down and watched it, after hearing that this was similar to Goodfellas and many people saying that it is actually a better film!! i thought no way!!.However after watching the first 10 minutes i quickly forgot about the subtitles and i was hooked on this film, it is so well made, so well acted by actors that were acting for the first time!! that is incredible for example Lil'Ze, which probably was the best performance of the film. This film has now become one of my favourite films ever! and is better than my former favourite Goodfellas. The structure is complicated at first but after say two viewings of the film you pick up on everything. The messages it conveys and leaves you as the audience with are memorable and have a great impact, A powerful Film! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and unforgiving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this new documentary called "Favela Rising" that seemed to be inspired by Fernando Meirelles' powerful and trenchant "City of God". What impressed me about "City of God" was both its urgent social realism and its vibrant, propulsive energy. While the film's stark yet colorful images arrest you, Meirelles' handling of the issues besetting Brazil's slums -- from poverty, lack of access to education and social services, that escalate to violence and the drug trade -- is complex and responsible, but without being preachy. The main character Rocket's camera (apparently representing Meirelles' own lens) seemed to be an impartial witness to the proceedings and thus the violence becomes even more brutal and devastating because it seemed endemic and thoughtless, coming from the film's characters. The name "Ciudade de Dios", the favela where the interweaving narratives in this film are set, could be no further from the truth of the realities in that community."Favela Rising", the new documentary I saw, appears to attest to the continuing resonance of "City of God". The docu, on the other hand, deals with a Brazilian ex-drug dealer who starts a musical movement called Afro-Reggae to keep young people in his favela away from violence. While City of God ended tragically, Favela Rising ended on a more optimistic note. Nonetheless, both are compelling to watch and experience.</fullReview>

The cinematography has exciting pace and it is superbly directed. The film has many separate strands that all intertwine very creatively. There were some truly disturbing scenes in this film, mainly the ones involving young children as killers or victims. However it is an effective portrait of life in that environment and it is very powerfully conveyed. Another film that it is similar to is Boyz In The Hood although I preferred this one.

		<fullReview>This is a profound film with filmmakers that knew what they were doing. It was such an incredible experience to watch this film. It will stay with me for a long, long time. The only frustration is the ending. I just wanted it to be more. Perhaps it's my Hollywood sensibilities, but I just wanted our hero to win big. This wasn't a tragedy, he won the prize...but it wasn't big enough. In fact, I got very upset because I felt that he was PART of the problem. Because of his inability to expose the corruption, our hero (though he got the job), added many more years of violence, neglect, and suffering to his town. So I felt that in the end it was a Pyrrhic victory at best. It's a sad, sad commentary on everything. But again, truly an amazing film. Congrats to all of those involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps the most amazing movie ever done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most amazing movie ever done. Seriously, run and rent this movie- it was in such demand, I had to wait 3-4 months to get it from the library (though now Hollywood Video has unlimited movies for $10/month). No matter what your believe, your faith, your world ; it will blow you away. It's simply stunning- I spent 3? hours watching a 2:10 hours movie- because I had to stop and watch scenes over again because I couldn't believe what I had seen. This is a great movie, one that bears watching again and again, so you can see all you missed. Watched at normal speed, this has the impact of a shotgun shell to the chest- it's so concentrated and such a potent mix of film-making wizardry that it's overwhelming. It's not for the weak of heart or stomach ? one has to accept the casual exchange of bullets and death without crawling in a corner. But, for someone who has moved past that, it is the most impressive thing I've ever seen: the trials and tribulations of a group of Brazilian slum dwellers that will etch itself on your consciousness.Everything about this movie is brilliant- the film-making, the effects, the story structure, the twists. This thing hooks you and yanks you like a marlin, along with the boat. It is a exultant ride through the poor underworld of Rio de Janeiro and you better just hang on and ride. Again and again this movie swivels and twists, with it's point of view and origin, as participants expire, and one isn't sure who to root for. It will have you laughing, and gasping? in horror and recognition of the most basic and base human conditions.It starts with close-ups of chickens being slaughtered and hunted and the message is clear: one must kill or be killed- you're either the killer or the dinner, and the only job available is robber. The 720° circular pan transition flashback in the beginning where Rocket is caught between the armed gang and police is probably the best of film; this thing is so consummately skillful that it will leave you in the dust like eye-level Indy cars. It's impossible to be too critical of this movie- it yanks you do far out of your fame of reference into the brutal nihilistic world of the Rio de Janeiro favela that you only just marvel and gasp, and accept that it's beyond your understanding. It is the rise and fall, along with many others, of a crime boss, punk, ruthless psycho killer named Little Zee, and a story of salvation- of intelligence and luck- of a photographer Rocket (and his semi-good brah Goose) who makes a life apart from the milieu, but documents it ?.. and it's all breathtaking. One really doesn't notice that it's subtitled- one so identifies with the characters.My only objection is that the concrete row houses are light years ahead of actual conditions in the fetid squalid hillside shanty towns that 10 million each live in by Rio, Sao Paulo, Cairo, Mexico City (they show the real places in the 50 minute documentary). The rooster gets away. You won't.</fullReview>

I didn't care if they died or if they didn't. No of them had any kind of morals including the main character, who was kind of weak and easy to manipulate. Maybe this was the intention.

Yet another "based" on a true story films, this movie paints the day to day violence of the 1960-80's slums of Rio DE Janeiro with a eclectic yet predictable color: red. By the end of the movie you are grateful our hero has escaped the pains of his upbringing, but you may be unsure you needed to relive it along side of him. -An artfully crafted film, the director takes us through a series of flashbacks, ending the film from where we began. This of course has been done before, and although I like the directors method of composition, in several sections we actually watch a couple of segments through twice over.

		<fullReview>As a comfortably middle classed, American living in suburbia, my initial reaction is whoa! This one packs a punch. At first, it is honestly difficult to care about a single character. But then it hits you, these are all children, kids. All the main characters doing the killing are kids. This draws you into the film and the thought that many (if not all) of these kids never really had a chance. Rocket is fortunate to become interested early on in the craft of photography and this interest paves the way for a better life for him. However, others who only know about survival and aren't privy to extracurricular interests like Rocket's have their fates sealed. Benny is the other character you begin to care about. He realizes too late there is more to life than being a hood. He spares a life that later takes his own. Such is the cycle of violence that infects the City of God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's most remarkable about this film is how dramatically similar the circumstances and conditions are to those that are present in Los Angeles, Guatemala City, New York, Port Au Prince, Kingston, Chicago, Miami, Mexico City, San Pedro Sula, New Orleans, Baghdad, Palestine, Johannesburg, Bombay, etc. The tragic brilliance of this film is that it's not a unique story at all.City of God, the film, depicts the same hell that is described so vividly in the so-called "Gangsta Rap" from African American and Latin American youth and in it's peer art forms elsewhere around the world (e.g., Ragga/Dancehall). City of God, the housing project, is simply one in millions of similar housing "projects" (experiments) that create horrendous conditions that both stretch and degrade human imagination to degrees that result in a shocking devaluation of all life.For some strange, sad reason, poor people of color suffer similar recurring tragedies and pathologies that are far more complex than the typical "they are animals, imprison them" socio-reduction of reactionaries and conservatives and aren't nearly as 'romantic' as some apologists and liberals might have us believe.I watch films like City of God, Menace II Society, Pixote, Salaam Bombay, Carlito's Way etc. not just for entertainment, but in the hopes extracting gems from the storytelling and getting closer to understanding why some people make the choices they make, and in the hopes of discovering why it always seems to be the poor Black and Brown people who die in the streets.</fullReview>

The only shame of making a film like this is how do you follow it? Well it seems a made-for-TV sequel is how you do it. Shame, but when a big film/TV studio offers megabucks to cash in on the fame of the original, it must've been impossible to turn away. Still, I have seen a lot of films over the last few years and nothing quite beats this. I cannot fault it at all - except that it did have to end.

The character details are immense and detailedly told and the use of different and multiple camera angles is a technical triumph. While most films use flashbacks in a confused and inappropriate manner, this film manages, somehow, to weave them in the exact right time to explain and give further detail to people and situations without taking away the mood of the moment.Highly, highly recommend, but be warned, the explicit violence, most involving children may be far too much for many viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real life story of terror and heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin with a minor rant: The front of the DVD case depicts a guy and a girl sitting on a beach, one kissing the other, and a group of hoodlums standing around, some holding guns, though that really isn't the clearest picture you see. The colors are warm. The tagline is "15 miles away from paradise... one man will do anything to tell the world everything."The back talks about a young man's passion for photography, that takes him though a rough life just outside of Rio de Janero. There are, again, some nice pictures of women and our main character with a camera.Whoever was in charge of marketing this movie ought to be fired. The DVD case and plot summary, while similar to some plot points, are wholly inaccurate compared to what the movie contained.That's not to say it was a disappointing flick, however. The movie was amazingly brilliant. I would almost classify it as a war movie, though unlike "Blackhawk Down" and "Saving Private Ryan" this movie is not about national wars, but rather gang wars. Also, unlike the aforementioned duo, this movie isn't boring as all heck.It's amazing to see the acting that comes out of these kids. They're completely unknown, un-Oscar-fied, but they emote better than Halle Berry could ever dream. There are times when your heart really goes out to the terror that they are feeling, while simultaneously committing the same atrocities to those around them. The storytelling is sophisticated in a "Pulp Fiction" kind of manner, showing you the "end" before the beginning. The film making techniques are modern and professional. There is tension, there is sympathy, there is the viewer rooting for the hero (though hardly seen throughout the movie) against impossible odds.All this, and it's based on a true story. Who knows how truly accurate the story is to the real life counterpart, but it terrifies me more than "Blackhawk Down" or even gore-fests like "Dawn of the Dead" ever could. Simultaneously, it shows a lot of promise in the world when these actors with so much talent and heart have come from the very place this film is about.The movie does kind of feel like it's dragging on (though it's only a dime over two hours), but when I think back, pretty much every detail was necessary.So, whether or not you think you can take the casual violence, this movie will chill you. I would highly recommend this to everybody.5 little dice out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One For The Millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'City of God' should and will be at the top of any list of movies for film courses from the New Millennium for many years to come. In terms of thematic development, political commentary, social importance, technical mastery and sheer energy it really has no equal since 2000. This is truly a mesmerizing piece, in which the events of many years are compressed into a few hours; like the early scene of the boy spinning about in a grievously perilous tight spot, we are left whirling when we exit the theater.We probably are first captured by the daring of the film. No slow starter, we are almost immediately plunged into a world of not just Rio's more disadvantaged side, but the loosely organized machinations of the most audaciously aggressive slum gangs we have ever seen. That these loose associations of crime lord fiefdoms are populated with youngsters is a revelation; nothing like it has been seen on screen. Consistent with the passions (misguided as they often are) of youth the frenetic pacing is so alluring it remains a complete mystery why the general film-going audience of the U.S, always whining for action (read violent) films, did not choke theaters in huge numbers. Want an action film with hip stars and great music? Well, here it is! Camera positioning ? as in the shots of a man in flight, running through the streets and houses, seen from above, now around a corner, is so adroitly accomplished it is a wonder even non-film students don't rise and cheer at the mastery. An evolutionary montage of events taking place in a drug dealer's apartment have no equal in film as an example of compressing time and yet clearly allowing us to follow the sequence of events. The injuring (shooting) of young children in the course of the film is so unsettling even hard-core violence-in-film seekers will wince. The realism of this scene and others promote the documentary feel we have seen in some recent ('Traffic', opening of 'Amores Perros') films. All of these moments are documented from the POV of Rocket, the only one of the three boys we follow through the years that do not go the way of the gun but has found instead a camera to capture images. The in-your-face consideration of violent situations (and there a lot of them) is quite palpable. This is grit-your-teeth stuff, designed to repel, not attract us. Co-director Fernando Meirelles notes in an interview (www.slantmagazine.com/film/features/fernandomeirelles.asp) that 'When you watch my film, you don't want to be part of these gangs.' And it comes across that way, unlike the much more deified image 'Scarface' Al Pacino posters illustrate to this day.Originally scripted from a successful book by Paulo Lins, he is cited on the official web site by way of explaining his reasons for launching the project: 'I am very happy that my book Cidade de Deus is reaching more and more people through this film?.This will enable us to increase the debate on violence, misery, abandonment and education in Brazil.' (http://cidadededeus.globo.com/). Rating: Four Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is, in a word, amazing. From the first dazzling 360-degree camera shot, you'll be hooked. From there you'll be taken through a rush of gripping, shocking plot twists and brilliant direction. The plot follows an aspiring photographer who wants to use his skill to make something of himself and escape the slums. The characters he meets throughout the film are very memorable, some likable, some psychotic. The film has a such a realistic style, you could be fooled into thinking you are watching a documentary, and in fact all the actors are locals who live similar lives to their on-screen characters. This is one of the most unforgettable films of the past few years- don't miss it!</fullReview>

It is totally different of previous Brazilian movies and worths to be seen even by those who have hated all Brazilian movies that have watched.Fernando Meirelles' masterpiece depicts with extreme realism the sad situation of millions of people who live in constant terror in brazilian slums. People grow learning not to give any value to life. They are under the barbaric rule of drug lords and do not have much chance to change their situation.This movie shows the battle between two factions for the control of the traffic in the slum and the fight of one inhabitant of the slum to leave this nightmare.</fullReview>

It has a little mix of Stand by Me, Lord of the Flies and Pulp Fiction all rolled into one. This film is completely breath-taking from start to its gruesome finish. If you don't have a strong gut then its not for you as there are some extremely violent scenes, and you have to keep in mind all the time that they are just kids. The directing is superb, the story is told from one young lad's point of view about several different people with the excellent use of flashbacks. The story itself is an amazing one - this is a must-see film. (Even though it is in Portuguese).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God's central story revolves around two opposing drug-rings in the title city. These two rings, although related to one-another, divide the city in tyranny, gangs, wealth, power and in the end moral stance. These rings are run by Little Ze and Carrot, two hoods who have grown up murdering, stealing, and influencing others. Each ring is composed of kids, (infants really) teens, and young adults, all waiting to become the next Lord of their city.Oddly enough, our narrator, our eyes throughout the movie, does not play much of a direct influence on either side of the war. He's definitely involved, but his story focusses on survival and choosing the correct path, one of individualism.The style of this movie can only be described as cool. It is very much a product of the Tarrantino generation-and proof, once again, of North America's influences over other cultures. In a sense, the film is very much like the character Benny, who decides he wants to start looking `groovier' and more seventies-orientated. City of God dresses itself in the fashions of another culture in order to stand out amongst a crowd of replicates.When we first see the story unravel through the 1960's, the rio slums are portrayed as a gold-saturated and content world, not luxurious or perfect, but still has a chance for hope. By the end of this film, it is tinted blue, gritty, puddles of blood cover the concrete. It is no place to be alone.We are tied to the story by one neutral character, Rocket, who, although inactive through most of the film, is the most empathetic since he never pulls a trigger. He is virtually the only character to not take the life of another.Roger Ebert described the film as a masterpiece, `One of the best films you'll ever see!' Of course this is a very bold statement, but City of God is definitely a movie you will remember.If there's one thing that makes this movie so unforgettable, it is the dramatic reality we witness. Using real people that more or less act as themselves, directors Katia Lund and Meirelles have created a documentary in the sense that what we see happened and continues to happen in slums like this all over the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough to Watch But Well Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several times now I have gotten into discussions with people regarding this film. The most common criticism that I hear is "how could you watch children killing children." I have to say that it is a fair criticism of the subject matter of the film but not of the film it self. This film is based on actual events that took place in the seventies in the slums of Rio. The film is brilliant at catching the desperation of some of the poorest people in the world. For many people in the US this kind of poverty coupled with violence is unimaginable and the shock can be quite powerfull. I applaud the filmmakers for artfully completing such a difficult task. The cinematography is magnificent. Alexandre Rodrigues beautifully does his part at portraying the difficulties that all teenagers face growing up (sex, carrer, frienship etc...) but with the extra challenge of having to deal with growing up with one of the most dangerous neiborhoods in the world. Over all a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been hearing about City of God for several months before actually seeing it, so naturally I expected great things from this film having heard nothing but great reviews from everyone else who had seen it before me. But really, this film exceeded all expectationsThe film follows the story of Rocket (who also narrates the film), a wannabe photographer, through his life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. His brother is involved in a gang who call themselves the Tender Trio, whose main interest is "holding up" and robbing the gas truck that runs through the city.The trio remain close friends until the looting of a motel brings severe consequences, which concludes by our finding out that some of the group died, went to jail etc.Then there was L'il Dice, who becomes the dominant focal point of the film as it progresses. L'il Dice is in the same group of kids as Rocket, and he also has a brother in the Tender Trio. It was L'il Dice's job to keep watch at the motel robbing, and we later discover his terrible involvement in that particular incident.L'il Dice becomes more and more involved with gang culture and drug money, eventually (under the new name L'il Ze) heading one of the biggest gangs in Rio along with his friend Benny, who also acts as Ze's conscience.What struck me about this film is the huge shock factor that is delivered straight from the first scene (chasing a chicken through the streets of the slums). The violence is gratuitous, so much so that everyone is totally desensitized to it by the end of the film. All parts in the film are played magnificently, special mention should go to Phellipe Haagensen for his excellent Benny portrayal, and Alexandre Rodriguez and Leandro Firmino for their performances of Rocket and L'il Ze respectively.This film is an honest must see for drama lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They shoot people in opera's don't they...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes this is a violent film that will turn the stomach inside-out (and the eyes away) for many viewers. While I'm more worried about those who might laugh at sections of the film, some people who feel like they already get more than enough of their daily allowance of vitamin violence, I guess should skip this film.This gripping, powerful film. It soars like an opera for me, and aren't most operas rife with violence, if not rife with assault rifles? The stylish presentation here, I fear will make the gunplay intoxicating for some immature viewers, but it is not hard to see that the hoodlum's life in the favela is fleeting, frantic and fatalistic.The story unfolds in little ellipses. We often get a glimpse of an action and than cycle back in time to once again rendezvous at the same scene from a slightly different point of view. That is flashy, as is the camera work. We get one fine use of strobe lighting; stop-action speed-ups to demean the marauding murders; and an opening 360 camera-spin for time travel.This is talent on display that rises above the morass at the heart of this film. In addition there is some explosive acting going on as well, I thought *both* actors that played Li'l Dice were remarkable. The younger of the two in particular delivers such a sinister grin and glee during a shooting spree that his look is more wretched than the result of his action. And yet it is completely child-like. Yikes...Shooting appears to be the only way out of these slums, with our Ishmael (call him, Rocket) choosing to shoot with a camera. The feeling that violence and the traffic is an inescapable quicksand is done well, there's a great set of shots where Rocket crosses Li'l Ze (nee Dice)'s path at every turn. It conjures just a hint of humour...Little scenes like that, and the benevolent Benny help to keep this from being just a torrid, horrid gore-fest. Indeed the Benny stretch serves as an eye in the middle of the hurricane. But this film reminded me of the early seasons of HBO's 'Oz" where I just felt my stomach ratcheting up towards my throat time and time again. The innocence of children seen by me most recently with "In America" is blown away, there's no redemption here, not even for the Runts. Revenge is served as a hot, flaming dish, and one that consumes even those who prepare it.Ultimately, I think the truth is somewhere between the extremes of the maudlin and the malicious. But in both camps, kids live in a form of unreality...it's just that in the "City of God" they all too readily die there as well. This film has its hope cornered in and caught in such a cross-fire, you can hardly believe it will survive, if anything the accompanying documentary on the DVD was even more stark. Tracing the story out of the film's fiction and favelas leads to an even more complex crisis.Now that's hard to watch...because it's hard to see. This film was hard to watch, but well worth it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City Of God is based on actual events that went on in the ghettos of Rio De Janeiro from the eyes of one who grows to be a photographer(Rocket). The picture is very grainy because it's shot w/ a Digi-cam but its graininess bring the film out. Backed by a solid and unorthodox script, Cidade De Deus is actually one of the better crime stories you will see. The film presents the street life from the Brazilian perspective and it's very believable as Rio De Janeiro, Brazil is one of the more hostile, though beautiful, cities in the world - not to mention the fact that I lived in Jamaica at one point in my life and saw the similarities such as little kids running around with guns and the struggle itself. The script does a lot of the "what comes around goes around" thing with some particular characters and shows that no matter who you are that if you push a man enough times that he will start to push back. 'Cidade' introduces its characters with a story up to their certain point in time which would their first moments in the film or to get to know them more. The film personally was a treat for me because at first I had never heard of it then I kept hearing about it then realized that this is a foreign-urban film that fits w/ the likes of Menace II Society, Boyz N The Hood, Paid In Full - the theme is somewhat identical to the recent Never Die Alone which has this film as a recommendation...Cidade De Deus gets the full 10 from me, A great solid all-around film and a bonus for crime movie lovers or 'hood flicks(like myself)</fullReview>

Not only does it give you an insight into the life of Brazilians, but the numerous gangs and weapons in the City of God. The amount of weapons they use are outrageous, but that is the real lief in the dangerous streets of the City of God. Most viewers find this movie disturbing, but I cannot say that is relevant for me. I looked at the crime as a symbol of pride and revenge. Although this movie is in Portugese, I found it hard to understand who was talking because of I had to read the subtitles very quickly.

		<fullReview>CITY OF GOD is a bit self-indulgent, a film that shuns on the gangster lifestyle yet always eager to promote it. Martin Scorsese and Tarantino's influences run heavy in this nearly 3 minute saga about life in the slums of Rio De Janero. As a result, it's hard to enjoy the subject matter as you're hit over the head with garish displays of a filmmaker gone wild. Nonetheless, the performances are top notch. A group of unknowns perfectly execute the instability of teenagers with access to guns, drugs and money. In one instance, a gruesome scene seems so real, you want to turn your head. Still, I stuck with the main character throughout the picture, a sign that the screenwriter had done his homework when taking on such a daunting adaptation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God is a vivid, compelling work of art. Not only do directors Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles tell an amazing coming of age story, but they also graphically display the violence and danger of life in the slums of Rio. This is a place where one certainly does not have to look for trouble to find it. Children grow up with a gun in their hand and a nonexistent conscience. School and work are frivolous activities reserved for the weak and meek. Hoodlums, as they are called, can become revered for their crimes and "getting out" is something frequently discussed but rarely done.Rocket(Alexandre Rodrigues) narrates the film as one of the few characters who does not fall victim to a gangster lifestyle. This is one case where each character is truly victimized, whether they are killing, being killed or just trying to stay out of the way. The film shows, with unparalleled clarity, how incredibly young children can become murderers. It also depicts the innate differences in people even in this environment.Rocket's brother Goose, along with a couple buddies, get the story going and set the foundation for what will become a horrible cycle. Children start out idolizing the current hoodlum leaders and "grow up" to become killers, thieves and rapists. Long before their wicked florescence, what innocence they had is lost by constant exposure to grotesque violence. As leadership is fought for constantly, and drugs become the most important commodity in the city's economy, Rocket tries to have a much more subdued adolescence. He isn't that interested in taking up the family business of selling fish, but he also does not want to be a hoodlum like his brother. He smokes pot and hangs out with the groovy crowd. He does consider crime. On a bus and at a diner he tries his hand at robbery, but never gets the gun out of his pocket. People he encounters seem to be "too cool" for him to steal from. Later on, he gets a job delivering papers, hoping he can eventually use his interest in photography to escape his abysmal surroundings.Subplots abound and they are wonderfully thought-out and executed. Things we suspect are substantiated and things we never thought of are uncovered. Its all so tightly wrapped and succinctly told with such velocity that I was astonished to find that I had just watched a two hour movie. City of God is an amazing movie thats a surefire classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vivid movie about hope and despair in Brazil's slums</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brazil's National Office of Tourism must have been non too pleased about this film. As a Northern suburbanite, to me Brazil has always meant soccer, samba and bossa nova. If I were to pick three destinations for a trip, Brazil would be right up there. Before seeing this movie, that is.I remember reading a review of City of God last year. I remembered two things about the review: it was positive, and the image that accompanied it was the one that appears at the top of the DVD cover. I expected a story to match that picture: hot and sensual. Boy was I in for a surprise.City of God follows the life of Rocket, a young boy trapped in the misery of Rio's slums. He wants to escape this so-called "City of God" and become a photographer.The City of God is a favela, a slum, where Rio de Janeiro's poor are unceremoniously dumped, to "clean the streets". It's a tough place to live when times are good. It is pure hell when times are bad.Rocket, Li'l Z and Bene were three childhood friends. They grew up but took different paths: Li'l Ze and Bene chose the path of crime. They become partners in the most powerful gang of the favela. Li'l Ze is the ruthless head of the gang, while Bene is the more level-headed right arm.Rocket decides that a life of crime is not for him and that he would rather pursue his lifelong passion, photography. But in the slums, it's hard not to contribute to the violence. It's even harder to escape it.The characters are entirely believable, they are well fleshed out and played marvelously by the actors, most of whom were acting for the first time.The camera work in this movie is somewhat disconcerting. At certain times, it looks like a big budget movie. At other times, the jittery camera and ever-changing shot angles make it feel more like a documentary. The camera play adds a lot to the movie's intensity.Another interesting trick is the way the director makes use of flashbacks. The movie is one big recounting of events, accompanied by flashbacks within The Flashback. Flashbacks are nothing new, of course, but the way it was used in City Of God was refreshing. I believe the reason for that is explained in the credits. I think saying what happens in the credits would be considered a spoiler, so I won't say anything about it. But if you're one of those people who turn off the DVD as soon as the credits start rolling, you would be wise to make an exception in this case.This is an excellent but disturbing movie. The director did not try to sugarcoat the gang problem in Rio's favelas. As most people know, one of those problems is the prevalence of gangs of children committing violent crime in the city. They have a name, but I forget what it is. Well, the director does not shy away from using child actors in violent and crude scenes.As a Northerner, seeing children being shot at point blank, screaming in pain and fear is unnerving. I'm sure if the movie had been made in America, there is no way such a scene would have been allowed. It would have changed the movie's rating to NC-17. That is, if they had allowed it to be released at all.I'm not sure what issues Brazilian movies usually tackle, but I found this one to be particularly well made. I especially enjoyed the fact that it was distributed in original Brazilian Portuguese with subtitles, instead of being dubbed.Even though I don't speak or understand Portuguese, I've never been big on dubbing. No matter how well they are made, I've never seen a dubbed translation that allowed all the subtleties of the original to transpire. Of course, subtitles are even worse with regards to content. There's no way to make the subtitles keep up with with the spoken text. But what you lose in content, you retain in atmosphere and feeling. To me, that is more important.This is a movie about hopes and dreams, pain and despair. We've seen it a lot in ghetto movies from the '90s and the beginning of the '00s; think Boyz n The Hood and the like. But it has rarely been told so vividly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As they say, "And now the film...."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have waited for some time to view the dvd from Netflix, and when it finally arrived this week I watched it with great interest. Previously, I had read some of the reviews and in fact discussed the film last week with a really bright Brazilian kid as he shined my shoes in a big Washington hotel. Hardly an objective lead up to actually seeing and reviewing the film, but since another Imdb subscriber recently took me to task (lamely, it must be noted) for being unoriginal, I wanted to provide a full disclaimer.First, this is not a bad film at all. It may not be as great as the hype and ratings suggest, but it has a lot of things going for it that easily transcend all the chatter. I like its internal structure, well edited if not totally original, portraying the interconnected lives of a small group of favela dwellers over a period of time. Although fast-paced, the story thread is never lost, and part of its charm is that it separates the essential humanity (or lack thereof) of the characters themselves from the changing context in which we see them from time to time as they develop or evolve. That is where art divides from any overt political screed.To me, filmed evocations of violence properly contrasted with a message of hope are not objectionable in and of themselves. And they can be seen in any culture, in any country, at any time. The measure of cinematic excellence rests on whether art effectively connects with its objects, and is ultimately truthful to its own message irrespective of how the viewer otherwise regards that message.As someone intimately connected with a sharply divided community in terms of culture and class, I sense that this story is indeed universally applicable, and the film itself is a fine piece of work in telling that story.</fullReview>

It tells the history of gang presence in the slum with amazing pace. What is most notable about this film is that the story is told by probably the only neutral character in the slum. Rocket is an aspiring photographer who is the only innocent person we really meet in the City of God. He tells the story of Lil Ze's rise to the rank of boss of the slum while taking the time to familiarize himself with the audience. While in some ways Lil Ze's monopolization of the City of God has a positive effect on the slum's impoverished residents, it eventually leads the slum from bad to worse. There are a few subplots that stray away from Lil Ze's struggle to gain power. Some of the subplots involve Rocket as he works to become a photographer, his brief and comical brush with crime, and his neverending struggle to lose his virginity. All of these tie in nicely with the story and the audience never feels that they do not belong in the film.City of God has a very documentary feel to it which makes it seem authentic. Actually, if I am not mistaken, the film was based on true events, which is a frightening thought. The film is quite violent too. However, it is not the violence that stays with you after watching it. It is the fact that many of the people shooting at and killing others are just kids. In the film, there are small children who, as one put it, "smoke, snort, kill, and rob." This makes them feel like men. This is quite disturbing as the children look as if they are no where near their tenth birthday, and many of them will never see theirs. City of God utilizes this to leave a profound effect on the audience long after the movie is overwith, which is why I felt compelled to give this film ****. I was prepared to buy it without seeing it and am now going to make it the next film to grace my dvd collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by this movie, definitely one of the top ten best i have ever seen. There is not one bad thing i could say about his movie, it was always moving forward and constantly kept your interest level high. The acting was brilliant all the way around. The realness the movie offers i cannot compare to any other film. The closest thing that it resembles is a Larry Clark type movie(Kids, Bully)but far above and beyond those. I can't say enough good things to justify how amazing this movie is.Totally shocking, you just have to see it for yourself to understand. Also to add, i am no fan of subtitles but the way this movie moves you hardly notice you are reading, its just that damn good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God is one of the greatest of it's kind. It shows how children in this lot can be effected at such a young age to become what is most feared. Some parts of this film are incredibly painful to watch, but it's not really the realistic violence, it's the situation. Almost documentary like, the acting is exceedingly good by these young amateurs. Similar to Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant' where the child actors are so real, that it doesn't even seem like acting. It never strays off to miss it's point, as well as the story. It does what it needs to do, in a unique way. I'd recommend it, for it doesn't glorify the lifestyle these children live, but it also doesn't really make them the villain either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Heaven set in Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American movies depicting violence have become very formulaic. So much so that the movies are protraying how violence in cinema works, not in real life.The City of God takes on the true story of a young boy whose must grow up in the notorious but innapropriately named brazillian suburb of the title.Living in fear of his life, like most people there he gets on with his life. While there is the horror of the suburb there is also the joy of being attracted to a beautiful girl and the hope of a future. American movie makers often concentrate on the hopelessness of the unfortunate rather than recognise any hope.The way violence is portrayed in the this differs all the time, reflecting the many different circumstances. There is also a complacency to the violence that is more shocking that anything else. Like Dante's story of the descent into hell, going into the inner circle is ultimately the only way out, first through purgatory and finaly (we hope) heaven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CIDADE DE DEUS is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. Actually, I haven't seen many. Hopefully, since this movie started that trend with me, that category will become more popular with me.CIDADE DE DEUS is about street gangs in Rio de Janeiro, aka Cidade de Deus, aka the City of God. The story begins with the characters Ze Pequeno (Leandro Firmino), Buscape (Alexandre Rodrigues), and Dadinho (Douglas Silva) as children watching their older peers participate in the action. Not long after, these children are grown and initiated into the very same street gangs to embark on lives full of crime, violence, drugs, and eventual downward spiral.This movie manages to exemplify just how strongly street gangs really affect people. It shows the effects on the members' families, as well as the members themselves. The fact that the peer pressure and the desire to be in these gangs is so strong is horrifying and devastating. And the fact that Rio de Janeiro is really like this is shocking and heartbreaking.I think the shot that can sum up the whole movie best is when the young boy being newly initiated into one of the gangs is told to shoot the small, sobbing boy in either the hand or the foot. The expression on the crying boy's face and his shriek when the bullet is fired will show you just how impacting and important this movie really is.The acting is great, but the actors are essentially playing themselves. The direction is remarkable, and the cinematography and poignancy of the film itself leave such an incredible lasting impression.Don't let the subtitles fool you (although, I don't know why they would). This is truly a movie to marvel at and one not to be missed. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God is the name of one of the poorest areas of the glamorous Rio de Janeiro. Despite its name, it seems that God does not usually come that way and it is perfectly normal, because he could go out with a bullet in his head. The film tells the story of two boys that were born in City of God who become two people totally different - one an honest photographer's apprentice and the other a dangerous drug dealer. But the main subject is not poverty or drugs, which are present throughout the film, it is violence.Violence is the norm in this area - the police waste bullets in killing people that they see as suspicious, unscrupulous criminals kill whole families to have fun, children with guns murder without showing mercy... Violence is a fact, it is a reality, and we have it so internalized that we are not able to stop to value it. Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund manage to make the spectator think and realize that it is an inhuman act what is committed in these scenes, but it happens everyday and nobody sees it, nobody lifts a finger to solve it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this was a powerful tale of despair in amongst violence, and that it was a very well received piece.It's the tale of Rocket, a young boy who grows up in the slums in the City of God, and who witnesses at first hand the full extent of conflict.In the City of God, violence is a cancer which spreads and engulfs its host, and no one can escape from it unless they are very, very lucky.Rocket's love of photography may just be his passport out, but with the city under the iron fist of Li'l Ze, a gang leader with a totalitarian control of the city, realising his dreams may not be easy, or indeed possible at all.There are many, many characters in City of God, and each of them get a significant amount of screentime which gives the movie a depth few others can achieve due to the effective grittiness of how their respective stories are told.The main problem I have with this story is that somehow it fails to really suck you in. A movie like this relies on drawing emotion from the viewer, and having a genuine view of each character be it hate, love, empathy, or sympathy. In City of God, too few characters achieve this.I found myself having feelings only about Li'l Ze and Knockout Ned. The likes of Benny, Shaggy, Carrot and the main protagonist Rocket drew very little from me.It took until about an hour and a half in before I felt truly part of the story which, for me, is too long.Putting this flaw aside, City of God is a very well told movie, which uses effective direction. It's just a pity I felt like I was watching events from afar rather than right inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although a lot of people have commented on the horror of this excellent film, I've yet to read any comments about it's humour. From the opening scene with the escape attempt by the chicken I knew I was going to enjoy this film and like Pulp Fiction and Good Fellas (though I didn't really want to compare) there's enough laugh out loud dialogue (the hot banana?) to pluck you back into the comfort zone and pull your jaw from the floor after the more harrowing scenes. The scenes with Benni are particularly heart warming, although you always kinda know you are being led down a path that will eventually lead to a sticky end. Some people have suggested there's too much realistic violence in City of God. Well .. if you prefer the pantomime violence of films like Lethal Weapon or Beverly Hills Cop then you don't deserve to see films as good as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film while I was in Italy as it is hard to find in the states. I only heard about it due to a Oscar spotlight on some cable channel and it peaked my interest. I viewed it with high expectations and was blown away by everything about this movie. The cinematography and script were great. Even the first time performances by the actors were impressive. However, most important is that I actually cared about the characters and story after the movie was over. Other good movies, such as the Lord of the Rings movies, were engaging yet during the end credits reality returns and you're back to your life. This is not true with City of God. The people, places, and situations are all real and the film really opens your eyes to a different life. Although graphic, the film is never gratuitous. Yet more sensitive people may not be able to view this movie. My only complaint is that it was a little slow in the very beginning and it took me a while to sort the characters out. The rest of the movie more than makes up for this flaw though. Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I implore you to give it a try if you have not already.</fullReview>

The story, told in a non-linear fashion, hits you with a memorable scene and/or line at all the right times. This film sets the benchmark one notch higher for ultra-violent dramas in the spirit of Pulp Ficiton and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

		<fullReview>This is like a documentary with nervous shivering camera work, but still telling a story and telling it in a good way. The movie has a rumour of being very violent and it is of course, because of the subject: Gang wars in Rio.However, the camera mostly moves away when the violence occurs, but you still get the message. This is a kind of slum, which you seldom find in the West. It's a slum were rising fear and murders are the only way to get dignity and where the police force applauds this and sell you more weapons. It might have to with the color of your skin, but mostly of the fact that you are poor. It's social apartheid.The weakest part here is maybe the story in itself, for this is in fact how gangster movies were narrated already in the 30s. It's not a punch in the stomach as some commentators have told you, but it might make you start thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish tragedy...shocking but stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(this may contain some spoilers)Some people have compared this film to other, mostly American gangland movies like "Gangs of New York", etc. But this is no mainstream gang movie; There's no De Niro, No Scorsese. This is a shocking, brutal film where an amateur cast of children and teenagers shoot and kill and where guns are more ubiquitous than toys. City of God, based on real life events, follows a cast of children as they grow up in the Rio slum known as City of God. It centers on the character of Rocket, who emerges as virtually the only cast member who is able to transcend himself out of his existence and make something of himself. Otherwise, there's little attempt to "Hollywood"-ize the experience of these kids. There's no supporting cast of abusive moms or alcoholic fathers to excuse away these kid's behaviour. That's not the point. (But a scene early in the film where a man kills his wife for cheating on him and then buries her in a hole in their living room works wonders in explaining how these children may get their behaviour and violence from...)The film is filled with haunting images....the most haunting of which involve the youngest children. The infamous scenes of L`il Dice as a child of 10 grinning with an almost ecstatic glee as he opens fire on his enemies shocks to the core. I wish I could say this film is redeeming. The main character Rocket's incapacity to commit violence and his own brave escape from this hell is indeed heart-warming in its own sense...but at the film's end as we watch this cycle of crime passing on to a newer, even younger generation of gangsters, you can't help but walk away feeling rather depressed and cynical. All in all though, as a film, it's a major accomplishment, it's stylish, unique, even funny, and as far from Hollywood as you can get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly fantastic film. The art direction, cinematography and overall style is easily better than any movie up for an Oscar this year. It is unfortunate (due both to the release timing and Oscar timing) that this film was not up for Best Picture.The plot of this film is by far secondary to the methodology of the storytelling. Few films are able to so completely portray the conditions of a particular locale as this film. The juxtaposition of the lush and beautiful Brazilian rainforest landscapes against the harsh, gritty urban lifestyles portrayed in the movie creates and moving, entralling visual masterpiece. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested more in visual artistry than plot and story development. At the same time, this is not to say that the story is irrelevant, just that you cold easily watch this film sans audio and still be very aware and concerned with the development of the characters. Overeall, it is a very moving and beautiful piece.</fullReview>

This is a movie more people should see, as its implications regarding poverty, politics, violence, drug dealing, guns, and human nature are rich and complex. There are so many different themes you could follow, so much meaning to this movie, which to top it all off, is based on a true story, it could be the basis of numerous theses, criticism and essays.

The cinematography and editing are excellent, though it does movie very fast in the beginning so it's hard to keep up with the story, but it does slow down as it goes on. However, there are so many great and creative shots--one in particular, when in a nightclub, everyone's dancing and the strobe light is flashing and one man shoots another and everybody leaves. It's excellent, and a damn shame it didn't win the cinematography Oscar (Same for editing).Not only the best, it's also the most realistic. The cinematography, which I already mentioned, acting, directing, script, editing, all makes like you're actually in Brazil.

		<shortDescription>`Once Upon A Time In America' for the year 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When violence is a language and survival a word written in blood, when children kill and get killed by the sound of laughter, life runs faster than a chicken running away from the knife. There, in the City Of God. `Cidade De Deus' (City Of God) is the name of a multi-family social housing project constructed in the sixties, that became a huge slum quarter (`favela') in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro and a center for drug traffic in Brasil. The film, by the same name, makes the raw and fascinating portrait of the transformation of the kids from the block into mega drug dealers of the seventies and early eighties. From the eyes of Buscapé (Alexandro Rodrigues), a poor, sensitive black kid growing in that universe of violence, we see the gathering of the pieces of rubble that make a great real story. Buscapé has the dream of becoming a photographer, and his lack of courage to enter in a life of crime will ultimately place him in the center of one of the biggest gang wars ever to occur in the city of Rio. In the space between the lines lies a beautiful story that is a truthful register of the growth of urban inhumanity. The city that grows and surrounds the quarter that has no light, no schools and no sanitation, forgotten by the government. It's that people with no hope or jobs that slowly penetrates into crime, from small robberies into achieving the full majority: drugs. And weapons. The film dissects the structure of violence, the traffic and the corruption from whence it feeds from. But beyond that, the story shown is much more than a superficial aesthetic display of crime. The story is transmitted in the small details, in gestures of guilt, corruption, friendship. The realism of the language and images is complete, without ideological sermons. This is `Once Upon A Time In America' for the year 2000. This is a great film.</fullReview>

I'll admit I was interested...the story seemed genuine. After seeing it a couple days ago I have to say that I was pleasantly suprised at how good this film is! It's very violent in nature, but it suits well with the feel of the movie...it didn't seem like overkill. The style at which 'City of God' was filmed was amazing. I loved how the makers found a way to use modern day techniques/tricks all while keeping a documentary-type realism look to it....like the use of a hand-held camera in certain shots, and a Matrix like shot with a rain drop in others. The story is a gritty one and very intriguing. Certain events were predictable (i.e. Benny's death), but overall the story was very engaging, and shocking to see how mindless and 'lost' these kids and the people in this city was. It gave an unprecedented, first-hand look in the life of these hoods in Rio; like Scorcese did with Goodfellas, the makers gave that same 'behind the scenes' look and feel here...and it works wonders. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and I hope it is recognized at the Oscars.***1/2 out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I love crime movies. Even the low brow stuff which is sometimes hard to watch. Some people are driven to a life of crime by several factors of society. Child abuse, poverty, unemployment, over taxation, racism and other injustices and society is just as culpable as the criminals it produces. However, this film is just sheer repetition. It shows us criminals in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, stealing, killing and ganging since childhood. But because it has nowhere else to go after that, except when they become adults and do the same things, I found this film tiresome after about the first hour.Having seen thousands of movies in life I always try to look for a way to accept the message given by all films but this film just didn't cut it for me as it was just low brow criminals running around the streets.

I had heard good things about the movie, but I didn't see it in the cinema. Yesterday I bought the DVD and I have already seen it twice! OK, it doesn't star Eliza Dushku, but that is the only negative thing you can say about it. Everything else is near perfect, be it direction, acting, script, etc. At times you do forget it is just a movie and that the people you are seeing are just acting. Great stuff, really ought to be in the top 10.My only concern is regarding the English translation, as I feel it is extremely difficult to find equivalent terms for the names and expressions used throughout the movie. Non-Portuguese speaking audiences will probably miss out a good part of the cinematic perfection that is "Cidade de Deus" (City of God just doesn't give out the same feeling), but they will probably get enough of it to see what a great movie it is. I'm Portuguese, so I understood everything they were saying, and believe you me that I'm seriously considering watching it again today, just so I can stand in awe for two more hours.

		<shortDescription>A True Story Very Well Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I decided to watch "Cidade de Deus", I was rather hesitant. Although I had heard positive comments for the film, there were several things that were putting me off: The shoot-em-up story did not sound original, the actors were amateur, the language and location were not so familiar. However I devided to give it a try.Well, it proved to be a very wise move by my side: "Cidade de Deus" is simply an excellent film. The story might not be that original but is very interesting and very well-told. The "amateur" actors are superb, and perform much better than many professional ones. The language and location may not sound familiar at the beginning, but the masterful director soon gets you quickly entwined with the environment; in fact, he is maybe the greatest asset of this production, as he does an excellent job in providing us with a top-notch direction.What you see is sometimes so surreal (a poor ghetto community totally isolated from the "normal" parts of Brazil, small children toying with drugs and guns, people showing a complete lack of respect for human life, etc.) that you tend to think it is a bit exaggerated. Sadly, it is not: The story is true, and many if the actors that play in it are actual inhabitants of this kind of ghetto communities. The film should awake many of us who sometimes tend to feel that our comfortable lives are the norm in this world, when in fact they are rather the exception."Cidade de Deus" gets a 9/10 by me.</fullReview>

The first five minutes are among the best cinema I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot). It's a masterpiece, a movie with no digital effects but nonetheless on a par with LORD OF THE RINGS for its depiction of a world utterly alien to me. And it's based, apparently, on a true story.But it's a tough ride, and definitely not for those who don't like violent movies. A good test: if you appreciate Peckinpah, Tarantino, and Scorsese, this is probably up your alley. Beware, though, this film has something more horrible than any of those directors: graphic scenes of children killing other children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was purgatory is now Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Oscar nominated director Fernando Meireilos' film is based on a true story from the slums outside of Rio. This compelling drama literally takes us inside the ultra violent drug world run by the rawest form of machismo. From an early age, kids are drawn to the power and elite status (so-called respect) that this sick world offers. No one really escapes. This world is just a giant circle of blood and death where the parts are continously replaced by someone more violent. Failure comes to those who try to walk away or run away. This world provides only one way out. The story is told from the perspective of Rocket, a boy who manages to escape joining a gang since he is seen as pretty harmless and is the younger brother of one of the early trio of thugs. Rocket finds his redemption through a camera and actually capitalizes on this brutal underworld to crack the door to a life as a journalistic photographer. The real story here is the lack of hope and the total desperation from such an early age. Many scenes are so graphic as to cause this viewer to cringe and even look away from the screen. Such a powerful, yet sad message delivered by the some of the finest film art one could hope for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i've never seen anything that seemed so real to me. this blew away reservoir dogs, and at one point and time i couldn't imagine anything being as real and actually scary as reservoir dogs. this movie blew me away. just when i thought all of the insanity had faded and the characters would evntually come to their senses, i was back to holding my mouth in disbelief. and to find out at the end that some of the events were based on a true story. this made me so happy to not have had to live in that kind of environment. i've told all of my friends about this movie and i hope they can escape from the buls*** movies that north american media pumps up. real movies lie in the hands of artists and directors that create and bring you to see and make you believe that what they are offering to you is practical or can actually happen. it was hard to believe that something like this could have ever happened, but the perfect set up of the movie looked so god damn real. i felt like i would walk outside to rio and almost forgot i was watching a movie. goddamn! this was so good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in Rio and the violence on those projects and slums was common place on the news. As a matter of fact, both violence and misery are toned down on the screen. It strikes me much more than Tarrantino's or Scorcese's because I know it is FOR REAL! I remember well during the 80's when drug dealer Bolado from the Rocinha slum was killed: His murderer was burnt alive with the gasoline from his own motorcycle, later they blown his head away with a shotgun to make him stop yelling. The fact of the matter is that City of God is not a slum, but a project. As the movie explains, those people were transferred there form former slums in Rio during the military dictatorship in the 60's. Their old slums gave place to upper middle class condos and shopping malls. They were transferred there and totally forgotten!Anyway... what a fantastic movie and what a combination of talent! A superb cinematography and editing, incredible well tied script, great direction and acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>is they had only a budget of $3.3 million. even US independent films have an upwards of $10m or more in their purse. this film showed alot of heart, from the wicked cuts to the overhead angles, it put you right in the thick of things. it was gritty, it was intriguing, it was subtle yet straight to the point. very powerful piece of filmmaking, and about the violence, I believe that the filmmakers showed it quite well. they used their flashbacks really well, and I was overly impressed with the whole scheme of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say that I loved the movie, but I know when I've seen a very good and powerful movie.Based on a true story, this movie tells of young man's journey to not only survive, but escape the Brazilian ghetto called City of God. Aside from the obvious differences between Schindler's List and Goodfellas, two movies that are based on true stories that are comparable in quality to City of God, there is a profound difference. City of God differs from the before mentioned titles in the fact that it felt more like a documentary film rather than an epic story. Spielberg and Scorsese are much more refined film makers.This is a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

You ain't been there."After viewing Cidade de Deus you may still not have been there, but you start to get an idea of how little you would want to.Exceptional directing and the art direction/cinematography was perfect.

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's right! This violent masterpiece about crime in the slums of Brazil was definitely the best movie of 2003, superior to The Pianist, The Two Towers or Chicago.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:City Of God chronicles the rise and fall of a teenager crime boss who rules the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil - Zé Pequeno/Lil'Ze. But to tell his story we must not only go back in time but also watch parallel stories to his to get the full story of this character; and that's where the brilliant editing begins.Sometimes Lil'Ze is relegated to a supporting character, others he just disappears from the picture, but his presence is always felt as every short story revolves around him. We'll learn about his childhood, then we'll see him affirming himself as a crime boss; next we see his enemies or rivals. Nothing is left to chance, it all comes back in the denouement to close all narratives in a bloody gang war.Although Lil'Ze is the main character, Buscapé/Rocket is the narrator who tells his story; both couldn't be more different! Rocket is a young man who wants out of the slums to become a journalist, not spend his life as a drug dealer like Lil'Ze.As the story unfolds, the viewer is shown horrible images of violence: Lil'Ze persuading a young kid to kill a preteen.Beautiful images of passion, loyalty and friendship: Lil'Ze's best/only friend quitting his criminal life for a girl and telling his pal he just couldn't carry on with that life.And just pure realistic images: teens having fun on the beach, partying in discos, or just discussing their virginity, like common teenagers, not overblown stereotypes. All seen through amazing cinematography.But the screenplay is the biggest strenght of City Of God. Each character is fully fleshed out, not just through words - and because these are slums kids, there are lots of curse words - but because of their actions that define them as real human beings. Even though it's not a linear narrative, there's not a single scene in the movie that isn't necessary for the sake of the plot. It's as tight as Pulp Fiction's or Chinatown's, just as good too in terms of plot and foreshadowing. If there's an Oscar it deserves to win, it's for Best Adapted Screenplay.Overall, Fernando Meirelles accomplished nothing short of a masterpiece.10 out of a well-deserved 10, because I can't give more.</fullReview>

It was suppose to come out in a couple of weeks, but now I'm reading not until June?second, I read this review at Amazon.com, and was just curious if any one else had any further information on it....................."This movie is past a 5 star rating. i was introduced to the version that was released in brazil. i have a friend from Sao Paulo and she let me watch this. this movie is 100% real. the actors are not actors they are regular kids and teens from the streets. they did screen test and did not let the kids know that they were going to be in a movie. then months past (while the kids learned the roles and characters) until they met the director. the kids had no script, they just had certain things to say but it was to be said in their own words since they are from the City of God. there is no acting in this movie, it is all real. on the dvd, they show how they set up this place to train the kids to be be them selves and they trained so long that they became professional. if you watch the movie you will understand. if you buy and dont like it, ill buy it off of you. this movie is truely wonderful and it means a lot to me."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a foreign film that comes from Brazil. It's about the ghettos outside Brazil, where the area called City of God is divided in half by the two drug cartels... how they rose and fell as the thirst for power and revenge grew. It's a sad story mostly because it was a true story. The cinematography was amazing. I recommend this to anyone who's fond of subtitled foreign films. It will give you a glimpse of something you haven't seen in a long time... originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Great Filmmaking is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see "City of God" simply because it had gotten 4 oscar nominations (I write this 3 weeks before Oscar time). I didn't know what it was about. A sappy Brazilian romance? A religious film?This is one of the best gangster movies ever made, it ranks up with "Goodfellas", which is no small thing. From the open scene until the close, it is unpredictable, scary, exciting, thrilling, and above all, truthful. It takes you into the world of Bralilian urban poverty, and shows the randomness of sudden death that can happen to anyone, especially if you're dirt poor. This great movie brings home the fact that hundreds of millions of people around the world (billions?) live in this kind of urban jungle dominated by crime and viciousness, where only a few people (the film's protagonist Buscapé) ever find a way out. The people who live in Cidade de Deus are living in a world of unfettered, unregulated capitalism where the only rational goals are maximizing one's wealth and power, without any thought for the future or for other people. This movie will blow you away with its truth and honesty. See it, see it, see it!</fullReview>

This was simply an exterordinary story. Set in several different decades. The direction of the movie was unbeliveable and the actors involved were some of the best to have graced the screen in years. (SPOILER) the part with the 2 crying children about to be shot was particually moving and the acting was worryingly good. I loved the story of the appartment and the whole experience left a room full of my friends lost for words.

		<shortDescription>Brutally Honest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is certainly one of the most exceptional foreign language films in movie history! The movie excels in every level. The captivating camera shots make a truly fascinating cinematography. Editing was brilliantly done with some Pulp Fiction influence added into it. No single actor's performance particularly outshine the most, but the ensemble performance, from the street kids to the crime masterminds, is remarkably convincing! The screenwriter made the story so suspenseful, bold and daring, that you would not want to miss a single scene. And the truly best aspect of the movie is its ingenious film making. Watch out for the "apartment scene" where the genius director shows how one small apartment drastically transforms as its inhabitants change through the years.I would not recommend the film though to people with a weak stomach. I must admit that watching this film was pretty difficult to me because i have no experience of residing in the slums or what other people calls "the ghetto." Everything might come extremely shocking if you are not aware of the reality drug trades and gang wars. There are very graphic violent scenes so watch it at your own risk.I would recommend it though to people who wants to see something honest, bold and dare. It is one of the, or probably the, most brutally honest film you will ever see! What this film achieved is boldness, directness, and honest filmmaking at its finest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much violence and blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I keep mixed feelings about this movie. Generally, I would say it's just too violent for my taste. All you get to see is guns, drug trade, corruption... Not that this isn't a feature of Brazilian favelas, but I mean, there's much more pretty things to be portrayed in a movie, like the kindness and friendly spirit of the people down there.On the other hand, I think that the very idea of social mobility (a black young reporter making it to be big leagues of journalism, plus getting sentimentally involved with a white girl) is a nice touch and I think it does exemplify some of the finest traits of the Brazilian soul in that things would eventually get better.I'm happy for Brazilian cinema that a product of theirs is getting that much Academy attention... But we also know that Oscar nominations are subjective to say the least. Some scenes of this movie reminded me of Pulp Fiction; it has indeed something very "Tarantinesque" or "Tarantinean" to it. Personally I regret all that violence and nonsense blood in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Expectations Fulfilled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I borrowed this film off of one of my friends yesterday, with high expectations having read many reviews complimenting it beyond belief. As he handed it to me i was warned, 'Oh, and by the way its in Brazilian... But there are subtitles'. I stood for a minute wondering if this meant i wasn't going to enjoy it, as his warning sounded exactly as if this meant the film was rubbish. I sat down to watch later on, feeling confused, but high in expectation. I had wanted to see this since it had been released, but it did not come out at my local cinema and i haven't had time to buy it. Five minutes into the film and i felt as if i spoke fluent Brazilian, i no longer realised i was having to read the subtitles, i had become so involved in what was happening on the screen. Great film making tied in with a brilliant story (which is true apparently), and something about managed to set it apart from other gangster movies. Its realism. I felt it happening in reality as i watched it explode on screen. I finished watching it and paused, to think about what i had just seen. I felt completely satisfied. The movie had beaten my expectations by a mile, they had been good... But the film was very good! The Godfather may be the greatest film ever, Goodfellas may be close, and Scarface may be a gangster movie to compete with any other, but City Of God is the best 'gangster' film i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My objection to this movie is political. I believe that these conditions exist, I believe that the movie was well-made, I believe that the intentions of those who made the movie were to break open the situation and ask that it be addressed.Unfortunately, it also invites a prosperous white audience to sit safely while being pleasantly horrified by dark people. For people living stuck lives in bland surroundings, this is a very spicy meal. It is a kind of porn.We have a major meth problem here on the idealized prairie. It is worse than cocaine, which few around here can afford anyway. The people who are attracted to meth will love this movie because it glamorizes and mythifies meth behavior, unreasonable violence against even family and friends. The dark ones will say, "Oh, this is us. It's in us wherever we are." The light ones will say, "I've only been experimenting a bit. I'm not as bad as those people."Anyway, where is the story of the women in this film? The stories of their babies?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is incredible how you can be surprised by some movies you see. You haven't heard much of them, which confuses you after you've seen them and been totally blown away by the experience. "Cidade de Deus" is one of those films.The story starts of with a boy describing his and his friends youth in "the city of God", which seemed to me as some kind of a Ghetto to Rio de Janeiro. After getting to know the characters and their personalities, we get to follow their different paths in life. Most of them are filled with drugs, crimes and violence. The different characters' stories is from thereon excellently bound together into the main saga - a bunch of Ghetto kids becoming the most fearsome gangsters of a big city.Although the movie clearly has been inspired by various other films, especially from the gangster and thriller genres, it always succeeds with maintaining its own original touch. Sure, some people say that the cuts between scenes is like stolen totally from the desk of Tarantino himself, but on the other hand I have also not seen a movie that moves with such power and speed in its storytelling since 1994 (which is when "Pulp Fiction" came to the cinemas). So, why can't a movie be inspired by other great examples? Isn't "Cidade de Deus" a perfect example of how well of a result it can make?All in all, this is one of the most wonderful makings that has ever crossed my eyes, and it is an honor to give it my highest rating. It is in good company with "A Clockwork Orange" and all my other favorite movies of all times...</fullReview>

Because he said a lot of untruth information about Brazil.To understand the movie, you have to understand Brazil. This is not an history class, but some things must be revealed.Mr. Howard Schuman said that Brazil has 120 million people. In fact, Brazil have 185 million people (a little diference). He also said that 50% of the population are under 21. Lie. Less than 30% are under 21. "Favelas" are´t government housing projects like he said. Favelas are places where poor people built their houses. They don´t have governments agreement to do this, they just do because they don´t have any other place to live.The movie shows an reality unknowed by the most of the brazilians. Meirelles shows the truth about my country. Nice worker people, surrounded by some disperated bad guys, who´s trying to live, trying to eat, stealing and killing for their lives.Brazilian people are very nice. They smile even when they´re broken. They laugh even when they´re hungry. They help each other even when they can´t help theirselves.We have much problems. Hunger, corruption, violence. But Brazil is an Huge country. Almost the same size of the USA. And we are not only favelas and natural reserves, spiders, monkeys, jungles and kidnapers. We are beautiful and nice people, beautiful and huge cities, beautiful natural reserves. And we also have 80 floors buildings, high military, health and scientific technology.We´re not a poor country. In fact Brazil are the most rich country in the hole world in natural resources and water. Our problem is that 80% of our money are with 20% of our people.So if you´ve enjoyed this movie, GREAT. But please, don´t feel sorry for us, because we don´t need this.</fullReview>

The recreation of this true story and true to life depiction of life in Brazilian favelas is brilliant. The film is also visually stunning, with great use of color and camera work. Some of the very few detractors claim the cinematography and soundtrack glamorize the tragic events that transpire in the story...but they don't truly understand the filmmakers' message. The highly stylized cinematography and hip soundtrack only reflects the attitudes of the young men who live in these places. This is the best way these young men can look at the world around them. It's a fast and furious lifestyle and that's what the cinematography and soundtrack aspire to help recreate. There's absolutely no sign of glamorizing the violence in this film, however. This film gets my highest recommendation and I urge people to check it out. The region 1 DVD comes out Feb. 17, 2004 and will include a 45 minute documentary of the true story on which the movie is based. I hope it's not too late for the film to at least get Best Foreign Film recognition at the Oscars. If it were up to me, it would win BEST PICTURE, but that's not likely to happen.

It's proved that we can produce good movies, with great direction of sound, music, photography, etc. Yes, it's violent, it's raw, but it's true. It's funny when you see others complaining about its content, since the Hollywood productions are SO much heavier... a good example? Gangs of New York. Do what I say, but don't do what I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully chasing the chicken</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- Alright, since there is nothing else to do, I thought and went off to the cinema. The title only thought to promise me an indy film about meagre slum life. By the scant knowledge I had about it, I actually expected some kind of boring social drama. Boy, was I surprised! So, let's talk about violence; of which there is a great deal in this film. Unlike so many Hollywood films, where violence seem to take a recreational dimension, this film really gets to you. It makes you think twice about it, since it doesn't present dead bodies, but dead persons. A big difference in my book.Then there is storyline; of which every thread is followed. Forget about main character. Yeah, there is one ? but he's more a link to the entire story, than a real protagonist. OK then, you can slice them out of the story, sure! But when the film finishes you know the life story of about seven characters. No mean feat, considering the time frame.Camera placement and movement with lighting and editing; everything molded into near perfection. I got aware of it sometimes, because there are some special moves done, and some intricate solutions to it. In some films it's not that good to get aware of such things, but in this film, I thought it was just fine.Now, I'm not used to Portuguese, but the only thing I really dare to kick at is acting. Well, voice acting. The acting is fine, but sometimes the voiceover seemed a little dull ? but hey! It's a voiceover!This film really chases the chicken to the end. It goes where it has to go, perilous as it is, but it's so beautifully done that I've even watched the film without subtitles ? and I don't know a word in Portuguese! I did this after seeing it with subtitles first, of course. And maybe it's actually subtitles that will put off most English viewers, since I don't know if it has been dubbed to any other language. Being Norwegian I, not unlike the Dutch, innately resent dubbing, but I've heard this is the other way in the USA, Germany and Spain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting look at life in a Brazilian slum town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that stays with you for a long time. Beautifully directed, perfectly paced, and with a very realistic cast of actors (maybe a little too real at times). It's a brutal, cruel, and darkly funny film.The title of the film refers to the name of a slum in an unidentified Brazilian town, where various characters hustle and try to make something of themselves (illegally, for the most part). The narrator is a smart, thoughtful fellow by the name of "Rocket." Rocket is trying to avoid becoming a hoodlum and find a safe career in life, unlike his peers. Yet he finds himself involved in the stark politics of his hometown, the City of God. Anyone who argues against gun control and for an armed population should see this film. Perhaps they'll reconsider their stance. Then again, maybe not. In any case, expect some truly sickening moments in this movie (both graphic and emotionally wrenching), as well as unexpectedly funny scenes. Yes, it's very contradictory, but very much like real life. Truly, you won't truly understand the actions/motivations of thugs and their drugs until you see this movie.</fullReview>

Quite in the lines of Lord of the Flies but the circumstances are different - a quest for survival from the cradle to the grave in the very backyards of Rio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes Tarantino to School</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie to school about how they ought to be making their own films. Every technique and trick those directors employ are done in City of God with equal aplomb, so the difference is in the content and context of the story. City of God does not take place in a slick fairyland of well-manicured, clever hoods, and it is not The Young Ones with guns. Where Tarantino's and Ritchie's films employ a cynical, "I'm so much cleverer than you" device, this film instead uses raw emotion. City of God says to the viewer "this world is real" in a way which neither requires you be in on the joke, and without looking down upon your priveledged life as if to say "you could never understand".While a Tarantino movie makes you wonder what kind of strangely kitschy but still over-the-top murder scene will occur next, City of God makes you wonder what will happen to the characters. Instead of collecting quotable quips to throw around at parties, you spend your time in City of God following the story. Some reviewers here have accused this film of being humorless, but if there is any humor to be found in situations so steeped in violence this film does as good a job of it as either Tarantino or Ritchie.City of God isn't as hip as a Tarantino or Ritchie film, and it's not as ponderous (or pompous) as The Godfather. However, it has all the exciting aspects of the films of its genre, employed in a believable yet engrossing way. Watching City of God didn't require waiting around for the good parts that would make the rest of the film worth enduring, and to me that easily puts it above Pulp Fiction or Snatch. It's emotional, honest storytelling gives City of God a level of tension and engagement which even the excellent acting performances in Reservoir Dogs couldn't quite salvage from the detached cynicism of the script.You might hate the film, and that's your own personal taste, but it's worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God take us into the 60-70´s Ghettos of "Rio de Janiero". A place where young gangsters are gods. Its a true story about a boy called "Rocket", and he decide to not partipate in anything that has to do with crime. This after his big brother who also was a gangster got killed by a little kid. This little kid grow up to be the bíggest ganster in the "City of God". And no matter how much "Rocket" try to stand outside he always run into these gangsters. The only way out of this is the camera. But its also a love story about a young man "Rocket" who sees how all the other guys loose their virginity except him. And how looses his girlfriend to his best friend. The movie i think gives a realistic view how it is to grow up in the ghettos where the fastest way to respect is money. And fastest way to get money is drugs and crime. If you havent seen the movie, i promise you get yourself something to think about afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jolting, epic and powerful (***1/2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The City Of God is a housing project in Brazil just outside of lush Rio de Janeiro that, to put it plainly, makes South Central L.A. look like a walk in the park. Drugs and guns are a fact of life, dead bodies lie in the streets and kids barely into their double-digits carry machine guns.The film spans several years in the life of Rocket (played as an adult by Alexandre Rodrigues), a decent kid who first watched his older brothers' gang, the "Tender Trio", meet with unfortunate ends. Now, as a young adult, he tries to stay out of trouble but is unsure how long he can do that and still get by.This is a jolting, visceral movie ("raw" doesn't even seem to do it justice). The camera-work is mostly shaky and hand-held, and it looks so much like a documentary at times that it's hard to remember that what we're seeing isn't real. One scene in particular, in which a kid who couldn't be older than 12 is initiated into a gang by being forced to shoot a terrified, crying, even younger child is one of the most horrifying scenes I've ever seen.Yet one of the most amazing things about "City Of God" is that despite nightmarish scenes like that one, it's actually an enjoyable film. To be sure, it is still a brutally realistic descent into hell, but it's one with several interesting (and in some cases, even likable) characters, dramatically satisfying plotlines, and even some warmth and humor outside all the blood and death.</fullReview>

As I am fairly fluent in Portuguese, I could tell that the Dutch subtitles were translated from English rather than straight from Portuguese. Quite a few things get lost in the double translation. Everybody knows the game where a sentence is whispered from ear to ear to arrive back to its originator completely mutilated. So here's a plea for more originality (in both senses) in the subtitles. BTW, it's awkward to read some comments here about "first watch of a subtitled movie". We get that all the time.You may read other comments to know how fantastic a movie this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary: "To be a real hood, you need more than just a gun, You need ideas"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is a violent (and true) account of the way of life in the Brazilian slums: unemployment, poverty, drugs, police corruption, and gangs of hoodlums. It concentrates on the 2 different paths chosen by two central characters, and the different lifestyles they lead to.Lil Ze chooses the life of a hoodlum and when he reaches adulthood he makes a quick and violent rise to power (in a manner similar to the end of the first Godfather movie). Rocket, who narrates the film, dreams of becoming a photographer.The story moves forward and back a little at appropriate moments, to give a background to a new character, and it works really well. It allows you to appreciate the decisions each person has made a lot more and you do become attached to each character as they take the spotlight for a while.The Director apparently used unknown actors intentionally to maintain a sense of realism, and that works to its favour too, you really feel you are on the street watching these gangsters shoot it out, as opposed to a bunch of actors playing scenes on a movie set. The camera action moves to give you the persons viewpoint at moments aswell, which adds to this.The cast play their parts very well, and Lil Ze (who I feel should be up f or "Best Baddie") plays a particularly callous character. His arrogant swagger when he walks, fearless piercing stare, and the fact that he is rarely seen without a gun in his hand, all paint a picture of what type of person it takes to become the most feared hoodlum in the City of God.Great casting, great directing and producing, even the music is a funky samba at good moments. Yes, its in subtitles, but don't let that alone put you off. It's the first subtitled film I've watched, and after a short while I didn't even notice.But it's a true story and a gangster movie, two things I love: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not know anything about this film apart from it is Brazilian and highly rated before I saw it. After seeing it I was shocked and I am still stunned by the images portrayed.The line attached to films, 'based on a true story' could mean anything from the whole truth to just the location is correct. I do not have anymore information that allows me to make a decision on the factual content apart from the documentary on the Region 2 DVD called 'News from a Private War'. I highly recommend this documentary at about an hour as it gives an illuminating insight into life in the slums of Rio de Jeneiro and shows that at least one of the scenes in the film is a direct copy from a TV interview of one of the characters in real life.The film is, superficially, a story of one inhabitants struggle to climb out of the slums and pursue his dream. Scratch the surface and it goes beyond entertainment into a bleak and depressing view of social exclusion. It has challenged me to reassess my life, my past and my future.The way of life shown in this film and the documentary is inconceivable to anyone born outside of it. The people are shown bereft of hope and dreams, and each has a story of survival. Not survival in any terms I can understand but surviving each and every day, living in the true meaning of an anarchic society where life means nothing to these people, either their own or anyone elses. Where killing is a way of life or even something to do to pass the time. Living in a society that is ignored by social agencies and the only contact with the government is by punishment. I would say that the life portrayed is as close to a living Hell as I could imagine.However this bleakness is broken by the occasional individual show of love or helpfulness, of shaky friendships and the main character's hope of a way out.I highly recommend this film as entertainment and as a view of a life I could not even envisage in my worst nightmare, yet is still uplifting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers) It doesn't take long for the irony inherent in the City of God's name to become apparent. This is an unflinching portrait of gang warfare in a Brazilian favela. It is a place crippled by competition for drug turf and in that competition life is shockingly worthless. Gun-squeamish viewers will not enjoy this film, as one of the key protagonists, Li'l Ze, emerges as one of cinema's most evil characters, dispensing with both ally and enemy with the carelessness of a child throwing away sweet wrappers. Any hope gleaned from the narrator, Rocket's, escape into a better world is diminished by the ease with which the baton of violence and worthlessness is passed onto the next generation at an age young enough for them to still be wetting their beds. Taut direction, fearless acting and beautiful cinematography make this a classic, but one that leaves the viewer in despair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has anybody ever heard of the band At the Drive In because Benny in City of God looks just like the lead guitarist from that band and Mars Volta. I thought I'd just share that with everyone.I heard so much about this film and it was just getting on my nerves that no cinema around where I lived played it when it was released. One cinema near me played for one night only but I couldn't get to that particular cinema because it was to far and not cheap to get there, so I had to wait an agonising 5-6 months for it to be released on DVD. When it came out a month ago at my local video store, they didn't have the DVD, they had the video which annoyed me because a friend of mine saw the DVD and said it looked so amazing, but video it was. At first I honestly was expecting something to be wrong with this film because when people usually say that a film is amazing like they said about this one, it tends to put me off because I have a strange taste fors movie's, but this one grabbed by the bollocks from the start and never let go to the final credits. It honestly felt like a three hour epic, coz there were so many characters and it wasn't the kinda film where you see one character and don't see him for another 30 mins of the film, each person had a story to tell which matched with all the other characters, like Pulp Fiction but much better and more rewarding. It did upset me in scenes when they were choosing which little boy to kill but before deciding they shot them both in the foot and these kids were from the age of 8 to 13, and the really small one who got shot first really upset me because, the way this young one cried and screamed after being shot, it made me think it actually had happened because he pour his heart out and I have never felt like that about a character since Christopher Walken's role as Nicky in The Deer Hunter, and that's what draws me to this film because it really does show you how real movie-making can be and it packs a punch of realism like no other. I suppose you would say that Rocket is the main character because the whole story is based on what he knows about all these people but you even get to know the bad guys like Lil Dice or whatever you call him, he was just fantastic as he was a brutal character who gave no care for anyone than his best buddy Benny, but in one or two scenes there is something in him that shows you that he is human at the end of the day that's is what this film deals with, Real Life.More amazing than any film I have seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord of the Flies in Portugese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at a Miramax-sponsored screening last night in Beverly Hills, of all places. What juxtaposition.This film, set in the slum/favela "City of God" outside Rio, portrays life in its belly with the unblinking eye of a documentary. The film is, at times, so unbearable to watch (violence against children, perpetrated by children) that you wonder what they "did" to the child to evoke such a realistic performance. The thought turns my stomach.This is not a film for the faint of heart, and I will agree with many of the other reviewers in acknowledging the Tarantino influence. Clearly, directors K &amp; F have seen "Pulp Fiction". However, what they acheive is something on another level. Not saying it's a better level, just another level. They make this story, these people, REAL.The audience at the Miramax screening was comprised of filmmakers, writers, actors. We know the tricks used to depict violence, blood, and gore. This film was so successful in hiding the tricks that many audience members were slackjawed and gasping at the sight of the violence. It does not look fake. It is disturbing, gory, and nauseating - particularly in light of the young cast.That being said, this film is something like "Lord of the Flies" set in the Brazilian slum. Epic, moving, haunting, Shakespearian. Hats off to the filmmakers, especially to the camera, makeup, and wardrobe departments who facilitated the ambience that made the story and the violence so believable &amp; compelling.This is not an easy film to watch, and I hesitate recommending it to the casual viewer. However, it is a real gem, and deserves serious consideration at Oscar time in the Best Foreign Film category. Miramax did a great service to this film by starting Academy screenings so early. Look at the buzz - well-deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only an excelent film, this film is a wonderful documentary of the last 30 years of brasilian urban life. More specific of the poor neighbourhoods, known as "favela". "Cidade de Deus" is such a "favela", created by the government to create housing without satisfying other basic needs. More than a documentary, this film is action packed. Gangsters, drug dealers, corrupt policeman, well, what more could you want? There are car chases, gunfight, pretty much of everything. Just to topple that, there is a multitude of sub plots, that bring us back and forth in time, and immerse the viewers in the history of this "favela". One feels part of it, and acquainted to all the characters, as they develop through the film. Amazingly enough, or maybe not, it is based on true stories... That can explain the extreme realistic feel we get throughout the film, one can hardly imagine we are looking at actors...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of a hopeless existence, beautifully shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a powerful film that is compelling from the opening credits with the unique "chicken chase." Instantly the absurdity of the people's existence in the slum is made apparent.Slowly we are drawn into their world with the many subplots being tied into the main story of Rocket, growing up and wanting to better himself and those around him, despite how hopeless it might seem.It's not a graphic film really and yet the subject matter of casual sex, casual violence and poverty and all to obvious.Do not be put off! If you enjoyed Amores Perros then you will enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put this is probably the finest movie you haven't seen. After an extremely limited engagement in the states this critically acclaimed film disappeared from the few theaters that were actually showing it. The loss is ours.CITY OF GOD is what filmmaking is all about, not escapism but involvement, immersement, and hopefully a glimmer of understanding into too often bloody and incomprehensible worlds.The story is ostensibly about gangs in Brazil, but its about so much more than that, it's about those places that are the price for our capitalist excess, places that pay the price for our new world order, it's about friendship, and love, and beauty, and innocence and how all these things fall away. It's part Robin Hood, and part Camelot, and part the world outside our door, and it is too much the blistering truth.Young people are ultimately what they need to be to make it till tomorrow, what adults by our ineptness, our callousness, our carelessness, or our design force them to be. "Children are man at his strongest... they abide", if there is a truth to find in the brutal and beautiful images of this film, perhaps it's in that quote from NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. City of God is not just a stunning look at one place and one time, it is a look at Palestine, and Rwanda, Columbine, and Baltimore, it is all those places where our children do not just learn to kill, but learn to choose killing.But if there is tragedy in THE CITY OF GOD, then there is also hope, and if there is ugliness there is also great beauty. It is, for such a seemingly violent movie, lushly, and lovingly photographed. It is a beautiful movie to look at, and that's part of it, part of the understanding the director(s) grants us, that in these distant slum lands where children slaughter children, there is beauty. Bone wrenching beauty, as beautiful as your child, your love, your sunset, beauty in the stories, and the striving... beauty even in the heart of horror and poverty.CITY OF GOD tells a story yes, but more I think it pushes us out of our seats to find beauty, even in the things we've turned our backs on, because surely if Directors Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles can find beauty in the CITY OF GOD, it should be a simple matter for us to find beauty... in our cities of men. A highly recommended flick. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing film about boys growing up as gangsters in a Rio De Janeiro ghetto. I haven't been there, and don't want to go! It is not a complete narrative about the ghetto, but a violent and living thing, full of machismo. You lack the perspective from the women, the peaceful children, the workers - those that kept everyday going through the mayhem. So it is in essence a gangster movie. Cinematically, and partly in subject, it reminded me a lot of the 1974 O Amuleto De Ogum. I saw little documentation for that one, but check it out if you have a chance - it saw it on swedish television ages ago, and it "blew me away" much as this one. There are also other violent argentinian movies, and I wish I could make a proper list, but I know to little. Maybe later. I see references to Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas...but these comparisons are misplaced. Especially, some young americans should learn not to call everything Tarantino. There's a story of gangsters movies, and there's a tradition of gangster movies, that go way back, and which is international. I enjoyed the movie fully, because of all aspects - actors, cinematography, the depiction of kiddie gangs, the brutality. It is genre perfect. But even a top movie, a 1o points movie, is allowed to be critized. I think that the playing with time - introducing scenes in advance, and making us confused, was unnessesary. Even if everything was nicely explained in the end, it would have better flow with straight story telling. I often wonder why gangster leaders are so irrational, like Ze in this movie. They just can't use those violent methods and expect to succeed. But I guess those sociopats are the one that leave most stories to be told after them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moviemaking of a high order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cidade de Deus is actually a huge favela or slum on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro and this is a nightmare vision that I had no idea of when I visited Rio itself as the start of a South American tour. Originally this was a best-selling novel by Paulo Lins who lived in the area and spent eight years interviewing and researching for his shocking work. Now it is a stunning film which is the first to be directed solely by Fernando Meirelles who is based in S?o Paolo. Shown through the eyes of slum-dweller but would-be photographer Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), it portrays the abject poverty and utter hopelessness of a community on the edge of civilised society which breeds a type of gangster that is so young and so brutal that one is both mesmerised and horrified by the sheer casualness with which life is blown away by the ubiquitous handgun. The subject matter is disturbing enough, but what makes the movie utterly compelling is attention-grabbing style of the film. The unconventional narrative sequence involves a whole series of flash-backs, detours and jumps, while the harsh lighting, jerky camerawork, and rapid cuts - combined with a young, unknown and largely amateur local cast - gives the whole thing the verisimilitude of a documentary. This is moviemaking of the highest order and purpose. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in the past years. Set in a ghetto suburb of Rio, it takes most of its quality from its unprecedented authenticity. I'm sure you all read the usual blubbering of the movie being shot (ha! the pun!) with amateur actors, so I'm gonna skip that.However, the acting is great - even the smallest children deliver a performance that would put most Hollywood "actors" to shame (if you have seen the movie, you will probably know which scene I'm referring to). The time shifts are a bit complicated at first, but after a while you can easily follow the storyline. Some flash back scenes show details about each character's past to put some more depths into the protagonists.The only minor drawback is that the movie is originally in Portuguese, which I do not speak - and I guess most of the American/European viewers (except the Portuguese) don't either. So I had to contend with subtitles, and am probably missing most of the dialogue.All in all, this movie earns a solid 9/10. This is definitely a "must" - but don't watch it if you're out to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, Roger Ebert gets one right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an incredible film! Recently, when Roger Ebert was praising this to the high heavens, I had to wonder--lately he seems to be awfully full of gushing hyperbole (_The Hunted_ was "a pure and inspire chase film"--did he see the same crapfest I wasted my money on?). But _City of God_ is actually worthy of the acclaim. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and it does very well what you want the best films to do--take you someplace you've never been before, someplace you couldn't go even if you wanted to. Sure, it is a violent film, but no more violent than something like _Gangs of New York_, and the violence here is all to a purpose--showing what happens to gang kids who grow up without any chance, without any guidance. The film is closer to something like _Goodfellas_ anyway, in showing the rise and fall of a gangster, and showing the development of a gangster culture, from the 60s into the 70s, as the relatively innocent marijuana business gives way to the more profitable and violent cocaine trade. The film is almost Dickensian in showing how a place affects the people who live there, and while it calls for change, it never does so in a preachy way. This is just an amazing, vivid, astonishing experience and you owe it to yourself to see this film in a theater if you can, on video otherwise.</fullReview>

Not only is it a story told very well,but it also is shot very well. I had never seen such great production value out of a foreign film that wasn't an action adventure or anime film. I would be interested in seeing a documentary about the making of this film. ****POSSIBLE SPOILER****I would especially like to know just how they shot the low camera chasing the chicken so perfectly.

One becomes a drug dealer the other wants to be a photographer.Despite it's very serious and grim story, the movie manages not to be depressing. There's ample subplots throughout the movie, all of which are good. The acting, cinematography, and editing are all up to Hollywood standards (the acting is above most new movies I would argue) Really I can't say enough about this movie.

		<shortDescription>Blood and Mud Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never in the history of cinema the favelas assumed the real place they earned as a melting pot of cinematic value. Ultimately, Fernando Meirelles understood that it was time to fill the gap, and, corageously, moved forward into the excruciating experience that would be the making of a movie about them. When you see this movie, you'll thank him in silence. Because Meirelles' movie grabs this world-within-a-world with rare boldness, and makes it much more than a simple "south american goodfellas" like someone called it. "Cidade de Deus" is a view-changing experience, for it is the first time the audience leaps deep into the schemes, the violence, the blood and the mud. And your vision of the street gang violence in Rio de Janeiro will never be the same. Magnificently acted (and don't forget these were all people from the real ghetto), brilliantly framed and graspingly edited, this movie's real triumph is letting us know what goes inside the places we never dare to get into. And succeeds in doing so with the touch of genius. With immense production values, it is amazing how the movie never gets too heavy or too epic, and you'll marvel at the way realism is the motto here, while the film never has pretentions of becoming a mockumentary. This movie's got heart, and real guts. And it ends up becoming the film about the favelas no one ever dared to do. So you'll thank director Meirelles - rarely there has been such courage from a movie maker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>bang, the first minute of city of god. Fast cutting, overlapped sound effects, wonderful camera shots, great music. What a way to start. And the brilliance of the first 5 minutes, is just a prelude of whats to come. Usually telling a story of this scope and size is very difficult to pull off, but the director easily succeeds in keeping an audience's eyes wide open throughout the whole picture. It's most definatly shocking. Some of the scenes are hard to watch, with some of it's documentary style approach. It is also very funny, and very poignant. Being a foreign film, i knew none of the actors, but it just made it all so much better. The friendships really seem genuine, and when some of the friendships fall, you literally feel the emotion pour out of the screen. Lil ze, the more deadly character in the film is played brilliantly, and whenever he's on screen, looking towards the camera, you almost feel obliged to walk away. Like you are being bullied or something.It's also a movie which pays off, and doesn't disappoint you with a cop out ending. But even it did, you could forgive it for everything that came before, and if you are like me, then you'll leave this film speechless.</fullReview>

The children, the drug lords, and the regular people were all common people and they were all very convincing. Even the small children, including the little one that gets shot in the foot, and the big one that leads the Runts were pure hoodlums.This movie leaves you feeling dirty, as if youve been in the slums yourself.

My mind boggled with excitement and terror as one witnesses the rise and fall of a murderous drug dealer and gangster named Li'l Ze, remarkedly similar to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar (from the non-fiction book "Killing Pablo" by Mark Bowden) while another person becomes determined to survive the violent turmoil of the slums by escaping to work as an aspiring photographer. That's not enough. There are character subplots throughout the movies, helpfully marked with the subtitles of each character's destiny at the beginning of every subplot that unravels in the progress.The film's MTV style may be a bit indulgent and overbearing that could bamboozle the viewer, but it's the overwhelming abundance of substance - in terms of pacing, plot structure, character development, horror of psychological violence as projected on-screen, et cetera - that made the film City of God one of the top-quality - if not the best quality - of any live-action film in the early 21st century alongside equally visually and aesthetically amazing Mexican New Cinema films Y Tu Mama Tambien and Amores Perros. The ending credit provoked the reaction of astonishment and disbelief that it's indeed a true story given cinema verite visual style of the film giving it a sensationalistic feeling. It's a pity dozens of Academy Award voters walked out in droves out of the City of God screening for consideration of Academy Award Best Foreign Language nomination. The Oscar nomination committee nominated Amores Perros which is also graphically violent but chose to reject City of God on the basis of its objectionable content pertaining to disturbing array of violence and murder meant to depict the reality of witnessing psychological trauma in action.The Oscars has lost its mind and credibility. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumph in Filmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest films I've seen in years, and my pick for the best movie of the year. The Brazilian film City of God is a dazzling portrayal of the violent Rio De Janeiro slum `Cidade de Deus', which ironically translates to the City of God. In this terrible world of violence, we see the story of how crime progressed through the eyes of our protagonist the aspiring photographer Rocket. Amazingly, the film spans decades, and shows many intertwining stories, which could stand alone as great films. Fernando Mareilles created this movie exclusively with untrained actors from the village, and their real emotions make the movie that much more powerful. This visually stunning film, with incredible camera tricks not only amazes you with the cinematography, but with the strong ultra violent and ultra sexual themes caused by this drug culture. The crime saga is told in the same way Goodfellas is and in many ways just as brilliantly. The violence is as powerful as any movie since Apocalypse Now and watching this masterpiece gives you a very new outlook on the potential of modern film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scorsese on steroids: Fernando Meirelles' 'City of God' is more like 'Goodfellas' than 'Gangs of New York, ' but the gritty urban swaggering, gratuitous violence, and lost innocence are there. Rio is New York with favelas even poorer than Harlem's at its worst. Yet the energy and romance of young people of all ages digging out of poverty through crime is there as it was so long ago in Buenel's 'Los Alvidados.' Latinos just do better than gringos in making poverty and crime a story worth something.From the very first sequence, where narrator Rocket stands like DiCaprio in front of the gang and slowly morphs into his younger self to tell the story from the beginning, Meirelles establishes the art and romance of Rocket's story. It will go from lonely child to wary photographer amidst a carnage of city crime unmatched recently except for 'Amores Perros.' The character development of gang leaders is remarkable, given their number and complexity, and cinematographer Cesar Charlones' almost-MTV quick cuts give a vitality necessary to depict the murder and mayhem of the poor but strong.Benny, L'il Ze, and Knockout Ned are but a few of the colorful and fated leaders to people this sprawling cautionary tale. Unlike their counterparts in 'Gangs of New York,' they are fully defined and developed, sympathetic and fated, no small feat for a director unknown to film-going New Yorkers.The new president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, commented that this film showed a need for change now. The ironic title, 'City of God,' says it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark side of the magnificent Brazilian soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a lover of Brazil and have been fascinated by Brazilian music &amp; culture for years, although I've never been there (yet). This movie is deeply Brazilian, and -strange as it may seem- it made me love Brazil even more. From the first to the last minute, you really can't take your eyes of the screen. It's a shocking movie, true, but it is also refreshing and unique. The directors have simply done the best work I've EVER seen! It's that simple. The actors are unbelievable when you think that most of them have never acted before. But the true power of the movie is the diffusive, captivating, romantic -and at the same time cruel- Brazilian soul. This is the kind of movie that after the first couple of minutes makes any noisy spectators shut up and watch with open mouths till the end titles and beyond. Those who have watched the legendary "Orfeu Negro" can't help but compare the happy, shiny faces of the children in "Orfeu Negro" with the scared and frightening faces of the children in this movie. The beautiful and the ugly face of the favela... I really can't say much more except that this movie is not entertainment but experience...</fullReview>

Hopefully it will be released in more theaters soon. City of God jumped immediately to my top ten list of all time. I give this movie a 10 and I've only given maybe five others that score. Great story-This is based on a true story, which always makes a movie more intriguing to me. Great directing-can't wait for his next film. Great acting from a cast of mostly non-professionals-Some characters were very likeable and it was sad when they passed and others you couldn't wait until they got whacked. Awesome cinematography-this stood out from any other movie in a long time, and it alone was worth the 9 bucks. If this is playing near you go see it before anything else, you won't be disappointed. It is pretty graphic and there are a few unsettling scenes of kids killing kids, but I thought that just made the movie that much stronger. Only one word can describe this movie...perfect. So if you can handle a little violence, don't hesitate,go see it..NOW.</fullReview>

Through this film we feel the breath of gang leader Li'l Zé; a hood whose reign in the town land starts a war that destroys the lives of countless numbers of his neighbors.The stylistic rendering of this film is both unique and brilliant. Shot in an ageless style surely this movie will pass as a transcendent piece of work that teaches us how cinema needs to be.Busca-Pé, our young narrator receives his escape from this violent world through the lens of a camera; finding a hope in hell. The real protagonist of this town land, however, is the ground itself and the blood that flows over it.You will see a thousand stories in this film; in every shot there is something that you have never before imagined; beauty in life and in death images that can never fade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't an easy subject matter to make a masterpiece out of it, but Meirelles has done it! This story is told in the most skilful of ways! All its bits and pieces are carefully placed and events are uncovered with flashbacks then when they really matter most! Innovating filmmaking molds the scenes and the acting is flawless. Yes, it is perhaps one of the most violent films I've seen but I don't think it is for the sake of spectacle or that it is a cold portrayal of gangs in Rio. This is a film with a striking social commentary. It exposes all levels and aspects of poverty and social inequalities in Rio and strikes us with the sheer magnitude of a problem that is real and ongoing! We see the fatalism of the ghetto, the corruption of the police, a society that never rewards good faith, the indifference of the system to intervene ("let them kill themselves" says the policeman), a system that supports the erosion and the self destruction of the masses. The protagonist is too human. He is the link between us and the jungle. The whole story is about a deep helplessness! Even "bad" Ze is really a helpless figure. Allow me to say that I think that movies like "The Lord of the Rings" is more violent in essence. 9/10 No doubt the best movie of the year.</fullReview>

The Director obviously has a well developed sense of humour as the opening sequence demonstrates. `City of God' is a remarkably good Film. Well worth a viewing.The acting of the whole cast is mesmerising. It is so fresh, so real and finally so moving. This is what the medium of Film should be doing all the time, discovering new talent and immortalising it, not always using the same old tired actors that have forgotten the truth to realism in performance.The fashion for trixy and obtrusive camera shots, which seem to have invaded nearly all modern film making these days, finally works here. The wide array of technical shots and flashy effects only aid the storytelling, furthering the tension and plot. Well done that man ! At last !This is the best Film I have see for a very long time. It single-handedly restored my faith in the modern Film industry. Well done to all involved in creating a truly outstanding Film.</fullReview>

I can only assume the same to hold true for this movie, especially based upon what we are shown at its end. stylistically the movie mirrors goodfellas in many ways, though for its documentary-feel, again it gives off the same sort of vibe that kids did when it was released in 1995.overall, a movie recommended to all who can bare to watch brutality in its harshest form.

		<shortDescription>A major achievement through and through - it did deserve an Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I decided to see City of God at the London Film Festival last November, I was not expecting to hear at the film's introductory speech, that this film was in fact `one of the most anticipated screenings at this year's LFF'. After all, the festival was already well packed with sought-after films, such as The Quiet American, Bowline for Columbine, The Pianist, Dirty Pretty Things, or The Dancer Upstairs! However, I was immediately taken aback by the energy of the opening chase sequence, which powerfully and unexpectedly introduced the audience to Rio de Janeiro's most dangerous neighbourhoods, the "City of God" slum.Critics have often compared this film with several other masterpieces, particularly Amores Perros, for confirming Latin American cinema's resurgence, and China Town, for superbly uncovering a web of violence and political scandal, but any comparison fails to do justice to Meirelles' singular achievement. This is an undeniably powerful film, and it would have been, according to all British film critics, a strong contender for an Oscar nomination in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. And here are the reasons why.This is a stylish and visually stunning film covering three decades of the lives of residents in one of Rio de Janeiro's slums, giving a faithful portrait of its particular reputation as a `cross between an orphanage and an abattoir'.The film is a major achievement for its screenwriter. Based on true stories, the source material was a 700-page novel by Paulo Lins, a book containing about 300 characters and 300 different plots. The screenwriter somehow miraculously produced a script that maintained not only its coherence but also the essence of the book, i.e., the sharp edges of reality and of characters defined by unusually harsh circumstances. However, the script has crucially also allowed some light in: glimpses of the humour, exuberance, and humanity of the characters. What the scriptwriter and the director did was to take all the depth and detail of a long text and reinterpret it visually. There is a central character, the narrator Rocket, who frequently interrupts the action to inform us that a certain character will be back later, and key scenes are frequently repeated. It's a device, but a good one because we always know who's who, what's what, where we've been and where we're going in what could have been more than two hours of mass confusion.The film is a major achievement for its entire cast. All performances are remarkable. Developed over a year's improvisation, many performers were recruited directly from the slum and acted for the first time. The children acting in this film deliver some of the most convincing scenes ever caught on the camera.The film is a major achievement in cinematography. There is a different visual style for each decade, thus helping to position the scenes in its right context. The style subtly changes from the traditional framing of early scenes to jerky camera movements, jumpy editing and a riot of colours (as if to challenge the growing crude reality), while remaining attractively cinematic.The film is a major achievement in editing. In one word: electric!The film is, last but not the least, a major achievement for its director, Fernando Meirelles, one of Brazil's best-known commercial directors. In City of God, Meirelles does everything with his camera: he keeps it still, cruises it handheld in documentary fashion, dives in reaction to violence, twists around in panic. The director masterfully uses harsh lighting, fast cutting, speeded-up action, jump cuts, moving the film along with lightning speed. Meirelles never dwells on anything.Meirelles' flair and lightness of touch do not conceal the wide-ranging social and political insights the film offers through its engrossing narrative, which is driven forward by exhilarating camerawork and scorching soundtrack. This film is a triumph, and, its effect is not easily summarised in a movie review; it has to be experienced.The question that remains, and which will never perhaps find an answer, is why such a powerful film has been overlooked by the Academy and not been awarded with an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

I agree with my friend Shel in being amazed with the acting of these kids, especially the children.Plus the portrait of Brazil, or Rio de Janeiro specificly, is fascinating. This is my first Brazilian movie and seeing this completely new culture is very refreshing - the slums, the jungle, the beach, the different social groups, the gang factions, the dark and light skins Brazilians, the parties.

		<fullReview>"'Cidade de Deus' captures lightning in a bottle. Like many, if not all of the internationally reknowned Brazilian films of the past decade 'Cidade de Deus shows us a segment of the Brazilian population in near perfect cinematic simulacrum. A story whose structure is indebted to "Citizen Kane" and is just as intellectually stimulating, this films narrative moves circularly telling the tales of many characters who become the central figures in a 'favela'. Rarely is criminality portrayed in such dimension, there is not one 'no-nonsense, tough as nails, born a jerk will die a jerk in this but. The characterization separates and explains the motivations of each main cast member perfectly. The word circular works also to describe the nature of the story which is one of crime and corruption; it is something that never ends as we all know but the filmmaking is so captivating that we expect a 'happy ends' but love the truth the film shows regardless. The Samba-infused score and frenetic cinematography work hand in hand to add rhythm and emotion where it is needed but the cold, shocking and gut-wrenching scenes are left as is and work wonderfully. This is a film worth multiple viewings and careful examination and is a rarity a great piece of art that ALSO makes a socio-political statement.</fullReview>

For the inhabitants of Cidade de Deus (the City of God) one of the most notorious favelas (slums) outside of Rio de Janeiro that often means relying on crime to survive. The inhabitants' problems are exacerbated by indiscriminate gun battles waged by gangs trying to control the drug trade, and cops whose interrogation techniques consist of shooting first and beating confessions out of the survivors.The City of God is a pseudo-documentary based on real individuals and events that dominated the affairs of the slum in question for a period of two decades. The cast of characters includes Rocket, the kid who hopes to use his camera to escape the slums, Bene, the gentleman gangster and diplomat, Knockout Ned, one of the `good guys' who gets caught up in the maelstrom of madness, and Li'l Ze the sociopathic crime lord who's always ready to dole out death. The performances in the film are top notch, especially when you realize that most of the participants aren't actors, consequently the emotions on display are raw, edgy and true to life. While several scenes initially appear overblown you quickly realize that the seemingly senseless violence is such that to play it any other way would be disingenuous. The gritty texture, harsh lighting and occasional jerky camera sequences enhance the film's documentary feel, rather than appearing gimmicky (unlike the host of cinema verite flicks of the past few years?) The director also makes use of Pulp Fiction style folding time lines, and snappy editing to ensure that the pacing doesn't stagnate, and is careful not to leave any loose ends. City of God treats the viewer to a brutal firsthand view of the poverty/crime cycle that thrives in the worlds slums. Its in-your-face approach and disturbing ending begs the disturbing question, what happens if this destructive juggernaut ever organizes and decides to leave the confines of the ghetto?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful presentation of a sad, seemingly hopeless social cycle, yet imbibed with verve, samba a-swinging do Brasil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, CITY OF GOD is an exuberantly sad story, with subtle faith, hope and love throughout. A bold stroke of genius to tell such a tale in this lively fashion - swift and steady, sad and comic, bullets flying, joyful dancing, pausing suspense - all the colors do Brasil.How can a tale of slum child gangsters, killings and revenge be exuberant? But "City of God," like Marcel Camus "Black Orpheus" 1958 and its modern version Carlos Diegues "Orfeus" 2000 - even in tragedy there's life a-living. The samba music, subtly triste, gives a sense of hope aftermath. Hope lurks as evil does: bands of 7 or 8-year olds, walking away jiving gangster talk and waving guns 'guilelessly.'Director Fernando Meirelles, co-director Kátia Lund, and their dedicated cast and crew gave us an unforgettable f?te of a film. It was as if under the guiding voice-over narration of Rocket (Buscapé) that we're dancing, swaying, samba a-moving through it all - all from the present day, swiftly swirling back to the sixties, then 'beachcomber' seventies, and disco eighties, full circle back to 'the beginning of the ending.' I marveled at the structure the filmmakers have adopted. There are shades of Dickens' stories: atrocious characters and the central 'hero' struggles, like a Shakespearean dark tale with verbal descriptive wit (thanks to subtitles by Jennifer Kafu.) It's a f?te, alright!There's comprehensive and energetic accounts of the making of "City of God" at the official site. Director Meirelles' notes, biography, and interviews on how the film project came about, the casting challenge with co-director Lund, who described in detail the circumstances involved and the casting process. Seven main cast members (portrayals of Rocket, Zé, Bene, Knockout Ned, Tiago, young Li'l Dice, and Carrot*) talked about how they see their character, personal experience on the project, and "We from the Movies." The methodic approach to the 'madness' of spending one year selecting 200 of non-professionals out of 2000, coaching them to prepare for the film, encouraging spontaneity, sounds like a structured experimentation. Camera crew literally followed the cast and action rather than traditional memorizing of dialogs and adhering to logistics. The production result, as we can see, is amazing! * Carrot was Matheus Nachtergaele, a more known actor who was asked to 'disappear into the film and mix in' with the rest of the non-professional cast. An interesting story within a story. Check out the official site for more CITY OF GOD appreciation.Perhaps CITY OF GOD would be given recognition and exposure during Oscar time. As the director repeated: the characters are not the focus, it's the place Cidade de Deus - 'favelas and tenement housing projects' - its social status and products not singular to Brazil (reminds me of Mortimer Adler's 1991 book title "Haves Without Have-Nots" - the diametrical extremes of the rich and the poor is universal).Hope lurks: a delight as the story turns to our 'hero' - change of flavor in storytelling ('how I became a photographer.') - seeing him rocketing through the decades, the streets, and back to the beginning of the end. Isn't that the 'darndest' chicken chase? The swift sound of knife utensil a-clashing.didn't it grab your attention from the very beginning, sight &amp; sound, with swinging beats? Do stay through the credits roll at the end - you'd get to see the real Knockout Ned saying the very same lines as were on screen. The truth hits - based on real events in Paulo Lin's novel, CITY OF GOD is overwhelmingly powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City of God, is among those films that stays with you in your mind, touches you in your heart all through your eyes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes it is more important to appreciate a film, rather than enjoying it. And City of God, is among those films that stays with you in your mind, touches you in your heart all through your eyes. This film is based on a true story and novel by Paulo Lins an insider who's lived in the neighborhood where God is silent and devil speaks trough the fire and guns. Fernando Meirelles doesn't make you cry throughout the film, because everything you see is far beyond expectations that wouldn't give you the second to think and shed tears. He makes you deeply sympathy with the characters because not only they are not trained actors, yet they are real people from Citdade de Deus (City of God), where the dreadful events has been taking place since one can remember. `There are two Brazils: Middle class and lower class, as two different worlds' says Meirelles who's from the middle class himself, `people of the middle class only hear about slums and the crime in other towns through press, nobody has ever made a film about them'. City of God broke the box office over Hollywood films such as Minority Report in Brazil, which is amazing for the Brazilian film industry. The only reason for this incredible success is because this is a film from the people for the people, by the people.The story is about the devastating crime and insecurity in Brazilian lower class neighborhoods, which have been left out of control for years and its crime rate has been extremely increasing. Film is shot on location, mainly in the actual neighborhood; City of God, and the characters are the real boys and girls that are essentially living in those neighborhoods at the moment. In addition a specialized director with a specific vision is needed to put that chaotic world in order and convey it into a meaningful motion picture. Fernando Meirelles studied the script with the writer Braulio Mantovani for two years and spend another two years with his characters rehearsing. `Instead of giving them the script, I gave them the characters, with free lines other than the script. Only %30 of the film is actually written,' says Meirelles as he talks about his close relation to the boys. He let the actors to play themselves and they talked and behaved as they would do in the real life. What's very interesting about the characters is the paradox, which is also the same for the film it self. We have a huge cast in this film, mostly children and teenagers. Instead of going to school and playing at home, these kids study crime and play with guns and drugs.Besides the authentic acting- the intense cinematography, editing and sound design deliver a great deal of entertainment to the film. Meirelles comes from commercials, and in fact this film is affected by that. Just like Television commercials, City of God is full of little climaxes that drive your attention up and down and play with your awareness. It is also segmented as the Television shows and commercials are and in every five minutes there's a new obstacle that leads the story to another. The sound design is wild in a moment and then calm or even silence afterward that you can't take your eyes off the screen, and you won't for sure. I assure you that there are several scenes in this film that you would always remember whenever you hear about City of God, or simply Brazil.City of God is what I would call a reminder for us the audience what an artistic film can be: a rich story, powerful directing, and a great deal of authentic entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly remarkable piece of 'real' cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meirelles viewed first hand the destructive lives of the citizens of the City of God, and his appreciation of their difficult existence is evident from this supreme piece of Brazilian film-making. The story flows fluidly as we follow the lives of young residents of this harsh social domain. The use of 'real' people to fill major roles in the movie is a piece of inspired cinema, with exact, mesmerising performances from the young stars. True, it is violent and very dark, but there are moments of black comedy that make this 'coming of age' tale highly watchable. It is as unpredictable as it is compelling and the film editing belongs in a masterclass of its own. Superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully told story w/ an intricately woven plot and a barage of interesting/real characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the priviledge of seeing this movie at the Telluride Film Festival this year and immediately fell in love. I believe it was the best film shown there - even better than 'Bowling for Columbine' or 'Frida'(although these were very, very, good). Its twisted storyline and large number of characters identified only by gang nick-names, is reminicent of movies like 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Resovior Dogs' or 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels/Snatch'(because 'Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch' are essentially the same movie). In fact, when recommending it to friends, I describe it as "A Brazilian Guy Ritchie/Tarantino-esque Film(yes, you can quote me on that)." City of God's description of the corrupt city near Rio de Janero is very strong and persuasive. Its actors seem like they are not acting at all - which is in fact, true. The director went to this city and offered the natives acting lessons as simple classes they could take. But, in reality, he was really holding auditions for the film! Genious idea if you are trying to capture reality instead of bringing in fake, over-aged, Hollywood, no-talent models, putting them in native clothing, placing guns in their hands and expecting them to do the job. "But enough of my yackin'," as Rob Reiner narrates in 'This is Spinal Tap,' go out and see what a call a foreign masterpiece for yourself.</fullReview>

I have not seen an exploitation/gangster film up to date that can compete with this one's caliber. This movie is so visually stunning, and the dialogue, the DANCING, oh yes, the DANCING is just so dope, I can't believe you can get so down to 70's old school. This is what gangs of new york should have been like.. but failed to pull my heart out and splatter it across the wall like this one did. The energy of Brazilian Samba makes your heart pound as each scene unfolds.I LOVE this movie.. and I hope you will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stark reality: vicious, desperate, and triumphant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cidade de Deus is a portrait of Brazilian life on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, in the most downtrodden of places. From the euphemistic reference to the "City of God," to the stark reality of gang life, this film shocks and inspires terror in the casual viewer, who is often far removed from the world portrayed therin. People wanting to escape reality, those favoring pedantic Hollywood escapism, need not view this film.If violence and poverty are the result of social neglect, then the protagonists of this film are the innocent victims. When children become predators, spurred by their own pursuit of power to escape social irrelevance, society becomes the victim. Alternatives, as the film demonstrates, exist, but they are far less compelling to neglected children than the life of crime.It is insufficient to say that the direction, imagery, and cinematography are breathtaking, though they are. It is also insufficient to say that this film accurately portrays the desperation of inner city youth (wherever they may be) and their limited opportunities, though it does. It is equally insufficient to laud the actors, because one would swear that nary an actor graced the screen; these actors became their characters in a transubstantiative process more divine than any miracle.What can be said, with absolute certainty, is that the film will challenge your comfortability with reality. Too far removed from the problems of the inner-city, and you will cry outrage for the "excessive violence." This film will wrestle with you intellect and your emotions, and force you to think about the world outside your door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is breathtaking, yet it does get slow in a few places. Nevertheless, it is a film that is incredibly eye opening for this country of Brasil and its culture of violence in the favelas (slums).It's also a gripping tale show casing one young boys desire to somehow get out of the madness, where if anything life is cheap. The fact that it is based on a true story (what parts those are, I am not certain) is even more chilling, particularly the end credits in which a real tv interview with a gang leader was taken word for word in the film.Probably the greatest triumph of the film is its ability to show that violence is cyclical and that in a culture where only guns and death exists there is almost no escape no matter how moral you might be, or try to do what is right. An amazing picture.Rating 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. Not because it is violent, not because it is trendy, not because it is a slowly growing cult film. But because it represents all that is good in film making.A true story to boot, the film excellently acted and maintains its pace throughout the entire production. My advice is go see it, if you like this sort of film you will love it, it you don't like this sort of film, you may still love it. The film is very moving and very chilling when you think of the concept of kids with guns. A final comment to people who say that the film is detached and does not offer any solution to the problem of violence in Brazil are missing the point. It is based on a true story, based on what things are like there. People have become too use to Hollywood with their "Everything is better" mentality, the sort of moral of the tale. This story has no moral, if only that surviving is sometimes all you can do . It is like saying that Shakespeare's historic plays are poor because they don't provide an answer to War.

		<fullReview>Battle of Algiers was great the way this movie is great.I don't know how this movie could be put down except by people who feel guilt in their pleasure watching the movie and think they must feel offended by it and take a stance against it. But, I saw the movie with great funny subtitles, and if the original Brazilian movie isn't as funny when it's supposed to be, so be it. you got me. Without the humor to relieve the tension, this movie is just a cruelly violent movie with heavy social themes--still the only movie of 2002.Someone told me how 911 hysteria was nothing compared to how f@#$ed up everyday fear is down south, so throwing its nytimes review aside without even reading it, I headed for an incredible freefall into Brazilian ghetto violence.To say that the movie lacks human dimensions is completely asinine and totally misses the point that the movie makes: for drugged street kids forgotten by the government and living under the rule of the strongest, no mouth speaks louder than that of the gun.It's horrifying, yet not surprising that every argument among these children ends with a gunshot. If the movie is upbeat and mistaken for glamorizing violence it has successfully captured a wider audience to tell the more important fact:behind every bullet lies a tragedy. If you're not interested in foreign affairs, go watch Bowling for Columbine.If you don't like watching movies with serious themes, go watch Kangaroo Jack, National Security, Lord of the Rings, Just Married, A Guy Thing, Catch me if you can, Two Weeks Notice, Gangs of New York, About Schmidt, Maid in Manhattan, Drumline, Antwone Fisher, keep paying your dollar to teeniebop movie producing Hollywood so that it may afford to release more foreign and independent movies I want to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>authentic depictions of hard life in brazil 2-3 decades ago.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that I had to wait literally about 6 hours to see this film. All shows in New York city were sold out saturday night opening weekend. But the wait was well worth it. If you've never been to brazil and often found yourself dreaming of a visit, watching the City of God will definitely ticket you there. Seeing this film will bring out emotions of fear, terror, and pity. However, the story also considers and explores a culture of jubilee and sensitivity.The story is told and labeled in parts much like Tarantino's "pulp". And it also adopts a sort of "matrix" approach to one or two scenes. But somehow it worked. All the characters, feud's, and details are discovered thru this method.Visually the film is excellent. From the trees in the woods to the narrow streets of the slums. Directors Kátia Lund and Fernando Meirelles along with writers Paulo Lins (novel) and Bráulio Mantovani (screenplay), deserve all the respect for bringing out the validity of this true story. Even though it may be below 20°F here in the winter north, watching the sunny hot climate in "city of god" will make you feel adjusted quickly.Appealing to the script is the irony in how young men cross paths years later, having taken or coming from different paths in life. Many other characters in the film are also the subject of a cause-and-effect theory. It teaches to us that violence, whether for revenge, honor, respect, power, or wealth, never truly results in happiness.Pay the City of God a visit, it will not fail to entertain and satisfy your appetite for a great movie experience.Ove aka Magnate</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film, if a little stylised.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is a film set, appropriately enough, in the slums called the 'City of God'. It revolves around a variety of characters but centrally around Rocket - a young black guy who wants to become a photographer whilst also staying out of the various gangs in the neighbourhood. Also central are Little Ze and Bene, with various other gang lords appearing. The film follows a timeline from Rocket's childhood to the present day.The film starts at the very present with our hero in grave danger (always a good way to start a film) and then proceeds as one huge flashback explaining how he got there, with the final 10 minutes acting out what happened from that moment onwards. As mentioned above the flashbacks start in his childhood and this seemed a good place to start, explaining why he grew up as he did and what happened on the way. To be perfectly honest, given that everything is building up to the present moment there's not a huge amount to say on the plot, given that it's a film set in an extremely violent part of a city with drug dealing and gang violence, work it out for yourself - as they say. What does lift the film is the characters and their movements. The central characters are given (just) enough time to expand into useful roles and to interact, though possibly cutting one or two people or scenes to allow the main characters more time would have been good. Even so, their physical and emotional interplay is excellent and does provide the core of the film. There are also some fantastic scenes especially the Hand/Foot scene that has some of the best child acting that I have ever seen. With reference to the technicalities, the direction was confident and made good use of lighting, the alleyways of the City and the larger areas. If I do have a criticism, it's that sometimes the film felt a little stylised - i.e. making use of freeze frames, etc that didn't really add to the film. To be fair, at other times these tricks did add a little, but I'm not sure overall if the film really needed them.Finally then, it's a very good film that should be seen at the cinema. It's not going to change your life, but on the other hand it'll probably make you think for a while, and that's a good second. 8/10. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was 1 of my first foreign subtitled films that i have ever seen in the cinema... I am usually quite sceptical about these types of films, as i feel that they seem 2 take your viewing off what is happening in the film(Spoilers herein) This film began with a chase scene, which seemed quite comic, until it started to reach the "beginning/end" scene, where it finished off. I felt from this area, the film started portraying the lives of Brazilian kids in the slum in a way i had never knew before. I never quite knew about the difficult living conditions before i saw this film.This film takes on a "Pulp Fiction" kind of approach by following a character, but then when the character meets some1, u r introduced to this character's life, and then ends up back at that scene. Everything fits into place well and show the way of the film.This film hits you hard, it gives you the shock factor and makes sure you are hooked due to the amount of stuff occuring all around. The scene that will stay in my mind forever is the scene with "Steak" and the 2 runts... I have never before seen anything like that, as American films seem 2 shy away from upfront murder of children.THe main part that defined this film was probably the last scene, with the Runts running round with the guns, saying they own the town. THe runts r only about 9 yrs old, and have got the power to control over older residences, and murder is no worry 2 them. I highly rate this film for a hard hitting and eye opening thriller. Go and C it!</fullReview>

Only when you understand a characters circumstances does his full story get revealed. This intelligent build up never leaves you wondering. And yet the cast of chacaters is large and varied. No one is just a cipher.This is the story of a young man growing up, so some of the characters, especially women, reflect teenage frustrations. Gang violence is shown for what it is - a foolish and terminal lifestyle for those with few choices or homicidal tendencies.</fullReview>

If you feel like this, than maybe you've succeeded in becoming part of City of God`s world. That`s what happens when you live in a reality like this 24 h a day. Violence becomes usual and you start to see things in a different perspective. Or, I could say that, people have to get a life, even when their environment fights against them. Believe me. I live in Brazil, so, in some aspects, I know what it is. What else can I say? Well, just try to watch this movie with an open minded heart. It has a great plot and a great photography, but, to me, the most important of all is that this movie shows the universal problem of exclusion and opression and how things can turn into a vicious circle if there`s no one to break it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>tmwest from S.Paulo stated "this film is so violent, it makes Tarantino look like Walt Disney". I just cannot agree. RESERVOIR DOGS (especially of Tatantino's films) was seen as ultra-violent. I believe that this is because 'hard-men' screamed in agony when they were hurt. This made a dramatic emotional impact. The violence in CITY OF GOD is seen by some as "banal". Yes! My concern is that the violence didn't hurt enough. Only the scene where the Runts were punished really depicted the true pain (IMHO).*I wish that Knockout Ned had been the central player with Lil Dice/Ze rather than Rocket. His degeneration felt for me as the crystallisation of the tragedy of life in the favelas.*I usually like hand held camera but for me as a foreign viewer it created a problem when coupled with the mass of dialogue and narration: I didn't get to SEE as much of the movie as I would have liked to.</fullReview>

Some movies becomes more than an entertainment movie, more than a history.Since the first frame, "Cidade" tells you why it was made: the reality is portraied in true colours, but with style, camera and edition ara fantastic, the non-professional cast impresses you more than words can say.The history is not maniqueist, the place is the real protagonist, you see the grown up of a favela, and if you know just a little about the crime history in Rio de Janeiro since the last 30 years, you will see that the movie shows exactly the perplexity of the naturals in front of the facts, what becomes worst and worst. Is a close up of the favela, the best ever made in Brazil, and probably in the word. The charm of this movie is really because it tells you a history. If it was a documnentary, probably we only say: oh, the crime, what terrible thing . But no. Cidade de Deus makes you see the face of facts, and when you go out to the theater, more than social reports, in its colours, crime becomes to be more than statistics. Go to see the movie and believe: now it is all true...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bittersweet must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The synopsis of City of God was compelling enough to begin with, but when the subject matter is coupled with the dazzling, lush visuals that Meirelles and Lund have achieved, the result is a true cinematic treat.The often shocking and always compelling storyline - following the coming-of-age of a group of teenagers living in a forgotten, desperate place - is crushingly constrasted by the sun-drenched visuals and upbeat soundtrack. This bittersweet contrast is part of the reason why this film is so compelling; its 130 minute running time having no meaning for me as I was lost in the narrative. The camerawork and cinematography were exemplary - rarely has a film looked so good. The style does have much in common with some American directors, but for me the comparisons drawn with Scorsese and Tarantino are unsatisfying. I don't believe this film could have been made by any other director, given the expert handling of the subject matter. There is a distinctive feel to the style, but it is never an entirely familiar one. In addition, the cast are all entirely convincing, unsurprising since they were picked from the Brazilian favelas where the movie is set.This is truly a movie which takes full advantage of its medium. I saw it on its UK opening on 1st January, but had I seen it in 2002 it would certainly have been in the top three of the year. All-round, a technically masterful treatment of excellent subject matter which deserves all the critical praise it has received. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having lived in Rio de Janeiro during the 70's I recall all the violence involved with Cidade de Deus. During that period, that region became the synonym of violence. It was quite intriguing to see how fiction had treated the dreadful reality.Shocking violence, dirty words, drugs, sex is on screen. The fact that it was part of a recent past society was shocking as well. This film is not made for those of weak constitution.The structure of the film is a novelty specially in terms of Brazilian films. It is openly influenced by Matrix and Tarantino's style. Nevertheless it has a crystal clear Brazilian spice.Have a look at it - prepare yourself in advance - however do try it and share your comments with us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New Master of the Pen Camera.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half hour of "City of God" shocks us because of the subject matter and the style in which the director tells his story and puts it on-screen.First of all, the subject matter is very compelling. The film takes place entirely in one of these modern "ready made" suburbs that the Brazilian government built in the sixties to house poor and/or homeless people. As we can easily imagine, it was mostly a political tentative on the side of the government, rather than a genuine gesture to provide aid. The film follows a bunch of kids who are growing up in this environment, trying to survive. With that, they have to choose between either the traditional life of a poor worker, or that of a smuggler and thief. Street gangs control the neighborhoods, and the kids become involved very early on. The film takes us into this hurricane of violence, following mainly two of these kids, one who's shy and wants to become a photographer, and the other who's violent and wants to become King of the streets. This first part sweeps us along in an admirable way, as we're invited inside their family lives, and their struggles for survival, education, etc. We see how impossible it is, unless one is tremendously lucky, to arrive at a normal life in this kind of situation. The style is more than compelling on two levels: the storytelling which uses the narrative voice of our kid photographer, who endears us with stories of those most important who participated to his coming of age journey. Even if today a non-linear approach is more than fashionable, it works here, and the director has been able to master it to a degree of perfection. More importantly, his visual style starts were "Amores Perros" left off, and it is as much in your face, raw and cinematically violent as its predecessor. It even goes one major step further: Meirelles has some distance with his subject, in the same way that the main character has with his own story (which is a brilliant transposition) and is more able than Iniarritu, to use cinematic violence constructively in order to bring us inside the true violence of the streets. For example, the opening scene (which is the end of the film) plunges us inside street violence... but the violence is of a chicken being chased, only to be caught and cut to pieces in an alley. That's why this movie is a shocker. Very rarely directors are able to combine a great story, great storytelling and a wonderful new visual style, all perfectly coherent. Is it a masterpiece? Almost. The movie is 130 minutes long, and for 130 minutes our extremely talented director will make sure that we hang on tight to the edge of our seat with his storytelling and our appreciation of his style and mastering of the cinematic medium. Unfortunately, there is a moment when we have to ask ourselves how many kids can we watch kill each other, and how many new "special effects" does the director still have in his bag of tricks? It is clearly very hard to maintain such a level of intensity at both levels for more than two hours, and our director is trying a bit too hard. If the movie were 20 minutes shorter I would dare to call it a masterpiece. Nevertheless, it will definitely become one of this year's major sensations, and will probably be studied by cinema students for decades to come.It is definitely a film to watch and watch again in order to learn how far we can go with a pen camera. It is definitely a director to remember. He will, without a doubt, become one of the most important directors of the next decade.</fullReview>

Especially The Role Of The Children As Victims And Protagonists. There Are Many Scenes That Seem To Freeze Time As You Watch Them. The Images Of Children Killing Other Children May Be To Honest For American Audiences. The Beauty Of This Film Is How It Is Able To Make You Feel Good While Never Allowing The Tension Of The What The Movie Is Really About To Escape Your Mind. It Takes An Open-Minded Person To Appreciate This Movie. Amorres Perros Came To Mind As I Watched City Of God. However What May Limit City Of God To The Level Of Amorres Perros Is That We Don't Ever Meet And Connect With Someone In These Town Is A Complete Victim. Someone Who Isn't Taking Part. However You Will Have To See The Movie To Judge For Yourself.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MTV Neo-realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cidade de Deus"is without a shadow of a doubt a worthy film. Judging by today's cinema standards it is rather unusual. Life in the Rio favelas and the struggle for survival of its inhabitants don't come first to mind as the ideal formula pitch for the latest Hollywood blockbuster. A quote of reality is these days extremely shocking and, funnily enough, a welcomed relief from our culture general lack of content and genuine disinterest in reflecting anything too uncomfortable to watch with the exception of cheap and easy-to-digest thrills.The film left me disturbed but also with this very feeling of discomfort.Are our thresholds for levels of excitement and sensation growing to a point that require more and more images of stylised extreme brutality and editing at supersonic speed in order to get in contact with the reality of today's world? Is this the only vocabulary in which the message can reach home?Is this generation of new creative filmmakers only going to take Scorsese as their prime inspiration, their mentor and their aesthetic leader?When with Scorsese the style rings true, his followers sound hollow at the core. They are full of beans and energetic pathos but empty of cinematic ideas, of innovation in their vocabulary and ultimately of real feeling to convey the humanity and real dramatic intensity of the characters of films such as Mean Streets or Goodfellas.The fast cutting MTV editing style, the "de rigour" voice over narrative, the multiple stories, the continuous bombardment of sound, the split screen easy device are all the signs of an advertising breeding and of a method of telling a story as subtle as a pop video. "Cidade de Deus" pretends to be a docu-drama faithful to the facts and the lives of the characters it portrays. Far from this intention we learn very little through the film neither of the socio-political context in which these events take place or, unlike its predecesor Amores Perros, the intensity of feelings of the characters surrounded by so much misery and death.There is a touch of intending to emulate the neorealism of say a Bicycle Thieves or La terra Trema in the use of non-professional actors playing their own lives. The ambiguity created by the use of real inhabitants recruited from the favelas itself add to the sense of reality but also a voyeuristic touch that left me with a bitter taste and a sense of exploitation of the real place and people.It reminds me of that Vogue magazine photo shoot in the 70's were incredibly sophisticated models in their latest Cardin or Pucci outfits were being photographed,Avedon style, with the Brazilian slums for background.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Brazilian epic covering gangs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is a Brazilian film that chronicles the formation of gangs in poor neighbourhoods of Rio de Janerio. The film is based on a true story and is an epic covering around 30 years. The story is told via the overlapping lives of several children who grow up to be gangsters. The film is very violent (most violent movie I have seen) so some might be turned off by it. The script is very good and the acting is great (this is remarkable considering how most of the actors are non-professionals hired from these same neighbourhoods). The film is very stylistic and borrows a lot from films like Pulp Fiction and Boogie Nights. A lot of shots are very cool and innovative. I also liked how music from that time period was interlaced within the film (as in Boogie Nights).If there is anything bad about this film, I would have to say that the style (although very nice) detracts from the issue. The message about gangs, the violent neighbourhoods, the corruption of the police, etc would have been more effective if the film followed a traditional docudrama style approach. This is really a minor point given that the film captures the essence of life and death in a way few other films have.Highly recommended to everyone that can live with violence... Even if you don't like the film, you'll learn about the lives of the poor in Brazil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understanding Urban Violence in Brazil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's common knowledge throughout the world that Brazil has a very serious problem of violence. The most outstanding example are the slums in Rio de Janeiro.Most of the people are not in direct contact with this violence and have a hard time to understand its causes. This movie tries to shed some light on the issue, by creating almost a documentary about a famous slum in Rio. The main character of the movie is not a person, but rather the place itself: Cidade de Deus (City of God).Beginning in the midst of the 60's, the story shows how a "popular" neighborhood, erected with the help of government financing, grows from a quiet spot to a Vietnamese War Scenario. The movie shows that the government was only interested in taking the poor people away from Rio's most beautiful postcards. The lack of social support, education and police transforms the place. And when there's no government present, there is no citizenship. When a society has no leaders, it creates its own. Gangs battle over this place to gain control and endup creating a country within a country.Fabulous editing, in the best style of Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh, this movie represents the best of Brazilian cinema today. If you have a chance to watch a copy of it, don't loose it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brazilian reality has surpassed the majority of attempts to portrait it in fiction. The acceleration of social decomposition has transformed violence into a banality.Few books have captured so completely this state of affairs (the Brazilian apartheid and the outlawing of the favelas), as does Cidade de Deus, by Paulo Lins. Written by a son of the favela, Cidade de Deus reveals, for the first time, how this ever increasing process of incrimination has ended by overflowing into drug dealing enterprises and the struggle for power in the hillside shantytowns.Cidade de Deus, the film by Fernando Meirelles, is an extremely powerful transposition of Paulo Lins's book. With a tremendous impact, modern and visceral, the film counts almost exclusively on the acting abilities of youngsters coming from the favelas around Rio de Janeiro.Meirelles and co-director Katia Lund worked with these kids for over six months, in a laboratory process comparable only to that undertaken by Hector Babenco while filming Pixote.Orchestrated by a director with profound knowledge of cinematographic grammar, Cidade de Deus renews Brazilian filmmaking, and offers the spectators the possibility of understanding the roots of social chaos which characterize our country today a little better.WALTER SALLES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best new film to premiere in Cannes 2002.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first reaction to this engrossing, thrilling, gutsy AND witty drama about ghetto life in Rio de Janeiro was: WOW! What a movie. It takes you for an unrivaled trip to the youth ghetto of Rio, the so-called "City of God". We follow the lives of some kids, who grow up in the late 60's - most of them don't live to experience the 80's. The only, or let's say: the fastest way to get out of these dumps are violence and drugs. Using violence and pushing drugs. You better not mess that order up, or you're done. While debutant Fernando Meirelles shows the incidents in ultra-realistic (and therefore mind-numbingly brutal) fashion, he nevertheless achieves great art by splicing up the story, going from the present to the past, using newest technology wisely, speeding up the tempo with great ease, but also slowing down whenever he has to and showing the ability to be tender. He teases the audience with hints about things to come, and when he gets back to those things, he always delivers in a big way. The film has about a dozen important characters, and it's amazing how Meirelles not only manages to introduce them with style, but also keeps track of them so that we always know who we are dealing with.Since there is nothing I could compare this film to, I'd like to say that it comes close to Scorsese's "GoodFellas". Ok, that is a totally different world, but it's just that Meirelles uses a similar approach: He doesn't feel superior to the people he's showing, and he doesn't judge them. He shows them and their actions, counting on the intelligence of the audience to understand the motifs, the short-comings and the needs of the characters on its own. Most importantly: He shows us violence in a way that is not cool. It hurts seeing those kids throw away their lives by falling to the way of the gun.So far, this is the biggest, most welcome surprise of the year. Let's just hope that the sometimes over-anxious marketing department of Miramax, which bought the film in Cannes, will be sensible enough not to over-hype "City of God".9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"City of God" tells yet another story of violence in a unique way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cycle of violence is not a subject filmmakers have ever shied away from. There are plenty of films like "City of God" that try and show such gratuitous violence that we almost become desensitized to it, we expect it. However, there is no film like "City of God" that tells this kind of story in rich, visual detail using some very compelling visual storytelling techniques.The film follows a narration and chapters structure, often going back in time to explain the events of the present via the film's narrator, the main character named Rocket, a boy from Cidade de Deus, a slum project in Rio de Janeiro. Rocket has many friends and acquaintances tied to the drug trade and/or people who steal and sometimes kill. While he doesn't do it himself, he's close enough to give us the story of those who do and explain how it has affected his life.The film starts off showing how in the 60s it all began with petty crime to make money and how that escalated into some bigger crimes that had serious consequences. It shows us specifically how one character, Lil Dice, changed everything with his violent ways. Director Fernando Meirelles gives us these little explanatory stories in chapter form with actually text titles to make it clear. With so many names and characters to remember, doing this with Rocket's narration is key to making this an accessible film.In the 70s, it's now Lil Ze (Dice's new name) that rules the streets. Where the only option to making money is to work your way up Ze's chain as he owns every drug ring in the area. It's a life of incredible violence in which all of Cidade De Deus' children believe that crime and dealing is the only way to make money.But while we see all these corrupted characters, we lose sight of how Rocket, an aspiring photographer, has managed to stay out of it, proof that it doesn't have to be that way, although the prospects for change look grim.What really makes this film different is Meirelles' work visually with lighting, color, a variety of non-traditional camera techniques. There is no element of traditional drama. All the scenes are particularly short or time passes rapidly in them. They are snapshot images meant to show us as many characters and lives as possible. While violence, drug-dealing and life in a poor area are not new subject matters, its Meirelles' work that makes this film stand out as one of the best ways of doing such a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping Crime/Gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loud music, joyful screams, and fascinating cinematography drew me in to 'City of God' from the off. Although i did wonder what sort of 'urban crime/gangster' film this as the first scene involved a chase through the slums of Brazil involving a chicken and what i consider toddlers. The film soon picked up to harsh crime film that i was expecting.Being a fan of 'crime/gangster' i have seen many films from this genre. Although they were either Guy Ritchie style British films such as 'Lock Stock..' and 'Football Factory'. Or American gangster films such as 'Boys in the Hood' and 'Goodfellas'. I am a big fan of these films but 'City of God was definitely something new. Director's Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund taught me something i didn't know, a lifestyle i wasn't aware of. A complicated script that is easy to follow tells the stories of two young boys who follow different directions. One who becomes a major drug dealer, and the main 'Rocket' who has always dream't of being a photographer. Giving up on this dream knowing it will never happen 'Rocket' seems to be following the path of many young men as a gangster or a hood, which many of the boys view as a glamorous life. The story is told through a couple of generations of brothers which helps to tell the story. The story is hard to explain, and being this a review... i believe that the film could have been a flop. i feel this because it is based in a place that a wide range of the audience can relate too, its in Portuguese, and is a complicated story line. But somehow i believe these make it a better film. The viewer learns so much about he characters and where they live. You cannot relate to where they live but i can relate to why they fight. For money, in revenge for loved ones and to stay alive. Which is something everyone would strive for.And although i believe it is a complicated storyline, with a range of characters and 'goings on'. The way the film is written, filmed and organised the film was easy to follow. And at the same time very powerful to watch.An iconic scene from the film is where Li'l Dice and his gang have a 2 small children cornered. The small children have to decide whether they are to be shot in the foot or the hand. The both weep and choose hand... which leads Li'l Dice to shot them both in the foot. This scene is very moving and emotional.I believe this scene represents the film. Brutality, intimidation and violence. But do not be put off by that. The film breath taking.My favourite scene is at the end. when the young, influenced children believe they now run the city. They are walk off into the distance- a shabby alleyway- talking arguing about who they should kill and who gets to do it. I think this is almost comical and funny as these children are acting there age arguing over who gets to do what. But at the same time talking about such a adult subject that children their ago should not even know aboutAll in all i believe that 'City of God' is one of the most gripping, exciting, moving and powerful films i have this year. It takes crime films to new level. Using diversity and powerful images to create new emotions i have never felt when watching a crime filmI look forward to watching the follow up 'City of Men', and i hope it lives up to its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expect I'm not the only one who understood the way this film fill and complete all the emptiness that hide in each person. Plenty stories and a complex storyboard. Real stories that enter in what is the real world. It is not a cruel movie plenty of blood spreading everywhere, it's a documentary which have been also used to help those people, who where after all the real actors of this enormous story. "Favelas" stories. And because of those original Brazilians musics, the ambiance that surround the spectators appears real. And as "Buscapé" said at the beginning: city of god, was a postcard... Since it came out at cinemas I have met a very poor number of people that knows this movie... that's really a shame, because is the exact example of what every movie must be: OK, good the story, good the super special effect, good the image, the music and the acting, but most important thing is the message and "city of god" got this point perfectly. 10, excellent is because i liked the back stages, the movie, the music, the acting, the plot, the story, and every scene is perfectly filmed its a chef d'oeuvre!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not see any creative genius in it at all. What am I saying? the director took the same approach to this film from another great American director, his name is Martin Scorsese in Goodfellas. Why was this film not as critically acclaimed internationally as this film? It had the same approach, all narrative from the main character, both the films had that one guy who always seemed like the obnoxious ring leader, both movies were based on a true story, both films were made into a movie from a book, both had a sick ending plot, both told the story from the middle, beginning, and then to the end. this film my have been influenced by Martin, but do not compare it to American films saying that this is fresh and new and something we could never produce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulp Fiction Style Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, there are a few grievances I have with this film. It's sort of made in a way where it's kind of spread into chapters. Sort of like pulp fictions is made into chapters, depicting the story of several different people and events, so too is this film. I don't think this adds anything to the film, since you'll probably end up confused by the number of people anyway. There are a bit of characters, and trying to follow the story of each one may be bit confusing. The film is also narrated by the main character. In essence he gives you a tour of the ongoings of the City of God. In a way, it sort of feels like you are being shown a documentary about a city, rather than being given a movie to view. The documentary style, though informative, seems to be a bit over used, and removes the no-documentary movie feeling. That being said however, the film is good for the story, and depiction of the struggles of both the city and the many characters of the film. The corruption, sorrow, anger, greed, love, and joy are all expressed very clearly, and the film allows you to fully understand these feelings in the characters (once you get them all straightened out). I realize that following only the main characters story line would have drastically crippled the film, and would not have been able to illustrate every other characters story. Because of this it is essential that there are very many characters in the film. Understanding this, it is difficult to lower the movies rating based on there being too many characters to distinguish, as it is necessary for the story line. All in all, this film is above average, however an 8 out of ten may be a little bit generous. A 7.6 would be more accurate. Watch it if you have an opportunity to, but don't go out of your way to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is so violent, it makes Tarantino look like Walt Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In old westerns they used to say "there is no law west of Dodge and there is no God west of the Pecos". I think those guys west of the Pecos would be shocked with "Cidade de Deus", even though you cannot say there is no God here. One of this film's most touching moment is when they start praying just before a gang war. It is so violent, it makes Tarantino look like Walt Disney, but at the same time it makes you understand and involves you in this terrible world of drug dealers. Some characters like Mane Galinha seem to have no option but to fall into crime. Others like Ze Pequeno are natural killers without any good feelings. But most of all you feel that all of them are victims of miserable living conditions. A great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People actually hate this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I look up a film on IMDb, I typically go to the "hated it" category and see 1) who is panning it, and 2) what other films they have reviewed and whether or not I share common tastes with the reviewer. Sadly, IMDb doesn't do a good job of filtering out trolls, so there is going to be one star reviews for Citizen Kane type films that aren't really serious, only an attempt to get under people's skin, or possibly an attempt to knock a film down on the Top 250.I also discount the "worst film of all time/I wasted two hours of my life" kind of reviews as attempts by the writer to get you to read their review. Besides, that approach is tired and cliché.City of God is the type of film that I can honestly only think of two type of "serious" negative reviews: People who are offended by the violence, and perhaps individuals who are dyslexic and can't keep up with the subtitles. For everyone else, this is patently a great, entertaining film.I try to rent this film at least once a year, and will watch it when it comes on Sundance or IFC. Aside from the technical aspects of the film, it is a great and compelling story.If you enjoy great gangster films like the Godfather or Goodfellas, you need to rent City of God as soon as you can. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

Must say I wasn't disappointed.The feel of the movie is very real and gives the viewer a chance to experience the reality of the slum-kids without being there in real life. Also the movie shows how many get "pulled" into making bad career choices. What makes the movie seem so realistic is that they used a lot of young kids that actually live in the "city of god" in real life. Makes the whole movie seem more like you're watching from the point of view from one of those kids.A must-see for movie enthusiasts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really loved this film, telling the story of the housing projects of Rio from their inception in the 60s to the end of the 70s through the eyes of a few of its major characters.I avoided this film for ages because I thought it would be a worthy lecture about third world suffering, but it really isn't. My one qualm keeping it from a 10 out of 10 is that with so much history and so many characters in the mix, there are a lot of loose ends and unresolved stories, despite it being about as long as you can sit still for.It's shot and directed beautifully, based on real events and people, and it doesn't condescend to the locals or make them out to be noble saints or any such rubbish. This is just about young people trying to survive - getting high, having fun, making money where they can, etc. The action is exciting and realistic but never glamorous. In the final part of the film we see where the cycle of poverty, zero education and violence ends up - it's like a tragic opera.</fullReview>

I work at customs and this has served as an excellent reference for my work. If you use cocaine and you see this movie you will probably feel so guilty you won't even need to go on rehab, you'll just dump the crap down the toilet and join the peace corps or something. i'm serious, this movie will affect you.warning: this is not Oprah, you will have to face some unpleasantness!</fullReview>

So what makes it different form the other movies of this kind?Well, it's just realistic,..a bit romanced (just enough for us watchers to stay keened). For sure it's a big production quality-wise (so money-wise) and thanks for that.No big main "hero" character, no morality, no useless violent (or sex) scenes (a lack of that? :) ..that's what it make of the "city of god" such a different movie. Cruel world described,..and well shown, although I don't think shooting remakes of the same kind is a good idea, this one is perfect, let's not make it commercial.On the very same level and topic, watch "la haine" , french movie.

I almost could have seen the Spanish version and would have been able to follow the movie. The acting was ridiculous, even the kids put Oscar performances on the table. During the end credits a clip rolls that was portrayed in the movie, and it showed how dead-nuts on the directing, cinematography, sets, cast were. It added a startling realism to what you just seen, then you begin to ponder what it has to be like living in those slums. In the end you are happy that the story teller, does eventually make it out and is successful, but at the same time, the gripping reality hits you, that out of all the characters of the story one ONE, makes it out. A sad life I am now even more thankful my family and I don't have to live. great movie, skip rental, and buy the damn DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Absolute Best Crime Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this film I felt it was almost too real. I couldn't separate the fact that this was cinema from how it affects me so realistically. I wasn't exploitative or needlessly violent like most crime films, but showed a city for what it truly is on the underbelly where age, gender, drugs, sex, race and money meet head on. The film is spectacular, every performance feels completely authentic the characters emotions are completely palpable. It's a disturbingly blunt and stylish view at a world we don't know but can't deny. A world we hate that exists yet are totally drawn towards. This film is better than any film made in America in the past 10 years, it belongs on the top #20 where it's at here, but it truthfully deserves a higher post. It's not only a great film, but it's has a conscience that is lacking from other crime films. The protagonist, Rocket, is the guiding light in this world of darkness, who leads us from temptation to temptation, mixing us in with these impoverished people and drug-fueled gangsters on a Homeric odyssey that has one of the most poetic and cynical endings I've ever witnessed. Not to be missed, if you haven't seen City of God, you are woefully missing out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never yet had I seen such a movie with all of the elements that I want in a movie, until I had seen this one. Who would've thought that it would come in a foreign film, or in a true story? "City of God" ( "Cidade de Deus" ) is the story of a teenage boy living in one of Rio de Janeiro's slums, and he dreams of becoming a photographer. The boy's name is Rocket ( Buscape, in Portuguese ), and little does he know that his passion for photography would allow him to take his camera and look at his world through the eyes of a journalist who is able to capture on film what so many reporters had been craving for so long but were not able to capture. ... It's interesting that Rocket also is the narrator of his story throughout the movie.But, even though Rocket is the main focus, it is not only his story. It's also the story of two other main characters: Little Ze, who is a ruthless kid who grows up to become the boss of the slum. And Knockout Ned, who is the very opposite of everything that Little Ze stands for. The two eventually butt heads, and all hell breaks loose.The fates of the characters in this movie prove to be never what you would expect, and their stories will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end! Shot in the actual slums not far from where the story really happened, using mostly local amateur actors whom had never been in front of a camera ( also from these slums ), this movie is directed so brilliantly that it makes you feel like you are right in the thick of the story. ..... It's tastefully done; not over the top with gore, while at the same time effective enough to get its point across.The movie always has you guessing, because just when you think you know what is going to happen next, usually it's something very different. ..... Also, the strategic use of flashback scenes to fill in the gaps of the story is a very nice touch.Along with an original soundtrack album which I feel is just as fantastic as the movie, the "City of God" movie will keep you on the edge of your seat from the get-go. In a setting of the period from the late 1960's to the late 1970's, the performances of this mostly under-21 cast is simply amazing, and very convincing ( especially considering the the majority of them are not professionals ).Also, one nice thing about the movie, is that you seem to notice one more thing in the movie with each additional viewing that you didn't notice in the previous viewing. Whether that was purposely done that way, or strictly a coincidence, either way it was a nice bi-product of an already great movie. ... To notice something new each time you watch the same movie is always a nice thing! To say anymore, I would have to spoil some of it. So, I'll just say ____ If you want to see a movie that really makes you feel, a movie that you want to tell your friends about, a movie that will leave you wondering what has become of the characters in the present day, and a movie that you will definitely not forget, "City of God" is definitely a movie for you! If you see this movie, please contact me. I'd love to talk with someone else who has seen it!Thanks! .... John Smith, Canton, Ohio, USA .... johnsmith2022@yahoo.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people shy away from foreign films because they:1) remember the (often) boring foreign films of the 1970s-1980s. 2) don't like reading subtitles 3) want some fluffy Hollwood escapist movie (forgetting that nine out of ten times they are disappointed)When I rented "JFK", there was so much rapid-fire, complicated dialogue that I finally decided to turn on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any important detail. Ever since then, I realized that subtitles can actually enhance a movie. After a few minutes, you don't even realize you're reading anymore.Over the years, I have taken a dozen trips to Brazil, and in my estimation, this movie is an amazingly realistic depiction of life in the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro. Some parts of that life seem really quite pleasant. It's not a depiction of abysmal poverty. Being poor in Rio doesn't necessarily mean sadness and despair. After all, these people do live in Rio de Janeiro, one of the most spectacularly beautiful and lively places on earth. You may not have much, but you can always go to the beach.That said, it still is heartbreaking to see how a clean, safe public housing site in Rio, so full of promise, degenerated into a chaotic nightmare of crime and death due to drug trafficking.However, don't think this movie is "a downer". It's a frequently riveting and intense film full of action, drama, and a bit of humor here and there. Other times, it is as laidback and carefree as the Carnival-loving, beach-going residents of Rio typically are.The story is narrated by a young boy, Buscape (whose nickname means "Rocket"). His ticket out of slum life is by pursuing photography. From his perspective, we see how a once idyllic neighborhood is destroyed by gang violence, mainly due to fighting over the control of illegal drug sales.Even very young children, some only 7 or 8 years old are involved in horrific crimes, and others are the victims of crime. Some of these children seem to have no qualms about just killing anyone they dislike. They shoot someone dead, and laugh about it.If I wanted to convince someone to start watching foreign films, I would choose City of God as the best way to change their minds. It is not only one of the three best foreign films I've ever seen, but one of the most remarkable movies you'll ever see.I gave this movie 10 stars, and I don't think I've ever gone that high before!</fullReview>

My brothers and I found this movie in Blockbuster for $2.99. That was the worst ripoff Blockbuster has ever dealt with. That's like giving away heart surgery or something. I would have paid $2.99 to read the back cover. The cinematography was flawless. The storyline, though based on a true story, was an original and brilliant, unlike most movies. I am a Saving Private Ryan fan. The reality in both movies is, well, very real. It makes you feel sorrow when a hero dies, and joy when some triumph for the good guys happens. This is very rare in a movie. I must say, I was very impressed. It proves my theory, that a movie can only be good when the actors, directors, and crew are on the same page, and allow some deviations from the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God"/"Cidade de Deus" tells the true (?) story of youth gangs in the titular city, a favela (slum) outside of Rio de Janeiro, in the sixties and seventies.The one thing that becomes immediately apparent is that "City" is an amazingly well made movie. Even though many of the actors are inexperienced, the acting is generally excellent, and the movie is beautifully shot and very stylish, told in a semi-chronological way, with some flashbacks and some foreshadowing.Yet no matter how stylish and flashy it is, make no mistake that this is a serious and realistic movie. The grim life in the favela and the often hopeless situations of its inhabitants become very clear, and it's not surprising that many of them, including very young children, resorted to crime.The movie is brutally honest and uncompromising in its portrayal of the life of the youth gangs: violence is everywhere, and it's shown in fairly graphic ways. Crazy and impulsive gang leaders shoot innocent bystanders and even their friends without even a glimpse of remorse, and little boys act like fully-fledged gangsters and unscrupulously kill each other. It certainly isn't easy to watch, but it is both very impressive and very unsettling, especially since its based on actual events and actual people.In spite of all this praise, there are a couple of things that could have been done better. First of all, the story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a boy who manages to stay out of (most) of the gang violence and manages to become a photographer. Unfortunately Rocket is a fairly boring character, and his story, while remarkable, isn't told very interestingly. In contrast, the main gang leader, Zhe, while obviously completely crazy, is a lot more fascinating.Also, this is an ensemble movie with a very large cast, and not all characters are fleshed out very well. With so many characters, many of whom look and sound a lot like each other (also due to the fact that most scenes are fairly poorly lit, and many of the action is very frantic), it's often quite hard to figure out what exactly is happening and to whom, let alone really care about it. It's not a huge problem since in part the movie is supposed to be a bit disorienting, but one might wonder whether it wouldn't have been better to focus on a smaller number of characters.That being said, I found "Cidade de Deus" to be a very good movie, although the 18th position it holds on the IMDb top list might be a bit overrated. Still, it's a very well-made movie, that tackles a serious subject in a very uncompromising and honest way, and several small shortcomings don't really distract from that.**** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The price of freedom?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very interesting presentation of the ongoing war among drug dealing gangs in Rio de Janeiro and between all of them and often corrupt government authorities. Much emphasis is placed upon the involvement of children, both as victims and perpetrators of the violence, and as beneficiaries of the large drug profits. I thought the treatment was unexpectedly evenhanded. As children have been excluded, by "modernizers" and other "do-gooders," from the legitimate economies of very poor countries, those who are unwilling or unable to bear the second-class status of dependents have been forced more and more into crime and/or soldiering to attain a status of respect. Of course total rejection of the very thought that any child might be conscious of or desire respect and self-sufficiency is itself an integral part of the disrespect to which they are subjected. It should be noted that the DVD includes also an actual documentary, almost as long as the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this ghetto tale of two boys growing up in a suburb of rio de janeiro is a perfect film. The acting is 100% natural and looks as if these kids actually did grow up in that neighborhood (maybe they did, some directors like to use local regular people). The script was brilliantly written, it was a very entertaining film. There's not much more I can say other than that the director did a great, job, this film was always interesting, and the actors were great, the characters were very well written and this film blows many of the gangster type movies based in America out of the picture. 10/10 #45 on my list of all time favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another movie with one of the characters narrating the story.In this case a real life story. The direction is just perfect. If he had just shown it as a single long story it wouldn't have been that effective. Breaking up the whole story and connecting them from one to an other was a perfect idea which worked out perfectly well. About the movie , city of god as i cud perceive it was mainly a city of blacks where violence is at its peak. Gangsters,Drugs,Deaths,Gunshots are pretty common for the people living in the city of god. Maybe this sounds common as we see this in many movies, but what is uncommon is that a person burying his alive wife, a young boy killing all the people in a motel, small boys who can hardly speak roaming around with guns etc. Part of the story is based on revenge. Everything for just the desire of a person to become the boss of hoodlums. An excellent movie with a strong story and perfect depiction of reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just thought the movie was very good. It held my attention from beginning to end. I also enjoy movies that make me care about the characters and this one made me care about Rocket, Benny, Carrot and even Lil' Fe (I could not help but feel his pain at Benny's farewell party). I will recommend this movie to several friends who are so-called "movie buffs". If you are not a fan of subtitled movies, this is not for you. I feel that if this movie was watched dubbed, it would take away some of the powerful drama that it has. I did not give it a ten because I am not a fan of slow-mo, speed up type of filming, but even that did not take away from the grittiness of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Growing up in a slum of Rio de Janeiro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call it my penchant for sunny places, or for sharp editing... or for growing up movies, or for a new appreciation of realism... I found all of these in this movie.The casting is excellent, the pace perfect and the narration varies between a wry that's-the-way-it-is attitude and auto-derision.Also, it's impressive the way that the narrator restricts himself to relatively brief comments that help stitch pieces rather than indulging any desire to weigh in with moral judgments - a temptation difficult to resist for some, yet once you're done watching the movie, you realise how short-sighted and knee-jerk your initial reactions were, how pointless really, when confronted with such situations.And the soundtrack has everything - quick-paced beats to heart-rending pieces and some great oldie goldie disco hits too. Even "Kung-fu fighting"! The music, the sunlight and the warmth/heat were, for me, the three big non-textual cues permeating this movie.I might even have given this a 10 except for a few John Woo style cuts here and there (not that that's necessarily a bad thing, just a personal aversion, that's all).I saw it dubbed in French without subtitles, so cannot comment on the quality of the dubbing in other languages. In French, it was quite well done, I thought - and that's not always the case! This also means that I cannot warrant for the quality of the delivery of the actors or of the narrator. What I heard in French was good, but I have no idea what it sounds like in Portugese.Give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Styalized brilliance in a thrilling and gripping journey. Ditch the Hollywood formula. YOU WILL NOT LEAVE YOUR SEAT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an avid user of IMDb. When I see a good film I will give it a good vote. When I see an excellent film I may just give it a ten. "City of God" is unlike anything I have ever seen. This film takes the boundaries of excellence and destroys them--it is the only film that has inspired me to compose a comment. Take brilliant directing, a captivating story and excellent cinematography, and you will get "City of God"."City of God" opens in the chaotic slums of Rio de Genero. The audience is brilliantly thrown into the madness as a mob of gun wielding gangsters vigorously pursue a run- away chicken. Rocket, who narrates the film, finds himself caught between the mob, urging him to nab the chicken, and a squad of intervening police officers. The confusion and dilemma between opposing sides in the first scene come to define the film. Right when the audience begins to ask "why?" it is thrown back in time and carried through the history of the City of God, following the exploits of rocket and other "hoods", otherwise known as hoodlums by other residents. Possibly the most fascinating character, if I were forced to choose one, would be L'il Zé, who was formerly referred to as L'il Dice. L'il Zé is a perfect example of weakness and tyranny. The impressionable child rises to power in the devastated slums, only to be destroyed by his own design and his own self-conscious. He is the victim and the criminal, the manipulated and the manipulator, all rolled into one beautifully portrayed mess,Perhapse the most compelling feature of "City of God" is that the force of good is seemingly absent. Each character is sucked into the cycle of horror and is kept there spinning. There is no Hollywood ending or simple solution as the cyclone continues to ravish the city in a new wave of gang violence. While the Hood ring leaders die in combat, a new order of violence is born in the eager convictions of the misguided youth. Ditch the formula, show predictable cinema the cold shoulder and enjoy the brilliance of "City of God".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most incredible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very sceptical when I first put this DVD in my player and began the film, not because I hadn't heard that the film was brilliant but because i had heard the film was all in sub titles. Now the idea of a fantastic film for me is one where u get totally drawn in and so immersed in the film yet I believed that i wouldn't be able to do this if i was having to read to understand the plot. I couldn't of been any further incorrect. This film is amazing. The plot, the shots, the camera, the direction, the script, the acting absolutely everything about this film is very very impressive and from a media student point of view the editing was of such a high standard that i personally hadn't witnessed before. I agree totally that the film is shocking violent and brutal yet i think anything less and this wouldn't of been the film that it is. The shock factor is only a shock to us as we don't experience situations like this, yet in the setting from which the film is shot from it is common everyday practise. I think one of the most successful aspects of this film is the fact that it sticks true fully to what life really is like in the Brazilian slums, the temptation is clearly there for over exaggerated crimes and police chases yet the temptation is not pursued. All in all i think that this is a truly fantastic movie and one which en captures its audience and forces you to take notice. If you haven't watched this film do so and if u have watched this film watch it again its just as amazing second time over.Ad</fullReview>

It is disturbing for many - especially those who need to take a look outside of America and see the parallels of the problems plaguing children and low income communities in the 60's and 70's. But here is the "rub" - why do two children who come from the same place turn out SO differently? One child's aspirations to become a professional photographer against the other who becomes a product of the environment? I believe this film, City of God, sets out to answer that. These situations are not indicative of Brazil or America or ... ??? And if one pays close attention, there are many lessons in this for everyone all over the world to grasp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films I have ever seen have managed to capture the essence of society's oft-lamented yet never-resolved problems of illegal drug trafficking and the rampant street crime as depicted in the City Of God in Brazil, as shown to us through the remarkably unskewed viewpoint of its many colorful real-life street characters. Of course the street-urchins recruited to play the roles of certain individuals now scattered in time have become first-time actors as a result of this astounding motion picture, and the characters they portray are brought to vivid, realistic life on the big screen in a manner that will captivate audiences from beginning to end, despite its rather long running time. (__-?) The process of sitting through this depiction of inner-slum street gangs and how one generation picks up the business of the older one that leaves it behind for them, is nothing short of revelatory. I thoroughly enjoyed Scorcese's Gangs Of New York, but I will say this: City Of God makes GONY look out to be but child's play. For one thing, Fernando Meirelles utilizes a nonfiction canvas with which to illustrate certain points that Scorcese utilized fictional conventions to get across. In Scorcese's depiction of violence, we are nearly saturated with violence almost for the sake of violence, a sort of hyped-up ultra violence that drives these kinds of gangster-pics, and which might very well repel a certain demographic of viewers who just don't care for that sort of aesthetic. In Meirelles stark and up-close depiction of the real-life dangerous goings-on of certain groups of street gangs, the violence carries with it the reflection of truth, and despite even being possibly more extreme, it can be accepted more as a fact of life or somehow manages to become easier to digest, if not flinch away from. CoG makes GoNY look like child's play, and that's ironic seeing as how it is children which take up the mantle and carry on the business which the older generation leaves for them. I walked out of City Of God a changed man - a refreshed man, that is, because it reminds you just how stark and real this whole business of the natural order of things is. And conversely, just how real the whole nature of the order of business is. Sit down behind the camera lens and allow yourself to be transformed as our young true hero guides you through this City Of God and shows you just how comfortably you sit there in the theatre contemplating it. Do not miss this transcendental film. Open your eyes and see through the lens of a child. Watch how this child grows up and passes through the necessary rituals to become a man. Ask yourself what it is this man has shown you through his eyes. And do not close your eyes to what is going on around you ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can't Hollywood get it right with all these big budget movies, when a small film like this does it the right way. First, the script was great as well as the cinematography. It's no wonder those things as well as the director got nominated for so many awards. It's a wonder it didn't win for best foreign film. The movie was based on real events about a boy named Rocket who lives in the slums of Rio. Many kids there turn to a life a crime and he witnesses all of it. Two warring gangs take over the streets. He gets the opportunity to take pictures of it and gets them in the newspaper. At the end it tells us he won awards for the pictures he took, including a death picture of the boss of the City of God.Just the way the story was told and how we are introduced to the characters is what really makes this film great. It could have easily been confusing, but all the flashbacks as to how some of the kids became hoodlums was well written and made sense. And it was something to learn how Rocket's older brother, Goose, was killed, but still Rocket managed to stay out of the gangs.FINAL VERDICT: The subtitles are easy to follow and don't hinder the enjoyment of this movie. I highly recommend it. It reminded me a lot of Blackhawk Down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you live through the TOP 250 List of the IMDb best films ever, there are certain milestones of movie-history which come along uncompared to whatever came thereafter. Godfather's epic design, Shawshank Redemptions brilliant story-developing, Pulp Fictions step into the next millennium of fulfillment for the movie needs of a new generation. Breathtaking adoption of fairy tales like LOTR 1-3, melting Kids and Adults together in Toy Story 1 &amp;2 leaves one back in the seat forever. What should be next? Any new movie design possible to fit in the TOP 250 IMDb List. Impossible I shouted out loud and slept well in my movie chair, until I have seen CITY OF GODS. With no expectations at all, I didn't breathe for the entire movie, no time for POPCORN and the drink. The opening scene sums up MTV Type of Clip-Movies in 3 Minutes and leaves u wishing to read the book, so that you can check for the ending, because you are thrilled into the last peace of your body. But the movie keeps its tension till the end. Cinematography at its best, with really unseen techniques not being incorporated for the selfsuck of the cinematographer, purely for the needs of the storytelling. Not a single actor appeared in TV Sitcom before, not on stage or in the movies before and all are playing there lives better than anybody could do. I could continue to describe why I think, that this movie is expanding the TOP 250 List not only because of the voters, it is really one step ahead in movie development and the best of it: It is not out of the Hollywood-Sundance-Cannes Bowl.</fullReview>

Considering it is a foreign film, one must suspect that it is not the regular spill we see in theaters coming out of Hollywood. It is a crime film and the story about the "favela" (ghetto in Brazil), shows little kids who in the real world are not so little. Forced to live in a community where they have no escape and are forced to fight their way out. Violence and language in the film only add to show the realism of the film since it was based on events in the area. Brilliantly filmed and well deserving of academy awards.

		<fullReview>Sometimes people make mistakes. My mistake was giving this movie an 8. The frenetic pace, and chaotic style of film-making was somewhat distracting. Also, with a Portugese dialog, and English subtitles, I wondered if anything was "lost in translation." After a second viewing, a revote was necessary. Now the movie was rated a 9. Why? Because the director's style made it difficult to ascertain that, indeed, there was excellent acting on the part of all of the film's main characters. That was because continuous use of hand-held cameras, short vignette segments, and fast-paced editing obscured the fine portrayals by the young actors.After a third viewing, a revote was necessary. Now the movie was rated a 10. Why? Because the film's message is important, and vividly told. The stark images from the slums of Rio contrast violently with the tourist image of "Rio Carnivale." The film, following the short lifespans of three generations of young gangsters, illuminates how and why children are drawn into gang life. A chilling ending to the film leaves the audience wondering if the cycle can ever be broken.</fullReview>

Although both boys grow up in the same place and under pretty much the same circumstances, Buscape become a photographer while Ze becomes the local drug lord, pretty much running the city. The story follows both boys through their lives from early 60's and into the 70's. This movie is impressive on a number of different levels. It's not only a great story of people but it's also a brilliant gangster flick incorporating everything including guns, drugs and gang war. This film works for a number of reason but, primarily, it works because it makes you feel for the characters. This outstanding story line is paired with a smart, witty script, great acting and some dazzling directing work. The package as a whole is brilliant.9/10 Well worth watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`City of God' is a Brazilian cinematic masterpiece. Thank God that it has been nominated for 4 academy awards. Director Fernando Meirelles mesmerizing look at teenage ganglords in a Brazilian slum-town nicknamed the City of God is one of the best crime films of all time. Hey! I know this might be an overstatement so please do not gang up on me. The film is narrated by the reticent teenager named Rocket who lives in the `city of god' but is not a hoodlum himself. However, he is surrounded by a life of crime &amp; violence that commands this ghetto. The teenage ganglords control the city of god and there is minimal police intervention. Hey, why not start a Youth Crime Watch program? I had to shoot that one in there (shameless promotion). Alexandre Rodrigue as Rocket sparks up an astronomical performance. However, the most puissant performance of the film is delivered by Leandro Firmino as the menacing youth gang-leader Lil'Ze. His killing-spree ruthless demeanor makes him the most intimidating character I have seen in film this year. Among the aforementioned, other godlike attributes in the `City of God' is the amplitude that Meirelles inserts in its screenplay &amp; narrative. The film is based on accounts of a true story and Meirelles &amp; Screnwriter Paulo Lins are most credible in keeping it Rio, I mean real. `City of God' is magisterial but yet disturbing. Nevertheless, it should be blessed as one of the best foreign films in history. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cidade de Deus" is a Brazilian movie that is set in the slums of the same country. We follow two brothers over the years and their lives develop completely differently. It is a world of crime, drugs, desperation, but also a world of hope for a better future. We find out about their involvement with gangs, with girls and also about their hobbies in general. One big hobby of one of them is photography and it may shape the path to the better future I just mentioned. The film runs for over 2 hours and was directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund. Bráulio Mantovani adapted Paulo Lins' novel and the result may be Brazil's most famous film of all time.This one scored 4 Academy Award nominations and won a BAFTA for its editing back over 10 years ago. I personally felt it was a pretty decent watch. I cannot see the real greatness that catapulted this movie into the top25-highest rated movies of all time on IMDb, but it's not a bad film either. There are 2 or 3 moments of greatness, but the rest is merely good. Sometimes, it even drags a bit, which is why I believe this film could have been kept down to 100 minutes without losing anything truly significant that would have hurt the overall movie. My favorite scene was probably the one in the club with all the hectic lights and actions and one guy taking out his gun which results pretty much in a catastrophe. Very intense moments in here. I wish there could have been more moments like these. Still, as a whole, I recommend the watch. Pretty good movie for the most part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most grotesquely violent movie I've ever seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the director's aim in making this movie was to make the most grotesquely violent and repellent movie in the history of cinema, then I think he's probably cracked it. This is a train wreck of a movie, one that at the same repels and engages the audience; well, that's what it did for me anyway. Certainly, there's a Hell of a film-making talent here and the end result is truly, and sadly, unforgettable. I can't say I enjoyed seeing this movie but technically it does have great merit. And, having sat through this movie, now I know that the very last place in the whole world that I would like to see at first hand is this slum outside Rio. I've never had any great desire to go to Brazil or to any of its major cities despite having traveled widely. Now I know for sure that I can give Rio a miss, especially after hearing from a good friend that he was robbed at knife-point on Copacabana beach some years ago. The movie gets 7 out of 10 and Brazil gets zero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A exploratory viewpoint on stories about life of slum dwellers' midst the power, violence and mainly drugs in Rio de Janeiro, the capital city of Brazil. Surprisingly this gem is the finest jewel of the rather unknown director duos. Based on true events, the casting director has done a tremendous job in getting the actors who a lot like their real life counterparts. Fantastic direction and equally good actors. You can see what the upcoming splurge capital goes through. Even though it's shiny on the outside, there's still dirt (city's slum and drug infestation) underneath. The realism is high. The narration is superb. It'll be a good and enjoyable challenge for you to connect the dots as the story progresses. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my point of view, it has got to be one of the most violent movies I've ever seen. From the moment the murderers start, we feel like watching a Tarantino's production-- in big style, may I say. "Cidade de Deus" is a movie that shows a violent community in 1970's Brazil, specially in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which is known by it's enormous social difference. There are plots and subplots, with a relatively fast screenplay, which is necessary to show everything they wanted to. Whilst some are used with cruelness in movies, I admit I thought this was too exaggerated, and sometimes, even implausible. For instance: why would "Zé Pequeno" kill and hunt everybody out there and nobody could do anything? There are lots of bad guys in this movie that could have easily killed him if they wanted to, but writers preferred to let him live until the end. Other than that, there are great performances, with an engaging plot that makes you enjoy some characters, and even understand why they're going those things. It may not be a beautiful movie, but it's the biggest Brazilian production to this day, and I'm proud of that. Congratulations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic film about gang life in Brazil. For one thing, this film is visually stunning. The cinematography is gorgeous to look at. The camera motion and editing is relentless. This gives the film a raw, realistic feel, as if we are watching these events through the characters' eyes.In addition to the amazing visual spectacle, it is very well written. It takes us through the lives of each member of the youth gang and flashbacks are used to give important background information. This way, we see the development of these kids, and how they got sucked into the gang lifestyle. From the sociopathic Li'l Ze to the extremely charismatic Benny, all of the characters are unique and fascinating to watch.This film does not shy away from violence, and there are some disturbing scenes. However, it is not overly dark or preachy. In fact, there is some humor mixed in as well. The tone of this film reminds me of Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas". It shows both the glamor and the downfall of the gangster lifestyle. This is a very powerful and entertaining film and well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing and terrifyingly realistic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going through the top 250 seeing which movies looked good and I came upon City of God. I was kind of skeptical at first because of the subtitles, but I got it anyways. The movie is very unique, taking the whole gangster concept to a different level, using young men who basically feel they have no choice but to become hoodlums and deal drugs. Rocket, the main character, is very likable and funny at times. I felt for the characters and thought the actors were very, very good. As I said, it seems so real, because if I'm not mistaken, it's based on a true story. It's kind of disturbing sometimes to see young kids dealing drugs, smoking, and shooting other people(or getting shot at), but it makes it very intense. I thought the subtitles were going to get really annoying, but I got used to them fast and they only bothered me a few times when they were talking pretty fast. Overall, I feel this movie is unique, awesome, and great. Very deserving of the high rating it has right now, 10/10.</fullReview>

The actors are brilliant considering they are all relative unknowns, well in Britain and the US anyway. The film takes a look at the underworld of brazil's largest city, Rio De Janero and what is discovered will shock as much as it will entertain you. A city that is rife with crime, from seasoned gangsters to 10 year old boys, everyone is killing, stealing and dealing their way through life in order to survive in the city of god.

		<shortDescription>It doesn't suffice to call "City of God" a Brazilian "Mean Streets".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cidade de Deus" (called "City of God" in English) knocks the breath out of you. This story of life in Brazilian slums makes you feel like you're in the slums with the characters. It follows Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) as he grows up in these places, and then joins a gang. You see, in these slums, either you join a gang or nothing ever becomes of you. So, Rocket is pulled through a world of drugs, violence, and every ugly thing that you can imagine; it's his only ticket out of complete isolation.I figure that some people would jump to call "City of God" a Brazilian "Mean Streets". Methinks that such a description doesn't suffice. This movie is far more profane, far more graphic than "Mean Streets" (although they both treat the same kind of subject). Of course, it's extreme, no-holds-barred portrayal of the desperation and violence of this existence is what makes this movie so good. I think that Brazilian Pres. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva actually praised the movie for its accurate portrayal of life in the country's slums. I don't know the slums personally, but either way, prepare to have the breath knocked out of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay movie, but not a masterpiece like the reviews make it out to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City of God is one of the highest rated movies here on IMDb, which has me ask the question: why? Yes, it has some intense scenes, endearing acting, and interesting usage of camera angles, but other than that, City of God is unremarkable.My first and main complaint about City of God is the high number of characters. There were so many different characters (who all looked very similar) that it became hard to follow what was going on in the story. With so many different characters, it was also difficult to make a connection with any one of them.I am on the fence when it comes to the cinematography of City of God. I think during some of the scenes the camera angles and filters were very clever in conveying a certain mood. On the other hand, sometimes these aspects felt unnecessary and almost seemed as though the filmmakers were just experimenting around.Overall, I don't think City of God is as great as I was lead to believe. In some instances, it feels like a cheaply made movie. Plus, the run time was much too long. The filmmakers probably should have cut some characters and subplots out of the film to focus more on the main character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THAT great?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the course of 25 years or so, we are told the (true?) story of several poor youths who grow up in the slums of Brazil, leading to a life of violence, drugs, and organized crime. The focus, though, is usually on Buscapé, a young man who chooses not to dive head first into the grime but to simply try and work his way through it. He also has a penchant for photography, which is just the ticket he needs. City of God is similar, both in style and content, to the likes of Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas. Trendy camera-work, (semi-)hip dialogue and humor, shocking, brutal violence, and a mob-like plot line are all aspects of it and actually done decently. The scene in which a boy must choose to be shot either in his hand or foot is a favorite! That all said, there was something about this movie that I did not like and I can't put my finger on it?I just didn't leave the theater thinking it was THAT great. And a ranking of 16 (48 when I wrote this review back in February of 2004) on IMDb? I just don't see that. It wasn't a bad movie though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why people love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be wrong (I'm not), but I imagine that most of IMDb's audience is composed of prepubescent, middle- to upper-middle class mamas-boys who hide behind the incognito status in an ill-conceived attempt to seem tough. And that's fine, and yes I have a point. People like you need this movie to be based on the truth, you're so warped in your overprotected, sterile life in a ridiculously puritan culture that this kind of intangible reality is all you have left to keep you from offing your fellow virgin colleagues at school. What else is a major factor in this unconditional love for having other people live a life of misery and violence? Ignorance (deep...). The stupider the person, the more one-dimensional their outlook is on foreign culture. They think Africa, their minds rush off to a malnourished Somali child with a hood over his head in a refugee camp... nothing else matters to them, that's Africa and that's final. Now, think Brazil... samba, Pele, Rio, poverty, violence, drugs... and all that noise. That's all this country is... nobody can walk the streets without being ransacked by a half-dozen monkey boys who will take your money, rape you and thrash you to within an inch of your life. All women are prostitutes, all people do all day is watch reruns of Pele's soccer matches and dance to Carnival music. Now, I've lived in Brazil for some 18 years, 2 of them in S?o Paulo, I've been to Rio, and I currently reside in one of the wealthier cities in the country (wealth in Brazil?? he must mean he owns a lot of soccer-playing prostitutes). I've never been mugged (what?? you just said you went to Rio!!). This city is overrun by BMW's, high-powered executives, and a ridiculously high standard of living, you rarely see a beggar walking the streets... by the way, I live in Brazil. Now, if you're as retarded as I imagine you are, you're there with a pathetic smirk on your acne-ridden face going "well la-di-da for you". I want you to mock me, because by doing so you're confessing to being a moron. Now, about the movie. I loved it... it's great micro-nonfiction that summarizes in a very stylized manner an issue going on in the ostracized portions of society, the portions that some people need to live in pain in order to feel better about themselves (yes, you..). Now, what's the problem with it? It echoes the stereotype the American society embraces as supreme regarding life outside their fortress, and the fact that the director is Brazilian furthers this stupidity. I'm not going to waste my time lecturing potential viewers, everyone has their head cemented miles up their own a*s, inertia is a major lifestyle, self-indulgence is the most pragmatic of dogmas that you people perpetrate on yourselves, your opinion is an absolute truth, no matter how much of it is based on creative coloring-in of the proverbial blanks (in most cases, a blank sheet). Not to worry, as long as you stay tucked within your make-believe world, nothing will harm you... be safe, the world never was any bigger than you wanted it to be; blame your parents for that, they activated the self-destruct button in your brain long before you were born.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This very long movie is entirely in Portuguese (what I call the devil's language). Yet, you quickly get sucked in and no longer notice you're reading subtitles. The story is more or less that of 2 boys in the hood, one who wants to be a photographer. The other follows a very Scarface-esquire path to rise to the peak of gangsterdom. Oddly, while neither one helps the other on purpose, neither could achieve what they did without the other.IMDb currently ranks this film at 18 of all time, which seems greatly over-rated. Good movie? Yeah. Great movie? Yeah. But 18th of all time? Maybe not. Three things I really liked about this film.1. The great use of Carl Douglas' "Kung Fu Fighting" during a party scene. 2. The explicitness. Full nudity of men and women, little kids swearing and doing drugs - shooting people in cold blood and laughing. It is this ability to shock and stun that really makes this film great and not just a knockoff of other gangster tales. 3. The interwoven tales. Like Pulp Fiction, all the characters connect to all the others - and not always in a linear direction. This film requires a minimum of three viewings to truly appreciate it. Very high recommendation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With nothing but rousing praise leading me into the theater, I should have expected such a disappointingly inauthentic and stylistically inappropriate film. City of God is not half as depressing as others suggest, or as it should be, and the dialogue throughout is embarrassingly generic. It had a glossy texture with doses of disturbing violence mixed into a mostly nostalgic and derivative coming of age story. While I was never bored - there's certainly no lack of action or story telling energy - I never felt connected to these one-dimensional characters (except sometimes Benny). People are introduced and killed off before we could ever feel emotionally connected to them (in this way the comparison to Pulp Fiction is valid, though Pulp Fiction was PULP, and this is supposed to be a meaningful film about the plight of street kids in Rio). Overall, it's a big budget after school special. For a real film on the subject check out Bunuel's Los Olvidados.</fullReview>

Slickly packaged within the ultra violent veneer of the postTarantino gangster genre City of God is replete with bullets,bodies, and just enough flesh to keep the international distributorshappy. It's an epic covering decades and including a good portion of theBrazilian population. It's also aggressively aware of the latestvogue of digital effects and story telling digressions (ala GuyRitchie's Snatch). Everywhere the camera and narratorbackpeddle through the third world carnage. At one level, the rollercoaster pretense is intriguing. However, given the reality of thesocial catastrophe lying at City of God's core the movie issurprisingly trite. If you didn't know the police in slums of Brazilwere corrupt then this movie will be an eye opener. And, despitethe fact that hundreds of those killing and being murdered arechildren the film lacks any connection, and any real humanity,beyond the level of the most superficially apology. It's excitingBrazil is capable of depicting the slaughter of it's people in suchan eye popping manner. It's to bad this film fails to connect withwhat lies at the heart of the matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie with great expectations, believing that the extremely high IMDb rating is probably well deserved. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Acting is very poor, screenplay is a confused mess of violence, there is absolutely no character development or any credible story, just a shallow, senseless stream of murders and shootouts.We are supposed to believe that the Big Boss of the Ghetto (who is supposedly controlling all the drug traffic in the area) is walking around and shooting kids who are about 7 or 8 years old? He has no better things to do, eh? No soldiers to do the dirty work for him? He wasn't even able to buy himself a car, so he goes on foot instead?! We are supposed to believe that the Big Boss has no enemies and that he has managed to establish peace in his large ghetto, although he is a psychopath and a vicious killer since he was a little kid when he supposedly killed everybody in an average sized motel and walked away, totally unharmed? We are supposed to believe that the Big Boss wants total peace in his area (because it's good for drug business) but ten minutes later he rapes a woman and kills half her family just because she didn't want to dance with him?! He isn't worried about the police investigating that massacre, eh? He is the Big Boss and the supreme drug lord, but he is in fact jealous and lonely and unable to find himself a girlfriend? I could go on and on and fill the whole screen with dumb inconsistencies, but I think you are getting the picture by now: Stallone's action movies actually have better and more contrived plots than this crap. Avoid this movie and ignore high IMDb rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm losing my credit for IMDb rates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was what I just watched really the film all the hype was about? I really can't believe what makes people be so shallow and appreciate that movie- like crap. Was that a movie actually in the first place or just an emotionless documentary about Brazilian crime-stricken streets? I'm asking because I really don't know and am still wondering how come such an abject movie can even get so famous and be rated so high in IMDb.First off, I didn't buy it. I really don't believe these pictures that I have just seen are so-called real stories of the Brazillian living in Cidade De Deus. Maybe the general outline of the plot can be linked to a true story but I don't want to believe Rio streets are full of gangs most of which are comprised of children. Are the Brazillian so brutal to recruit children as hoods? Because that is what that movie leads me to believe. I hope that's not really the case in Brazil as depicted by Fernando Merielles in Cidade De Deus. Secondly, if we talk about the movie, there were so many stories left hanging in the air. I was shocked when it neared the end to see that the stories told at the beginning had actually nothing to do with the general plot of the film. I prayed Deus that as the movie kept going a story would arise and all the events would get linked to a sustainable idea and my time wouldn't get wasted as such;however, the credits came but what I hoped for didn't. Everyone killed everyone and the last guys standing were little children making plans to kill their 'enemies'. Was I expected to laugh at that really? If you were going to finish the film the same way as you started-killing and raping-why did you guys really waste my time and didn't tell me that beforehand? I would go watch a wildlife documentary where lions eat antelopes and learn more about 'how tough life can be in some places'. I couldn't believe everything in the movie turned out the way I guessed they would. What's the point of watching a massacre really, I cannot understand. And finally the director of that movie should learn in what ways a movie differs from a documentary. Because a movie differs from a documentary only if it has characters developed. If you have no character depth then you shouldn't name that crap a movie. We should name it another way and look at it through another perspective. Because when we watch it as a movie it doesn't meet the need.For it to be a movie, we should have been given more than just a narrative voice to the main character's feelings. We watched a movie but we still don't know who our main character is.To conclude, I watched this film just to dispel the disappointing effects of Slumdog disaster.However, it didn't come any better. I hoped Cidade De Deus was the better one in the comparison but what I have found really let me down incredibly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A violent cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really disappointed with this film. It is sold as a sort of triumph of the human spirit film, but it is more like a typical mafia gangster film transplanted to Brazil and the seventies. I was waiting for the Godfather to come out any minute and say "He takes out a knife, yah take out a gun." Scene after scene is of someone getting killed and the deaths have all the depth and meaning of a pixel creature getting shot in a video game. This film entertains on the most base level and has no depth whatsoever.I can't say that I cared about anyone in this film, except for maybe Knockout Ned. The main character doesn't really do anything to improve his life. It is more like he just wanders out of the neighborhood. Where is the triumph in that? He also never seems to pass judgement on anyone or anything that happens around him. Its like stuff just happens. This dude died, and then that dude died, and yawn.... Great, he has the moral character of a robot, real inspiring.I also noticed that its one of those "based on a true story" films, like that is supposed to make us think. "Wow, I just saw a part of life that I never understood before. Its hard to believe that life is so cheap and that no one cares about anything in this neighborhood." Well, I don't buy it. Its just too cartoonish to be real. Maybe the basic story line happened but that is about it.By the way, my wife walked out on this film. I guess she thought going to the meat packing plant and watching cows being slaughtered would probably be entertainment at the same level. But at least it wouldn't be set to Samba music!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For sure it is a great movie but a very factional movie! Living in Brazil isn't exactly like that... It is a country almost large as US, and it has deep differences between one state and another.Cidade de Deus tries to show a little the hard and criminal life of Rio de Janeiro city (probably the worse and most dangerous city in Brazil).But it isn't entirely like that! Far from the biggest cities as Rio de Janeiro, people live in peace, studying and working very well. That's the problem of movies... they can distort world's point of view of something.South of Brazil is a very good place to live, good development, little criminality, polite people and great infra-structure (eg. Curitiba, Santa Catarina). S?o Paulo, the biggest and most important city of Latin America is the heart of Brazil and of South America economy. Art, leisure, culture, nightlife, many different people and innovations. Of course there is poverty in S?o Paulo, but it is not so different from NY.Particularly I don't recommend a visit in Rio de Janeiro... but if you really want to know how Brazil is like you should try S?o Paulo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an awesome film, that has really set the standards for 2003. The samba score sets a tremendous pace, and the film moves at breath-neck speed. The nod to "Goodfellas" is all too obvious. It's witty, well-written, well-acted, and perhaps not as violent as you'd expect. Two scenes stick in the mind, the decision as to which child to kill and the slow-motion strobe-light execution at the party. Are these kids or gangsters? Excellent, don't miss.</fullReview>

It was better to spend the money to actually help these people in Brazil. I know that these things should get taken care of but a lot of children are getting killed in this movie and it is so harsh and not right even if a single child gets to be the victim of seeing these scenes , and making these kinds of movies cannot and won't do any good for them nor the people who are watching these.

		<fullReview>Being based on a true story, having lots of non-actors, making some very imaginative choices in cinematography, and so forth, this film really throws a lot of stuff at you, and it is impressive in its ability to keep a great many plates spinning in the air (although to tell the truth, if the narrator had said "but it's not time to tell So-and-so's story yet" just one more time, I would have screamed).Unfortunately, the next day when you look back on the experience, you realize that all you really got was a couple of hours worth of just another gangland storyline with a little too much Guy-Ritchie-influenced camera work and more than a few this-will-get-them-talking shock cinema moments.Original grade: 6 out of 10. Worth seeing, probably not worth recommending.Revised grade (3/7/2012): 1 out of 10. Abysmal. Horribly bad in a way that makes me think less of people who think it's good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of God may be a good work of art but if I were to prioritize all such good works to be seen in the world, this would not be near the top. I already live in a world with enough violence and misery around me, so when I go to the theater I prefer to see objects of beauty. The message that senseless violence begets only more senseless violence is a good, if trite, one. But all I could think throughout the film was, "Who will shoot whom next?" All the hoods are older teens, except for a very minor role played by the runts. Seeing mere boys get shot was another turnoff. There was a certain coherence to the movie and if it serves to raise consciousness about the awful plight of Rio de Janeiro's street children, a la Pixote, there may be value to it. I prefer to raise my consciousness in more subtle ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City of God" is an old story. So old, in fact, it begins in the 60's as it tells of gangsters in a Rio de Janeiro slum who do what gangsters do and have done everywhere for all the same reasons. Poverty breeds ignorance which breeds hopelessness which breeds desperation which breeds crime...etc. This film shows us nothing new, save the location and its paper thin characters, as it takes the audience into a slew of favela-dwelling punks with guns (so many it's hard to keep track of who's who and who killed who for what reason) as it attempts to impart a sense of warring in the Rio ghetto. You'll see such a convoluted mess of gang bangers there's no time for the film to provide character depth or a sense of the gangster ethos or the mechanics of the drug trade or a reason to care who lives or dies, etc. Just a whole lot of killing with numbing excess and only a hint of a human story. For reasons I am unable to deduce, "City of God" received raves from all corners and countless awards and noms. Go freakin' figure! Personally, I found the documentary piggy-backed into the DVD more interesting than the film and the one scene from the film I remember most (it was shown twice) was that of a chicken which was run over by a truck but escaped unscathed. If you like your street punk killing flicks with subtitles, go for it. (C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like cinematic dynamite, City of God lights a fuse under its squalid Brazilian ghetto, and we're a captive audience to its violent explosion. The titular fa vela is home to a seething army of impoverished children who grow, over the film's ambitious 20-year time frame, into cutthroat killers, drug lords, and feral survivors. In the vortex of this maelstrom is L'IL Z (Leandro Firmino DA Hora--like most of the cast, a nonprofessional actor), self-appointed king of the dealers, determined to eliminate all competition at the expense of his corrupted soul. With enough visual vitality and provocative substance to spark heated debate (and box-office gold) in Brazil, co directors Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund tackle their subject head on, creating a portrait of youthful anarchy so appalling--and so authentically immediate--that City of God prompted reforms in socioeconomic policy. It's a bracing feat of stylistic audacity, borrowing from a dozen other films to form its own unique identity. You'll flinch, but you can't look away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average. Too violent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I read all the praise that this movie was getting, being for example entitled as one of the best movies ever made, I had pretty high expectations. Before watching the DVD I did not read anything about the plot. I really didn't know what kind of movie to expect and barely understood what the genre would be. After watching I don't understand why so many people love this film. Totally overrated.After watching the first 20 minutes I was thinking "Man this is really boring! I wonder if the movie will ever start going?!". Throughout the whole movie I was always like "What the hell is supposed to be so great about this movie? What am I missing?" After the first 20 minutes are over, the film begins to get more interesting. However it just doesn't really do anything for me. There are no characters that I could somehow feel any sympathy for. The storyline is somewhat interesting (though not intelligent) and the effects and visuals may be nice, but the violence ruins everything for me. This Li'l Ze guy has to be one of the most horrid villains of any movie. And to me it is quite dissatisfying to see that the only person that may have the ability to stop him (Ned) gets his girlfriend raped in front of his eyes by this very villain, and soon thereafter gets half of his family shot. And in the end he doesn't even kill the bad guy.I know that this stuff may very well happen in the real world (in fact the story is supposed to be based on real events). I just don't want to see it. I don't like it. I know that there is a sewerage system under our towns, where it smells terrible and all kinds of nasty stuff happens. But I don't want to see a movie about it. I don't want to be taken there. The same thing here. I don't want to see a psychopathic killer and inhuman violence.However if you happen to like horror movies, helplessness, senseless violence and barbarity you may like this one. If you are looking for substance there is not much left after subtracting the violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about violent crime that makes everyone so damn proud of it? From the brainless antics of Al Capone to the drugged stupidity of Scarface (and many others since ? I didn't finish Reservoir Dogs cos it ended up in pieces in my garbage can) there seem to be no lengths to which directors won't go to display the trashier side of life and yet make it seem like they're showing cuddly everyday folks.And now Brazil has a chance to flaunt its criminals, and no effort has been spared to demonstrate that when it comes to pointless shootin' and killin' the Brazilians (so it would seem) are way up there in front of the pack. They've even all got cute names, just in case you may decide to warm to them. Actually, I didn't (mostly). The more enjoyable scene of this movie for me was where they were all stretched out across the street dead as old mutton and more full of bullet holes than an rusty tin can in the back yard. I was disappointed that the director didn't follow this up with a shot of a sizeable nuclear weapon consuming the "City of God" in the sort of fireball which you normally associate with hell.Then perhaps something natural like trees and stuff could take over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disturbing scenes for any decent human beings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to share my opinion with those interested in watching this violent film. If MIRAMAX films aims to draw attention to the crime and drug problems of the poor neighborhoods of Brazil, they should not use these kind of shocking portrayals of violence against children, total disregard of taste, and association of sex with violence, drugs, and criminal activity. If one was really interested in solving Brazil's desperately poor and criminal gangs, government-sponsored media should be used, (the raising of) television commercial adverts, political action, and the use of Red Cross Society and Amnesty International. The awful aspects about this movie are that young children are shown being frightened and subsequently shot by gang-members, black children owning guns, and the association of sex and lust with crime. After that, the (general) public is appalled at the number of incidents of child violence and child pornography being distributed on the world wide web. Films like these should be reviewed by a special committee for their quality and their degree of taste of delivering the message they sought to deliver. In my personal opinion, there should be no room for such sort of films that contain raw and barbaric portrayals of violence, bullying, and humiliation in civilized society, in order to prevent the very idea of turning to violence among the desperate poorest of the poor.</fullReview>

This director must have had too much of a love for Casion and Goodfellas. This film feels like Goodfellas mixed with Gangs of New York with a lot more violence, less blood, and younger slum-dwelling characters. It's even based off a true story and narrated like Goodfellas! The best parts of this film are parts when it veers out of Scorsese territory and into its own highly brutal and shocking territory. It only reaches this is maybe in one or two scenes but these scenes are powerful enough to make the movie worth seeing at least once.

The whole poverty stricken population in the country is not in a state of constant murder and rape, or they would all be dead eventually.I'm not entirely sure what the director's purpose was but it feels almost like a hidden political message. To my best ability I'd say that message is that poverty makes people kill each other, which is complete Bull SHlT!!!Total waste of your waking life.
