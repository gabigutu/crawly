		<shortDescription>Why is this movie getting such bad reviews?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a lot of reviews saying this was a bad movie. I disagree! I don't know if any of these people have read any of the books, let alone Hannibal Rising, but I loved the movie. Given, it seemed like Thomas Harris wrote the book strictly for the movie, but I felt this movie was made to have people understand how Lecter, "the monster" was created.Yes, Lecter is irrational and that's the point. Hannibal Lecter is suppose to be distant because he's a psychopath. He's suppose to be apathetic. Some people mistook that for bad acting.Comparing the movie to the book...they were about 85% compatible. Minor changes were made, but nothing too critical.I think some people are quick to make this movie out to be horrible because they really are milking the Hannibal Lecter story, but I felt it to be a decent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could it be better than Red Dragon and Hannibal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to a free screening of this movie tonight, Thursday December 12, 2006 at the mall cause they gave out free passes at my work across the street.I wont give really much away...but the movie itself was great. Great locations, great acting--especially by Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal. I swear his acting was so good that it was scary and near perfect as the demented Hannibal Lechter.The story about how he came to be was great also starting with his youth during WW2 in 1944. And 8 years later, the main plot line unfolds showing him becoming a medical school student in France where he begins to learn of the many body parts that make a human work.All in All this movie is a delectable revenge type movie with scary, dark bad guys and many gruesome deaths.*two thumbs up*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tasty Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isn't it interesting that most critics of this film whine that it didn't measure up to "The Silence of the Lambs"? If you merely want a reworking of Lambs, go rent Lambs and watch it again. Frankly, anyone who goes to see "Hannibal Rising" hoping to have the same response and emotions engendered by "Lambs" is a boob of the first magnitude.The fact is, "Red Dragon" and "Lambs" are psychological thrillers, "Hannibal" is an action flick and "Hannibal Rising" is a biopic/action flick. Of the four Lecter films, "Hannibal Rising" is second only to "Lambs" in overall quality. ("Red Dragon" was spoiled by Ed Norton's astoundingly robotic performance; "Hannibal" was a visual masterpiece but was ultimately tainted by the the screenwriters' obvious desperation to concoct an ending that bore no resemblance to the novel's very cool conclusion.) "Hannibal Rising" has it all. 1) Superb direction (Lecter's riverside encounter with Paul Momund is stunning in its ballet-like choreography); 2) a perfectly paced screenplay; 3) beautiful art direction and design; and 4) powerful performances.Li Gong's Lady Murasaki is actually as I pictured her in the novel: beautiful, mysterious and not-to-be-trifled with. But it's Gaspard Ulliel who steals the show. It amazes me that he successfully played someone who's simultaneously a sweet, vulnerable youth victimized by the Nazis and the Soviets and a calculating, coldblooded murderer. Ulliel's finest moment is when Lecter unleashes his unhinged wrath in the climatic scene aboard the river barge; it was thoroughly disturbing.Don't listen to the critics. Go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to a lot of other comments on this board I thought this was a great film. And having just finished the book beforehand it met all my expectations no problem. Ulliel looked very menacing as the anti-hero Lecter but charming at times as well, just as Hannibal should be and he is backed up by a strong supporting cast (Rhys Ifans in particular).There are nice references to The Silence of the Lambs the Samurai's face mask that Hannibal tries on resembling the mask worn in SOTL and the music that he listens to in his room at the medical school which is the same as he has playing in his cell in Baltimore.I was hooked from start to finish and would recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hannibal Rising' faces many of the problems that will beset any prequel. When the audience already knows how the larger story arc is going to resolve itself, how do you make the new prequel engaging? With a charismatic enigma like Hannibal, there is also great risk of the new young version seeming like a hollow parody of the older more familiar version played by Anthony Hopkins. I believe that 'Hannibal Rising' is largely successful. It didn't strike me as a stand out film but I was satisfied with it overall and do think that it has more value than just to enthusiasts of the Thomas Harris books. I'd rate it a comfortable second place out of the five films with Hannibal as a character (I count 'Manhunter').'Hannibal Rising' does seem a bit choppy and for a plot that explores what drives a character into psychosis and lust for revenge, it didn't really spend much time trying to flesh out the Hannibal character. You get the brush strokes and the gist of things but a lot of the minutiae seems glossed over. I guess my point is that the audience curiosity for this film would be, I suspect, about what things turn Hannibal INTO Hannibal -- the internal process-- and not just solely about watching him hunt down and destroy those who have crossed him. A minor point perhaps but it struck me as odd in watching this that a series of films devoted to one of cinema's richest characters wouldn't really get in depth character exploration in the prequel for the series.This is not intended to criticize what I thought was a well directed and tensely executed film. It is a violent film -- no kidding, right? -- but a lot of the violence is implied, in the background or off-camera. I really commend this decision as my imagination is much more vivid when things are suggested and not shown. 'Hannibal' worked not through terrorizing the audience but more through horrifying. I was balanced on the edge of trepidation and distaste as Hannibal entered each show down with characters he wanted to extract vengeance from. I love sitting through a tense thriller that offers no relief and this was almost the case here. My fellow Canadians and I were in tears of laughter when it was announced that a character had fled 'to a village outside of Saskatoon.' Surely unintended humour, and almost certainly audience specific.What interested me most was the discussion I had with friends after we finished watching the film. I asked them when they felt sympathy for Hannibal was lost in the film -- and make no mistake, the events in the opening act are very much designed to put you behind Hannibal. Some said after the first killing. Some said the moment he transforms from child to youth. I think it comes later. Hannibal is rooted for almost out of default initially. His antagonists are just that much more evil and repellent that you throw your sympathy to him. This changes when a policeman asks Hannibal to help him track down these same antagonists. Hannibal has the choice of doing or not doing this. His response and subsequent actions for the remainder of the film decided my sympathies for me. Lesser acts of evil, might be used to purify and cleanse greater acts of evil, but are still evil in themselves when the motivation and the cost are the substitution of salvation and justice for corruption and revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offensively bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this site, and haven't yet commented on any movies, but I feel Hannibal Rising in all its bloody, spectacular awfulness, merits a pass. Don't bother with this one -- that's two hours of my life and $6 I'll never get back.From the cookie-cutter dialogue to the put-on accents to the cliché-ridden plot devices (a rich Asian aunt who just happens to live in a giant château in France -- c'mon) to murder after pointless murder after pointless murder, with no element of suspense or plot tension, Hannibal Rising comes off like Final Destination 3 but with a thinly realized pseudo-sophisticate veneer that strives, unsuccessfully, to "connect" it to the stark, intellectual landscapes of Silence of the Lambs. I left the theater with friends debating over who, exactly, had been Lecter's first victim, because none of us could remember (turns out it was the fat French butcher, killed for making one off-color comment at the market to Lecter's aunt, who looks to be exactly his age) who was killed when, or how, in the pointless bloodbath that comprises the latter 2/3 of the film. Yes, some bad men killed and ate Hannibal's sister, and yes they are still bad men, involved, apparently, in the slave trade and other evil doings, but the characters are so flimsy, so two-dimensional, that we grieve not when they meet their maker in the form of a vengeful Hannibal.Production is sloppy, sets are claustrophobic, there is no back story to how or why the Lecters reign from a mammoth castle in Lithuania (Are they longtime royalty? What's going on here?), and Hannibal's transformation into a monster is barely believable. Plenty of children survived similar horrors during WWII (read The Painted Bird, if you're interested in a deeper look at eastern European WWII orphans) and didn't go on to become serial killers. So, why Hannibal? This film certainly doesn't have the answer. It, in fact, barely raises the question.I left Hannibal Rising feeling like I had been both raped and lobotomized. Maybe that was the filmmaker's intention, but I'm wishing I'd spent that same $6 for a second viewing of Pan's Labyrinth, one theater over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No need for this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Presented as a prequel of the well known "Manhunter" and "The silence of the lambs", this movie pays apparently no care for verisimilitude. Lecter - we learn - is a victim of brutal violence suffered when he was 8 years old. He survives bombing, war criminals, a Soviet orphanage, a travel from USSR to France in the 50es (with also a jump through the Berlin Wall), where he finds a beautiful Japanese (!) aunt (Gong Li). He already speaks a perfect French and is able to study medicine without apparently having had any education (in the orphanage scenes he cannot even speak due to the war trauma). Since he is Lithuanian, he probably could speak German (very common in those countries before WW2). Weird enough, the Japanese aunt is a survivor of the Hiroshima nuclear bombing and she is a sort of Super Geisha Samurai who can fight under the ancient rules of Kendo (something a woman of the 40es or 50es could not even dream to do in Japan). Lecter himself shows to be able to cut a man's head off in one single hit of sword, in a scene so silly that I could not keep from laughing. In the end, this movie is simply an example of commercial exploitation of a once good idea, just like "Red Dragon" (a completely useless remake of the masterpiece "Manhunter" by Michael Mann) and "Hannibal". Stick to the original ones and let this movies out of your "to see" list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising tells the story of Hannibal Lecter from age 8 to his early 20s. After his parents are killed during World War II, only he and his sister are left alive in their family lodge. A group of Nazi soldiers stumble upon the lodge and take shelter, but as they begin to starve they decide to use Hannibal's sister for food. Hannibal ends up escaping and ends up in an orphanage where he has gone mute due to his traumatic experience. He escapes the orphanage and goes to live with his late uncle's widow. When he finds the names of all those responsible for his sister's death, he goes on a murderous revenge spree, and he begins to cannibalize his victims. Not even he can see the monster that he is becoming. The fifth entry into the Hannibal Lecter series is entertaining, but could have been better.Lets start off with what's good about this movie. As a revenge story, it's very good and very entertaining. It's about a young boy that watched the person he loved most brutally murdered and used for food. As soon as he's old enough, he makes a promise to his sister to do something about it, and he does. This movie would have been even better if it was a standalone film, but instead it's an origin story of the greatest movie villain ever. As a Hannibal Lecter movie, there are a few problems. They show some of the more important aspects of Hannibal Lecter beginning to shine through, such as his interest in medicine, and his loathing for rudeness. It even shows him beginning to taunt people who are interviewing him ("Now tell me inspector, did you choose war crimes?"). Hannibal Lecter shows more emotion in this movie than all the others combined, but that makes sense since he's not a monster quite yet. The only thing I really had a problem with was that they way the script was written, it seems that Hannibal would get his revenge and then stop. The movie doesn't really explain why Lecter would turn into a serial killer.The acting is pretty good. Not one big name American actor appears in this film, which is kind of cool because we're not distracted by any big names, which leaves more focus on the characters. Gaspard Ulliel does a really good job as Lecter. Taking over for Anthony Hopkins isn't the easiest thing to do. He does the Lecter tone of voice pretty good. I didn't really feel like Dominic West was as involved with the plot as he could have been.Overall, this is an entertaining movie, and it's nice for Hannibal fans to see him in a movie again, but they missed some opportunities to make connections to the other movies.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, no Anthony Hopkins so I didn't expect greatness, but was pleasantly surprised. Gaspard Ulliel did a very good job and has a wonderful look about him. I was caught up in the story about how Hannibal got started. To give an idea of my opinion so you know where I'm coming from, I think Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest actors of our time and he was brilliant as Hannibal. That being said, I was reluctant to see this. However I can now say I'm hoping for more. The movie was done very professionally. They are saying this is the best since Silence of the Lambs. I now believe them although I did like Hannibal better than most. I don't want to give too much away, just believe me it's worth the time to see it. Just don't expect Anthony Hopkins. Keep in mind this is Hannibal at a much younger age. Go into it with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly not a masterpiece, but still a worthy prequel to the Lecter saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2002, Anthony Hopkins announced he wouldn't play Hannibal Lecter again. However, producer Dino De Laurentiis, refusing to put his lucrative franchise (ironically, the Oscar-winning Silence of the Lambs was the only Lecter film he had nothing to do with) to rest, decided to bring the character back, with or without Hopkins. And since novelist Thomas Harris had already mentioned a small but significant part of the famous cannibal's past in one of the books, the solution was pretty simple.Following the example of Batman Begins and Casino Royale, Hannibal Rising revolves around the protagonist's early years, trying to convincingly explain why such a brilliant man became a cannibal. Apparently, the answer is to be found in a tragedy that marked young Hannibal for the rest of his life.It's 1944, and the Lecter mansion in Lituania is under attack from the Nazis. The family runs off to a cabin in the woods, only to be killed, leaving only Hannibal and his little sister Mischa alive. Just to make things worse, the two are taken hostage by a bunch of local SS employees, lead by the psychotic Grutas (Rhys Ifans). Within a few days Mischa is killed, and her death has such a devastating effect on her brother he doesn't speak for eight years. He only starts connecting with the real world again once he moves to France and lives under the protective wing of his uncle's widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). As their relationship moves to more complex and dangerous levels, the tormented youngster (Gaspard Ulliel) also becomes fascinated with the study of the human body, and the various tools he learns to use in medical school will come in handy once he discovers Grutas and his men are still alive and decides it's payback time.Many bad things have been said of Hannibal Rising. Some found the idea of justifying Lecter's insanity useless, while others complained about the book being a mere commercial gimmick to promote the film. The latter theory may be true (after all, the novel preceded the movie by just six weeks), but I actually think Thomas Harris and director Peter Webber (whose previous work, Girl with a Pearl Earring, also dealt with an origin story, though obviously in a different way) have done an admirable job: the mood is kept suitably creepy for the entire duration, and while there's plenty of gore (the on-screen murders are less gratuitously bloody than in Ridley Scott's Hannibal, but more imaginative and shocking), the focus is constantly on the characters, particularly Lecter and Lady Murasaki, and their evolution. The weak link in the film is Inspector Popil (Dominic West), a police officer whose presence has the sole purpose of reminding long-time fans of Will Graham and Clarice Starling. Pity the lack of any convincing back-story robs him of their charm.Another inappropriate element is a scene where young Hannibal wears a samurai mask which is identical to the one he's forced to use in the original trilogy. The shot itself is great, no doubt, but it's absolutely clear its only reason to exist is to evoke Anthony Hopkins.Luckily, that one moment doesn't take anything away from Ulliel's sublime performance: he obviously borrows a few things (the sly food-related witticisms, the spooky stare) from Hopkins, but adds more elegance and charisma, making the character more similar to a vampire than a cannibal. Also notable is the supporting cast, the strongest contributions coming from Li (the sexual tension between her and Ulliel is palpable and conveniently unsettling) and an almost unrecognizable Ifans (most moviegoers probably remember him as Hugh Grant's moronic roommate in Notting Hill).So, in the end, Hannibal Rising is not a perfect film, but it is sufficiently interesting and scary to satisfy fans of the franchise.7,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are all voyeurs at heart. Don't gaze at that car crash. Act normal to the boy with Tourette's Syndrome. You don't want to know what the latest escaped pervert did to the girl down the road. Or do you??Monsters, real, psychological, or ones we deem accidents of nature, are a constant source of fascination. Those in the cinema are like fairground rides - safe - but scary. You can laugh, scream or hate them with impunity. One particular cannibalistic serial killer has been called the most memorable villain in film history. His name is Hannibal Lecter.Sequels and prequels are often safer box-office bets than new material. One of them (The Silence of the Lambs) ranked among the most significant movies of its day. Hannibal Rising represents the fifth of the Hannibal films, and is also the first film to be scripted by the novelist and original creator, Thomas Harris. So is it scary?Taking as its overt theme, a psychopath in the making, Hannibal Rising introduces us to Hannibal Lecter as a young lad in Lithuania. It's 1944 and nasty Russians and nastier Germans are killing each other as war nears its end in the most hostile of regions. After watching his parents killed before his eyes, Hannibal cuddles up to his young sister Mischa. But the wardogs that barge into their forest lodge are almost dying of starvation and Mischa looks kinda tasty.Just as we lean forward to watch the gratuitously gory slaying and feasting on a five year old, the camera cuts and we follow Hannibal as he struggles through snow and border crossings to reach his Japanese aunt living in Paris. At this point I am thankful that Germans, Lithuanians, Russians, French and Japanese all speak English in the movies - how else would they understand each other? Auntie Shikibu teaches him the arts of Japanese sword and stick fighting. Hannibal quickly puts the skill to use when a local butcher insults favourite auntie before nephew has got into her pants. And brings her his head. Literally.Auntie manages to get Hannibal off the charges and he goes to Paris to study medicine - specialising, it would seem, in the art of chopping up corpses. Hannibal quickly acquires all the skills a would-be psychopath needs, yet in flashbacks and nightmares he is haunted by the memory of his sister."Memory is a knife," Auntie tells him, "it can hurt you", but undeterred he doses himself with truth serum and continues to track down all the war dogs that were nasty to lil' sis'. Most of them were also war criminals, so the authorities don't stop him too soon, and we get to see nasty Hannibal almost as a good guy.Hannibal Rising is mainly of interest as a psychopathology of Silence of the Lambs. It tells us what we already guessed about how he came to be a nutter. What it doesn't do is scare us out of the two hour tedium.We might believe iconic 'Hannibal' is scary in himself, but the truth is probably that Silence of the Lambs was simply one of the most important films of its time. Hannibal Lector was merely a side-product. In 'Silence', for instance, we got a technique little used at the time, where both Foster and Hopkins alternately look directly at the camera, face square on, as they speak. We are in the shoes of the person being addressed. One of those people is going to be hunted. Mercilessly. Add to that, Jodie Foster's star persona (shaped by the roles she's played) is one of a rugged woman who's nobody's pushover. We sense that if Foster is scared, anybody would be. Silence of the Lambs was neo-noir psychological thriller with victimisation that invokes morbid fantasy and horror. Oscar-winning performances, skillful cinematography and taut direction all combined to scare us out of our wits. Hannibal Rising sadly has no such assets. The script is pedestrian, the ending a foregone conclusion, much of the acting overdone, and it delivers neither horror nor thrills. It is a long film that groans under its own lack of momentum.To its credit, there is some fine photography, and Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal does a brave job of making the character convincing. Our story does include a small twist about 'sister stew' at the end, but it lacks the force to deliver a suitable climax. While adding to the growing canon of Hannibal films, I personally preferred all the preceding movies, and even the Trey Parker song and dance tribute, 'Cannibal! The Musical'. As a revenge thriller, Hannibal Rising is long-winded; as a psychological study it's didactic; and the camera turns away too often to satisfy a true gore-fest fan. While it will have its adherents, Hannibal Rising is hardly worth rising from your armchair to go and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In World War II, in Lithuania, the Lecter family leaves their castle escaping from the Nazis and lodges in their remote cabin in the woods. After a battle between a Russian tank and a German airplane in the property, the whole family dies except the boy Hannibal (Aaran Thomas) and his baby daughter Micha (Helena-Lia Tachovská). Later the house is invaded by five marauders and under siege of the Russians in a cold winter without any food, they eat Micha. The traumatized Hannibal is found by the Russian army and raised in an orphanage until his adolescence. Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) succeeds in escaping from the Iron Curtain and travels to Paris, where he meets his aunt Murasaki (Gong Li) that teaches him martial arts while living with her. He joins the medical school and when he finds a lead of the killers of his sister, he decides to make them pay skin for skin."Hannibal Rising" is a stylish movie that explains the dark origin of Hannibal Lecter. The story shows the moment when the poor boy loses his humanization and becomes a monster. The classy production is supported by magnificent art decoration, scenarios and extremely beautiful landscapes. Gaspard Ulliel gives a great performance in the role of the deranged and revengeful Hannibal and the beauty of Gong Li is impressive. I only do not understand why this great movie is underrated in IMDb. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Hannibal, A Origem do Mal" ("Hannibal, The Origin of Evil")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Visuals, But A Disappointing Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of all the Hannibal Lector films, I was expecting another film I'd enjoy and thinking this would be a terrific character study of man who is one of the most famous fictional killers of all time. What I got instead was more of a simple revenge story than the character study. Oh, yeah, we do learn some background of the famous "Dr. Lector," but not enough of what really made him the weird combination of intellectual and cannibal. Although portraying and having someone in the film label the young adult as "monster," the filmmakers (actually, author Thomas Harris) really made him more of a sympathetic character instead. They took the easiest road, out, too, making an easy target the villains: the Nazis. How often has Hollywood done that, even today 60 years after the conclusion of WWII. What we get is a revenge story of how Lector went from a child captive of the Nazis for a short time, to a medical student in Paris and how he tracked down the Nazis who killed the rest of his family. Of particular incentive to him was the avenging of his sister's death. There is a neat little twist at the ending regarding that but I go into that for spoiler reasons. The best part of the film was the absolutely gorgeous cinematography. This is beautifully filmed, first frame to last. The story is much better in the second half than the first, which has a few parts in which it lags. I'm not quite sure about the credibility of having an Asian aunt raise him, but I also enjoy seeing actress Gong Li. Her relationship with young Hannibal is a strange one. Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal was okay but certainly not as riveting in the role as the mature Anthony Hopkins was in his three performances. Why a young French actor, who has all the accents that Hopkins doesn't have, would play the role, I don't know. Overall, I'm glad I saw it but, unlike the three other Hopkins' "Lector films," this is one I won't add to my movie collection. However, at least I learned what the most tasty part of the human anatomy is, not that I would ever put that information to use!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more we know about the monster, the less scary he becomes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the sole Oscar-grabbing horror epic "The Silence of the Lambs" Hannibal Lector was presented to us intelligently and sparsely in fleeting glimpses ? covered in masks, behind bars and in the shadow. In "Hannibal Rising", he inhabits every single scene. This is his warped, twisted bildungsroman, his revenge story, and his background history. In short, the only things "Hannibal" shares with "Lambs" is its name.It is one cash-cow of a name, too. Every frame in the film is milked its worth of Hannibal's evil nature, without much subtlety. Sure, there have clearly been half-hearted attempts to establish the kind of high-brow horror that Lambs achieved, but the film reeks of b-quality and unimaginative grotesqueness. There are only faint, dimmed traces of horror or genuine suspense, often washed away by pedestrian set-ups that make fans of the genre nod with tired recognition. For example, the dialogue feels unforgivably staged. In fact, there is no real exchange between the characters, only plot-propelling lines or rehearsed wisdom that slip through in between the torture games. But what is probably worse is that "Hannibal" never tips over nearly far enough or often enough into enjoyably hammy territory. It has absolutely no self-distance, the kind of spark in the eye of Anthony Hopkins, or any form of a sense of humour.Onto casting, Gaspard Ulliel is clearly not a bad performer, nor is anyone's acting truly the root of the film's problems. However, Ulliel's gaze isn't the piercing, wise, twisted trademark look of Hopkins as Lector, but rather the sleazy eye of a teenage boy ogling a girl on the street. To add insult to injury, he is confident in a way that is much too cocky for Lector, who should rely on a sort of inherent calm and confidence that is only displayed subtly through his eyes. I will concede that a couple of scenes aptly showcases his acting skills though, such as the mental breakdown scene toward the end of the film. Rhys Ifans, a charming Welshman usually relegated to good-guy characters, gets his freak on in unnecessarily sinister ways. He has "the eyes of an arctic wolf" and throughout the film he shouts, murders, loots, rapes and generally acts badass to instill the 'baddie' image in his character. Which is clearly preaching to the choir given his opening crime ? what prompts Lector's revenge. Nevertheless, nothing Ifans does is all bad, and again, acting is never the problem.The fundamental problem is my titular assessment. It can stand repeating: the more we know about the monster, the less scary he becomes. I would not go as far as to say the story victimizes Hannibal, but here he inhabits the protagonist slot and elicits sympathy of sorts accordingly. Do we root for him? Not exactly. Do we wish he'd get caught? Not really. There are plenty of gray zones in the film -- perhaps intentional, perhaps not -- that have the cumulative effect of not really achieving anything tangible. Toward the end you almost feel a bit 'meh' about the whole story, and the not-hero-but-not-villain slot inhabited by Hannibal causes a stance of indifference toward his action, however outlandish they are.5.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film ... for teenagers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen this film ... Well, good things first. This film is well made, with attention to details, no stupid goofs, actors performance didn't make me uneasy for the most part. I'm from Lithuania myself, and Lithuania was displayed quite truthfully - thanks, Hollywood.Now bad things ... I think that they bother me because I've seen the original Hannibal movie, and was expecting something else. But anyway:1) First, I didn't like the idea of making a pervert serial killer a kind of positive hero, or martyr. Hey, Hollywood, you want youngsters to admire serial killers and try to be like them? You'll get it. The love story of Hannibal also fits here.2) Second, the idea of making Hannibal a kind of samurai sword fighter is, IMHO, absolutely out of place here. I understand that sword fighting looks cool by itself, but we are making a good old western serial killer movie here, or don't we? 3) And, finally, the performance of the main hero. The Hannibal is very evil person, but he had personality, charisma. And conversion from normal person to a maniac seems a good place to demonstrate passions, emotions, TO ACT. This Hannibal spent all the film with the same blank face - he's the real killer ... of the movie.To sum it up - a well done movie for teenagers, who want to see some cool action, some maniacs, some blood and killin' and don't pay attention to the actors performance (unless it is really bad) and the ideas of the film. And, of course, who never saw the original.However, if You expect from this movie something similar to the original, just don't waste your time. Imagine a mix of samurai movie, teenage maniac thriller and love story, all with a good budget - You'll get the idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is proof that the American film industry can't uphold great franchises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into this movie with high expectations. I could not wait to see the childhood of the infamous Dr. Lector. I loved Silence of the Lambs, and I thought that Hannibal Rising would be a great chance for me to brush up on the film industry's greatest villain.Unfortunately, Hannibal Rising is not an experience worth your time, your emotion, or your money.I am a brother of two sisters, one nine-years-old, and one five-years-old. I apologize, but I'm not someone who particularly enjoys hearing about/watching little girls getting beheaded and eaten. I'm not somebody who likes watching that. If you like it, go right ahead. There's plenty of blood to go around.However, for the rest of us, Rising is just another installment to the series, and is literally a bloodbath. The emotional-backing behind Lector's killing spree is that his sister was killed and eaten in World War II and his parents died during this time as well. The transition from innocent boy to evil killer is a poor one. You don't see every step of the way. Instead, one scene Lector is a normal person, and the other, he's killed someone as if it's nothing. After he avenges the death of his sister, he doesn't even act like he's relieved or excited. He simply does it and moves on with his day, like a chore.I understand why Anthony Hopkins had no connections with this film. I also understand why half of my theater got up and left the movie during a particular scene. I also understand that the film industry's greatest villain has been permanently tainted by this poor film.The phrase, "Ignorance is bliss," works well here. Simply pass on seeing Hannibal Rising. Use your imagination to decide why Lector became Lector. Don't ruin it by actually seeing it yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It had to happen: Hannibal Lecter has finally eaten himself. How did we get to this unappetising situation? The dinner bell was rung years ago, following the release of Michael Mann's Manhunter. Saturated to a psychedelic glaze, this resembled a nightmare you'd suffer if you'd dozed off in front of MTV, with Iron Butterfly's gloriously pompous 'Inna Gadda Da Vida' chuntering away on the stereo. Sporting a stylish visual finish and soundtrack more suited to rock promos, it all but suggested that serial murderers were relaying their own private pop videos in their heads the entire time - ones in which they could become all-powerful world-eating dragons. With harelips.Even Francis Dollarhyde (aka the 'Tooth Fairy') played by the freakish-looking Tom Noonan, resembled something dreamed up for an Aphex Twin short. (Former rock video director Tarsam Singh would draw more explicit 'mental illness as pop video' comparisons in The Cell, which actually starred a pop star, in J-Lo.) Creepy as all hell, Manhunter encapsulated the maggoty heart of a decade in which surface appearance (and Manhunter was all about appearances, real, imagined or stolen) was paramount - until American Psycho pulled off the same trick a few years later.Yet Manhunter's ace-in-the-straitjacket-sleeve was actually a peripheral character; the brilliant but insane psychiatrist Dr Hannibal Lecter (here 'Lecktor'), played by Brian Cox, all dead shark eyes and twitchy malevolence.By the time Silence Of The Lambs, rolled round, Lecter had been prodded closer toward centre stage, with Anthony Hopkins replacing Cox, kick-starting a 'who's the better Lecter' debate which has occupied film buffs for years. Hopkins' interpretation turned Lecter into the stuff of penny dreadfuls, a Freddy Krueger quipster or high-IQ Jason Vorhees. It drove author Thomas Harris and his output in a new direction - the direction of the bank - undermining his previously held literary credibility, to the point of producing pretentious novelisations of already commissioned screenplays. And Hannibal Rising (book and film) is oh so very bad.Hannibal Rising deals with the heir to the Lecter dynasty, and what happened to turn him into a monster. The answer, in short, is the same thing that invented the modern teenager - the Second World War. From the dappled, ambient opening (caption: "Lithuania 1944") in which the boy Hannibal plays with his little sister Mischa in Castle Lector, we're plunged into a world of dread - and a scenario more suited to Hammer Studio's home counties version of Transylvania.After Hannibal's parents are killed in a crossfire between Russians and Germans on the Eastern Front, a band of starving, opportunistic brigands led by eye-rolling panto villain Grutas (a miscast Ifans) invade the family cottage and boil Mischa up for stew.The traumatised Hannibal escapes, is sent to a Soviet orphanage (improbably Lecter Castle, now in Stalinist hands), suffers night terrors and makes his position on school bullies clear. "You do not observe the human pecking order," the orphanage head chides him. "You're always hurting the bullies!" Thus is set the deceitful template for Lecter's MOR: like the Krays, here's a psycho who only hurts the bad guys. Keep your nose clean, and you've nothing to fear from old Hannibal. In other words, total nonsense, Mr Harris.Somehow the teenage Hannibal (Gaspard, in baby Dracula mode - and looking more like a young Cox than Hopkins) ends up in post-war France and is adopted by his beautiful and sophisticated aunt, the Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Li), who is at one point described in Harris's accompanying novel as stepping out of the bath "gloriously barefoot"; a phrase that should tell you all about his current literary style. The Lady, fond of motorbikes and motorcycle leathers, who wafts around to a twee oriental soundtrack, is also nursing a private grief: her husband, Hannibal's uncle, has died and she lost her family in Hiroshima. Nevertheless, she's managed to acquire a full set of Samurai armour and a sword collection, with which she teaches Hannibal how to fight.A gifted student, Hannibal enrols in medical college, while tracking down the scum (now in varying positions of office) who ate his sister: beheading them, drowning them and turning them into shish kebabs. Meanwhile, detective Pascal Popil (West) tries to bring him to book, but worries that he doesn't exactly know what Lecter is, as the term 'serial killer' won't be invented for another 20 years. This is a terrible, laughable film, sporting a rushed, flailing direction from Webber, and brought about by Harris's position as prisoner of his own success. Not to mention the greed of his partner in ker-ching, producer Dino De Laurentiis, calling the shots like some wizened alchemist from one of his own Sword 'n' Sorcery productions.One wonders why they bothered, aside from fiscal considerations. Perhaps the vogue for year zero prequels (see: Batman Begins, Casino Royale, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning) convinced them they'd be mileage in digging up old bones. But boogeymen are infinitely scarier when you don't know their back stories, sweeping in like an ill wind from God knows where.Artlessly cannibalising genres, from Grimm-style fairy tales to slasher movies and action epics (Batman Begins, Kill Bill), Hannibal Rising, which makes Ridley Scott's Hannibal look an understated masterpiece in comparison, also pigs out on its own mythos, featuring themes and images from its back catalogue; wild pigs, objects placed in mouths, severed hands, and 'that' mask - actually a samurai face guard Hannibal tries on in an intimation of the future.Its most misjudged moment occurs when Hannibal confronts Grutas and carves a massive 'M' in his stomach while cathartically screaming "'M' FOR MISCHAAAAA!!" It just puts one in mind of the Count from 'Sesame Street'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't going to comment on this movie, since I didn't figure there's much to say. A horribly bad movie in every sense of the way. But when I saw how many favorable reviews this movie has gotten by people, I was deeply disturbed. Is it only because the directing by Peter Webber (Girl with a Pearl Earring) makes this look like a typical drama? Is it that easy to fool people? Make something look less cheap than a Troma movie, and then having it pose as a "serious movie". Not that I don't like Troma films, they are definitely not pretentious. They are what they are. But this tripe?I'm just going to spontaneously knock off some complaints, I could probably find thousands, because as I said, I can't find anything in this movie worth writing a good sentence over.And PS, I'm not your average Internet whiner. It's very seldom I give as low a rating as 2/10, in fact I think I could pretty much count the times I've done so. A movie have to be as bad as this:*If we aren't in an English speaking country, why do people speak English with accents that are beyond cliché? A minor complaint, since you have to live with that in most movies, but since this movie is totally dominated by European places, we should at least have ONE person, AT SOME TIME, speak in another language.*Supposedely, Hannibal watches his sister get eaten and murdered. We get this repeated in FIFTEEN THOUSAND flashbacks. Now, eating a little girl is pretty strong stuff, and you never get the feeling they actually did that. The girl was a child actress, she's fine. Something should have been made to indicate the seriousness of the event.*Still, despite having witnessed this event, it wouldn't explain how Hannibal would spend 8 years going crazy over it. Having a traumatic experience will never turn you into a psychotic killer. It's OK for comic book villains, not for something that claims that it wants to be taken seriously.*Gaspard Ulliel who plays the title role is HORRIBLE. It's hard not to get the idea that he is one of those narcissist actors who have no talent but love their own faces. He repeats this one gaze and this one open-mouth-smile and he winks his head in one way until you go crazy, and he occasionally tries this ridiculous quasi-Anthony Hopkins-imitation that makes me shudder out of near disgust.*Who was Hannibal's mother and father? What was the situation in the war? What was the backstory? Does he mourn them at all? Why does he never mention his parents in the rest of the movie? Could it be because it would be grittier with the "bad guys" eating his sister and a lot easier to focus on that suitingly gross thing, making it the obvious excuse for Hannibal being a psycho?*How did he cross the Berlin Wall when he fled from Russia to France?*How come he was educated?*Why does he have a love interest? What does he feel for her? Is he just a normal guy who likes to eat people? Apparantely, that's nothing left of him, a "monster", but Hannibal comes off as quite a passionate guy! He obviously loves this girl, so how does that fit in with the fact that he gets NO READING from the lie detector. The film obviously tries to tell us two things at the same time.*The Japanese girl claims to have survived Hiroshima. Eerrr..... please explain.*Furthermore, she is also well into these ninja kendo killer stuff. Which is not possible Why is there a line about the absent police in Germany during WWII? Gestapo? SS? Ring any bells? Did I hear it wrong?*How does he "begin" to remember, all of a sudden, the names of the killers?*Hannibal in this movie seeks revenge for his sister. When, how and why does he start to eat people?*Why is there a "villain" in a movie with Hannibal Lecter in the title role? Why is he a "hero" that you are supposed to find likable? Why is he a psycho for your gory amusement's sake? Why can the "villains" bargain for the Japanese girl's life? Why does he care and when does he stop caring about other people? Why doesn't the movie make up it's mind?*Why is the "villain" your average Bond villain played by Rhys Ifans dressed up like Liam Gallagher? And why does it turn into a semi-action thriller towards the end? Where is the suspense?*This "villain", it seems, got off the Nuremberg trial by a "witness pouring acid down her throat".... why was he on those trials? And good job, by the way, he did better than Hess and Göring!Oh, I'll stop there. Overall, the screenplay must have been written by Edward D. Wood Jr, it's SO BAD it's beyond words. Every sudden change of direction in the plot, and basically every single line of dialog makes me think of Ed Wood's old grainy 50's movies. This could have been one of his "masterpieces", let's have an example: One of the last scenes, the bad guy on the floor, Hannibal carving away, the Japanese girl looking sooo terrified. Then we have the following line - Stop. Forgive them. - NEVEEEERRR (lol) Off he goes carving again. Then a guy with a gun shows up and the oh so pacifist woman stabs the crap out of him! Where does that make sense???? HE should forgive these guys but SHE can kill off any random guy she likes?Just an example. As I said, true Ed Wood stuff, this. Some exec. sloppily ordered a drama to cash in on the Hannibal name. They should pay with their livers on a plate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing but nearly worthless piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HUGE SPOILERS! First of all: I haven't seen any of the previous Hannibal movies, so I'm basing my review sheerly on this movie.The film starts off as something which seems somewhat a conventional revenge story, but you kinda know that there's more, because the title character is Hannibal, the cannibal, so I said to myself: "How will they do it?" The movie tries to accomplish what's nearly impossible for filmmakers, who aren't geniuses: it tries to force the audience to root for a man, who eats his victims' cheeks. Well, it's not impossible to accomplish. Kubrick did it once, when he made A Clockwork Orange, in which you can somewhat sympathize with Alex, who are raping and murdering left right and center. You sympathize with him, you care for him, but not in the conventional way. It's something else. It's a special relationship you have with the character. It's pure brilliance, what Kubrick did there.In Hannibal Rising, the title character's portray is... wrong. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's obviously wrong. And after a good hour into the movie, this film turns into a mess, full of glaring plot holes, too convenient, unrealistic situations (every single bad guy gives Hannibal the next piece of the puzzle - gets a little boring for the 4th time...) and unsympathetic characters (even the Japanese girl turns into an alien around the middle of the movie).So you're wondering what's this totally uninvolving thing you're watching right now, and then you find out there's one more bad guy, currently living in Canada. The man, who seemed to be the main bad guy told this to our "hero" when he tortured him. Well, his methods get pretty old, when you see this particular thing at the fifth time...Then the ship blows up, they think he's dead, yadda-yadda-yadda. But no, he's not dead (what a surprise!), he's on his way to Canada, where he meets the last bad guy and tells him a hilariously bad one-liner (he only had one good moment in the whole movie, so that's not saying much...), and the movie is closing with a pointless final shot of a car from behind. What's the deal with this? What's the greatness in this? Am I the only one who fails to see it? All in all, if you want to watch a disturbing revenge movie, try Kill Bill. If you want to watch a disturbing and disgusting revenge movie with unlikeable characters and almost zero substance and entertainment factor, then Hannibal Rising is your movie! 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that has always puzzled me about Silence of the Lambs is why Hannibal Lecter crucified the cop when he broke out of his cage. It seems that it was out of character for him to do that, as the cop was polite and decent to him. I believe it was just a scrap thrown to the audience for effect.Hannibal Rising wasn't a terrible film. Unfortunately for it, its three predecessors "Silence", "Hannibal", and "Red Dragon" were difficult shoes to fill (even if this was a prequel.) I do not consider "Manhunter" in this particular mix for consistency reasons. What is discouraging is when one considers the resources available to the makers of this film. I guess it comes down to the old saying, "If you're going to do something, do it right." There are three distinct problems with the film. The first is the beginning 15 minutes during which time the embryo of the beast Lecter is destined to become is conceived. The film fails to effectively project the trauma of Lecter, as a child, witnessing his parents murdered and his younger sister cannibalized, then abused mentally and physically in an orphanage that once was his father's castle. Instead of engaging the viewer with the ghastly horror and ordeal forced upon the child Lecter, the heart of the story is rushed and "butchered" to an almost incoherent pulp. Thus, the viewer has no sense of understanding or connection with Lecter, which is ridiculous, because that is what the story is about. This pitfall, in itself, restrained the film from reaching its potential. For in the past films, Lecter was one of those villains that you couldn't help but like due to Hopkins' excellent portrayal of the charismatic madman. Part of this was also due to the mystery of his past and what circumstances transformed him into evil.This leads into the second problem. In conjunction with the lack of proper plot development, the actor cast as Lecter is impossibly two-dimension. There are moments where he almost ascends to the suave and sinister personae of the Lecter we have come to expect, but he never quite makes the grade. Instead, Gaspard Ulliel flashes a mischievous grin that worked the first couple of times, but grows old quickly. In the midst of the film there is some sort of attempt at romance between Lecter and his dead uncle's wife, but it comes across muddled with an incestuous tone.Thirdly, this is a revenge story with Lecter as the avenger. It seems only logical that the abominable acts and gruesome evil committed against his younger sister should have been thrust upon us so that we might sympathize with the horrors that plague his dreams and thrust him towards revenge. Yet, there is no assault on our senses to take us down into that abyss where Lecter resides. Thus, when Lecter enacts his revenge, we are left apathetic. There was one very distinct plot surprise that was the director's significant opportunity to maximize on a twist and provide an in depth descent into Lecter's madness. When Lecter is reminded by one of his victims that he, too, dined on his own sister, this was a colossal plot turn, but the director missed the boat. By that time, though, there was no salvaging a vessel that was half-sunk before it even left port. Hannibal Rising was a disappointing and tragic example of commercial film making with no consideration for the art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the single worst movies I have ever forced myself to watch in my lifetime. I only watched it for a girl I liked at the time, and even as obsessed with her as I was, I couldn't force myself to like this.The entire movie is a cliché inside of a cliché. You think you've seen cliché movies before, right? Disturbia, 30 Days of Night, The Mist, The Decent. You know the list. But this movie makes all those movies look like the height of originality. It basically takes everything the History Channel has to say about the most average, lame, predictable serial killer alive and dumbs it down into a movie script.In other words, you've seen this movie before if you're over the age of 9 and have any idea about generic serial killers in children's books.Hannibal himself looks like a prettyboy. Wait! An emo prettyboy who is too much of a pansy to get over his "traumatic" (but not graphic) events of his childhood, which is yet another cliché.I'd also like to know why on earth this was rated R. There is nothing more graphic in this movie than you could see on your standard TV show. I was so insanely bored with it I was about to punch out the TV.I've seen bad movies. This isn't a bad movie: it's a training video for hell.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some decent aspects, but bad overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The guy who played the youthful Hannibal did a good job, in my opinion, but everything else in the movie seemed so disjointed and weird. The movie started out incomprehensible (Who's dropping the bombs? Why do Germans have English accents? Are the bad guys Germans or Russians? Would it really have been like this at the tail end of the war?) and just seems to get more and more confused.The plot is random and illogical at points. The whole samurai and kendo thing seemed just out of place at first, but when Hannibal put on the mask that resembled his later face mask, it was just lame.There were a lot of laughs in the theater during the serious climactic parts, so it's pretty obvious no one took this seriously. Even my friend, as a die hard fan of the Hannibal mythos, thought this sucked really hard. It's a shame, too, because the concept of Hannibal losing his family in WWII is such a great premise. The actual execution was poor, though, and didn't seem to fit at all with Hannibal's character aside from a few points where the production crew obviously tried to emulate scenes from prior movies. The ending wasn't even a real ending; there was resolution, I suppose, to the story that the film tried to tell, but they didn't really try to introduce anything beyond that.It's a bad movie that is luckily forgettable, as the enjoyment of the other films isn't hindered by any of the plot elements that appeared here. Save yourself the cash money and go watch Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising The intolerable and at times deadly Hannibal Rising is a complete bore fest. Peter Webber, director of Girl with a Pearl Earring takes a bite (no pun intended) into one of the most villainous and ferocious masterminds of contemporary cinema, Hannibal Lecter.The film is a prequel to Oscar winner, The Silence of the Lambs and the unknown Manhunter which is also a prequel to the Oscar winner. During the past 20 years, this viewer has seen two interpretations of Dr. Hannibal Lecter; one played by Brian Cox and the other, which is obviously the more popular one played by Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins. Nothing compares to the atrocity played here by Gaspard Ulliel known for his lukewarm portrayal as the vanished soldier in A Very Long Engagement.The film starts with Young Hannibal in his formative years during World War II and his transformation, if that's even the word, into a brutal serial cannibal killer. The film can never gain any traction to engulf the viewer and has no "meat" to satisfy any cinema hunger. The film flips in and out of two time periods and loses all chance of a decent picture. The screenplay by Thomas Harris who wrote the Hannibal Lecter series loses all vision of his character and turns him into a winy and pugnacious young boy. He includes the most horrible love story which has no way of enchanting any couple and includes a few chase scenes and terrible stipulation of who and what Hannibal Lecter truly is.Ulliel cannot grasp the character rather attempts a Anthony Hopkins impression and seemingly fails on many levels to bring a new Hannibal to life. Gong Li known for her stunning and Oscar snubbed portrayal of "Hatsumomo" in Memoirs of a Geisha gets brought into a world where she should of burned the script at first glance. The only entertaining aspect of the film is some pretty decent cinematography by Ben Davis and an above average performance by Dominic West who breathes some fresh air from time to time but we're still left suffocating.A rental for a Thursday night might be in order if you have nothing to do and have postponed your suicide for the weekend. Other than that, leave the film on the shelf and try playing some "Pictionary" or a nice game of "Kerplunk"; Hannibal Rising rises no where.Grade: 1/2/****</fullReview>

I absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal so I decided to watch this movie to see if it matched up to it's predecessors. Well, it didn't. The plot line was terrible, the acting was terrible, and everything else in the movie was terrible. In Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, everything was brilliant from the acting to the plot you name it. This movie did not do these movies any justice. In fact, it disappoints the whole series. Gaspard Ulliel does not give the part of Hannibal Lecter or Anthony Hopkins any justice. Anthony Hopkins is the best Hannibal bar none and Gaspard Ulliel was not the person to follow in his footsteps. I would NEVER recommend this movie to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever wanted to know what made Hannibal Lecter into the man he is today? No, me neither.And that's the trouble with Hannibal Rising: it doesn't matter how good it might be (I repeat: MIGHT be), it basically tells a story that doesn't need to be told. Lecter, the sophisticated cannibal with a penchant for Chianti, is a monster who needs no back story in order for him to be frightening. In fact, demystifying the killer makes him a little less scary, which surely can't be a good thing for a horror film.The movie begins in war torn Lithuania, where a young Hannibal is forced to care for his sister Mischa after their parents are killed. However, when a band of unwelcome hungry war criminals decide to sit out the harsh winter in Hannibal's home, Hannibal finds he no longer needs to care for his sibling?because the nasty men use her as the main ingredient in a delicious and warming stew.Eight years later, a grown-up Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) is living with his tasty Japanese aunt Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li) in France, when the opportunity arises for him to get even with the men who ate little Mischa.The first half of the film is awfully dull?a dreary biopic showing how the boy came to be all alone and emotionally damaged. The second half is slightly better, as the revenge plot gets into full swing and we actually feel like we're watching a movie, rather than The Biography Channel. But with little of the disturbing imagery, creepy atmosphere, and nasty gore that made the other Lecter films so enjoyable, and some seriously silly moments (Lecter foreshadowing the wearing of his iconic mask), and fairly large plot holes, Rising still only ends up as a mildly entertaining and instantly forgettable effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dreadful, dreadful movie. It is as bad as the first in the 'franchise' (The Silence of the Lambs) was good. There's nothing to recommend it.The general idea is to attempt to explain the Hopkins-Lecter pathologies and tropes. Well pathology, yes, but tropes..? Iconic costuming, props and symbols are reproduced in this film simply for the sake of brand continuity.The acting's rubbish. Gaspard Ulliel grins menacingly but there's nothing going on behind the eyes - worse still is his laughable aunt-cum-lover (!) Gong Li (a shame that - she is much a much loved celebrity of Chinese cinema). Even Rhys Ifans can do nothing to save the thing, half-heartedly chewing the scenery when he's not chewing someone else in the cast. The script is bland, as is - amazingly -the 'gore'.The only reason I stayed to the end was to see what happened to a gang of boys who infiltrated our auditorium to avoid the 18 certificate. Even they got bored and left after ten minutes. Good move 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A totally unnecessary and extremely poor prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a law that states that with every sequel to a film that is made, the quality of the sequel will deteriorate exponentially. This law seems to apply embarrassingly well to Hannibal Rising (HR).Where Silense of The Lambs had a tremendous build up of suspense, HR is completely flat, plodding and repetitive. Furthermore, since it is a prequel, we already know that young Hannibal will survive his childhood unharmed, sophisticated and crafted in the art of human cuisine. So in every scene where he is in danger, one can just slide back in his chair waiting for the next pointless scene.Where we had compelling characters in SoTL, HR gives us cardboard cutouts. And although we can see that Gaspard Ulliel studied the performance of Hopkins, his portrayal of Hannibal is just a embarrassing two-dimensional caricature. Amazing btw, that a tall, long-faced man can become a small, round-faced man in his later years. Talk about a complete miscast.The story of HR is as far as I'm concerned plain bull, boring, unoriginal and it ruins the myth of Lector. Wooden dialog is not known to help mediocre stories but the producers must have thought otherwise. Actually, the whole script is plot driven which means it only reflects the content of the scenes while lacking any depth. Too bad there wasn't much of a plot to begin with.Didn't we already have a prequel to the original classic and wasn't this movie in fact the first to be released? I strongly recommend skipping this movie because all you'll see is another rehash of something already rehashed to death. And even standing on it's own, it is just a very,very poor movie in frankly every aspect.Alas poor Frenchise, I knew it Horatio...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best but well worthy of the Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and seen Hannibal Rising last night and have to say that even though it was not as good as the novel i still highly recommend this movie, the acting is pretty good given they are not your high profile Hollywood stars and Gaspard Ulliel play a wonderful Hannibal Lecter.The scenery is beautiful, the war scenes are very well shot and the acting throughout the movie is well above what i expected especially from the little known french actor playing the famous cannibal.Don't go see this movie expecting a similar style of film like the others in the Saga, just go and enjoy the movie and marvel as you see what sort of monster a human being is capable of becoming.Overall i think the movie holds enough of its own to be a very worthy addition to the "Hannibal" franchise.Fans of the book will probably find the movie more absorbing than those who haven't read it. But do yourself a favour and read the book before seeing the movie as its vital to really get a good understanding of whats going on and the story behind it.Would also like to add that the music and score for the movie is first class and almost gives it a "dream like" feel to it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Lecter Has Sunk That Low</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising is the worst film I have seen in a long time. I didn't have high hopes for this film, but I didn't expect something this awful. First of all, we don't need to feel sorry for Hannibal Lecter! Doesn't that kind of ruin the whole point of his character? The next thing I was quick to notice about Hannibal Rising is the campy dialogue. No, campy doesn't quite say it... This is not the worst dialogue I've ever heard, but it's in the bottom five. These lines are just stupid! Really stupid! Even Hannibal, the next worst film in the series, had some really good dialogue. But, not in Hannibal Rising. Thomas Harris even wrote the dialogue himself, the guy who wrote all the books. What happened?Gong Li I saw twice in two days. The first time was in Raise the Red Lantern, which she was absolutely amazing in. The second was in Hannibal Rising, in which she was amazingly awful in. Gong Li's a terrific actress when she's speaking Chinese. When she's speaking English, she sounds as horribly forced and wooden as William Shatner. But then, all of the actors are wooden. There is not one decent actor in this whole movie. That includes Gaspard Ulliel, who played "Hannibal Lecter." I put the words "Hannibal Lecter" in quotes, because I refuse to believe that he was portraying my favorite villain of all time. Gaspard Ulliel doesn't even really try to fill Anthony Hopkins's shoes (not that he, or anyone else, could), or any kind of characterization at all. Every line is stilted and wooden, sounding as though he's trying too hard to sound scary. Is he even trying to emulate Hopkins at all? And Ulliel is not subtle. Even when Lecter was imprisoned, Hopkins this air of subtlety about him. It wasn't until Hopkins started getting inside your head you could fully comprehend his sinister nature. But Ulliel tries too hard (WAY too hard) to be as overly sinister as possible. Honestly, I do enjoy movies that will tell a story with minimal dialogue, but the film still needs decent actors who can show us what the characters are thinking. I'm not getting any of that here. I mean, I really don't get it; in the other Hannibal movies, you really couldn't get Hannibal Lecter to shut up. Here, he's barely saying anything (plus Ulliel is giving us no characterization outside of "Sh! I'm evil!").And why is he suddenly so openly aggressive? There's a scene when Lecter gets into a fight with a butcher in broad daylight. Why?! Hannibal was always aggressive, sure, but he was also extremely calculative. He was never as easy to provoke as he is throughout this movie. Lecter may be a serial killer, but what made him so scary was the sneaky and secretively deceptive way he would come after people. Hard to track and hard to predict. All of that is lost in this picture. He openly fights this butcher, and immediately when that happened, I said "Wait, doesn't that kind of give him a record for being aggressive now? And wouldn't that make him more likely to be a suspect?" In the other movies, no one could tell Hannibal was a killer. In this movie, I don't see how anyone could *not* tell! He's so obvious, plus he has a record. And then he *does* become a suspect! Okay, how the hell did he go all these years without getting caught?? Furthermore, at any point in this movie, there are at least three different people who *know* *he* *did* *it.* The continuity errors are ridiculous! I finally had to convince myself that I had to be watching a different series; there was no way this was part of the Hannibal Lecter series. A lot of the story didn't make a lot of sense. It was suppose to tell us why Hannibal was who he was, but it doesn't really accomplish that.And then we have those *STUPID* dream sequences!I absolutely hate it when movies plague us with dream sequences! That is the lowest place that a screenwriter can possibly go, when they have explain to us through a *dream* what the characters are feeling! It's like "Really? You had to stoop to that low? You couldn't come up with any other more creative way to tell us what the character is thinking?" And all those dream sequences are officially pointless! He actually starts telling someone the whole story (complete with flashbacks)! Why put in the dream sequences, then? Are we suppose to see that Hannibal Lecter has had a tragic life, with the memory of his sister haunting him? He's a villain! We're not suppose to pity him! Maybe feel a little sorry for what happened, sure, but not openly pity the bastard. Even if he is the greatest villain of all time. After halfway through the movie, the filmmakers actually made the decision to basically turn Hannibal Rising into a third-rate slasher film. Hannibal Lecter has sunk that low. He's actually turned to clichés now. I couldn't believe it. And the biggest indicator of this: they made him put on the mask that's synonymous with the character. NO! They made him put on the mask?! What the heck?! So, now he's basically on the same level as Michael Meyers?! NO!Basically, this is one of those prequels that actually makes me want to not watch the original(s) for awhile. It has ruined the character and the franchise that badly. Even if this was its own movie, though, it would still suck! The acting's a joke, the dialogue is among the worst I've ever heard, it's full of plot holes, void of scares, the director barely knows what he's doing... This was all in all one of the worst film experiences I've had.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excruciatingly bad picture which manages to deprave its celebrated hero to the point of raising suspicions over the filmmakers' bizarre intentions. After the movie is 10-minutes-old yawing sets in at a by-the-numbers typical revenge story, Gaspard Ulliel as Lecter acts as if he's suffering from hemorrhoids, and the movie's revelation that Hannibal Lecter was tentatively trained in kung-fu martial arts has definitely got to be an in-joke; and a bad in-joke for that matter. Badly conceived, badly made, badly directed, badly written, badly acted and badly thought of being done in the first place. "Flawed" is not the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made But Ultimately Stupid and Amoral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes this movie was a technically well made French film and had a seemingly original setting and plot. Young Lector is a Lithuanian child, son of a nobleman, caught in the retreat of 1944. He and his sister are holed up in a hunting lodge after a fight between a Russian tank and a German Stuka wipes out the rest of his family. There are also the evil SS Germans with local Lithuanian helpers, just as bad but cruder. They end up holed up there in the lodge too as the Russians drive out the retreating Nazis. So as they all starve in the cold, these disreputable knaves decide to feast on the Hannibal's baby sister, not good for a well adjusted childhood. As a result, he goes mute and ends up a prisoner for eight years in a Soviet orphanage set in his family's old house. An older trustee boy torments him but Hannibal escapes but passes up a chance to slice him up. But he snuck into his mother's old room, and after eight years of enemy occupation, the bundle of letters his mother left in the top drawer are still there untouched and unread. Considering what the Soviets did to the Lithuanians, you'd think he would have some reason to get some revenge on them as well as the Nazi collaborators.After a hair raising escape over the Soviet frontier, which includes a rather uneventful hobo journey through Communist Poland and East Germany, he makes his way to France to look up some French count uncle and his Japanese wife he had a picture of. Naturally, they take him in, but Uncle is dead and his Japanaese wife, a real looker, is still around to provide some well needed maternal, and later more, care to the young waif. Her family was wiped out in Hiroshima so there is that bond, though why Japanese get a pass when they made the Nazis look like amateurs with their depravity in China and other locales is amazing. That topic wasn't expanded but she is also a daughter of some samurai family and ends up teaching young Hannibal all sorts of killing and other martial and discipline skills to further his career. Gver me a break, female ninja in 50s France, did the writer watch "Kill Bill" or read too much anime? She also breaks his mutism down and gets him to speak again, but he still has his horrible nightmare about what happened to his little sister in that lodge when the Lithuanian Nazi collaborators ate her, natch!Hannibal draws first blood on some fat rude butcher who insulted his aunt/samurai instructor in the market. He is crude, ugly and bigoted, as well as a former Vichyite, so when Hannibal dices up and decapitates him samurai style we can only applaud this well deserved piece of revenge. See a pattern! But this brings us to our Inspector Jaubert, Clarissa Starling detective called Popiel, played by the only actor I recognized, Dominic West. Then he goes to medical school in Paris where he learns more about human anatomy and nature, especially after helping out in an execution of a Nazi collaborator. Then he dopes himself with truth serum so he can remember the names of the brutes who did his sister in. He remembers they left a bag of loot which included German dog tags in the lodge when they beat a hasty retreat in the face of the Red Army. Now this is where it gets stupider. Somehow he managed to not only wrangle a French passport but travel unimpeded through two Soviet satellites to Stalinist USSR, where they let this waif in without any scrutiny so he could roam around Lithuania looking for evidence and revenge. Mind you, all visitors to the paranoid, xenophobic Soviet Union better had good reasons to be there and were closely watched. Also, he was an escapee from the country and orphanage yet the only one who noticed him, he is using his original Hannibal Lecter moniker, is a local police chief who was also part of the gang of sister eaters. No other official had any inkling he was an escaped citizen of the worker's paradise up to possible counter revolution or espionage?Now he turns the table on this police chief, who unwisely confronted him unarmed and alone at the derelict lodge, where he engages in his first act of human gourmet. Now it's all downhill, he has all the identities of these hoods, who had conveniently relocated to France, to get his revenge. In James Bondian fashion, he turns the tables on his would be pursuers, who now know he is after them. Meanwhile Inspector Joubert is still poking around, he knew what Hanny did in Lithuania but vows the guillotine for him if Hanny kills in France, fat chance.So it is just a bunch of overly clever revenge killing of totally despicable Nazi collaborator, white slaving, drug dealing scum who no one could ever feel sorry for. He is just a clever, erudite avenging angel cleaning up the mess that Nuremberg missed. Hannibal comes out a little daft but otherwise utterly justified and principled and skilled guy, with his Japanese lover now to defend too. Mr. Harris obviously wrote this as a rejoinder for the cannibal fan club, to make this creep look like a real mensch and man of letters too. As a film by itself, unconnected to the Hannibal saga, it would have been an interesting but ultimately routine revenge flick. But it is a sick,backdated excuse for one of cinema's favorite bad guy, who we are supposed to imagine was a good chap after all. Whether this is a bad thing in any grand moral or cultural way is not addressed in this cheap cash out prequel of the Hannibal saga. Most damning, one can not imagine that this Hannibal turned into the one we all know</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film nerds world wide don't need to be told how amazing Silence Of The Lambs is. As a serial killer movie, it is - in my opinion - number one, with Se7en a hair behind it. I don't have to go on about it's fine points, and if there is one flaw, it's constant breaking of the fourth wall, something I'm not a fan of. Still, this isn't enough of a detraction to mar the film in the slightest. It's a masterpiece. Nuff said.Hannibal was really well done if vastly different to the book, even if Jodie Foster didn't return to reprise the role of Clarice Starling. Gary Oldman was creepy as f@#k as Mason Verger, and Ray Liotta was amazingly slimy as Paul Krendler.Red Dragon was, I thought, a very solid film considering it's director is not known for making emotionally intense films. It followed the book faithfully, and had an amazing - some would say TOO amazing - cast. Hell, even Manhunter, Michael Mann's take on the same book was a great flick. Which leads us to Hannibal Rising.Sigh.Where to begin? I must admit that this review may be a little biased as I couldn't stomach more than the first twenty minutes of the film. I turned it off, and if I hadn't hired it, I would have burnt the disc. It was abysmal. It was the Batman and Robin of the Hannibal series. It took a great franchise and butchered it beyond the point of recognition, to a point that made Mason Verger look like a pretty boy. And I'm being polite here.First of all, Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal. WTF? I'm not saying he's a bad actor, not at all, but could they not have cast someone who wouldn't have had the problem of performing in a movie not written in their native tongue? Not that I think non-English speakers shouldn't appear in English spoken films, far from it, it's just Hannibal has been well established as having an English - or if you want to be picky with Anthony Hopkins' heritage - Welsh accent. Ulliel has a very strong French accent. Now call me petty if you will, but wouldn't it bug the hell out of you if when Vader spoke his first words in Revenge Of The Sith, he was voiced by Hayden Christensen? Next, we have certain elements of the story to contend with. I haven't read the book for Hannibal Rising, but if it's anything like the movie, then I'm very disappointed in Thomas Harris. Young Hannibal as some sort of half-hearted Samurai apprentice? Come on, that has to be the lamest idea I've ever heard, up there with at least half of the plot of X-Men 3. And trying to humanize him by showing his first kill as being motivated by some sort of loyalist chivalry towards his adopted aunt...Jesus wept!! Avoid like the plague, particularly if you're a fan of the first four films. Stinks worse than Jame Gumb's woman suit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay sure, if the title character in this movie were named Hans Frankz and had no ties to the Thomas Harris book series, it could be a decent albeit slow and lengthy film.Unfortunately, the ties to the Lecter story give the director ample opportunity to show his knack for cheesy clichés and lack of imagination. How many times can we see this "hannibal" with blood on his face and smiling in the chin-down, menacing way as Hopkins in "Lambs"? Seen enough of that, okay, this time we'll include some similar dialogue so as to avoid confusion for our inept viewers.Frankly this movie is boring.

		<fullReview>I went to the theater pretty exited to see this one. I'm a huge fan of all four previous adaptations of Thomas Harris' novels featuring the Lecter character. I had read Hannibal, so I knew some of the back story this movie would deal with. Within the first 10 minutes of watching Hannibal Rising, I knew we had all been duped. I kept waiting for new insights, and most of all for this movie to get entertaining. It never did. The plot was so thin, it would have been best as a half page of dialog in a much more interesting film. There simply was no need for this bit of the tale to be so drawn out. There are many things wrong with this movie. Number one is the script. I'm a big fan of Harris, but any good producer would have seen this script and demanded a complete re-write. It's Dino De Laurentiis' love letter to Thomas Harris. There's no way this movie would have been made this way if it had not been penned by the creator. No way. Another thing gone horrible wrong is the casting. I can't get any idea if Gaspard Ulliel is a good actor by watching this. I simply have no idea. He was nothing at all like the Hannibal we know and you can't even fathom him ever becoming old Lecter. Not only does he not look the part, but nothing about his personality was remotely a shadow of the character we love. This is mostly the result of the made for TV directing style courtesy of Peter Webber. This movie should do nothing else but serve as inspiration for Scary Movie 5. If you think I'm picky and being unfair, I should tell you Deuce Biglow is one of my fav film series. Im not hard to please. First and foremost, I need to be entertained. This movie fell so flat I walked out of the theater shaking my head trying to absorb what just happened...what DID happen? what's with the ending? The ending was a load of cow plop...actually cow plop makes more sense than this movie and is probably more fun to watch. Hannibal learning Jap fighting skills? WHAT!! Hannibal is a mute for 10 years, yet he knows how to speak at least 3 languages spontaneously?? YEAH! Seriously. I could go on and on on how disappointing this film is, but I'm sure you'll hear it from everyone else who saw this pile of poop. If you know someone that enjoyed this or thought it fit with the series in any way, you should give serious thought...to eating their movie collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writer Thomas Harris weakened his own legacy by creating this banal prequel to an otherwise very entertaining series of Hannibal Lector books and films.The entire premise of this "Rising" is to create empathy: Poor Lector was abused and saw too much as a kid. Yep, another Batman behavioral study.And now, why we don't give a hoot:. WE ALREADY EMPATHIZE WITH LECTOR. We don't need these politically correct psycho-babbling background to like him. This is fundie preaching to the choir. Bor-ring.We like him because he's suave. He's got class. We like that he's intelligent. And he kills jerkwads so we secretly don't min the linchpin of the franchise.This is too much information. We don't need to have any other excuse to like him. A wasted effort.Harris is a decent writer who should have spun a few more good tales instead. He could have written a much better version of "Dexter" if he would have avoided the prequel mistake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AKA...Hannibal Falling, or Failing, or Funny, or Finished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, now with the 3rd and 4th actors playing the monster Hannibal Lecter, hopefully they can put this series to rest. And with the final two in the series 'Red Dragon' and this one 'Hannibal Rising,' both completely underachieving, perhaps they will. This 'Rising,' this prequel to the legend Hannibal becomes, is all over the place. Though it mainly wraps itself around revenge ? something he barely seeks in the later years, it's about WWII, killing Jews, interracial/family "affairs," training, homicidal families (don't just watch your back around Hannibal!), school and war criminals. Not to spoil too much, but Hannibal seeks revenge on the men responsible for murdering and eating his younger sister and a dutiful cop is completely and utterly onto him. It almost seems like everyone knows he did it, yet, later in life, this is all forgotten, forgiven and he makes a huge name for himself as a world-known doctor. I'm not sure how no one bothered to look up his background, but then, its fiction. I believe the main problem is that it wants to be too many movies in one, but there are other problems as well. The older actor, #4 Hannibal, tries and is enormously unsuccessful at mimicking the #2 Hannibal played by Hopkins. The other major problem is the consistent, and utterly annoying after awhile, flashbacks. They start the movie as a WWII film, and end that segment with young Hannibal and his sister in a house with very bad men. Skip to, uh, "present day" Hannibal in an orphanage. They spend the rest of the movie filling in the blanks on how he escaped when they could've saved so much time by just showing immediately what happened when it happened. This wasn't the weakest link, but it is easily skipable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the main problem with 'Hannibal Rising' is that it doesn't have much to do with Hannibal Lecter, at least the Hannibal we've come to know from the three films with Anthony Hopkins or the books they're based on by Thomas Harris. This is strange as Harris wrote both the book and screenplay. Of course we know this is the story of Lecter as a child on up to young adulthood. But there is very little here that suggests or reminds us of the later Hannibal, the one we've come to love/hate. It seems to me there could be much gruesome fun in anticipating the many aspects of the character's later life, but such references come fleetingly and grudgingly and most times do not feel genuine. Much of the disconnect starts with the actor portraying Lecter as a young adult, Gaspard Ulliel. He doesn't look, talk, or act as we imagine a younger version of Hopkins' Hannibal might. For a comparison, think of Robert DeNiro as the young Vito Corleone in 'The Godfather Pt. 2.' It is very easy to picture his character aging into Marlon Brando's older Don. Here, we feel and sense nothing of the later Hannibal character, and aside from some rather obvious trademark characteristics trotted out reluctantly it seems by the director, we simply do not believe this person is Hannibal Lecter, young or old. The film's premise is simple; during the last days of WW2, a group of Nazis comes across the Lecter family's hiding place in Lithuania. Hannibal's mother and father are killed, leaving him and his younger sister Mischa to fend for themselves. The Nazis have no food; starving, they begin to cast hungry eyes on Mischa. Fast forward eight years, and Hannibal is tormented by the memory of what happened to his sister. So he plots revenge on the squad of Nazis who ate her, methodically seeking them out and killing them, one by one. He goes to live in France with his Japanese aunt, Lady Murasaki. She instructs him in Japanese customs, including the martial arts. (I had to groan at the idea of Ninja Hannibal. Fortunately, it doesn't last too long.) But the film wanders from place to place the rest of the way, punctuated by brief spasms of violence whenever Hannibal finds another Nazi to kill. All of this is quite frankly boring. Even the supposedly gruesome scenes aren't very interesting. Certainly, they pale in comparison to similar scenes in the three Hopkins movies. 'Hannibal Rising' is well-shot, with much beautiful scenery, but that's about the best thing one can say about it. In a larger sense, the whole project reeks of being a package deal- a short novel by Harris with a movie deal already lined up, the movie timed to come out shortly after the book (obviously) hit the best-sellers list, all calculated and pre-sold to an audience hungry for more of the Hannibal character. It is a shame, and a sell-out. I hope Harris takes the big paycheck he must have gotten, retires to some comfortable retreat, and writes another Hannibal Lecter novel, a REAL one. I think after 'Hannibal Rising,' his audience deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't know a cannibal could be so boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will disappoint Hannibal fans.If you want to see the Hannibal we are familiar with don't bother with watching this thing.And even if you excuse the lack of similarities with the other Hannibal films this movie is still boring and forgettable.In this film we learn of the beginnings of Dr.Hannibal Lector.The atrocities inflicted on his family during the last days of World War II,especially his sister,just flips little Hannibal out and starts him down his wicked road to total evilness.Somehow he gets into a well-to- do medical school in France and learns the things he needs to learn about the human body to further his career,I guess you'd say.Which is fine I guess.But the problem is in the film Hannibal's actions don't seem all that wicked or insane considering what happened to his family.If my family ended up like his did I might also seek revenge like he did and I think most folks feel the same way which sort of mutes Hannibals actions to the viewer.While the characters in the film wonder why Hannibal is so insane and such a monster, we as real people in the audience just aren't that horrified because Hannibal doesn't act all that crazy considering what has happened to him.And the other problem with this film is it doesn't know if it is a straight drama or a horror film so it sort of straddles the line and tries to be both.And it fails at both.Its hard to be a serious drama when you have to utter lines like ,"But he ate my sister!".Also the gore and blood is tame compared to what a straight horror film would have so viewers will be unsatisfied on both levels after watching this film.It also has a slow plodding pace,a way to stretch out the paper thin plot I suppose.And there is none of the trademark Hannibal stuff we are used to.This closest he comes to the well-known face mask is when he tries on a Samauri mask,looking up into the camera with an attempt to scare I guess.It just looked hokey to me.This film isn't terrible but it isn't good either.It is just sort of there, trying to feed off other better made movies about Dr.Lector.Not one to add to your horror collection and actually probably not worth a 2 buck rental but a friend let me borrow his copy so I'm okay there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like rating movies on their predecessor or predecessors as the case may be but in this case I find it hard not to, honestly. I feel as though Harris writing the screenplay was just a horrid idea. The difference between this movie and the other three (To all you uber nerds, yes, I am ignoring Manhunter) There were two big difference for me which give way to smaller ones. First, Harris tried too hard to make the film elegant. This is murder, not a cotillion. Quit trying to make it such an acute mile stone of costume and cinematography. You're not Dali, so stop trying. Second, the other movies had a mystery element to them. There was an answer at the end of the story but in order for us to be satisfied by it we need to pay attention to the question. This movie was just giving a a vague plot. It seemed almost like a biography then a fiction story. I don't think that there was anything within this movie to keep me interested. I didn't wait for the end because there was no reward for getting there. There was no question and thus no answer. Three good movies were put out and then there was a fourth that didn't live up to the standard. Even ignoring the fact that it was part of a series, there STILL wasn't ANYTHING to keep me interested in the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few things are quite good about this movie: photography, special effects. Acting is sometimes very bad though and you'll have trouble to believe either in Hannibal the so-called monster, who looks more like a current teenager with a hormone problem, or in the bad guys that made Hannibal into a monster, with their fake accents and contrived evilness. Anyway, the worst thing in there is probably the story, a typical, boring revenge routine with a twist of cannibalism. I almost stopped it 3 or 4 times but watched it to the end, mostly because of Gong Li. Tomas Harris has written very good stuff in the past (think of "Red Dragon"), but I suggest he retire and enjoy his savings, because he's only writing crap now. About the director, I won't say a word because I'm a nice person, after all.</fullReview>

This one is not an exception. But it's not as awful as i expected. At least it keeps your attention before the ordinary ending.

In the original film, Hannibal was a smart person who predicted the unique methods of a criminal mind. The character in this film approached his victims directly. I thought he was going to hunt his victims in a smart sneaky ways, but unfortunately simply they kept running into each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Lector Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I overheard a representative of Alliance Atlantis say that this movie is expected to be a box office hit or at least that it was going to make a lot of money. I think the only reason this may be true is because there are a lot of Lector fans out there who are committed to watching this fourth Lector odyssey. This movie was pointless, one does not learn anything new in this movie about Lectors life. We have learned why he became what he became in earlier films. I guess this movie is for people who have no imagination and have to see for themselves what little Hannibal went through. The only thing I did like about this movie is that it wasn't needlessly gruesome, it didn't have a lot of blood guts and gore that leaves the viewer with a nauseous feeling at the end. If you read this before you see the movie in theatres, wait for the rental.</fullReview>

They packed everything in to two hours of film and everything just so disjointed and i never really got a feel for the characters or connected with them. Also if you are planing to see this film for the gore then you will also be disappointed as there is not a lot in it and all the gore that was in it seemed to be dulled down. Overall this film has to be one of the worst films of the year so far and i hope that it is not included in a box-set with the other Hannibal movies because it was just so pointless and disappointing.</fullReview>

The Lecter character wasn't really very appealing and it seemed as if for the whole movie the filmmakers were trying to justify his future acts by making the incident at the beginning of the film seem so awful. They have probably done a reasonable job with what they had to work with but i'm not sure a prequel was ever destined to work with the Hannibal franchise.This film will just leave you feeling flat and wishing you had never bothered.</fullReview>

She wanted to have sex with her nephew but she couldn't even pronounce his name right, "Handball, where are you." The funniest scene is where you figure out how Hannibal "Handball" and his Japanese aunt? connect. His family was killed by the Nazi's in the war, and her's by the American's in Hiroshima? Gong Li was just terrible. The young boy had a certain fetish for saying "You ate my sister" but the biggest twist of all was when you learn he ate his sister too!!! M for Mischa. Honestly the young Hannibal had the look but considering he didn't talk in the movie until more than halfway when he said "thank you" to his Japanese aunt. The movie is horrible, stay away, unless you are bored and you want a good laugh and you are willing to watch 2 hours of nothing to get 2 minutes of laughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's obvious Hollywood hasn't learned anything from the awful 'Exorcist' prequel.I saw 'Hannibal Rising' today, and within the first ten minutes, I could sense how flat the story was. The dialogue is mundane, there's absolutely no suspense, nothing graphic as far as I'm concerned, and nothing scary.The fact that the scene which acts as a catalyst for Hannibal's rising is merely a badly choreographed flashback demonstrates a lost potential. This was a bland story not worth being told.What also bugged me were the inaccuracies and contradictions of what has already been established in the original three films. For example, the actor playing young Hannibal doesn't resemble Anthony Hopkins at all. And the way he reacts to finding out he ate someone unknowingly as a boy contradicts the scene at the end of 'Hannibal' where he willfully and hypocritically feeds a unknowing young boy someone's brain.</fullReview>

The movie almost tries to humanize Hannibal Lecter, which is ridiculous. Let's face it -- he eats people.

		<fullReview>Great looking bad movie movie. The point of the film is to show where Hannibal Lechter from Red Dragon, Hannibal and especially Silence of the Lambs started out and learned to do what he does so well. The problem is that what we see here never makes any sense with what we know follows in his later chronology. More than once I comment how it was wrong for the character to do something on screen.The film ultimately subverts Lechter's character- revenge is not enough reason to create what he becomes. Of course this might play okay unconnected to the other stories, but I doubt it, since the story never really works on any level. This is just a sleazy euro-trash film with pretensions.

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Declining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to the meticulously of Jonathan Demme and presence of Anthony Hopkins, who invented the narrative and esthetic's codes of the saga to come (in my opinion, more than Thomas Harris, who's book could have been adapted in many other ways, as the Michael Mann's adaptation of Red Dragon - "Manhunter" - shows it), the series of film that fallows "Silent of the lamb", if they weren't all good ("Red Dragon" is an absolute waste of talent) had the interest to include a most fascinating character : Dr Hannibal Lecter.In this age of prequels, origins and beginnings, which only shows the incapacity for Hollywood to create a new and original concept, it's not very surprising to see a film that tells us the youth of the distinguish cannibal. And it's not hard to guess that the youth of Dr Lecter wasn't exactly wonderland. So, the good point of this prequel is that it's rather violent, full of perversion and has plenty of great torture scenes. Well, it's seem silly but it's generally what you're looking for when you're watching that kind of movie. And you're even happier when, in bonus of the perversion and of the blood, you also have a good movie. Helas, don't expect any cinematographic interest here : the direction is lame (it looks like a TV movie with its cheap camera effects), the actors are generally bad ( special mention to Anthony Hopkins, who's transparent in this movie, and to Gong Li, who has nothing to do here, and why the hell is she Japanese again ! : and of course, like in all American movie, she's really strong in martian art, and a good and wise teacher to young Lecter), and the script is rather stupid.Where "The silent of the lamb" and even "Hannibal" manage to stay rather clever and credible about the psychology of Lecter, this origin is so full of historical mistakes (the after WWII France isn't credible at all : the houses interiors, decors and direction panels seems too modern), clichés (see the German army in the beginning : they flew from the Russian front, but they're all SS and all they could think about is to kill some Jews and Gypsies, and everyone speaks English, no matter were you are ! Interesting to notice, however, that everyone has a different accent...), and facilities (Hannibal's reason to become a cannibal are really poor and incredible).All in all, this movie, enjoyable for one or two torture scenes, is highly dispensable, and, as usual, I strongly recommend you to watch the original movie ("The Silent of the Lamb") rather than this simplification of the character, for you'll learn much more about a psychopath's psychology in the Demme's movie than in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't read or seen any of Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal, or Red Dragon, then what can you expect to see? An overlong revenge movie with a number of scenes that don't seem to have any point at all.The problem with the movie isn't so much that it's poorly made or internally inconsistent (although it really wasn't very good). The problem is that they tried to link it to Hannibal Lecter. Given that it won't have much appeal to a new audience, that makes it a pretty big failure.We already know some of the story of his past from the books, so the movie should have focused on how the fantastic character of Hannibal Lecter came to be. Instead it takes the only big thing that we *already knew*, and builds a completely random story of war-crimes and revenge around it, involving a character named Hannibal Lecter, but whose behaviour and motives bear no resemblance at all to the character we know. That he is a little style-less and impulsive is annoying but could potentially be explained away, but the Hannibal in this movie is passionate and troubled, not especially cultured, and shows no calm or of that great sense of irony.Some aspects of the character are covered in a weak attempt to tie it in - like that he can defeat a lie detector or tell things about people - but they're really blunt, poorly executed, don't lead on to anything, and have no explanation! The *only* thing that existing fans would want, is missing!I'm still a fan of the other books and movies - I have them all - but I won't be adding this one to that collection. I was planning to read the book, but it would have to be strongly recommended to me by someone I trust before I considered it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the Worst Film I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, what a blatant excuse for hyperbole those four words usually are: "The Worst Film Ever".Yet this film, I believe, can qualify for this title, and I will explain why.Firstly, the acting, cinematography, music, script, indeed the whole thing was a big cliché. Yes, that is what we sort of expect from Hollywood these days, and is the reason why I avoid Hollywood films, but I can safely say there was nothing original in this movie.Next, the execution. The acting was poor - not "Plan 9 From Outer Space" poor, but certainly cringe-worthy.The film was, as it intended to be, incredibly disturbing (in my opinion, anyhow). Unfortunately, what the filmmakers failed to realise (and they are not the only ones guilty in the last few years) is that there has to be a point to the gratuitous violence. There was certainly no point to be found here.The violence concerned me on another level. It seemed to, in a way, almost glamorise the cruelty. I think the perfect illustration is in one scene, after finishing off a brutal and unpleasant killing, the character of Hannibal mutters a witty, and somewhat ironic line. Is this supposed to make the audience laugh? It seemed that way, but at that moment the audience was dead quiet.I do wonder, to be honest, what drives people to make films like this, other than purely making money. The only thing this film achieved was to provide a back-story to The Silence of the Lambs, itself a fairly average film that looks like a masterpiece compared to this. Is such a back-story, however, necessary? The above mentioned film worked fine on its own; one can therefore only conclude that the producers have attempted to wring as much cash out of that film's popularity as possible.I freely admit that I still believe that the cinema is a valid medium for art. Movies like Hannibal Rising, however, are as artistic as a McDonald's Commercial. However, there will be many more of these types of movies made, because that is the mentality of Hollywood today. If this makes you feel depressed, don't. There's plenty of talent in the world of film-making today. Just look toward a little continent called Europe.</fullReview>

It's vanilla. It's beige. It's mediocre, at best. It's pointless. It's the cinematic equivalent of a roller-coaster with no bumps, loops or turns that goes at a moderate pace from start to finish. Save for perhaps one brief moment, there's nothing in the film that brings about any excitement or has any kind of "wow" factor. Hannibal Lecter is surely one of the most intriguing characters ever, yet this movie, which captures his "beginning" story (always the biggest opportunities for a great film story) falls completely flat.The acting is mediocre at best (awful stereotypical English-with-a-cheesy-foreign-accent stuff), the dialogue is cliché-ridden, stilted and unconvincing, the timing/editing is abysmal, the cinematography provides little in the way of drama, the climax is, admittedly, slightly better, but the ending is near-pointless and feels tacked-on.Don't bother watching this movie, it does little to further the Lecter anthology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the fifth film in the Hannibal Lector series, but is the story that started all the madness; after the death of his parents and sister during World War II, a young Hannibal Lector (Gaspard Ulliel), having escaped the Nazis, moves in with aunt Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Li Gong) and begins seeking his revenge for his sister's death.Like all Hannibal Lecter movies, this has disturbing and graphic scenes, but pretty cliché by the time this film came to be. Gaspard Ulliel did an OK job as Lector, but I didn't find him as bewildering as Hopkin was in his portrayal. Li Gong made a great addition to the cast, elegant and stunning as always.In a nutshell, though, this movie didn't have the the appeal and suspense built-up as Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon had.

You can count many examples like these.Hannibal Lecter trilogy is awesome. Such a talented writer! But this book look like he forced himself to write a past story of Hannibal and thought what popular was. Then he found it! Germans! I think he shouldn't force himself to write of Hannibal's past after the success of the trilogy.My opinion as a movie, you can watch it. I could rate as 7 if they changed the title.

		<fullReview>Here is the foundation of madness. The tale of Hannibal Lecter is a grisly and dark tale, but here we actually sympathize with him. He is a boy who loves his sister very much, so much he attempts to defend her against the invading looters. He is only about 10 years old, much too young to fight off five armed men, and their violation of the boy and his sister is nothing short of monstrous. Even in time of war, there is no excuse for the horror these men perpetrate on the children, and these are the seeds planted in Hannibal's mind that create the character we are so familiar with. The cast is primarily European, which gives us another perspective into the creation of our sociopath, and the introduction of Lady Murasaki and ancestor worship creates the dimension needed for Hannibal to avenge the death of Mischa. The film begins in horror and ends in horror, and is perhaps the most chilling of the five films about our character. Gaspard Ulliel gives a haunting performance as the young Hannibal, Li Gong is impressive as Lady Murasaki, and Dominic West is equally intriguing as the investigator of war crimes who knows but cannot prove Hannibal is killing the criminals. And perhaps this is the reason we sympathize with Lecter. This monster preys upon monsters. If you think about it, most of the people Hannibal kills, with the notable exception of the two police officers, two ambulance personnel, and the tourist at the airport in SOTL, are criminals, murders, child molesters, and worse. While we are not privy to the full list of Hannibal's victims, we see a purpose in his killings. Overall, this is a chilling tale that completes the Lecter series, and one that is a must see for fans of the films and Harris' novels. Rated R for the same reasons as the previous films, and definitely not the fare for the younger members of the family. Collectible for the lovers of the series.</fullReview>

It might be great for all the gore lovers but not for me. I was expecting much more. It clearly misguides about the character of Hannibal. They forgot that there was a reason why the character was screened so less without revealing much about his crimes and just giving a nature of his deeds. The mystery of his character was not meant to be solved and not at all in this way. It turns out to be just a gush of blood without the charm. Not for fans of Hannibal. Others can have a look. Its not at all mature like others in series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was almost inevitable that the Hannibal Lecter name would eventually be tarnished by some fool with a camera. That fool is Peter Webber and his film is Hannibal Rising, the prequel to the franchise in which we learn the dark origins of Lecter and what made him into the monster we know today. It is set post World War II. Hannibal lost his entire family in the war and now he is on a vengeful quest to find the barbarians whom he watched murder his younger sister. This is a painfully stupid film that does nothing but make a mockery of the name Hannibal Lecter. I don't even want to believe that the main character of this film is actually Lecter it is just such a blemish on that ominous name. Frankly, there was no need for a Hannibal backstory film at all, but if you're going to make one, make it right.There is something ironically amusing about this film. It is the screenplay debut of Thomas Harris, the man behind the character of Hannibal Lecter in the first place. Harris is the writer of every Hannibal Lecter novel so we have him to thank for some great movies, but all that goes out the window when he attempts to make a screenplay out of his latest book. The dialogue is one of the worst things about Hannibal Rising. It believes it is way too smart and profound when in fact it is pathetically stupid. The amount of dry and cringe worthy lines from this movie is staggering. Its attempts at metaphors, or really any figurative language for that matter, are shameful. I felt like I was witnessing the work of a complete hack when one of the characters so dramatically stated, "Memory is like a knife... it hurts you." Really? There is one thing about this film to be thankful for. The acting and dialogue is so bad that it is very easy to forget you are watching a film about Hannibal Lecter, thus making this a very forgettable addition to the franchise. It is so forgettable, in fact, it's like it never even happened, which is great because this film is something that never needed to happen. A relative unknown named Gaspard Ulliel was cast in the role of the young rendition of Lecter. Ulliel tried desperately to do justice to the character, trying to hone Hopkins' portrayal. However, he failed miserably. His acting is so ridiculous and so laughable it would have swung this film into the so-bad-it's-good realm if the film hadn't been so stupidly boring.This film tries way too hard to make us believe that this is really the young Hannibal Lecter, shooting itself in the foot and convincing us that this is an impostor trying to recreate what Hopkins so perfectly pulled off. Ulliel's dialogue is moronic and stale and his mannerisms and subtleties that make Lecter who he is are virtually non-existent. Hannibal Rising turns the eerily calm and collected Hannibal Lecter into an angsty and whiny teenager who over acts every emotion the real Hannibal Lecter so eloquently represses.I have a very difficult time believing that this is a Hannibal Lecter film. I want to completely discard it from the franchise, but with the word Hannibal in the title that is difficult to do. This film tarnishes what The Silence of the Lambs and its follow ups executed so incredibly well. Red Dragon and Hannibal aren't perfect films but I still enjoy them. Hannibal Rising, on the other hand, is a complete mess with almost nothing good about it. If you enjoy gruesome, like I do, then you might enjoy bits and pieces of this film. Otherwise it is complete trash which should have never seen the light of day. It is the lack of backstory that makes Hannibal Lecter so intriguing and so eerie. This film lifts that veil of secrecy and then pisses on all of it and feeds it to the dogs. It is one big giant mistake, and there's nothing we can do about it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sad creative implosion of Thomas Harris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fairly standard for Hollywood to take a writer's work and bastardize it beyond recognition. It's somewhat rare for a writer to willingly bastardize his own creation. Hannibal Rising is an example of the latter as Thomas Harris takes his most famous and compelling creation and refashions him from murderous psychopath to ill tempered Batman knockoff. I don't know what effect the fame and fortune of The Silence of the Lambs had on Harris personally, but this film is the mark of an embarrassing creative collapse.This movie is about the origins of Hannibal Lecter, which is a problem right from the start. Lecter is a brilliant work of fiction, a charismatic monster who almost transcends his evil nature. He is not at all realistic. There are sadistic madmen in the world, but they have as much in common with Hannibal Lecter as the average policeman has with Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot. The more you see of Lecter, the harder it is to deny the fantastic, unbelievable aspects of the character. That's why he's more fascinating and effective when he plays a small role in a story, such as the novels Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and the film adaptation of Lambs. The more you focus on him, such as in the book and film versions of Hannibal and this movie, both Lecter and his stories become more ridiculous and hard to swallow. So, trying to make a serious movie that's entirely about Lecter is a doomed endeavor.The film begins with Lecter as young boy in World War II Lithuania and the terrible tragedies his family suffered. It then jumps forward to Lecter as a young man (Gaspard Ulliel) who gets taken in by his Japanese aunt in France. As Lecter deals with his almost-Oedipal attraction to Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), he's haunted by a desire for revenge on the band of looters that savagely killed his young sister Mischa (Helena-Lia Tachovska). There's also French Inspector Popil (Dominic West), a war crimes investigator who complicates Lecter's efforts to slaughter those who slaughtered his sister. Playing out more like a 1970s revenge flick than anything resembling the previous Lecter films, a bunch of variously evil people meet relatively ungruesome ends and Lecter slips away at the end.Hannibal Rising not only starts out as a bad idea, it's even worse in the execution. At the point where his Japanese aunt is training Lecter in the martial arts, I actually laughed out loud at the cheesy stupidity of it. That's not something I could have ever imagined doing after I first watched Silence of the Lambs. It doesn't help anything that Gaspard Ulliel looks like a male model doing Zoolander's "Blue Steel" face through the whole movie. This thing is devoid of any of the cleverness or complexity of any of the previous Lecter stories on the page or the screen. It's more like a really pretentious Steven Seagal direct-to-DVD release.I loathed the ending of the novel Hannibal. It was such a gross violation of the essence of both Lecter and Clarice Starling that I was convinced Harris was intentionally trying to anger his fans so they'd stop bothering him for more Hannibal stories. But he then went on to write another Lecter book and then the screenplay for this cinematic joke. I no longer have any idea why he's done these things, only that he should be punished and not rewarded for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disaster in need of repair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a major fan of Thomas Harris, and have read all of his novels several times, with the exception of Hannibal Rising. Once was enough. I have all of the films based on his novels with the exception of this one. I saw it at the theater, and like the reading of the novel, once was enough.There is much to say that would be of interest, preventing it (barely) from being listed as "awful." I have nothing against the visual impact of the cinematography, an art form that is long neglected. The film is mostly dark, and even the daylight sequences seem to have an absence of light.The editing and pace of the film moves right along. The actors are all fine and well. What went wrong? ***** SPOILERS ***** *The storyline is an abortion. Harris was commissioned to write another Lecter story with the intent of it becoming a film, and no one told him that to drag the boyhood of a monster forward so we, as an audience, would come to understand the monster came from a sad, tormented boy.Bosh.Who cares? Having read the other novels where we encounter this true Monster, I was impressed how much his story was told in bits and pieces, not unlike the story of Nero Wolfe series. Why give us everything all at once, when it so much more fun to be able to glean the story from brief anecdotes? Lecter's sister was mentioned in earlier novels, as well as some of his past. Those brief glimpses made the character more interesting, giving him a sense of mystery. By releasing this mess, there was no mystery. Even the clever use of the mask... sigh... are you kidding?? What I feel SHOULD have been done was to continue forward from the previous novel, ignoring the mangled end of the film Hannibal. Leave our Monster to be a Monster, but show him more for what he truly is, and once we see that, we can see how this mess could have been made interesting...He is a Moriarty without a Holmes. If we are to go back into his previous life, then tell the tale of how he was captured in the first place... wouldn't that have been an interesting story?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is It Hannibal Lecter?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched silence of the lambs after almost the entire world had withed it(may be more than once). Hannibal came next and wasn't too bad. suddenly came red dragon out of nowhere and we all fell in love with edward norton once again. so to be successful prequel rising should have had something which would have added and linked all the earlier movies. unfortunately, rising makes a mockery of lecter's sinister legacy.firstly the premise on wchich the film proceeds that of retribution and exploring lecter's demented state is in conflict with all the other movies where(and for good reason) the fact that lecter is a demented and sadistic personality is taken for granted without going into his background or may be the reasons for his degradation. lecter's infamy lies precisely in this- he kills and torments for the intellectual thrill of such a process. rising by introducing elements such as retribution,angst and injustice succeeds in giving a disproportionate cause for lecter's depravity. the entire movie is ingested with efforts to try and connect lecter's depravity with his traumatic childhood memories. this is impossible to digest, for all those who see this movie in relation to the otheres in the line, can never reconcile the lecter of "silence" and the lecter of rising. in fact lecter's sinister charm lay in his inexplicable thirst for human gore and flesh. the moment the director attach's a tangible emotional reason that degeneration , the whole thrill and horror is lost. as an independent movie the film is all the more handicapped for no viewer would easily swallow cannibalism as a normal mode seeking vengeance.moving aside from the character development of lecter, another thing which makes this movie quite ordinary is the habitual resorting to the second world war where the root of all evil lies.a young child tormented by war crimes, a beautiful aunt who was a victim of Hiroshima.......... is this why lecter became lecter? oh! common . rising is at best a grim portrayal of a tormented child's journey of retribution, at worst it is a blot on the entire lecter series. 4 points just for gong li's charm and a few gory scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh. Ultimately regrettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising is, I think, the fourth film of the Hannibal Lecter film series (not counting Manhunter because I assume that was outside the continuity of the movies Anthony Hopkins appeared in). This is the only one of the recent movies without Hopkins, which makes sense as this deals with young Hannibal. A pattern is emerging- the odd-numbered Lecter movies (The Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon) are great; the even-numbered movies (Hannibal and this movie) are bad.Hannibal Rising attempts to explore the origins of Lecter, a Lithuanian boy whose sister was cannibalized during World War II. Lecter grows up to seek revenge, and we see him become a killer and a cannibal.Inevitably, without Hopkins this movie is going to lose much of the magic and power that Silence and Red Dragon had. Even if they had a younger actor who could do what Hopkins did, there's still an argument to be made that Lecter is scarier as a caged monster and psychological threat than he is as a cliché horror movie killer. Maybe there's an argument to be made that less is more when it comes to seeing Lecter. He's not as big of a character in Silence and Red Dragon than he is here or in Hannibal, but he's more powerful in Silence and Red Dragon. I don't know, but what I do know is that Lecter isn't helped here by either the bland writing or a good guy as compelling as Clarice and Will Graham were. The good guy here, Popil, is not a stand out character at all.Some of the war scenes in the beginning are dry; the home invaders at the beginning of the film look silly in trying to be scary, and, just as the scene is starting to get scary- they're about to eat the girl- the scene stops. There arguably should have been more here. In contrast, the movie goes a bit too far in depicting a brutal murder by sword, and later, a knife through a head. Unfortunate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this DVD dirt cheap, and was expecting nothing extraordinary in terms of film making, and frankly couldn't think of f''k all else to watch! i WAS expecting this to be a biopic of the life of the fictional cannibal hannibal lector, up to the events of red dragon... it wasn't though... I have no idea if the book has more content or what, if not, it f''king should have, cuz this just seems like another silence of the lambs marketing trick. producers won't be happy until a franchise has been milked to the very last drop. the remake of Red Dragon wouldn't have been so disrespectful had it have been done properly, but it wasn't. actually this screenplay was wrote BY the hannibal lector creator Thomas harris himself... maybe he just should have sticked to writing the books? :/ this film tells of the life of hannibal lector as a young boy when his parents were killed by the nazi, and his sister eaten by the Nazis who captured him, and held up in snowbound lodge, UPTO- the point of where he's possibly in his mid 20's.sometimes something can be so bad it's actually funny. alota people have said this movie is as funny as f''k cuz it's so bad, but i didn't think there was anything funny about it. hannibal kills around 5 people, all the killings are bland, and unimaginative... nothing like those in hannibal and silence of the lambs which make the view recoil in disgust and horror. for those anime fans out there reading this, hannibal actually uses a samurai sword to kill some of the 5 victims- (his aunt who takes him in turns out to be Japanese).anything positive to say about this 3/10 film? - there is but one thing... when you first watch this you don't expect anything of the young guy playing hannibal whatsoever, then throughout the film you gradually begin to see the hannibal lector portrayed by Anthony hopkins appear- everything from his voice, to his facial expressions and body language is dead on target! i actually thought i was watching a young Anthony hopkins.I reckon the guy's performance was let down by the bland shiny production values and brain dead Hollywood style story telling. overall 3.1/10.Worth a watch? - no not really. Q: Even if I can't think of anything else to watch? A: Yeah, just avoid it.</fullReview>

I thought the last one was a new low until I watched this. It's a complete waste of time and completely unnecessary. Who cares if Lecter had a traumatic youth? The less we know about the character the more frightening he is. Seeing just a little of him in "Silence" is what made him so memorable. I don't want to feel sympathy for him, I want to be horrified by him. Hopefully Harris will let the series die here and perhaps move on to more fertile territory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unfortunate addition to the franchise, which to be honest, should have been left with Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs. Since then? Stuff that has made people money, but not much else.The story line (and don't think there are any spoilers here, but always beware, sometimes I think the smallest fact ruins a movie) revolves around Hannibal's experiences during WWII, and some particularly nasty Nazis, Russians, and others. They give rise to some anger management problems for the poor wretched kid.But there is a major strange disconnect between this "prequel" and the movies it is supposed to precede. I don't know about anyone else, but I never even considered the possibility that Hannibal Lecter was of eastern European descent. Just me, sure, I guess. But, what? Guess he's supposed to be brilliant, and so maybe Anthony Hopkins doing a bad Maryland accent can be excused because he was covering up a bad Lithuanian accent.Problem is more basic though, bad plotting, weird events, bad acting, nothing really having to do with the other movies except cannibalism. And even that is strained.Lecter is supposed to be evil, but here he's just not very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And never is that more true than with regards to building a solid fictional character. I watched The Silence of the Lambs as part of a college seminar on the nature of "monsterhood." The course covered a wide range of "monsters," both fictional and real, from Dracula and Frankenstein to Adolf Eichmann and Sanyika Shakur. Hannibal Lecter, until this well-funded but ridiculous installment in his story, embodied some of the best of what can make a person monstrous: utter detachment from his heinous acts, a moral compass that manages to be both uncompromising and yet bizarrely capricious, and, above all, an ability to appear an exceptional member of society -- gifted, intelligent, and comfortable with oneself.And with this chapter in his life, Hannibal Lecter is now just another poor soul who's fallen victim to a traumatic childhood.For those who need complete closure in their lives, this movie (and the source book) will satisfy. Every single facet of Hannibal Lecter's personality is explained in painstaking detail. We learn about his predilection for human facial flesh, his fascination with inflicting both psychological and physical terror. Even the face guard he will be forced to wear later in life - - as a safety measure for the law enforcement folks transporting him, mind you -- is now cast as a formative fetish from his teenage years. In other words, all the mystery of what makes Hannibal is removed. To my mind, that eviscerates everything that made the character great.On a positive note, Dominic West turns in a trademark solid performance, and Li Gong manages to look stunning while acting as well as her abysmally-written part will allow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and Red Dragon, but Hannibal Rising was a real let down. One of the biggest faults is that Hopkins is an Englishman, but young Hannibal in this film is portrayed with an Eastern European accent. The storyline isn't original, and Hannibal bears almost no resemblance to Hopkin's Hannibal. He doesn't seem at all intelligent or insightful, or clairvoyant as Hannibal does in the first three films. The acting and dialogue are sub-par for the horror genre. Oh well, I guess any film without Hopkins as Lector is bound to be far below its predecessors. The more violet scenes are well done, and Ulliel does alright as a psycho, but he just doesn't feel like Hannibal. The visuals are excellent, and the cinematography is above average.I give Hannibal Rising (The unrated, 130 minute version) a 4/10.</fullReview>

A young Hannibal watches only steps away as his parents violently die, leaving his cherished younger sister in his care.

He flees to Paris to find his uncle has died but his beautiful and mysterious Japanese widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li) welcomes him.Showing a cunning aptitude for science, he is accepted into medical school, which serves to hone his skills and provide the tools to exact justice on the war criminals that haunt him day and night. This quest will ignite an insatiable lust within a serial killer who was born, not made. This movie was a very sloppy movie with it being just thrown together. A total avoid.

Aside from some really bad lines of dialog, and cuts that left you wondering what happened, turning Hannibal into a sympathetic character kills the film. A Hannibal Lector movie is the type of movie where you want to root for the bad guy because he is bad. You expect him to do nasty things to people who maybe really don't deserve to have nasty things done to them. Unfortunately his victims are much worse than he is, so he's more of an anti-hero than the brilliantly psychotic serial killer that you know and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Lecter as comic-book avenger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So just how does one go from being a carefree, apple-cheeked schoolboy to becoming the most notorious, cannibalistic serial killer in literary history? "Hannibal Rising" thinks it has the answer. First, you watch as Nazis mow down your parents in cold blood. Then, you look on helplessly as a band of starving Lithuanian soldiers carve up and eat your little sister. Finally, you enroll in med school so you will not only acquire intimate knowledge of the human anatomy but will have unlimited access to disemboweled cadavers and tools of dismemberment that will come in mighty handy in your off-duty hours.The very concept of Hannibal Lecter is so off-putting and distasteful (pardon the pun) that it really only works when you have an actor of the caliber of Anthony Hopkins on hand to, in some way at least, "humanize" the character. For without the "charisma" Hopkins brought to the role, Lecter becomes just another garden-variety psycho - and the movies themselves mere exercises in cheap, tawdry exploitation.This is the single greatest problem with this alleged "prequel" to the Academy Award-winning "Silence of the Lambs." Hard as it tries, it really can't make Lecter's transformation all that compelling or believable. And without that shield to protect us, the goriness and unpleasantness come rushing over us with full, unabated force. Admittedly, there's a certain purgative kick in watching the cannibals get their comeuppance at the hand of one of their victims, but you'll still probably feel like taking a shower after the movie. About the only interesting aspect to the story is how each of the three main characters has chosen a different way to cope with the loss of family members in the war: Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel), of course, turns to revenge murders and cannibalism; the chief inspector (Dominic West) goes after unpunished war criminals; and Lecter's beautiful Japanese aunt (Li Gong) helps protect her nephew from the full force of the law. But such analysis is going way too far in justifying a movie whose sole purpose for existing is to turn the audience's stomach as it caters to the propensity for vicarious sadism that resides in the human species.Those who made "Hannibal Rising" have taken a character who was terrifying precisely because his actions COULDN'T be explained in any rational manner - and thus any one of us could fall victim to his madness - and turned him into a conventional Angel of Vengeance stamping out evildoers and injustice, with the imprimatur of "divine righteousness" to give him moral cover. In short, they have transmogrified him into little more than a comic book action figure (albeit an extremely dark one). Not that it's any big deal in the grand scheme of things, but "Hannibal Rising" might be more accurately entitled "Hannibal Falling."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't keep a good franchise down. Thankfully, I watched the movie version of "Hannibal" before I read the book, because quite simply, the book sucked. Too many ridiculous characters and a stupid sub-plot which was thankfully omitted from the movie adaptation and left to Scott's cinematography to bring life to an otherwise embarrassing story. This sub-plot - of Lectur's infancy and why he became who he is is the subject of this movie. So how is the audience expected to react? Hannibal Lecter, one of the greatest baddies ever conceived and gifted Hopkins his Oscar, is now, "ooh - he was just a victim of circumstance". Thomas Harris obviously couldn't think of a sequel so this prequel was the only choice for a quick buck. Turn the unfilmed stuff into another book and let the movie makers do the rest as the royalties flood in.What is left is a woefully 1-dimensional revenge-killing story. No sub-plots, no reason why everyone across several nations in battle-torn Europe speaks fluent English, no obvious continuity between this story and the next, the embarrassment of using a Chinese actress of playing a Japanese woman (Has nobody learnt anything from the Geisha movie Sayuri?) and a movie where just about everybody is the bad guy, so nobody cares who lives or dies. Gaspard Ulliel (French, an obvious choice for an Eastern European later to be portrayed as a Welshman living in America) spends most of his time head forward and skulking around on the brink of turning into a bat and flapping away. The rest of the characters just don't have enough of character to develop or to care about. It doesn't matter how nicely it's filmed: like "The Village", if the story is lame then no amount of cinematography can give it life. Think of when the successful "Alien" series became "Another dead horse gets flogged". An utter waste of time.</fullReview>

Dino DeLaurence and his ilk are milking this for all its worth and this latest offering proves that Thomas Harris got lucky with the character of Lechter and his attempts to make him into some kind of cult hero have failed miserably. I thought the dreadful "Hanibal" was pretty much the end of it but now they came up with this muck. Lets be clear, "Silence of the Lambs" and "Manhunter" were top notch films but the rest (maybe "Red Dragon" as an exception) were dire. This movie was basically a "Death Wish" remake and the script was terrible. The acting was poor and nobody emerged from this attempt to cash in on the first two movies fails in all levels except one. The war scenes at the start were accurate in uniform and tanks but for those who like this sort of movie this won't mean much. I once saw an interview with Dino DeLaurence and his daughter saying that this movie would go on and on. I have one message to him and his daughter, Stop it, stop it at once. The series is dead now move on. As for Thomas Harris, he must take full blame for the dire fare served up in the two sequels and he can't blame a poor script as he wrote it himself. 3/10 for the war sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good sequel or prequel should be good on its own merits. You should be able to watch that movie and it should be enjoyable without having seen the others in the series. You can watch Red Dragon without having seen Silence of the Lambs. You can watch Hannibal without having seen Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon. But the whole time I was watching this movie, I had the feeling that I was watching deleted scenes to a DVD. They were informational, but not enough to hold the movie by itself. The whole movie seemed to stretch out too long, but at the same time, it didn't seem long enough because it didn't explain enough. There wasn't a lot of suspense. I was expecting more.I was unimpressed with the young Hannibal - with his acting and the story. Certainly, he was a cold blooded killer, but he was no young Anthony Hopkins. He wasn't freaky enough. Nor did I buy his background story. There were literally millions of people that watched equally horrible things during World War II (well, maybe his story was in the top 10 percentile of horrible things that happened during that era), but I did not buy that these events spawned the creature that we have all known to love.A lot of people praised the French guy that played Hannibal. He was all right. I think they could have chosen better.I was glad to see that this movie was not overly gory. In the age of Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Hostel, this movie kept the violence level tasteful.</fullReview>

If I wanted to see a World War movie I would have watched Saving Private Ryan. If you have never seen the original three films you may like this. However, if you have seen the films leading up to this one, I hope that you agree that, while the main actor did an OK job, he does not resemble Anthony Hopkins at all!! They tried to explain so many things ? such as why he likes to eat flesh, why he is a psycho, his medical background ? and after viewing this 2 hour film ? the explanations were very weak. I was looking forward too, and eagerly awaiting this film. I am very disappointed, and I hope Anthony Hopkins is too. Hannibal Rising does no justice to the great directing and performances of the previous 3 films that led to this disaster. Don't bother with this one. On a scale of 1-10, this film deserves a negative 23. After seeing this movie, I would not even see it again for free!! In fact, I wish I could sue the cinema for my ticket price, my hourly wage, and the gas I used to drive to and from the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie felt like it lasted forever. i liked the lead and i like gong li. that was about it. it was dull. the blood was minimal. and i don't know what you people are saying about there being too much sex...cuz when i saw it there was none (and that is fine). i can't say that i am too surprised because hannibal was bad and so was red dragon (i did like silence of the lambs). i felt nothing for any of the characters in this movie. no emotional investment whatsoever. i was really excited about this movie, don't know why, but i was. sorely let down by it. i hope no one else pays for this movie. just wait for it to come out on DVD. don't pay the $8, it isn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film "Hannibal Raising" is one of the best films I've ever watched. This film show how an otherwise good man "Hannibal Lecter" turn into a monster/Cannibal/vampire.The acting was superb So was the story line. Hannibal Lecter the son of a prominent Lithuanian family experienced first hand the cruelty of the German/Soviet battle. His sister was murdered and cannibalized by partisans. He (Hannibal) was so traumatized by the murder of his sister Mischa that he went on to become a sort of avenging Angel and avenged his' sister's (Mischa's) death on those responsible. Though what Hannibal did was an overkill he succeed in making those responsible for his sister's death pay with the life /or limb.This film is a must see for all those of us who have watched "Silence of the Lambs" and it's prequels, and sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining-- and the young Lector did a good job. He was not Anthony Hopkins, but what could you expect? No one is Anthony Hopkins as tied into the collective consciousness with Lecter. The acting was still superb, and many of the quirks Hopkins brought to the character were duplicated or adapted for his younger self. I do admit during the whole movie I wondered how Lector, the conscienceless killer we know, is portrayed as merely a revenge story. I finally decided, however, that the movie hints beyond that. It is partly an element of his personality.. the same thing that brings some people from abusive backgrounds to be murderers or low-lives, and some to be exemplary people in real life. Also, they seem to show that Hannibal thinks of murdering the schoolmaster-- who seemed in the scene to treat Hannibal well. That implies that the vicious murders were not really revenge, so much as revenge was an excuse for the vicious murders Hannibal found himself prone to and desiring. Most serial killers fight their urges for some time before beginning to kill. This seems to be shown-- it just so happens Hannibal had somewhat of an excuse for his murders (if a flimsy one at times, such as the butcher.) to stop him from needing to fight the urge for too long. Also, it could be estimated that after killing several times, he realizes an intense excitement for it that exceeds merely the "satisfaction" of revenge--- and personal demons that do not go away with the completion of his revenge.It is not Silence Of The Lambs but it is better than Hannibal. Watch it without over-inflating your expectations, and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

I mean, I'd seen the trailers and knew that this movie is nothing more than Hollywood and Thomas Harris trying to squeeze every last ounce of milk out of the cash cow that is Hannibal Lecter. But even given the obvious reason$ for this film making it to theatres, the fact remains that there are a LOT of over the top scenarios and implausible situations. For example, when Hannibal goes after the main villain in his compound and is hiding in the steam room while the hostage girl shaves said villain-I mean, come on!! rub 2 brain cells together and try and figure out how the hell he was supposed to: Get into the compound past armed guards, into the house, rig up the exploding surgical glove in the (boiler room?), get into the bathroom before the villain and hostage girl, wait it out in the steamroom, etc, etc, etc..I mean, he's supposed to be super- intelligent but it makes it appear that he's "Magic Hannibal, Super Serial-Killer"..All I got to say is that Gong Li is desperately in need of a new agent...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Hannibal Rising' Will Not Stand the Test of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an unfortunate tendency in modern horror films to do anything, no matter how shameless, to get a reaction out of the audience. The premise of these films goes something like this: the more blood, violence, and gore, the better the movie. In reality the opposite is quite true. Alfred Hitchcock got it right with 'Psycho' and other talented directors have been able to successfully follow the formula of 'less is more.' The problem with films like 'Hostel,' 'The Hills have Eyes,' and now 'Hannibal Rising,' besides being truly awful, is that there's really no craft behind it. Anybody can come up with these stories because the stories are essentially irrelevant: it's all just a set up for another bloodbath.'Hannibal Rising' is the fifth entry in the wildly successful Hannibal Lecter franchise and it may turn out to be the final nail in the coffin. As a fan of the franchise I have to say that this latest effort is a huge disappointment. 'Hannibal Rising' is an adaptation of Thomas Harris' latest book which was released late last year to mixed reviews. The story is a prequel to the rest of the series and tries to explain Hannibal Lecter's origins, his childhood, and how he came to be a cannibalistic psychopath.The film begins in 1941 in the midst of World War II. The Lecter family, who own a castle in Lithuania and are assumed to be very wealthy, are trying to escape from the Nazis and from the horrors of war. Hannibal Lecter is a young child at this point and is established to be very close to his younger sister, Mischa. What happens next is one of those childhood traumatic events that tend to shape the outcome of the rest of one's life. Young Hannibal Lecter witnesses the death of his parents and then, to his horror, the death of his sister. Mischa Lecter's death is quite gruesome, so I will spare the details. Suffice it to say, Hannibal Lecter is exposed to cannibalism for the first time.The rest of the story becomes rather tedious and formulaic as it goes from Hannibal Lecter as a young child to Lecter as a young adult. After running away from home, Lecter comes to live with his aunt, the Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li). She takes an active interest in him, although it's never really explained why, and he goes off to medical school in France. The rest of the story is your standard revenge tale: the hero goes off to kill the people who hurt him as a child. To call this an anticlimax would be an understatement.Hannibal Lecter is played by newcomer Gaspard Ulliel (A Very Long Engagement) in an over-the-top performance that is simply all wrong. Where Anthony Hopkins was once subtle and restrained, Ulliel is trying too hard to look and act like a psychopath. He's always smirking and winking at the camera as if he wants to let us in on a little joke. There's no semblance of character transitions either. Hannibal Lecter goes from innocent young child to raging psychopath and cannibal in the blink of an eye. We never get any sense of what is going on inside his mind or what his motivations are. It doesn't help that the filmmakers and the screenwriter (Thomas Harris of all people) keep supplying him with lines like "you ate my sister," which comes across as unintentionally funny. Even more ludicrous is a scene in which, after having killed someone and stolen the guy's fish, Lecter smirks and says "yum." The great failure of 'Hannibal Rising' is that if fails to offer us any new insight into the character of Hannibal Lecter. It's not enough to say that he had a traumatic childhood and, therefore, he became a killer. Many people have experienced traumatic events as children without becoming psychopaths or murderers, certainly not to the extent of someone like Lecter. The film also lacks genuine moments of suspense. Instead it tries to set up scene after scene of blood and carnage, all of which quickly grows old. Whereas the great 'Silence of the Lambs' was grounded in realism, 'Hannibal Rising' is a three-ring circus.</fullReview>

Just acting out what we already heard is a big let down to fans. I speak for the people I know personally and the strangers outside the theater who complained when I say this. What we were hoping for was a little history lesson and a lot of insight into "head games" Hannibal played in his youth.A very poor scary film.On the positive side the movie was a great action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Rising Rises to the Occasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made Dr. Lecter kill and eat his victims? A large portion of that enigmatic question is answered in this latest chapter of the Hannibal Lecter saga. I say "latest" because after viewing this, it is my fervent hope that it isn't the last . After the film, I found myself wondering what Thomas Harris and Dino DeLaurentis have in store for Lecter-The Psychiatrist years.This film captures the tenebrous tension of the original film Silence of the Lambs. The musical score is comparable, the direction gripping. Gaspard Ulliel is compelling as the young, psychopathic and psychically damaged Hannibal Lecter. There have been reviews which assert that once the puzzle is revealed , as to how Dr. Lecter became the serial killer notorious, then he is no longer "scary". I offer that a wounded animal is far more dangerous than a sound one. Thomas Harris' carefully sculpted character is still the unique and terrifying anti-hero he's always been. This aspect shows Lecter vulnerable. Come closer?.closer please? Lecter is a "thinking person's criminal" whom some suspect has a soul (albeit a dark one). This film was an excellent homage to the making of the tormented beast/renaissance man/psychiatrist and the neophyte agent, innocent Clarice, who will later be Dr. Lecter's undoing.One fact of interest: The real serial killer Andrei Chicatillo (from Russia) was notorious for biting and eating from his victims. It is well documented that he lost his brother during the revolution and the famines which ensued. His brother was eaten by renegade soldiers. Does knowing that make the specter of Mr. Chicatillo less menacing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there may be spoilers here, I think (hope?) that they're minor enough not to ruin the movie for anyone.Had it not been a companion to the previous Hannibal movies, Hannibal Rising would probably be an average action flick. The movie is not terribly bad for an action movie, in itself. However, in the context in which it must be viewed, it's pretty bad. After seeing the movie, I was actually surprised to see that the screenplay was written by Thomas Harris. I think that it fits very poorly with the rest of the story.My biggest problem, I think, was that in SotL, Hannibal is a true villain. Yes, he helps Clarice, but he does so maliciously and with a narcissistic purpose. It is not the serial killer that sends chills up our spines; it is Dr. Lecter. By portraying him as a sympathetic young boy, who's experienced horrible tragedies and is out to avenge his young sister's gruesome death (by killing Nazis no less!), HR turns Hannibal from cold and sadistic villain to anti-hero. Indeed, even by the end of the movie, there is little to suggest that the young man we've spent a long two hours watching on the screen will grow up to be the brilliant, refined and coldly cruel Hannibal of SotL.Hannibal's poor character development is the movie's most glaring flaw. Of course, because the point of the movie is to elucidate the development of the Hannibal character, it fails at its primary purpose. There are other minor annoyances. The samurai training seems to be superfluous. I failed to grasp the relevance, other than to give a cheap shot of Hannibal wearing a mask similar to the one he wore in SotL (which, ostensibly, had been placed on him by the prison guards to keep him from biting, rather than by Hannibal himself to honor any kind of samurai tradition).I can't say that I'd recommend the movie to anyone who has seen or enjoyed any of the previous Hannibal movies. Someone who hasn't yet, might enjoy it, and I think that it would make the subsequent films seem even better than they are. But anyone who enjoyed Hopkins' character in previous films should steer clear of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, the reason people respond to this film with such hostility is that they are trying to compare it to Demme's "Silence of the Lambs". Well, of course it's not going to beat it. That film is a masterpiece. You need to look at the film ON ITS OWN. "Hannibal Rising" is no "Silence of the Lambs" or "Red Dragon", but very good none the less.I went in to the movie expecting another "Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning" or some other horrible "origin" horror movie. Instead, I got an interesting look at how Hannibal Lecter became the complete psychopath we witnessed as Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.What I was surprised at seeing, was that the film had a revenge plot. But, as you go through the (although overdone, basic) revenge plot, you can slowly see Hannibal becoming more insane.By the end of the film, you can tell that he has absolutely no regard for human life. It doesn't bother him to kill. And perhaps one of my favorite aspects from 'Silence of the Lambs' is in the film. Whether Lecter goes from calm, serene, seemingly normal to completely insane and violent.Again, if you go to watch this film, don't compare it to "Silence of the Lambs" or "Red Dragon" (if you're wondering why I leave out "Hannibal", it's because that movie was terrible). Think of it like a Godfather III. You can't compare it to the original masterpieces, so, take it on its own. Look at it as its own movie. Don't sit and think 'well, he's not as good as Anthony Hopkins'. Well, of course he isn't, but that's because no one is. Just take the movie by itself for what it is, and maybe you'll enjoy it to the level it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awful start for Hannibal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This extremely badly put together mess is supposed to show how the Hannibal Lecter we all know from 'Silence Of The Lambs' came into being. The story starts in 1944 when the retreating German army are crossing Lithuania pursued by the Russians.Hannibal and his family have escaped from their castle home to a small cabin. When a Russian brigade stop to take on water they're spotted by German bombers and Hannibals parents are killed leaving the young boy to fend for himself and his sister. They are discovered by looters and his sister is killed.Flash forward about ten years. Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) is now in a boys orphanage (which 'ironically' is set up in the old Lecter castle). Hannibal doesn't talk anymore and is the victim of bullying by the toughs of the institute. Escaping he makes his way across Europe, over the Berlin wall and into France, where he catches up with his aunt (played well by Gong Li). Sent to medical school he begins to plot his revenge against the men who killed his sister.This could have been a brilliant genesis story, where we see how an innocent boy is turned by events in his early life into the monster (albeit a charming one) we came to know in previous films. Where this film starts to go wrong is the rather bland way things are presented. There's blood alright, but a lot of the killings go by off camera. One of the better events happens early on after an incident in a market and is probably the one killing that sticks in the memory. As Hannibal butchers his way through the men that killed his sister there is an escalation in the brutality and sadism involved, but you don't actually see that much. I largely blame the awful writing and cackhanded directing for all the problems.The stand out actor (unfortunately for the film) isn't Gaspard Ulliel, but Gong Li as Hannibal's icy Japanese aunt.All in all a waste of time and film. Harris's script is slow and predictable, Peter Webber's directing plain amateur. Avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Able to entertain, its not memorable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a prequel to "Silence of the Lambs" and seeks to tell how the young Hannibal Lecter, affected by the dramatic events of World War II, became a dangerous cannibal. Directed by Peter Webber and written by Thomas Harris, this film has a cast headed by Gaspard Ulliel, Gong Li and Rhys Ifans.This film is not bad, but its too far from the success and quality of "Red Dragon" and "Silence of the Lambs". It cannot be analyzed as a horror film because never frightens us. Its closer to the thriller or police movies.It has a dubious script, which explains the reasons why Hannibal is what he is in previous films. This is its first problem: it want to transform a perfect villain in a dubious antihero. The idea simply does not stick with anything that the character will do in the movies played by Anthony Hopkins. The idea of &#x200b;&#x200b;inserting Japanese elements in the story also seems a wrong option, something that does not fit properly, despite the good acting of Li Gong.In fact, speaking of actors, she seemed to me the best performance of the film, discreet and elegant as called for her character. The actors who played the villains was reasonable. Gaspard Ulliel, in the leading role, is a casting error: although he managed to give its character lots of coldness and cynicism, he wasn't able to give it charisma and sense of taste, striking personality traits of Lecter that are quite visible in Hopkins movies.The film contains several intense action scenes with moments that may hurt some people's sensibilities, so be warned. Still, its far from violence and gore visible in "Hannibal". Its a film that focuses on action and romance, not on blood. The special, visual and sound effects are good and get better as we approach the end. The soundtrack seemed to be regular, fulfilling its role without stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfairly maligned prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Designed as a prequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (and MANHUNTER before it), this is a film that aims to show how Hannibal Lecter ended up as the human cannibal that we all know and fear. Many people criticised this film, arguing that familiarity breeds contempt and the more we learn about a killer's background and origin, the less frightening he becomes. They have a point, but they're also missing something: HANNIBAL RISING is a very well made and entertaining movie in its own right. My advice is to forget all about the connections with the later films and just enjoy this film on its own merits.It's a distinctly European film with a European sensibility and a young, French, unknown lead actor. It has a level of classiness that's not present in many an American film; a sheen of quality that sets it apart from the rest. The opening sequence, set in the latter days of World War 2 and detailing horrific events in Lithuania, is very well handled, full of foreboding, great effects, and sinister actions. It ably sets up the rest of the film, which turns out to be a revenge flick with the added intrigue of having the main character becoming more and more sick and twisted as the movie progresses.One thing that stands out is the quality of the cast. The unknown Gaspard Ulliel is weird and brilliant as the young killer, and you quite believe he's a sociopath. There's a romantic sub-plot that goes nowhere involving the lovely Gong Li (CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER) but it does serve to humanise the monster a bit. The ever-reliable Dominic West is also very good as the policeman investigating Hannibal's crimes, although his role is completely extraneous to the thrust of the film. The bad guys, too, are very well cast and all of them thoroughly despicable chaps: Kevin McKidd, Richard Brake, and in particular a cast-against-type Rhys Ifans all make an impact here.The violence that plays out is entertaining because the villains all deserve it: from the butcher slashed apart with a samurai sword to the guy strangled and eaten, these men are repulsive and their deaths well earned. Another highlight is that the film doesn't focus on the gore, either, not in a repulsive way like HANNIBAL; there's nothing stomach churning here. The cannibalism ends up as a sub-plot, really, not involved with the main film, but that didn't bother me too much. I enjoyed the pacing, the acting and the direction, and found all three of those elements assured and designed to entertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising (2007) * (out of 4) Prequel traces the early years of Hannibal Lecter who sees his killed during WWII but even more horror follows when his young sister is killed and eaten by some soldiers. Flash forward several years and Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel) seeks revenge against the men.HANNIBAL RISING was the fourth (and to date) and final film in the Lecter series that started with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and continued with HANNIBAL and RED DRAGON. Those three films were all box office hits and critical favorites but this film here seems to be one that nobody really wanted. I idea of doing a prequel to Lecter's early days was interesting but sadly there's not a single thing that works in this picture. I really, really hated this movie with a passion and I grew to hate it even more as its already long 130 minute running time went by.There were several problems that I had with the film including the fact that I just never thought this Lecter was believable in that he would turn into the Lecter of the previous three films. I thought Ulliel was pretty boring in the lead role and I just never believed we were watching a brilliant psychopath. Another problem I had with the film is that the story itself was just downright stupid. I mean, it's basically just a revenge picture but it's already weak story just keeps dragging along to the point where I was looking at the clock after ever five minutes.Even worse is the fact that there's just no energy, no passion and no scares to be found anywhere. I'm really not sure what Thomas Harris was thinking on this prequel but it's a complete and utter failure that doesn't have much going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Lecter rises from the wartime cauldron of Germany's Eastern front in Lithuania</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did Hannibal Lecter become the way he is as an adult? "Hannibal Rising" (2007) shows us how. It is a dark story and darkly filmed, bred on the Eastern front in Lithuania as World War II comes to a close and the Red Army bears down on Germany.The film has some notable faults, such as weak dialog at times and dragging out some scenes too long. Yet the wonderful performance of Gaspard Ulliel, the intrigue of the story, a fair amount of spectacle, the excellent set design and reproduction of the times and the lighting overcome these deficiencies, leaving us quite satisfied at the overall result. We understand Lecter. Furthermore, we can sense the continuity between the young adult Ulliel and the middle-aged man Anthony Hopkins. The story becomes rather simple and somewhat repetitive, a revenge story. This is at once a virtue and a fault. Without Ulliel's Lecter, the film would not work. Li Gong provided much needed balance. Beware. This movie is not for children or those who are repelled by cannibalism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We finally learn who Hannibal Lecter is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the Hannibal Lecter movies, I absolutely loved this one!We have seen Hannibal Lecter in action before. We saw his brilliant mind and his ability to predict his opponent's moves based on his knowledge of their instincts. We saw his lightning-quick animal reflexes that never hesitate and his lack of squeamishness while striking. We even saw him eat people.Yet, while we saw him psychoanalyze and get into the mind of his prey we never really did get into his mind.How did he get that way? Did he ever have a human side? And why does he eat people?In this movie, we finally see Hannibal's evolution from man to something that's a predator of Man. We understand the instincts. And, in a plot-twist that you won't be able to predict, you finally see the dark, horrible secret, you understand his instincts and what makes him tick. You finally see, and you won't be prepared for it.It's true that Gaspard Ulliel isn't Anthony Hopkins, possibly the best actor of our generation. Who is? But he carries the role well. Li Gong was worse - she seemed unnaturally tough. The character's clearly supposed to be "the angel that diverts the knife", in the Abraham analogy, and she failed the part. I'm not sure if that was her fault or the director's.These minor quibbles aside, this movie was a worthy chronological start to the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided this movie for years. After seeing "Hannibal" I had no interest in seeing how he became the monster he was. Alas, an Amazon Prime membership and down time at work drove me to "Hannibal Rising." I learned that I have a far greater affinity for young Hannibal than old Hannibal. Young Hannibal grew up in WW2 Europe. He went from affluence to fighting for his life due to the war. One particularly tragic event forever changed him.The actor chosen for Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) was excellent. He even had a sinister looking face the way the corners of his mouth curve upward in a Joker-esque manner made him able to sneer with ease. His acting left a little to be desired as his accent (or simply his manner of speaking) seemed forced. Also there was the dialog between him and Lady Murasaki (Li Gong). They constantly spoke in hushed romantic tones as if every word they exchanged was secretive or passionate. It came off as pretentious and grandiose as though they were the two most important or two most passionate people in the world.If we were to boil it all down, "Hannibal Rising" was a revenge story. Some people are fueled by love, some by hate, others by both. Hannibal was definitely fueled by both and it was his inability or unwillingness to not cross the line that made him Hannibal the cannibal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it does not have the vibe "The Silence of the Lambs" had, yes it is bloody and brutal, but that is the whole point, it doesn't need to be insanely complex or psychologically thrilling, this movie is meant to be completely different, this is what everybody was always curious about. We all loved Lecter and his mysterious presence, but for all these years nobody knew how he began his cruel ways, in this movie everything unfolds and it really adds to the franchise. So what that it is bloody? From what we have heard in previous films all of them would have needed to be as bloody as this one, since Lecter is considered to be an incredibly sick serial killer, who also, appears to be a cannibal and that is exactly what is showed here. In my opinion Gaspard Ulliel did an awesome job as Hannibal Lecter, he had the vibe of the older version of Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins, of course. This is a decent way to revitalize the franchise, so we are not out of hopes for seeing a sequel to 2001's "Hannibal", Lecter films are not quick to come out and are all in a strange order as we know, so this lays the ground for a new film, maybe in 2020? Who knows.Overall it is very entertaining, shows us what people were eager to know about Hannibal Lecter, his roots, reasons, etcetera. Delivers suspense for sure, isn't just a blatant killer movie, has decent acting. The only weakness in my opinion was how they decided to incorporate different countries here, but everybody seems to speak English fluently, even in 1952 Russia :D I know it sounds funny, but nonetheless, it is worth watching, that is the only notable flaw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The success of Silence of The Lambs was unexpected. What Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins achieved with that film surpassed all expectations. It prompted Thomas Harris to write more books and this film serves as a prequel to provide the back story of how Hannibal became the cannibal. The premise is that he is traumatised as a young boy from being imprisoned during the war where his young sister is feasted on by his captives. An older Hannibal seeks revenge on his former captives and gains this in numerous sadistic ways. The plot is weak, the acting mediocre and overall, this film lacks any sense. Rather than watching Hannibals feasting on humans, you are best off avoiding this film and dining out in style!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What made Hannibal the beast he was?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, director Peter Webber and author Thomas Harris bring us Hannibal Lector (ne: Lecter) the formative years. Off the bat you have to say it's not overtly a horror film, something which has proved to have annoyed many who ventured in expecting something different. Which on one hand is a shame because it's a very effective thriller, ripe with literary smarts and boasting some very good acting performances. While there is horrors around, genuine ones that history has taught us as fact.On the other hand it is a disappointment to fans of the Hannibal series, and to horror fans in general. The marketing didn't help, it was sold to all and sundry along the lines as the cannibal begins in earnest, thus nobody was quite prepared for the fact Hannibal was a normal kid once, even human! Once the pic kicks into being a revenge killer thriller, it lacks an emotional wallop, with the screenplay shaking too many eggs in the basket and not coming up with a tasty fava bean based omelet.Smart tech credits help to still further keep this out of stinkerville and above average, but the heavy feeling of missed opportunities and poor writing hangs heavy as the end credits roll. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for prequel to the masterpiece TV series(SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie got a lot of bad reviews but I, admittedly somewhat biased to anything Hannibal, really loved this movie. It was nice to finally have some back-story to how Hannibal became the "cannibal" or, if you will, the Chesapeake Ripper. You get to see Hannibal as a child with his little sister Mischa in all their innocence during a time of war. You get to see the things that transpired to transform Hannibal forever and the tail of revenge that no other Hannibal adaptation had previously touched upon. The biggest moment in this movie for me(SPOILER!!!)was when Hannibal's sister was taken away to be eaten by the starving soldiers and Hannibal revealed that he also ate the soup that contained bits of Mischa to stay alive and it was revealed that he was trying to not only get revenge for his sister's death but to silence all that knew his shameful secret, forever! This movie is a perfect fit for a prequel to the Hannibal TV show and the TV adaptation is the best one yet! They couldn't have possibly done it any better! Definitely 10/10. An instant masterpiece and must-see for all die-hard Hanibal fans!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good story that stands on it's own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the best way to enjoy of this movie is to think of it on it's own without the Silence of the Lambs in mind. Because as a story it is a very good WWII related historical thriller set in Lithuania and France. And the character of Hannibal is actually a sympathetic hero of sorts. You're on his side throughout the story since he has some justification and the retribution theme is surprisingly freshly done here. In that way it doesn't seem to gel with the later stories that much but that is because of the novels.I was not a Silence of the Lambs fan thought it mostly gross horror - so I didn't see Hannibal Rising till 2013 on DVD. In Hannibal Rising the violence isn't that graphic - you know when to avert your eyes. Cannibalism is there but it's not so in your face. Anyway the violence mostly has a feel good element that makes it more acceptable. Production is good. The historical European atmosphere and sets are authentic looking. Acting is good too. Gong Li is beautiful here and actually a useful as opposed to the usual helpless heroine with some goodness in her heart. Gaspard Ulliel is fascinating to watch just creepy enough yet sympathetic. Just have to put out of your mind that he could turn into Anthony Hopkins.Surprisingly good on its own - even for non Silence fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a writer decides "hey let's make the main character a ninja or something!" you know that the series has gone wrong. Also, like Hannibal and to a lesser extent Red dragon, the dialog seems allot cheesier and more clichéd. In Silence of the Lambs, you could feel Hannibal Lecter getting inside your head. In Hannibal Rising I see a young Hannibal Lector that reminds me more of an episode 2 Anakin Skywalker then the fearsome killer in Silence of the Lanbs. Perhaps the movie reflects the book well. I don't know because I haven't read it and that's something that others may wish to comment on. What I am seeing in this movie however is a shallow action film with long boring socialization that does little to develop the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie has a lot of problems, but would have been good on its own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>my main issue with it is that it doesn't match up to the character of Hannibal lecter that we know from silence of the lambs. this is the story of an angry revenge killer, and does not explain the sociopath that the later lecter is. it would be a completely different forensic profile. the kills in this movie are emotional. Hannibal's motives are emotional here, twisted, but coming from a place of love and loyalty.Yes, the actor sounds cold and mechanic perhaps to mimic an idea of the Hannibal we're already familiar with, but it really doesn't add it up in my opinion. He doesn't have the curiosity mainly.the other actors are much stronger and more interesting to watch, and the plot is alright. ALL in all. not a total waste of time but disappointing to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't think that this movie is a good explanation for the development of the Hannibal Lecter we saw in The Silence of the Lambs. It's more of an action movie and less concentrated on the psychological background. This whole revenge topic doesn't really get to me. I would say it is not a completely bad movie and the acting is good (I especially liked the young Lecter), but it just can't compete with the Silence of the Lambs. In my opinion, this movie should stand alone as a true Classic. Our own ideas of why Hannibal became Hannibal are probably much better. If you want to watch this movie, you should probably view it as a movie of its own and not compare it to the Silence of the lambs! The violence in the movie is, I would say, medium. Not appropriate for kids and young teenagers, but there is worse. All in all, I can't really give an recommendation and stick with 6 points!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite Gaspard Ulliel being very pretty to look at, he just doesn't strike me as Hannibal Lecter. Anthony Hopkins is the ideal Lecter but I'm damned sure there were other actors from which to choose for this role. Nevertheless,he was cast and he made damn well of it. Gong Li. I'm not familiar with her but her face remained so frozen. NO expression sometimes. The visuals are striking but nothing we haven't seen before.yes this film provides plenty of macabre for the blood-lusty viewers. at some point we forget that this is the story of Hannibal lecter. the cannibalistic psychologist who saw to Clarice starling and will graham. there's a precise something that fails to link this film with the others before it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In short: A good film with a great Lecter = A flawed but worthy addition to the franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a great fan of the books and of Hopkins' Lecter I must admit I was one of those people who was becoming increasingly hard to impress. So, when I picked this film up from the shelf and cast my sceptical eye across the front and back cover, I admit I was expecting little more than a cheap and shallow hash job.I was wrong. This is a damn good film! Hannibal Rising is the story of how everyone's favourite psychopath came to be the monster we all know and (oddly) love. Expecting a gore fest is a mistake, the violence involved in each death increases as Hannibal descends into madness. Pinpointing the various mental stages Lecter goes through in this way really does build an intensity that you feel with full force come the final showdown.OK, so it has it's faults. I will knock a star or two off for a few things; a few snippets of dialogue that are cheesy or unnecessary, the odd moment where the pace feels sluggish and the fact that although the actors are all talented and play their parts well enough, they are all carried by an unexpectedly stellar performance by Ulliel. But there is a genuine beauty to this film, the scenery is perfect for the mood being laid out, the plot is intriguing and taboo without having to sink to shock tactics or cheap scares and the atmosphere wraps itself around you and slowly tightens it's coils. Not only that but, as always, the internal struggle between love(?) and hate for Lecter hits hard as you find yourself willing him onward in his murderous plight.I think the real winner of this film however was the thing I was originally most wary of. Anthony Hopkins will forever be the Lecter boffin's actor of choice and there is no denying that Hopkin's owned the part in his day. But in watching this film you MUST leave that favouritism at the door. Gaspard plays Lecter with passion and a great understanding of the role, everything from his tone of voice and the subtle expressions that cross his face to the air in which he carries himself has Hannibal Lecter written all over it. Gaspard has taken small snips from Hopkins' original performance and used it to garnish his own take on Lecter, giving the audience a familiarity that makes his performance as the younger Lecter all the more believable.Overall I am giving this movie an 8/10. In truth it's a 7.5 but I will round up because this film had a lot of snobbery riding against it. You will not be given guts and gore with this film and you will not be given cheap gratification but you will most certainly be given a Lecter and a story that is well worth your time and attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Back Story On Hannibal Lecter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising is the fifth and final film to feature Dr. Hannibal Lecter. It is a prequel to Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.It is an adaptation of Thomas Harris'novel of the same name and it narrates he story of Lecter's evolution into the infamous serial killer and explores the early life of well-read psychopath.It stars French actor Gaspard Ulliel,who portrays the young Hannibal Lecter, together with Chinese actress Gong Li. Hannibal Rising travels back in time to World War II-era Lithuania, where an impressionable, well-to-do young boy named Hannibal was forced to watch helplessly as his family was massacred and his young sister suffered a terrifying fate at the hands of desperate, famished soldiers. After seeking temporary shelter at the Soviet orphanage that was once his family's home, Hannibal later flees to Paris in search of his long- lost uncle. Though his uncle has passed away, his uncle's beautiful Japanese widow, Lady Murasaki,warmly accepts the frightened orphan into her home. But even the love and kindness of this generous stranger isn't enough to calm the raging storm that is brewing inside this troubled young boy. Plagued by nightmares and determined to seek vengeance on the murderous war criminals who brutalized his family, the profoundly disturbed but academically gifted Hannibal enrolls in medical school in order to hone the skills that will allow him to exact horrific justice - killing and eating his enemies.The movie has great locations.Peter Webber did a good job in directing the film.But what makes the movie poor is the story.It barely explains Hannibal's development of his cannibalistic attributes.I do believe that having a psychological problems and experiencing trauma isn't enough.Providing justice does not make it realistic nor plausible.At the same time,the performances in the movie were decent.But overall,the film does not give justice on the development on the character of Hannibal Lecter - a Hollywood iconic character in cinema.I think that the author Thomas Harris and the scriptwriters did not do enough research to explain fully the man and the character behind Lecter.In the process,this movie throws away the greatness of the other films in the Hannibal Lecter series.Overall,this is the the worst movie of the series behind The Silence Of The Lambs,Red Dragon and Hannibal.</fullReview>

This film, fortunately, doesn't try to make his behavior justified.Some of the actors here are decent, even Gaspard Ulliel playing Hannibal is good. But the idea of exploring a former war wasn't the best option for it. People who watch this kind of movie is looking for things different from war.It's a shame that the director over longed this movie.

It is done with skill and knowledge. There is much to distinguish this movie from others that attempt to show the underpinnings of the characters of epilogues. I would place this movie in the line of the Star Wars movie prologues. I have watched this movie several times and it has great staying power.

		<shortDescription>The Curse of Prequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with prequels is that how you imagine the character came to be is always more interesting than how any production team can portray it. Much like Darth Vader, Hannibal Lector is diminished by being played by a younger actor.So the plot is that Hannibal LEctor witnesses his sister being eaten by a group of SS Deserters in WWII, and his mind becomes unbalanced. Adopted by his hot Japanese aunt, played by Gong Li, he learns how to use violence effectively. There's also a clever policeman to provide a threat to him... and the kind of cat and mouse game we saw in the earlier movies without anyone as interesting as Anthony Hopkins...The scenes with Gong Li, who is really hot for a woman in her 40s, are a little troubling. She seems to vacillate between encouraging Hannibal's actions, discouraging them, and then trying to seduce him. Hannibal "Rising" indeed.The way that they've always made Hannibal an acceptable character. (The guy's a cannibalistic serial killer, after all!) is by giving him adversaries who were largely worse than he was. So he is either trying to evade them, kill them or help the police catch them. It's kind of manipulative, really.The movie has some fun moments, and frankly what annoyed me was that the prudes never followed through with a sex scene involving Li. Instead, we got a lot of tease, no delivery. No wonder Hannibal went nuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not a feel-good movie by anyone's standards with the possible exception of the protagonist. It was set as the prequel to the uber-famous Silence of the Lambs and if you've seen that one, then you understand that whatever happened to Mr. Lecter in his youth was not Disney fodder. I have a pretty weak stomach for graphic gore but while it was quite clear what had been done to the victims in the movie, I had very few issues with the representation thereof as far as queasiness goes. Only the final murder scene transgressed into unwarranted levels of depiction. Despite not having any big names in the cast, the acting was quite good, I felt. Gaspard Ulliel was very believable in what must have been a difficult role as the older child-Hannibal although I must admit I was struck by the physical differences between he and Anthony Hopkins who plays the elder Hannibal in Silence and later Red Dragon. His aunt, played by Gong Li was also quite believable although the writers did not need to add the physical manifestation of their mutual attraction for us to see the effects of that relationship on the future cannibal's personality in my opinion. Some of the support cast, most notably the "bad guys" were a bit weak as they took turns being the next victim. I must admit it was kind of hard figuring out what to hope for as the movie went on. They made Hannibal's intended victims very deserving of societies disapproval but does that mean we want Hannibal to actively pursue his revenge? The story did not provide your classic good vs bad; it was more like monstrous versus diabolical. All told it was about a 7.5 for me. Worth a rental but choose carefully with whom you watch it.But that's just my two scents. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable standalone film but let down by Harris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Thomas Harris' intriguing novel, Hanibal Rising is an unnecessary prequel.Where Brain Cox portrayal was forgotten, Hopkins made the character of Hannibal the Cannibal Lector his own toping the lists of fictional villains. The casting director and filmmaker's fail to remember or ignored the publics love for Hopkins portrayal and overlooked that inevitable comparisons were going to be drawn. This hampers Gaspard Ulliel version of Hannibal Lecter from the outset.As a standalone film it is interesting watching a young Hannibal during World War II plotting revenge on those responsible for his sister's death. However, Thomas Harris' screenplay is clunky. With a slow build up to the first kill, Peter Webber direction is acceptable, however, the film suffers from a low budget feel in places despite the impressive opening scenes.Brit actors Rhys Ifans, Richard Brake and the talented Kevin McKidd give notable performances. Sadly the whole film rests on Gaspard Ulliel's Lecter and because of his mannerisms, accent and expression not emulating Hopkins it is difficult to connect with him.Should a younger Hopkins had been mimicked, this could have spawned squeals. However, the producers tried to start with a clean slate but fall short as they set Ulliel has an impossible task of creating a young Hannibal rising that so detached from Hopkins. And while the character was still fresh in the viewers mind from Red Dragon (2002) Ulliel is just not exceptional enough to make that break. As an entry to a successful franchise it oddly is more entertaining as a standalone film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best but not the worst on Hannibal series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Hannibal Rising" Hannibal Lecter's story is told way before the events portrayed in "Red Dragon", "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Hannibal" (in this particular order). Here we have the chance to know how Hannibal become a cannibalistic and intelligent killer by observing horrible facts that happened during his childhood and his first murders on his teenage years. Gaspard Ulliel plays the young Hannibal taking Anthony Hopkins famous role but not his magnificence. What most viewers complained about this film is simply because it wasn't involving like the other Hannibal movies or shocking like "The Silence of the Lambs"; others complained about how this film ruined a great character. It is very difficult not to make such comparisons but if you judge the movie by itself you'll see a different point of view over this sinister character. Here the villain of the previous films is the hero; he only gets revenge on those who made his life worse; he's twisted but you understand why (and perhaps that might be the problem since Lecter is not meant to be fully understood); and his transformation from a orphan into a medicine student (but what about Psychology?). My problem with this film was the excess of exaggerations in some moments (although it wasn't so violent, it could've be more); too many unexplained things; and of course the major problem was a more interesting approach over such charismatic and evil character, the psychological look into the mind of this complex figure, I mean, he gets revenge on the people who killed his sister okay I understand, but it doesn't add much to the fact of all the other killings in the posterior events of the other films. So this brilliant and psychotic man simply become addicted to killing and eating his victims? Sounds very hazy to be explained as a possible motive. Perhaps a (who knows?) 5th film explain a few things more. Compared to the other films this one is not that bad. It places below "Red Dragon" (both 1986 "Manhunter" and 2002 version) and "The Silence of the Lambs" (the greatest of all), but it stands above Ridley Scott's "Hannibal" (very weak). But that's just my opinion. And the thing that amazes me is that Thomas Harris the creator of Hannibal's novels is the writer of this film and not even that was enough to make a excellent movie, it is good but there were too many things missing.Ulliel is not Hopkins but he manages to do a great job here, very frightening resembling some of Hannibal's famous skills and mannerisms. Also stars Gong Li, Rhys Ifans (the real villain of the film) and Kevin McKidd.A good step but not much suitable for Lecter's die hard fans. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I was shocked to see how low the ratings are for this movie. I was actually really impressed with the film and how it played out. It had the suspense of the rest of the Hannibal films, yet in a new direction, in a haunting way. It's really creepy to witness the origin of a monster. It stuck with me. It's cool to connect the mannerisms, thoughts, and actions of the elder Hannibal with the developing Hannibal.The actor, Ulliel, who plays the young Hannibal is excellent. He really scared me. Sometimes the faces he made gave me chills. His dialogue and presentation of such was frightening. He's a really cute guy, but he scared the hell out of me. I was kinda confused about the point of the Li Gong's character's involvement in Hannibal's life. Were they lovers or just close because they both suffered immense tragedy? I think it was the latter, but I'm not sure. The emotional side of the movie was prevalent and strong. There was a huge theme of tragedy throughout the film that truly reached me. It's weird, because you know that everything Hannibal does in this movie is wrong, yet at the same time you understand a little why he had the compulsion to do it. It had a really interesting plot that was enjoyable to view.It had the gore of the other Hannibal films, it had the complex torture scenes. It had the creepy villains and the terrifying dialogue..all the ingredients of the other films that made them so delicious. ;) I think it was a great movie. I really want to buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HANNIBAL RISING ? CATCH IT ( C+ ) Hannibal Lecter is such an Iconic character that everyone wanted to know what made him the infamous serial killer Hannibal Lecter. The movie starts off really well and the reason behind Hannibal violent nature was quite strong but sadly the director ruined everything later on by putting same mediocre killing methods with flawed screenplay. All we know that Hannibal Movies have their own league and they are really captivating and hardcore. But this time it looked like a typical revenge movie, which was weird. I was amazed how the inspector was 100% sure that Hannibal Lecter is the killer the moment he sees him. After that he is everywhere in Gong Li's house, in Hannibal's room and then in hospitable. It was just too much! I have become huge fan of Gaspard Ulliel but sorry to say he couldn't completely pull off the Hannibal lecter legacy. He was scary indeed but there is an edge and mysteriousness around Anthony Hopkins (Original Hannibal Lecter) which was lacking here. Still Gaspard Ulliel gave his best and his expressions during killing were worth watching. Gong Li was good but not as strong as Hannibal lector's movies leading ladies have been whether Jodie Foster, Julianne Moore and Emily Watson. Overall it was a little disappointment in the end because of bad characterization and poor direction &amp; screenplay. Still there were moments which were really haunting specially shot between young Lector and his sister.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This site is becoming more and more common nowadays. Just for money, with little regard for acting or plot, Hollywood will sadly continue to make countless prequels and sequels to classic and cult films, it is not a new thing, and it will never stop, as long as someone gets extra money, it will always happen.'Hannibal Rising' is a perfect example of this. The plot was a bit random, and there was little structure, the young Hannibal runs across Communist run Eastern Europe (how was he not caught by the Soviets, I don't know), and then he gets into a Medical school, with little education as far as we can see behind him. There are so many flaws in the plot, it is the equivalent of driving on a road full of potholes.The film is just another below average horror/thriller. And I saw this because of the over use of violent scenes, and how the acts of violence where carried out (a Catana sword?). If you compare this to 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991) there was really not that much violence, if you compare it to 'Hannibal Rising' and the acting in 'The Silence of the Lambs' is of the highest quality.if you are a fan of the many 'Hannibal Lector films' by all means watch it, but it is a shame to see what could of been a decent film wrecked by poor acting, a poor plot, and and over use of violent scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You ate my sister"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether the fact that Gaspard Ulliel chooses not to adopt any of the characteristics Anthony Hopkins used as Hannibal Lecter to such effect is a good thing or not. None of us is the finished article in our youth, so in that respect Ulliel is right not to mimic Hopkin's glacial manner too closely (although there are hints every now and then), but it's for this reason that I felt I wasn't really watching a Hannibal flick. Instead, Hannibal Rising comes across as just another revenge film, albeit one with a reasonably original location.The film attempts to reveal the reasons Lecter became the cannibal we all love, and it is a reasonably entertaining and well-written story, even though it follows a fairly routine path and falls foul of all that is bad about the genre. One of the reasons Silence of the Lambs was so successful was that it satisfied two different types of audience: the visceral horror seduced the hard-core horror fans while those seeking something a little more cerebral could enjoy the psychological aspects of Lecter's duel with Clarice Starling. That cat-and-mouse aspect of the original has diminished with each sequel so that, with Hannibal Rising, we get plenty of the former but precious little of the latter.The film's production values are good ? this is no cheap rip-off of the franchise ? although great care seems to have been taken to avoid showing too much period detail (the film is set in the early fifties in Europe). Gaspard Ulliel looks as unlike Anthony Hopkins as it is possible for any person to look, but he brings a certain sinister quality to the role which is at least in keeping with the character. The problem is, as with many of these type of films, he appears virtually invincible, superhuman, as he single-mindedly eliminates the men who ate his sister one by one so that, even when the screenplay places him in jeopardy, you are in no doubt that he will escape ? maybe because he has a four-foot samurai sword secreted down the back of his jacket (and would therefore surely need five-foot long arms to enable him to slip it from its scabbard without snagging it on his coat or inadvertently lopping his own head off) or because he has painstakingly timed how long it will take acid to drip through a glove (drip, mind you, even though it hisses and burns the metal on which it lands) in case he needs a diversion when captured by his nemesis.Try not to think too much about this film once you have watched it and your memory of it will probably be a lot more forgiving than if you begin to reflect on what you have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal not frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well well, the millennium was the start of a new genre in the scene, let's make a remake or a prequel. We had so many prequels and mostly they failed, TCM the beginning didn't make any sense, Batman begins had in fact nothing to do with the comics, exorcist prequel was a flop and we can go on and on. So after the success of Silence of the Lambs they made Hannibal. It was part two of Lector but the killings were exaggerated and unbelievable, remember the eating of the brain. Red Dragon was a kind of prequel and failed, you better watch Manhunter. So they made another prequel, Hannibal rising. It's a good movie on his own but again, why solve the reason why he's a madman. Let the people use their own imagination. Luckely is the actor who plays Hannibal believable. Why he's a cannibal is explained here, but why he became a killer isn't. Of course it's a mainstream flick and the gore is on low profile. As I said, it's okay to watch it on his own, if you would like to know more, buy Manhunter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Film in Hannibal Lecter Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a huge fan of the character of Hannibal Lecter for years; I still consider Jonathan Demme's "The Silence of the Lambs" one of my top favorite movies of all time. I've read all of Thomas Harris's books and enjoy the movies (though I'm not a huge fan of Michael Mann's "Manhunter"). Being such a fan, I was truly disappointed by the latest addition to the Hannibal Lecter canon. The film begins in 1944 Lithuania with an eight-year-old Hannibal living with his family in their estate. The fighting of World War II drives them from their home to their hunting lodge, where Hannibal's life is forever changed by the actions of a group of war looters. The story follows Hannibal as he grows and eventually seeks revenge.While all of the previous films were tense thrillers, this film feels more like a generic revenge plot. For some reason, this movie just didn't have the same vibe as any of the previous. Rather than a suspenseful game of cat-n-mouse, this movie chugs along a predictable path from beginning to end. Even the "big revelation" at the end of the film can be seen coming a mile away. Not only does the story feel generic and predictable, but the pacing is depressingly slow. At 130 minutes, it's already a bit long but the movie crawls along at a snail's pace for most of the runtime.Despite some annoying flaws, the film does manage to entertain a bit. It was nice getting a glimpse into what created the monster we've come to love, though I thought the kendo/samurai training felt out of place. The scenes in which Hannibal disposes of those who ruined him were some of the best in the movie. As for performances, they were generally hit-or-miss. Rhys Ifans, while a bit over-the-top, was the most entertaining as the leader of the war profiteers Vladis Grutas. We also get some fine work from Gong Li and Kevin McKidd, but most of the other cast failed to really impress me. I wasn't a huge fan of Gaspard Ulliel in his performance as a young Hannibal Lecter. He didn't come across as believable in the role. Instead of feeling as if I'm watching a young Hannibal, I felt more as if I was watching someone doing a halfway decent Hannibal impression.Seeing as how Thomas Harris released the novel right around the same time the movie was released, this whole deal sounds like it was thrown together for a quick buck. It doesn't feel as if the same heart and time were put into the story as any of the other films. It does NOT feel like a Hannibal Lecter film, but it is a mildly entertaining revenge drama regardless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannibal Rising" is the background story of the most terrifying antagonist in American literature. The movie sticks close to the novel. This is a great prequel.Hannibal Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel) was a child during World War II. His family was killed and his sister was cannibalized by barbaric Nazi soldiers. He is coming back for revenge.Hannibal is traumatized by the events that he witnessed. He soon leaves a workhouse and goes to live with his beautiful aunt, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). She helps him recover and soon he becomes the youngest person to ever be admitted to the medical school in France but he still has a "taste" for revenge. Hannibal Lecter won't forgive them until they are dead.Gaspard Ulliel's portrayal of America's favorite cannibal is amazing. He doesn't quite match up with Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox but he is believable as a young counterpart to the character. Gong Li broke my heart. The supporting cast is also good. If you want to complete the legacy of Hannibal "Hannibal the Cannibal" Lecter, you must see this, and this is also written by the "father" of Lecter, Thomas Harris.The acts the young Hannibal carries out just gave me chills. He kills six men in vicious fashions. Just unbelievable. It is fascinating to watch this intelligent human being becoming the vicious cannibalistic monstrosity.I do not see what was so terrible about the film. The negative reviews are very misleading. Nobody else could go as close as BECOMING what Hopkins portrayed as Gaspard Ulliel.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a typical revenge film starring a famous character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one problem with this film is it portrays Hannibal the Cannibal's transformation into a serial killer as being based on revenge instead of just wanting to feel the power of killing, which is how he is portrayed in the Silence of the Lambs. Killing based on revenge makes it much easier to get caught and Hannibal is to brilliant for that.The movie starts with a young Hannibal. He sees his parents killed in the war and his sister is eaten by soldiers for survival. He is saved by the Russian soldiers, but is scarred for life. He escapes an orphanage and tracks down his Japanese Aunt in France. Hannibal is now a young man whom is in medical school, but needs to track down his sister's killers and seek revenge. He finds them one by one and kills them in evil, gruesome ways. His Aunt knows what he's doing when he kills a local that harassed her. But she protects him, perhaps because all her family is dead too.So, the rest of the movie is more or less a revenge film with some extra bits such as Hannibal tearing flesh and eating it. However, it was silly when he writes an M on that guys chest. That was hokee.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK for a revenge film. Just don't expect to see the brilliant Lecter as he is portrayed in Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Razzie's nominated this film as the worst excuse for a horror movie. It wasn't a horror movie at all, but a tale of revenge upon men who committed a murder.One could even say that they didn't commit murder, but only did what was necessary to survive. One could, but they enjoyed it too much to forgive them.Gaspard Ulliel (Paris, je t'aime) was utterly convincing and fascinating at the young Hannibal Lecter. He was cold and calculating in his dispatch, as one would expect from someone who has had his greatest love stolen by barbarians.Li Gong (To Live, Zhou Yu's Train, The Curse of the Golden Flower), as the Aunt who might have been reprising a titled work, Operation Cougar, as she seemed to have the hots for her nephew, was magnificent, Her beauty was ever present font and center, and her performance was simply incredible.A fascinating story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, this makes you understand Hannibal even more. Why he is like he is, why he did the things he did and so on. One of the greatest thing about this movie is Gaspard Ulliel. He's fantastic, I mean it can't be easy to try to be as good as Anthony Hopkins. I think he did a fabulous job, no one could have done it better.This movie is about Hannibal Lecter when he was young. He went through a lot off stuff during the war, that's quit disturbing. After living at an orphanage during a long time he escaped. He later found his uncles wife and lived with her. He fell in love with her in some kind of odd way, because it's hard to think that Hannibal Lecter could fall in love. But then he seeks revenge for the ones who killed his sister. After a while he almost tour around to find out and kill the ones who took the only thing he had at that age, his sister.I think the story is interesting even though it's kinda weird sometimes, but no movie is perfect and this one i close. I really hope there will be another movie with Gaspard Ulliel playing Hannibal Lecter. I think it's strange when people give this movie crap, I mean what's wrong? It's not supposed to be like the other movies, this is about who he was before. Well, this movie is great anyway so if you haven't seen it you really should, because it's great. It's not very scary or so, but it's very deep in some kind of way that I can't explain. I almost cried when I saw how trapped he was in himself (Hannibal), how disturbed he was in as smart way. I'm very emotional so I guess that didn't happen to many people.Don't miss this movie, even if you haven't seen the other Hannibal Lecter movies. Then this is an easy start. The movies came in a backwards way or something, hm. Well, it's absolutely great! One of my favorites!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal? Is that you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken by itself "Hannibal Rising" is an above average film with great cinematography, decent acting, and a good storyline. A story like this however has a lot not only to live up to, but also to build upon, and in this regard it is often hard to recognize this Hannibal from cannibal we've all grown to love.The most positive point of this film is that we get to understand Hannibal's fragile psyche through the tragedies of his early life, the death of his sister in particular. This moment gave him both motive to become the killer we know as well as exposing him to canibalism for the first time.What we don't understand from this film is why he chose canibalism as a way of life. This is a revenge film, and it's never clear why after he completes his revenge Hannibal continues his path of murder. It is implied that simply no humanity is left, but at no point in the picture is Hannibal interested in taking innocent lives, and so one has to wonder how he choose to do that later.Also present his Hannibal's early life in Medicine. To compliment that we would expect to get a taste of his love for language, but that is never seen ether. The poetic Hannibal who is smart and manipulative never shows up in this film, and it's hard to believe that this soft spoken boy becomes the outlandishly clever man who was locked in a basement with Clarice.What is present however is perhaps the genesis of Hannibal's later love for Clarice. Taken out of context Clarice might very well represent Hannibal's need for an adult version of his sister, and may well have played that part in his later life. I appreciated seeing that as it does give a bit of a boost in meaning to Clarice's role in the early films, and answers the question of why he felt so attached to her.Overall this is a slightly better than average film, but the flux in continuity of character is a bit hard to swallow. I knock it down a point on that alone. The better points of the film are to be expected, however they were done very nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as good as Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs but as good as Red Dragon. I read the novel and confess that I did not like it very much. There were strange and pointless subplots and the structure was all over the place. What Hannibal Rising the movie tries to do is get the structure right and cut out some of the unnecessary subplots and twists and to a certain extent it succeeds and to a certain extent it fails. I actually liked the movie better than the book quite frankly but it was close. Gaspard Ulliel was very good as Hannibal but he didn't match up to the bar set by Anthony Hopkins who will always be the best. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful in this movie. I really think this movies tries hard to be something special but it is restricted by the source material which is sad because Peter Webber put some great ideas into this movie. The only bad thing about this movie is the ending where they play childish music, really suits the mood, not. I would still recommend it though you should read the novel first otherwise it gets a bit confusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising is a pretty good movie. If I was 15 years old today, meaning I had never seen Manhunter, or even Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal or Red Dragon, I would say that this is a very decent horror movie come character study.If I have a few issues with it, they would be the following.Not enough of Hannibal's personality and his interaction with his sister, which was made the his motivating factor from Hannibal onward, were delved into as deeply as in the book. Hannibal's almost autistic focus on his senses, or his creation of memory palaces was not delved into at all, which is a shame. It needn't have lasted more than a minute, but it would have revealed a lot about the psychology that writer Thomas Harris created.Then, shooting the movie in England, when every low budget action movie heads straight for Eastern Europe, makes no sense. They could have achieved a much greater sense of authenticity if they had shot in the Baltics, and used Eastern European actors. The English accents of the actors immediately transport you back to the Hammer House Of Horror productions.Then, there was the mask, which he wasn't outfitted with until his transport in Silence Of The Lambs.On the plus side, there is the wonderful Gong Li, who has no problem portraying very strong female characters. Lady Murasaki seems as tough and, in her own way, twisted as Hannibal. She has the best line in the movie. When presented with a butcher's head and the police approach, she replies - "Quickly Hannibal, they will call it murder".Overall, if you are relatively unaware of the great movies that were Manhunter and Silence Of The Lambs, this is a pretty good movie when standing on it's own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The book is much better!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prepare yourself for a minor disappointment if you read the book before watching the movie. If you haven't read the book, it is pleasant movie to watch. Although, it has some "empty spaces". How did Hannibal knew how to draw that good? How did Lady Murasaki fell in love with him? How did he enter Grutas house? These questions are all answered if you read the book. But these "mistakes" were made because the movie in my opinion is the book played in fast forward skipping and jumping some important information. Even the story line is not 100% like the book's and this does not help the movie. There is Hannibal's interest in arts that is missing. There is also one scent where you could giggle at what Hannibal invented to go into Grutas house. He also got information about his sister's killers in other ways that are not shown in the movie. There is his love growing for his uncle's widow missing in the movie. This leave another side of Hannibal's complex character left out. Even Hannibal kid attitude is missing. Mr.Poppil's character in reality is much more important, as he is a trigger for Hannibal's action in some way. After all this critic I have to say that young Lecter actor becomes more convincing through out the movie and this was a very hard task and his predecessor, Anthony Hopkins had become Hannibal! If I were you I would wait for the DVD because it's not really worth the cinema ticket money. In the mean time I would read the book! Enjoy it either way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Hannibal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer is obvious: the name sells. But not with the greatest stretch of imagination can I, for one, connect the "young Hannibal" in this movie to the subtle, unpredictable, elusive and super intelligent character so unforgettably portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. What we have here is an average revenge yarn. By saying "average" rather than "mediocre", I am giving this movie due credit. But it certainly is nowhere near the "Hannibal" league.Yes, there are attempts to link, but only on a very superficial level such as the background of a medical student. And the reason for Hannibal to turn cannibal is not only superficial, but also unconvincing. As a run-of-the-mill revenge yarn, however, this movie has all the ingredients: a devastating, tremulous childhood experience, a justice-conscious cop that is always trying to stop the vigilante, mouse-turned-cat routine, rescue of damsel-in-distress routine and, of course, sweet (apology for choice of word) revenge. The "blood thirsty" (another apology) segment of the audience would probably be reasonably satisfied, but who am I to know? If you have seen Gaspard Ulliel in "A very long engagement" (2004), you know that this young French actor is good. But the banal script of "Hannibal rising" does not give him much scope, despite the potential opportunities. Playing Hannibal's mentor, a widowed aunt and a Japanese women who is no stranger to the samurai sword, is GONG Li who is always a pleasure to watch, in more ways than one. The chief villain is played by Rhys Ifans who was quite impressive in "Enduring love" (2004). Playing the good inspector is Dominic West whom I remember most from "A midsummer night's dream", the delightful 1999 version."Hannibal rising" is the sort of movie that you can take or leave without losing much either way. The "prologue" (nearly half an hour) is a bit long and image from Hannibal nightmarish recollection is overused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem is, he "just needs to get more fun out of life"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main flaw of the film can be summed up in two words: Gaspard Ulliel. Notice the I say "flaw" as opposed to "problem", as by no means is Ulliel an awful actor, he's just not Dr. Hannibal Lecter. I realise that this is Lecter in his younger years, and maybe not as ruthless and cunning as he is to become later, but this seems inconsistent in 'Rising'. Sometimes Lecter is fantastically cunning, the fork in the hand of the man who attempts to slap him (in the trailer) is very Lecter-like, using an everyday object as a means of harm. But later in the film, he does something as stupid as not looking around a room. It's just not "him". Gong Li does well as Lady Murasaki, though her performance again is oddly inconsistent at different stages of the film. Dominic West as Inspector Popil is largely a sympathetic character, which he plays well, but he is certainly underused. The ones that stand out in the film really, are the Nazis who kill little Mischa. You can see just why they haunt Hannibal's dreams, and are truly vile characters, and Hannibal's revenge on them is "righteous" in his own way. This film is truly difficult to rate. As part of the Hannibal saga, it's not great, even verging on poor. As a revenge flick in the vein of "Lady Vengeance", it is quite good, but nothing groundbreaking. It will by no means disappoint viewers, but it is distinctly average, and worst of all offers no "real" insight as to how Hannibal becomes who he is in "The Silence of the Lambs".6/10 Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will first make it clear that when taken as a film on its own, Hannibal Rising is not bad, but as a Hannibal film I was horribly disappointed. It had so much potential; one of (if not THE greatest) characters in film, explained on screen for all to see; written by Thomas Harris the creator of said character; from the initial trailer it didn't look like much could go wrong, how off my first perceptions were.I do understand and sympathise with Gaspard Ulliel; following Hopkins is not a job I can imagine anybody wanting, but I find it hard to excuse his performance based on this. Ulliel's Hannibal lacked the substance of Hopkin's Hannibal; he reduced an intelligent, suave, precise, calculating character into one ruled entirely by emotion; an animal and Hannibal is so much more than this. Hopkin's was so successful because the killing was merely a by-product of his character not the driving force. People argue that this was before he learnt to control his urges, when he WAS an animal, bit that does not fit with Hopkin's portrayal, you don't just learn to control something like that it consumes you; it is either the prominent feature, or it is controlled; there is no fluctuating in-between.It is possible of course that this was not Ulliel's doing, but I find it difficult to think that Harris doesn't understand Hannibal. The actions in this film however, suggest this. The revenge spree that Hannibal goes on considering the murder of his sister would fit with any other character, but not Hannibal; revenge in his terms should be subtle, as with Mason in Hannibal; the class of tempting Mason's helper into murdering him, before Hannibal leaves the pig pit is seen as a momentary plus in his mind, not the driving force.The film's direction, use of mise-en-scene and sound were all fine (nothing exceptional, but nothing terrible either). The film as a whole was working well until it turned into a revenge action thriller. Yes see this film, but don't get your hopes up for another great portrayal of Hannibal Lecter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because hr is a prequel, hannibal's never in any real danger. there's no fear he'll die or lose a body part- we know he'll be fine bc he grows older and eventually meets clarice starling. thus, the movie should focus on the internal development of hannibal as serial killer.instead of witnessing hannibal's internal metamorphosis into the cannibal, we get a revenge story in which hannibal spends his time capturing one killer to get to the next one. some will argue that hannibal's internal struggle is developed; however, his waking up at night screaming misha! misha! and the black-n-white flashbacks of grutas eating a bird (or whatever) and hauling hannibal's sister out of the cabin don't amount to much.where's the internal conflict? all the men hannibal kills are repugnant, and he has no qualms destroying them. essentially, any audience member familiar with the other hannibal movies spends the time waiting to see HOW hannibal kills these louts, and that's about it. perhaps the "love story" with li gong provides some interest, but even that's not developed too deeply or satisfyingly.i suppose a viewer may be in the moment of a scene and feel hannibal's in danger, but he's not. ultimately, there's little to no tension in this movie, and you'll sit comfortably in your seat, never venturing to its edge.essentially, hannibal is a superman who cannot be destroyed. so we sit watching him mete out punishment to a bunch of degenerates who deserve nothing less bc they're flat, evil characters, and we're left to wonder where's the kryptonite of internal conflict that would reveal hannibal's psyche as something darker and more complex than just an avenging brother.</fullReview>

It's absolutely impossible they gave him the same mask while he was being locked up. Makes no sense. And why was he eating only some of them? And after showing us every murder, why did they not show anything for the last one? And what happened to him that made him be so cultivated and so styled in the other films? No answer there either. Plus, on parts, it seamed too long. I didn't feel like I was presented with any new information for part of the film. I think best would be to just have waited for it to come out on DVD.</fullReview>

This movie really shows us how Haniball came to be the DR. we know him in Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, and Hanniball. Also i thought the scenery was great, and it fitted perfectly with the fast moving plot. Throughout the whole movie i was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next kill.

		<shortDescription>It could have bean worse, but Hannibal Rising is so bland, perfunctory and downright stupid that you'll gnaw your fingers off all the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Michael Mann introduced the world to Hannibal Lektar (sic), albeit fleetingly so, in his gripping crime thriller Manhunter (1986), Johnathan Demme took him mainstream in 1991 for the much more hammy, albeit equally gripping, Silence Of The Lambs, for which Anthony Hopkins gnawed his way to an easy Oscar. Then it all got a bit silly with Ridley Scott's gruesome Hannibal (2000) that lacked the chilling chemistry between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, instead just offering a concoction of half-eaten faces and spilled intestines. It was generally assumed that the coffin in this increasingly tiresome franchise had well and truly been buried and covered with as much dirt as possible when Hollywood uber-hack Brett Ratner was chosen to dig it out again with an unnecessary retelling of Thomas Harris' original novel Red Dragon (2003) (the book that Manhunter was based on). Alas no. We no longer live in the world of a sequel-too-far, but rather the prequels that get film lovers such as myself all agitated and irksome. A completely and utterly unnecessary telling of Hannibal Lectar's childhood, Peter Webber's film begins at the dog-end of WWII. When young Hannibal's family are killed by a Nazi plane crash-landing through their Lithuanian home, only he and his younger sister remain, and together they hide out from Nazi and Soviet poachers, who are rummaging through the area. Soon they are greeted by the ruthless Grutas (Rhys Ifans, milking his performance with every mouth muscle possible), a former Nazi associate, who along with his compatriots, kidnaps them both and takes Hannibal's young sister away for some incredibly unpleasant activity. The story then flashes forward to Hannibal finding refuge in Paris, and joining up, for completely spurious reasons, with Japanese Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). It is here that Hannibal plots his quest for vengeance against the men who murdered his sister. There is one great moment in Hannibal Rising, near the beginning, when after a group of Soviet soldiers plough into the back garden of Hannibal's castle, and demand the family that they use the watering hole, we get a view of three Nazi planes all coming into shot, with one of them slowly turning, and descending upon the hapless Soviet soldiers. They fire at it, and the flaming aircraft crashes right through the family's garden. It is this moment alone, which has absolutely nothing to do with the central themes of Hannibal Lectar, that had me captivated (for a few seconds at least). From this moment on, the film just gets sillier, and sillier with each passing scene. Considering just how gruesome Ridley Scott's Hannibal was, and just how chilling both Manhunter and The Silence Of The Lambs were, why on earth were we taken back to Hannibal Lectar's childhood? Whereas before we had the poison-eyed Brian Cox doing his subtle, but effective role as the cannibalistic doctor, and Anthony Hopkins pulling it off with menacing charisma, here the producers appear to have cast a member of One Tree Hill in Gaspar Ulliel, as the flesh-eating psychopath. The occasional pillow-lipped smile that emerges after every severed limb did nothing to reverberate my masochistic nerves, nor for that matter did his incredibly stupid relationship with Gong Li, which would appear to only exist in order to explain why he carried that pointless samurai mask with him. The grittiness and intelligence of the previous films is replaced with bland gornography, most of which is about as scary as an episode of Scooby-Doo. Partly this is down to the overplayed score and dialogue, but the perfunctory nature of the narrative does nothing to sway your expectations. There is never a bell-concocted balance between the nastiness of our protagonist, and the sympathy we are asked to give him.The bottom line here, is why did we need a back-story for Hannibal Lectar? People are afraid of what they don't understand, and part of the chill of seeing the previous films was the complete insanity behind both Lectar was unexplainable. All this movie exists for is to milk the cash cow that is the Hannibal franchise, and any psychological depth to be found in that character is completely washed away in a stupid and vacuous revenge tale, in which our young anti-hero decides that the best way to avenge the death of your family is to eat people. No it is not as bad as certain other rehashed films (particularly horror ones), and Rhys Ifans does liven every scene he is in. But when you'd already had enough of Anthony Hopkins, fava beans et al, no way in hell will pretty-boy Gaspar Ulliel, and his completely unmenacing pillow-lipped smile, do anything to reinvigorate that interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal rising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely not as good as people said it was. It made no sense and had no real relation to anything. It was mainly Mr. H living with an Asian lady who was his aunt and seemed to be the only Asian in the city. When a chunky butcher guy asks Hannibal's aunt if "asian poosy runs east to west " Hannibal gets mad and . . .You guessed it, goes home and get a freaking ninja katana ( dead serious. ) and finds him fishing the next day, and like the true samurai he is, kills him with style . . AND Doesn't EAT HIM. . I THOUGHT HE WAS A FREAKIN CANNIBAL. DISSAPOINTER / SPOILER Through the whole movie 4 cheeks were eaten by Hannibal. No arms. No legs. Nothing but 4 measly cheeks. Hollywood tried to make this a somewhat "art film" which in my opinion shouldn't work for this kind of movie. I do think it deserves a sort of elegance and high class, but it didn't seem to keep with that the older Hannibal did, or why he eats people in his other movies. Over all, this movie wasn't my type because i only watch b movies. I wanted my money back, but wait! i didn't pay to get in. If you are a Hannibal fan, then this movie may not be for you, it was close, but off just enough to make it unreasonibly boring.--Superstar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Rising - (2007)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say the acting was very impressive throughout this film. The expected violence and gore was also as expected. This story goes on to tell us about Hannibal as a young child. How he was indeed traumatized as a child living through the terror and horrific events of a child in the middle of a violent war. This story continues into Hannibal's early manhood. The events unfold as he one by one seeks out the men that killed his younger sister, in the most unspeakable way. This movie is a bit too long to tell us a story that could have been maybe a good half hour less. This film is one that has good possibilities of capturing the attention of its audience, if nothing else, due to at least a curiosity level. If you are are a real fan of the Hannibal Lecter character, I would suggest that you see this movie. You could find the added information needed to complete a final personality analysis of this gruesome complexed man. I give this one a strong #6 - mostly since the acting was very well presented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good stand alone revenge movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the Hannibal legacy ... and look at this movie as one of the great revenge movies of all time. The morphing of the main character into a methodical vengeful killer, influenced by terrible childhood events is a treat to behold. The depiction of the WWII eastern front in winter is a chilling catalyst to the chemistry of a developing adolescent, the events of which color his psyche and set him on the road to a survival-at-all-costs behavior. His resourcefulness and focus take him on a journey of education, research and training that sharpen his capabilities in dealing with any barrier that must be overcome to achieve his goals. He becomes the unemotional, asocial killer that he must, topped with a dash of learned cannibalism. Go Hannibal Go !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film but deviates from the book......................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion all of Thomas Harris' books have been better than the film versions. I read the book before hand and suggest you do if you are a real fan. The film is only two hours and because of that it is one good chunk short of the plot and two characters short from the book. There are also a couple of adaptations which you think actually that didn't happen like that in the book but since the screenplay was written by Thomas Harris I will forgive. Although the book (and the film) focus is the young Hannibal there is something groundbreaking about the background to the story that is not suggested by the previous books and that is the perversity of the second world war and the fact that the remaining characters in the book are all victims of some horrid aspect of war which would have been the case for many people after the second world war and in this sense Thomas Harris revitalises this historical period conscientiously. Unfortunately you have more time to ingest this as a reader than watching the film.What it does for me whilst the detectives and his protégé Lady Murasaki think he has become a monster the film makes him more human and towards the end of the book though not in the play Lecter is forgiven by the students demonstrating in favour of him seeing him as he saw himself a victim and his victims as the real murderers.This film is a good watch to watch the prequel and to avoid readeing the book to find out how one of the worlds most infamous characters came into being??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising tells the story of a young Hannibal Lecter growing up in a war-torn Lithuania from childhood into a young adult. After losing his family, and witnessing the killing of his young sister, he sets out to exact his revenge on the vicious murderers.I was looking forward to this movie as I enjoyed the three previous movies - Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal and Red Dragon - but was very sorely let down. While I know it is a prequel to the other movies, I felt that it had absolutely nothing to do with them and it was really a movie that just used the Hannibal name.Now I know that this is a prequel to everything that we had already seen, like I said above, and it tries to concentrate more on Lecter's background and growing up, but I feel like it's just treated as a stand-alone movie. This movie is pretty much just a revenge movie as well and I think it would have been FAR better if it told the story of how Lecter became a doctor, why he started killing people and why he became a cannibal. Even maybe leading the story up to a few years just shy of the happenings in Red Dragon, but it doesn't do anything like that.Hannibal Rising is EXTREMELY slow going and because of this it was very hard to get into. I knew that it wasn't going to be a high action film, obviously, but it really did just crawl along for the majority of the time. In fact, 95% of the time I'd say.Should - and could - have been so much better but ultimately just a complete let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Origin Story, Poor Homage To Original Character and Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was just plain weak. I found nothing about it to be a proper way to explain the origins of the character and to lead into the original films. The acting was terrible; from the completely wooden and expressionless main and supporting characters to the downright laughably bad Russian accents attempted by actors of just about every European nationality EXCEPT Russian. The story itself did nothing to actually depict the progression of Lector from an innocent child to a corrupted monster. It basically just happened without explanation. As a viewer, you form no emotional connection with the main character; he's almost instantly unlikeable, despite the horrific events he endures at the start. The same applies to the actual traumatic events themselves. They happen so quickly that there is no time for the viewer to develop any sort of attachment to the characters, therefore completely removing any sort of emotional impact it would have on the viewer. Additionally there seems to be no attempt by the actor to mirror the character and personality of the original character played by the original actor. Anthony Hopkins version of Lector was a sophisticated intellectual who had an extreme appreciation for high art and culture and was well spoken with a vocabulary consistent with a man of supreme intellect. The Hannibal seen in this film was reduced to an almost barbaric individual who spoke infrequently and spoke in a very low brow manner. His personality was completely mismatched with the extremely evident attempt to depict him as a sophisticated individual, like Hopkins Lector was; merely throwing in the fact that he was accepted to medical school, was a gifted artist and appreciator of classical music with no pretext or prior indication of any such aspects of his personality. It was as if the film makers threw it in because they needed something similar to the original Lector's character to be present - without it there would be little indication that it was the same character at all. The films completely misses the point when it comes to showing the progression of how Lector spiralled into becoming a merciless killer. The film can't seem to make up its mind as to whether he is a killer because he is a psychopath and enjoys it, because of his childhood trauma or because he is seeking revenge. His motivations are impossible to pin down. The forced love interest aspect near the end completely clashes with the direction the character is apparently being taken; that he is becoming a monster devoid of human emotion and sympathetic qualities. Quite the contrary, the film seems to attempt to simultaneously portray him as a monster and a hero. There is no clear conversion from one to the other; that is, beginning as a sympathetic character who is heroic to a corrupted monster. He is, at times, depicted as villainous and heroic. Conclusively this film was handled poorly as an origin story. With unlikeable characters, bad acting, confusing motives, disorganized and messy story telling and disjointed character development this film stands apart from the entire Hannibal Lector saga as a film that has little to no connection to the original films in any way except perhaps by name only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved This Film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the story thickened as the movie went on just as any good film plot should! Gaspard was an excellent Hannibal and took on the legendary gory scenes and devilish acts of the deranged Hannibal Lecter very well! Especially in the scene where after murdering one of his sister's killers he licked the blood off of one of his fingers! I know it's gross but he really made you think about just how crazy Hannibal is and how he became even more crazy, evil and conniving in the other movies that portray an older Hannibal played by the great Anthony Hopkins. Also Gong Li played the role of Hannibal's aunt very well, and the two of them, Li and Ulliel (Gaspard), were a good pair with a chemistry that came off very honest with no gray areas on screen- meaning that you always will have a good concept of what was going on between them and how they felt about each other during the film. Being Asian in a foreign European town got Li's character "Lady Murasaki" in a lot of trouble/mischief and the young Hannibal was there to help her out of every dilemma every time. Overall really great film! It's a must see and will still be a must see many years from now!</fullReview>

I think that both films, "The Silence..." and "Hannibal Rising", are very good.It is very beautiful how this film handle the relationship of Hannibal with his sister.

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Rising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could have been interesting to see how one of the greatest villains in cinema came to be, if it was done well, this was the attempt, from director Peter Webber (Girl with a Pearl Earring). Basically, 8-year-old Hannibal (Aaran Thomas) and his baby sister Mischa (Helena-Lia Tachovská) are inseparable with their strong family bond, and they are hiding from the Nazis. After seeing these vicious attackers kill his sister right in front of him, teenage Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) swears vengeance, and for a while goes to Paris to live with his aunt, Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Miami Vice's Gong Li), and study at medical school. He goes in search of his sister's murderers, Vladis Grutas (Rhys Ifans) and his small group of men, and when he has his chance, he realises the horrible truth of the murder. Vladis reminds him that he was part of it too, as he was forced to eat the flesh of his own sister, how this relates to his continued cannibalism is a question, surely he'd be sickened by the idea. Also starring Kevin McKidd as Kolnas, 300's Dominic West as Inspector Popil, Richard Brake as Enrikas Dortlich, Stephen Walters as Zigmas Milko, Ivan Marevich as Bronys Grentz, Goran Kostic as Pot Watcher and Charles Maquignon as Paul The Butcher. Ulliel I suppose was alright as young Hannibal, but why couldn't they couldn't they get a British actor with the same quality as Sir Anthony Hopkins. As for the film itself, there is not enough cannibalistic gore to keep people interested, and it doesn't have that much tension either, a pointless prequel horror thriller. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie, and Worst Prequel or Sequel. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily the second best Hannibal series movie after the Silence of the Lambs. No useless gore, no much suspense but an excellent and efficient story showing how Hannibal rised. I very much liked the background (Lithuania, World War II, his sister eaten by hungry soldiers, Hannibal growing up in a sovietic environment) and actually found it was the only explication possible to explain what Hannibal became later. Ulliel's performance is stunning and Gong Li is as beautiful as ever. I found this paradoxal couple very convincing. I didn't think Ulliel was capable to rise to such prominence. His acting and his attitudes are tremendous. Maybe the movie wasn't enough "bling bling" to please some viewers (as some commentaries show) and the simple-minded public will miss some gore and blood senseless scenes but the movie really is worth watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a complete sucker for hearing the bio behind the character and this movie did just that. It gave insight into the character's being.However, it is completely different from the other films. Many people are upset that it did not follow in a cookie-cutter shaped way to Silence of the Lambs but those who tended to look beyond the other movies and forget that it was indeed pert of a series tended to enjoy it much more. I personally enjoyed this movie because in this setting, Hannibal is no longer the enemy or the bad guy. You like the character as an antagonist instead of opposite someone else.The End scenes were definitely worth waiting for. The suspense built in such a period of time was impressive especially during the scene where his aunt (Gong Li) had been taken and he is desperately trying to find her.Beautifully acted and scripted. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

I am here to tell you that said person is probably an employee for the studio or an actor in the film. The movie is horrible. The acting is decent at best and the story line is ridiculous. This series has "jumped the shark". Many parts of this story do not fit in and there are cheap gags thrown in throughout. One part shows him putting on the famed Hannibal mask before he goes out for a kill. This is ridiculous. The only reason why he even has the mask in the original film, Silence of the Lambs, is so that his guards in prison are protected from him biting them while they are transporting him. I registered an account just so I could tell people how terrible this movie is. I was expecting great things and I found that it pained me seriously to even sit through this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an absolute Hannibal Lecter fanatic. I am huge fan of both the books and the movies, even though I can admit that one of the movies is a bit of a let down. The character of Hannibal Lecter in my mind is legendary, he's the ultimate serial killer, the creepiest, the funniest, the wittiest and most memorable serial killer that you will ever find in a series of movies. Brian Cox had a decent stab at playing Lecter in Manhunter, a movie that while pretty good feels plodding and dated when I saw it recently. Brian Cox did well as Lecter, but in my mind there will only be one true Hannibal Lecter, and that of course is Anthony Hopkins. His chilling performance in Silence of the Lambs is one of my all time favourites. Silence of the Lambs is one of my all time favourite movies. Of course its sequel, Hannibal, was always going to fail in comparison to the greatness of its predecessor. But that movie as well was passable. Red Dragon, Hopkins' last ever performance as Lecter was a return to top form, while not being as good as Lambs, it wasn't too far off. So as you can imagine I was excited by Hannibal Rising, I had read the book before I saw the movie and actually loved the book quite a lot. But the harsh critics had made me not look forward to seeing this as much and so waited until it came on DVD to rent it. So what did it come out like? Well its not as good as either Lambs or Red Dragon, but by god is it still a brilliant movie! While the lack of Anthony Hopkins is noticeable at first, it doesn't distract, as the person who plays the young Hannibal Lecter, Gaspard Ulliel, is surprisingly brilliant. The atmosphere is pretty intense, the movie looks beautiful and the storyline is still very strong. If it has one weakness its the fact it isn't concluded well enough for my liking.As I've sad Gaspard Ulliel is the big surprise of the movie here. While he is most certainly no Anthony Hopkins, he actually does a brilliant performance here. Obviously he has taken some traits from Hopkins to make his performance better, but there are scenes where you see him that actually send a shiver down your spine. The slight nods and twists of head make his performance so chilling. Scenes where he interrogated by Dominic West's Inspector Popil bring out the very best of Ulliel. One scene where Hannibal asks the detective, "Did you choose war crimes" is particularly memorable. While Ulliel starts off a bit strained, when he's at his saner stage he doesn't work so well. The minute he starts turning completely mad Ulliel exceeds himself. A scene where he commits murder involving rope is chilling as sings a song to his victim. The later parts of the movie also really work because once again Ulliel is just so brilliant in the part. Gong Li also deserves special mention, she is definitely one of my favourite actresses at this moment of time, after her great performances in Memoirs of a Geisha, Miami Vice and Curse of the Golden Flower she delivers yet another superb performance here. Dominic West does a decent enough job in a role that is admittedly pretty pointless. Rhys Ifans has chief bad guy duty here and he is very memorable. While he does tend to overact a little bit, he still comes across as memorable and delivers his lines with a great amount of venom.Hannibal Rising also succeeds in delivering some pretty memorable deaths as well as a nice storyline going on. While the deaths are nowhere near as gory as depicted in the book, the scene I mentioned above involving rope is nowhere near as nasty as I imagined it when reading the book, they are still very well done due to the incredible performance of Ulliel. There are some nasty scenes dotted about, the very final death is actually very nasty and had me wince a little bit. But the true pleasure of this movie is all about seeing the past of Hannibal Lecter. Now this will frustrate people who want Lecter to remain a mystery. For those people I recommend you avoid this movie as this is telling how he became a monster. Thankfully not all of Lecter's secrets are revealed, the movie chooses to end before we find out why he went on to become a serial killer. What we see is the seeds of his insanity starting to grow, not the full blown insanity fully grown that we see in Silence of the Lambs. The storyline makes you both pity and hate Hannibal, this is a very clever idea in my mind as that is always how I felt towards him in the other movies. He is the tragic hero really, if he wasn't mad he's be a great person. The flaws of the movie are basically that the beginning does drag after a while and there are some scenes with Ulliel and Li that are difficult to hear because of their accents. The ending also leaves you a little bit frustrated as I would have personally liked to have seen a little bit more.Hannibal Rising may not be the best of the Lecter series but it is far from the worst. Gaspard Ulliel'S performance steals the movie and the great supporting work from Gong Li makes the movie even better. A couple of flaws are there, but the movie is far too enjoyable for me to dwell upon them. While this might not be the perfect Hannibal Lecter movie for people who want the legends past to remain a mystery, this is a superb movie for everyone else and very sadly and underrated one as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, rather boring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I just watched that movie and I just watched because I think it would have been nice to know Hannibal Lecter a bit more. But obviously I was pretty wrong.The summary on the DVD box sounded somewhat good. After watching the film I have to say: The summary was about the best thing in this movie.There are just too many weird and "wrong" things in this movie for it to be good. For example: Nowhere in the three movies with Hannibal I've seen he does seem like influenced by Japanese culture. According to "Hannibal rising" the first influential person he liked after WW2 was his Japanese aunt, who taught him Kendo and introduced him to the Japanese culture (at least some aspects of it). I would think this leaves an impression on a character, but obviously it does not.His aunt is a weird character, too: She's perfectly fine with Hannibal chopping off a head of a man who just addressed her inadequately and insulted her as revenge and she even puts that head on a stake in the marketplace or something of a french town at night. This happens in the first half of the movie. In the second half of the movie she's suddenly all "forgive him" about the guys that ate Hannibal's sister during WW2 and can't bear to see a man being cut in the chest.Back to Hannibal: What I liked about Hannibal Lecter in the 3 movies I saw with him was that he was a vicious killer for his own satisfaction, which makes him menacing to me. In this movie he's just a guy on a revenge trip. That's not menacing. That's not extraordinarily insane and still brilliant like Hannibal was portrayed in the other three movies. Furthermore he seems to like blowing things up and making a horrible mess, quite the contrary to the nearly clinical killer in "Hannibal" for example. As others mentioned he inexplicably seems to be fluid in German, Russian and French at least, despite growing up in Lithuania and Russia only. Furthermore Hannibal Lecter is supposed to be highly educated and well-mannered. This movie should be supposed to show me where that education and manners come from, but it doesn't. In fact I would expect Hannibal to be more of a grunt with that "education" he probably received for 8 years in that Russian orphanage.To make that character mess even worse, Hannibal's victims are guys you actually don't blame him for killing. They ate his sister, some of them are known war criminals, one of them even is head of a slave trading ring. So, after all, Hannibal is just enacting revenge on guys that (in a movie's sense of things) actually deserve it. So, in my book this movie just doesn't respect any aspect of Hannibal except that he is a cannibal. And that is just plain weak. Other than those mistakes I think this movie has just too many lengths. A movie that's supposed to show the roots of Hannibal Lecter for me just screws up the whole character, is unable to have consistent characters that only appear in this one movie and has nothing else worth noticing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Emoing ('How could this happen to me?') (spoilers throughout)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why Hannibal Lecter was so fascinating in The Silence of the Lambs was because we knew so little about him. Details were sketchy. In light of this it was up to the audience to draw their own conclusions. In Hannibal Rising everything is given to us; the reasons why Hannibal became a murderer, a psycho and a cannibal. As a consequence, Hannibal immediately becomes a less interesting person. In fact, he even becomes banal.The last thing I wanted from this film was a simple explanation for Hannibal's psychosis. But unfortunately we get it. You see, Hannibal's sister was murdered and eaten by a group of mercenaries. Simple as that. Bloody hell, the film has taken an iconic screen character and lumbered him with the most hackneyed back-story you can possibly imagine. Instead of just being an evil nutjob, Hannibal becomes an innocent gone bad. A victim of circumstance. It flies against everything that made the character work in the first place ? the fact that he was unfathomable, that you never knew whether it was nature or nurture that made him. Once you explain a character like Hannibal, everything is gone. He's not mysterious and he's no longer frightening. He becomes ordinary.But then again, I think that the character only works when he's in a cell. I can remember when I first watched The Silence of the Lambs and thinking how terrifying it would be if Hannibal got loose. You wouldn't be able to sleep at night, and if you did, you'd wake up and find that your kids had been eaten! It would be chaos. But as Ridley Scott's Hannibal proved, fantasy and reality are different things. The imagined reality of Hannibal out in the open would have you messing your pants, but the celluloid reality of it was rather limp. Basically what you had was a rather chubby, effete, balding gastronome dishing out catty one-liners and occasionally making snarling faces. He was one part Gordon Ramsey, one part John Inman.But in Hannibal Rising he turns into something even worse than this. He turns into an emo. Just take the scene where he strangles some poor bastard to death by tying him to a tree and having the rope tighten around his neck. With his hair swept over one side of his face and with his actions fuelled by blissful revenge fantasies, he might as well be wearing a My Chemical Romance t-shirt. And then there's the way he looks up to the heavens and screams, Vader-like, in impotent rage when his mother is killed in the Second World War. Boy, it kind of sticks in your craw to realise that two of cinemas baddest villains were emos.But the emo scream of anguish actually gets a second airing. When Hannibal is attacking one of his sister's murderers, and after the awful line that is 'He ate my sister', he finds out that he unwittingly ate his sister, too (!). 'Nooooo!' he cries. Oh dear, the whole character's twisted personality can be explained in two sentences. Hannibal's sister was eaten by Lithuanians. Hannibal ate her, too. Suddenly he doesn't seem like such an interesting character.What makes this more annoying, though, is that the film is actually quite well made. It's not offensively awful. The photography is good, the editing is up to scratch and certain sequences are well executed. But where it falls down is in the banality of the characters and the acting. In particular, I'm talking about the kid who plays Hannibal. It's impossible to reconcile him with the Hannibal played by Anthony Hopkins. The two just don't seem to be in any way connected.I also don't like the way Hannibal has become a hero (he's not even really an anti-hero any more). All the way through the film we're asked to root for him. We're asked to cheer as he drowns, strangles and stabs evil-doers. And sure we're going to cut him some slack as these people ate his sister. But again, by making him the hero you're making the character one-dimensional. There's very little moral ambiguity. It's a revenge flick as clear-cut as Kill Bill.But again, even though the film fails dreadfully as a character piece, it does have an enjoyable sequence or two ? the drowning of the mercenary and the showdown with Grutas (Rhys Ifans) standing out in particular. But even these highlights reveal another fatal shortcoming in the film ? Hannibal's intelligence. He's like the James Bond of serial killers. No matter what you do, you can never outthink him. He'll get out of every jam, either by simply outsmarting the other person or by having a handy gadget or weapon in tow. For example, he gets caught by Grutas but has a bomb set up that provides enough of a distraction for him to get loose. And then later on, when he seemingly gets shot in the spine by Grutas, he plays possum and then stands up, revealing that he had a samurai sword tucked conveniently under his jacket. Yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie / Story Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Hannibal Rising was a great movie! I would very much like now to go back and watch the others again. I found the acting quite good and the story line even better.In addition to tidying up the beginning of Hannibal's life, I found other aspects quite interesting as well. Not knowing if some of the information provided is true or not simply allows my imagination to go with it, and thus, for me to enjoy the movie as such, a movie. I did not take notes and try to figure out if something added up or not (so I'm not sure if anything did or not). I simply enjoyed being told the story.Having only rented it, I look forward to purchasing a copy. I put it up near the top of my favorites and will enjoy watching it again, especially being that I can't recall if there was any bonus material. If so, I seem to have forgotten to watch it in a rush to return the rental.Hannibal is certainly a moral paradox. And I love a good paradox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good considering the source</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the book and having seen the newspaper reviews, I went into this with very low expectations. The book is flat out bad with Harris spending more space on showing us his knowledge of fine wine and foods than he spends on character development. Knowing that he had done the screenplay also worried me. However, the director did a nice job of skimming the crap and focusing on the story instead. The first 25 minutes in Lithuania are excellent. The use of limited flashbacks is well done and the holding of the key element until the very end is handled well. Unfortunately just about every scene with Li Gong is terrible, mostly not her fault although her delivery is somewhat wooden. Gaspard Ulliel does a nice job especially with the mannerisms; you can believe that this boy could become the Anthony Hopkins version of the man. The bad dudes are all good especially Rhys Ifans and Richard Brake. Also excellent cinematography.The weakness is the source material. Many will be disappointed by the motivations behind the Lecter character. The childhood trauma and the confused feelings towards his aunt explain some of his transformation but just doesn't seem "enough". The deaths are interesting and plentiful but not as gruesome as many would have you believe (which is okay by me anyway). The coincidences and ridiculous "schemes" are just plain bad writing. But if you realize that this is a revenge story more than a detective story or a character development story, it's very watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Giving Hannibal Lecter samurai sword skills is just one more surrender of a great character to the Hollywood machine. I can just see those people during a video conference thinking up ways to make "the forth in the trilogy" so to speak. The Misha storyline of course was forgotten in previous movies and I did feel I'd been cheated out of it. But to take something that would be worth 10/20 minutes in a previous film and elongate it and dilute it over 2 hours...well...that's just plain wrong. It's good as senseless revenge flicks go but as a Hannibal Lecter film it really leaves to be desired. Plus it's noticeable they tried to up the blood and gore level and did a poor job at it with even the slightest excuse to show a bloody finger. The storyline aside, the acting is OK but is still have an impression the kid was trying to had to show he'd become the monster.</fullReview>

Many times I continued watching a movie even though I thought it was lame, hoping something would turn out to be good in the particular production. I never claimed my money or my time back. But no now! Hannibal Rising oughta be the worst movie ever! It's not even entertainingly bad, it was "bad" bad! I took a look at the other "hated it" reviews before starting mine up... Some said it's the gratuitous violence that turned 'em off, some said the geographical/historical inadvertences, some complained the accents were really bad, some commented on how this film cannot compare to the previous enactments. What p****d me off? Everything! I mean It's really hard to put my finger on what was so bad about this movie that made me interrupt my watching it and start reading reviews and trivia about it. I finished it after a 2 hours break and I felt compelled to write this comment. If you want to see it, wait for the DVD. You'll still lose precious time but you won't regret the money.

		<shortDescription>Notion ruined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all in my opinion Gaspard Ulliel was an excellent choice. He's got what it takes. This movie is a really good one and it's stands on it's own, but... It's unavoidable to compare to the other three films ( I'm a Lecter fan and I liked all of them). It has not much to do with them. I mean the figure of Lecter is a mysterious demonic creature without human feelings and in this film you find out; yes he was a child, he was normal, he loved his family etc... And because of this trauma (evil men ate little sister) he became a monster. It's so lame, so Hollywood. I know it's really subjective but I would like it more if the conclusion was: you can't explain why Hannibal became the monster he is. In my mind he existed like the original evil and now that notion ruined. If there was a hint (before bad things happened) there's something not right about this kid, it would be much better. Now I know he had a pretty good reason and have to feel sorry for him. I don't like that. So that's my subjective opinion about Lecter. I want my monster back!!! :)</fullReview>

Whom is he aiming at, teen year old kids knowing nothing about Europe, World War II and horror? Poor acting, sad dialogs, there was hardly any suspension. The refinement of the later Hannibal is nowhere to be found. It lacks its humor. Maybe he stuck close to the book, all options were open to make something spectacular out of it. He simply missed all chances. Shame! Compared to the Silence this is really far away from what it could be. Will anyone please stop this director if he plans to do a Hannibal IV?</fullReview>

A choice of options will be presented, even a fashionable "budo" way, but the final decision is up to you. after all, the movie is about value of life, and Lektor knows enough about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yikes. Not a good film... very contrived, even to the point of its props (eg. mask of Samurai effigy). Poor performances and a seriously weak storyline (reveals, such as they are, are pandering and lack imagination).And yes... he does sing.I don't know what is up with Thomas Harris. When "Red Dragon" (2002) came out, that movie's taglines read: ? Before the Silence ? Meet Hannibal Lecter For The First Time ? How It All Began! and although Harris wasn't directly responsible, presumably he gave his blessings to their revising "Manhunter" (1986) to better dovetail into "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991). Manhunter's budget was $15M and grossed $8.5M... Dragon's budget was $90M and grossed $209M. IMO it wasn't a better film, but its success was probably due to Anthony Hopkins. So here we are, five years later - the 'Rising' book was just released this past Xmas and already there's a film (due in part of course b/c Harris wrote the SP). I don't know if they even asked Ted Tally, but if so he likely passed and Harris thought he'd have a try himself. After all, how hard can it be to write an SP ? This probably spells the end of the franchise - and rightly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated horror/thriller let down slightly by length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the reviews I couldn't help but wonder why it got such a low 5.8, indeed I'm only giving it a percentage higher, but after watching it I was convinced it would please every fan of previous Hannibal Lector related movies and indeed horror fanatics in general. I still do believe after reading the criticism that some people are being a too harsh and should most definitely ignore Silence of the Lambs when considering judgment. This movie is stand-alone and far above the average of the usual modern crap the horror genre has coughed up as of late, which basically relies solely on loud noises and big flashes.Hannibal Rising tells us the disturbing tale of infamous serial killer, Hannibal Lector, starting from the beginning of when his monstrous, blood-hungry attitude came about. Set during and after the war, the horrific atmosphere is set, when both of Hannibals parents die and he and his sister, Mischa, is captured by Nazi's in what looks like the dead of winter. After a brutal event occurs, Hannibal wants vengeance on all who captured him and his beloved sister, to which the thriller-like tone is set for the movie.First of all, the acting is superb. I didn't think Gaspard Ulliel could manage to live up to the twisted, disturbing villain that is Hannibal Lecter of past movies (Anthony Hopkins of course), but somehow he managed to leave you just as genuinely afraid by his own unique, unsettling performance. The cast alongside him are strong also, despite being relatively unknown.The music is atmospheric and is reminiscent of Lecter movies of old to which it is perfectly apt with the dark, moody scenery of France. Their is plenty of squeamish moments to leave any hardcore Horror fan wincing and equally enough tense, thrilling moments to keep anyone enthralled and intrigued.However, this movie is not without its flaws. Firstly, it's far too long, there are just too many dull scenes that the movie could've done without. Secondly, there was nothing truly 'scary' about the movie, a lot of the blood and gore in the movie was thriller-like stuff, as my aforementioned point suggests, it WILL leave you gasping in shock, but nothing in this movie will make you jump. This might not be taken as a negative point to most, but I was expecting more shocks.Not much else to fault, I advise you to give this movie a chance and try to look at it as an independent film rather than part of a series. By no means is this a 'fantastic' movie, but a good one nonetheless. Well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hannibal Rising" ? Makes Its Ascent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off I should state that Hannibal Lecter is one of my favorite film characters of all time and I've enjoyed all previous movies based on him. I really have an insatiable desire to see as much of the good doctor as I can. Needless to say I was very excited to hear not only was Thomas Harris writing another book but he'd also take control of the screenplay as well. Upon viewing it's safe to say that he delivered again. This was a very satisfying tale of revenge and how the desire for retribution can consume any individual if it becomes too strong. A tale many people can probably relate to, if only on a much smaller scale.This was a very necessary movie as it thoroughly explained what could create such a monster. It didn't throw out any ridiculous explanations either just for the sake of having them; the whole puzzle really came together very convincingly. The background set during World War II in Lithuania added a nice touch that showed a set of circumstances, which could transform a tender child into a complex serial killer. To this day no one knows why people turn into mass murderers but in an instance as the one presented at the very beginning, it could plausibly happen to anyone depending on what we get exposed to early on.On the acting front it was amazing. The whole cast did great. In fact they probably could've gotten away with a lot less effort sometimes but this must've been a personal project for most of them, as they just seemed completely lost in their roles. The biggest surprise I've received so far this year came from Gaspard Ulliel's turn as the younger version of Hannibal himself. I never heard of this guy whatsoever even though I have seen a previous flick or two with him in it?but he just scored off the charts. One would have to possess some tremendous gall to begin with in order to take on the villain Sir Anthony Hopkins turned into legend but to do it with such success is an incredible task that Gaspard pulled off. Granted he obviously wasn't nearly as perfect as Hopkins was, however he landed close enough especially when you consider Ulliel's young age. This guy will have a tremendous future, and without a doubt not just as a desensitized comeuppance-dealing psychotic. Li Gong added her tremendous skill and beauty with ease and is remarkably pleasurable to watch. Dominic West is an incredible talent and one of my favorite character actors, needless to say he was incredible as always. Many of the other actors were basically unknown to me, which added to my astonishment of how well they did. To the untrained eye it may appear that some of the thespians lacked chemistry but this was done on purpose to add a general sense of apathy to our unlikely protagonist."Hannibal Rising" will certainly become a target for needless bashing because this is the first time our anti-hero is not portrayed in a brilliant light. This was a must though since Hannibal was still developing and a monstrosity like that would have to be molded over time?no one could start out like that, sheer hatred has to be learned. Another setback was there weren't any noteworthy original killings that every other feature contained, nor were there any specific memorable quotes. Finally the comic relief was lacking and there was only one instance of it that helped revive my attention from the intensely dark tone we as an audience were saturated with for nearly two hours.The cinematography was suitable and generated a very creepy effect. The biggest negative had to be the pacing as it was unnecessarily slow at times and took away from the thrills as there really weren't that many. This was the least suspenseful installment yet because it decided to focus more on back story and character development. That being said, it'll take mainly die-hard fans to fully appreciate this prequel. However I'm sure those that are passionate about a well-developed story will enjoy it too if judged on a stand-alone basis. After "Silence of the Lambs" this was the next best motion picture if established on overall quality. Even though it still hasn't convinced me of converting to cannibalism, I have developed a new hunger to fill in the gaps between this and "Red Dragon".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's time to learn what led Hannibal Lecter, once a gifted, bright young man, to a life of horrendous crime.Fans of the book series will already be familiar with the story of Hannibal's younger sister, Mischa (and her eventual fate at the hands of Nazi soldiers), from Thomas Harris's 1999 novel "Hannibal". Now it is time to learn the full story of Lecters troubled childhood, a result of growing up through the horrors World War 2.I, for one loved Hannibal Rising, so much so that I returned to cinemas to watch the film for a second time merely a week after my first viewing. The film has also re-kindled my interest in Thomas Harris's wonderful series. Stunning cinematography, emotional performances beautiful direction and all together great story telling help to make this film one of the best I have seen in a long time.Gaspard Ulliel does a fantastic job at portraying a young Lecter. He is perfectly charming and polite on the outside, whilst on the inside his sadistic and vengeful nature continues to grow. Ulliel is highly engaging and convincing in his performance, doing the famous character justice. Gong Li must also be mentioned at this point for her performance as the graceful Lady Murasaki who acts as both mentor and love interest for the young Hannibal. Li and Ulliel have a good chemistry throughout most of the film and both actors appear to have a great understanding of their characters.I would highly recommend this movie to fans of the book series, however fans of the movie series might be disappointed if they are expecting to see another Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pretty disappointed with the movie Hannibal Rising. I don't think that the plot was that well developed and it was i thought, slow and dull. I had a hard time understanding how Hannibal's aunt wasn't that weirded out by his killing of the butcher and at times its as if she actually supports his killings. The whole movie was basically a big flashback of the event that spawned his life of Cannibalism when his sister Mischa was killed and eaten by the soldiers. In the other movies Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs,and Hannibal, Lecter mainly killed to be free from his jail cell or if he disliked someone who had mocked Clarice Starling. In the movie Hannibal Rising, Hannibal Lecter killed the soldiers for revenge but i don't get why he had to keep killing after he had fulfilled his task. A thing that i did like was the boy that was chosen to play Lecter, Gaspard Ulliel. He was absolutely perfect the way his face portrayed a terrifying evil that captured the audience. Another good point was the ways in which he killed his victims which were very scary and gruesome. I couldn't help but feel excited about finding how the next victim would die. At times i felt myself question who the real villain was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Waste Of Time ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you draw on the strings of a classic cult horror film and try to rewrite history, the wise would be well off leaving those sleeping dogs snoozing to their heart's content ...Hannibal Rising is, without doubt, one of the worst films to kick off a new year - and it's still only February. The story is disastrously weak and riddled with nonsensical chance and writer's cramp. With it's forerunner now well and truly on a higher shelf, some bright spark decided that the original story should be told from the beginning. So, along with a financial backer, they set out to recreate the early years of Hannibal Lecter.Casting a French boy in the role of the adolescent Hannibal only confused the character's Eastern European origins when he spoke. The supporting cast must have been drawn out of a hat at a charity ball and the editing appeared to have been done by a deranged axe-man with a blunt instrument. Where the idea of this Japanese Aunt came from, along with the martial art of kendo and the Samurai mask, I'll never know - and we're only 30 minutes into the film at this stage.It's a bizarre tale with some truly awful lines, delivered by a collection of character actors who should strike this ordeal from their resumes. Remember Ridley Scott's Hannibal in 2001 and leave this poor relation to the half-price bins at your local DVD store.If I were to describe this movie in 5 words, I'd say that it was 'a cow in a tracksuit'. But then I'd be insulting the cow ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you probably already know, any movie made to run along with a story already captured in a movie is always expected to be worse. Whether it's because no one wants the original to be somewhat tarnished or because they truly feel it was worse is hard to tell. In this movie, young Hannibal Lecter has to wittness the death of his entire family, with one of them being cannibalized. His whole life's work begins with dreams in which he sees the killers of his young sister, Mischa. The movie has a good plot, and surprisingly good acting. As a huge fan of gore and make-up effects, I had my interests moderately satiated. This movie is not for anyone with a weak constitution, but is not so horrifying as to cause mass insanity. Overall, it was worth my $10, and I will have no reservations about buying it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the weakest link but MUCH better than the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book soon after it came out and hated it, but decided to see the movie just to complete the series. While still not on par with Silence or even Hannibal, the film version of Hannibal Rising is a far better addition to the series than the book was.Usually the great thing about a novel over the film version is that it gives a lot more back story and details that flesh out the characters more than a 2 hour film can. Unfortunately the back story and details were the W0RST part of the novel Hannibal Rising, not because they were gory but because they were goofy. The deserters were not desperate men who committed cannibalism to stay alive but cartoon villains you'd expect to find in Gotham or Metropolis instead of Paris. They made Mason Verger look like Christopher Reeve in kindness and humanity. In the film they're still a bit overdone and too Gothically seasoned, but Rhys Ifans and Kevin McKidd especially managed to suck the marrow out of what they're given and make their characters more believable on film than they ever were in print; ironic that for such a thin novel less is more.What helps the film most, however, is Gaspard Ulliel. He's incredible. His cadence and speech (perhaps because English is not his native language, but everything is precise and suave and clearly calculated and menacing while you can't identify why), his presence (ominous and intelligent and calculating) and all about him work beautifully. His feral movements and face in the final scenes are terrifying. It's ultimately Gaspard Ulliel and NOT Thomas Harris, who finally makes you believe this kid could one day be the same man who tries to have Will Graham's family slaughtered or slice the face off of an innocent policeman who stands between him and freedom.If you're curious about the differences in the movie v. book, basically Hannibal's relatives (other than Mischa) are reduced to cameos. His parents and their servants appear but only long enough to say 'howdy' and get killed, his uncle doesn't appear at all (he's already dead when Hannibal arrives in France) and Hannibal escapes from the orphanage rather than being rescued (which works far better plot-wise). Hannibal's muteness is addressed but they needn't have bothered as it adds nothing to the movie. I would love to have seen his bonding with Lady Murasaki explored further as perhaps that would have come across far better on film than in print as well, but it's pared significantly.All in all I'd give the movie a solid B- where I only gave the book a D+. See it for Ulliel and Ifans. (And please, Mr. Harris: WE DON'T NEED "HANNIBAL THE INTERN" OR "HANNIBAL: THE NIXON YEARS" Just take your money and retire to Florence or Paris. Or write something else- you've only written 1 book that wasn't Hannibal centered, go find something else! Leave our cannibal gourmet alone and stop trying to redeem him too much!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so looking forward to Hannibal Rising, especially as the author was also writing the screenplay. Sadly, I was disappointed. It was the old yarn about kid gets orphaned by bad guys, kid grows up with special skills(?), uses them to get revenge, yadda yadda.... What I want to know is how did he get to the Hannibal (AKA Anthony Hopkins), seeing as he has gotten his revenge ? How come he carries on the "hobby"?. "the Lambs " never really gave us that bit of history as I remember it, nor, Red Dragon, etc. Back to the movie, by the end of it I could not but help thinking of "Itchy &amp; Scratchy", it became really cartoon-ish? Gaspard really tried, and he looked like he studied a lot of the old B/W silent horror movies, you know that thing with the close shot of his face? Din't do it for me, sorry.Skippy - Ireland</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an obsessive Hannibal fan, I was sorely disappointed by this movie. Gaspard Uliell was not engaging as Hannibal, he mistook the character's calculated manner for an air of brusqueness. Gong Li does an amazing job bringing to life a character who's dialog doesn't really expose much about the character, I am still not exactly sure why she fell in love with Hannibal.The details in this movie make it bearable, though. The allusions to the sequels are at times kitschy, and at others, laughable. It's interesting to see Hannibal coming into his own as a gourmand, and really makes you think about what happens between this movie and Hannibal, if, that is, you are able to disregard the fact that barely anything in this movie lines up with anything remotely resembling continuity. How could someone wanted for murder in France become a practicing psychiatrist in the United States? Why'd he give up on the Samurai sword? And while we're on the subject, one of my major points of contention regarding this movie, beyond the plot, or lack thereof, beyond the cinematography, or lack thereof, a sword training montage? I mean, come on...All in all, this movie seems to be nothing more than the last few drops of milk out of the cash cow that was Hannibal Lecter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only give two stars because I know I have seen worse than this.Here's what I got from "Hannibal Rising": Hannibal and his sister were briefly imprisoned in their home by some soldiers (Nazis, Russians, can't remember which since they were both in the neighborhood). When food ran out, they killed his sister for food and may have made Hannibal join in.So, he has a lifelong vendetta to get back at them for what they did to his sister and maybe himself as well.At the end, he succeeds.So, just like Batman, The Punisher, The Crow, and V, who also had personal vendettas against what was done to their families and themselves as well, Hannibal Lecter is a superhero.I was under the impression that this movie was supposed to be about the making of a fictitious evil psychotic who is a danger to the public in general and needs to be kept locked up at all times.That's not the movie I saw.Oh, and by the way, how did a mental hospital's mask that was made with intention to keep the evil psychotic unable to use his mouth against someone else become a TRADEMARK for the alleged evil psychotic? Please tell me that Hannibal Lecter isn't now supposed to be a budding Jason Voorhees who will come back from the dead over and over again and only find a good fight against Freddy Krueger.All in all, the Hannibal character's background is the same background as your average comic book superhero and he gets the bad guys in the end. That's all there is to get in this picture.AAAaaaaaaaannnnnnnd CUT!!! That's a wrap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IThe Legend of Lector starts here!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know the tale of the gruesome Dr. Hannibal Lector. How he captured and ate people. We have all heard about his cunning, a twisted, monstrous mind. But we haven't heard how it all began. Hannibal Rising tells us the beginning of one of the most disturbing sagas of modern times.The story goes like this, Lector is the child of a Lithuanian nobleman, living a happy life in a castle there. That all changes when his home is invaded by the Nazis, who defeat the Russians in a battle for control over the area, and take young Hannibal and his sister, 'Mishka' as prisoners after killing their parents. They cannibalize Mishka due to lack of food availability.Eight years later Lector is still living in his old home which has been made into an orphanage. One of the workers there always torments him due to him being 'different'. One day however he goes too far and cuts his enemy's hand. He is locked up in a back room and told he will suffer every day for the rest of his life. He manages to escape, and cuts his enemy's throat. Then he leaves, and takes up a quest to find and brutally kill Mishka's murderers.First I would like to say that this movie could have been dome better. The direction is poor, as is the script. The film focuses too much on Lector finding Mishka's killers, rather than on his development into the Lector we know. In fact, it seems like his personality is already established when he leaves the orphanage.The acting is above average. Gaspard Ullieli's portrayal of Young Lector is different from Anthony Hopkins's portrayal in several important ways. Gone is Lector's humorous view of people's psychological troubles, as is his British accent. This Lector is simply out to kill and murder those whom he hates, although the taunting is still here, it is more in tune with the persons past wrongs. Li Gong also gives an adequate performance of his Japenese Aunt.The musical score works well with the film, and the costuming is fairly good as well. The sets manage to nicely recreate the era.One of the biggest problems for me, was the abrupt ending. I would love to see some kind of directors cut of this to figure out what happens to the main Nazi.So finally to the important parts. Will fans of the other three like this one? It depends. If you are primarily a Hopkins fan or a Harris fan, I don't suggest seeing this. But if you are interested in Hannibal's past- go right ahead and watch it! Just prepare for some minor setbacks in an otherwise entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book before the watching the film, yet again the book is better. However, I loved the film anyway. I think to truly appreciate the need for the martial arts used in the film that another user picked up as typical to Hollywood films you have to look at Lecter's character throughout the books and films. Lecter is intelligent and culturally aware and the way Thomas Harris includes Lady Murasaki and her affect on Lecter as child only adds more to our own understanding of him as an adult and fully fledged serial killer. He is culturally aware because he was exposed to so many different cultures as a child, he is such an intelligent character because he is not ignorant to the world around him. Saying that however, his character is still a serial killer so while he is intelligent and amazingly aware of his surroundings, he is still a psychopath! This film is excellent, from the filming and the casting to the screenplay it continued to impress me from beginning to end. I recommend this film to anyone that enjoyed the other Hannibal films!! My only problem is that it doesn't exactly reflect the books excellence, but that is unavoidable otherwise it would be 5 hours long!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just seen about 98% of the movie or that is to say that I'd let 98% of the movie play while I was on the computer, only to check in here and there. Don't worry, I was in the same room and though I'm implying I didn't miss much, unfortunately, I didn't miss much.To be fair, many prequels are not good. Prequel is the latest Hollywood invention that's standing on its last leg but didn't have good ground to stand on to begin with.The movie in itself wasn't bad, with scenery of pre and post war Europe but rather it was the story that wasn't good. No scratch that, the story on how the notorious Lecter came to be was good, and palletable but perhaps it was the chemistry or the sheer predictability of the movie's atmosphere.I guess a face mask is Lecter's symbol which is cheesy to bring back even if it's a samurai's mask. The great Anthony Hopkins had donned the role of the High Societal Psychopathic Cannibal and unfortunately with such a performance, not only do you get countless spinoffs but people always compare original formulas to newer ones but also unfortunate is there was always something superb about the original formula for it to make is a cult success in the first place.I'm happy to have caught this movie on bootleg rather than being an idiot to spend money on it as I did with The Red Dragon (blah) As I'd said before, the movie isn't bad with itself but I'd seen better done with less and there was something so bad about it that I didn't have interest in it to watch the end of the story, nor do I care.</fullReview>

The story wasn't bad at all, however the characters bother me, one thing I notice with the role of Gaspard Ulliel is his voice, he possess a face that expresses the countenance of a young adult but later his voice really doesn't seem to fit. Deep and sonorous, it seems that it was altered. The gory scenes were reasonably fulfilling, one motive why I like to see this movie is brutality and it did show some of the stuff that suited my expectations but not too much compare to other atrocious movies. It seems nostalgic or evocative in the sense it reviews the past, but for me I would see a lot of Thomas Harris supporter out there would be partially entertained with this movie.I give a rating of 6 for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand where all the bad reviews came from! I found this movie to be wonderfully clever, perfectly sadistic, and touched with an immense sense of dark humor.In my opinion, Hannibal Rising does a solid job of explaining the origin and evolution of our favorite cannibalistic antihero.The art direction on this film is fantastic, as are the costumes, the sets - every visual aspect of this movie captures the atmosphere perfectly. The score also compliments the film impeccably, although (to my knowledge) it has not yet been released on CD.Gaspard Ulliel plays the part of a young Hannibal Lecter to perfection, peppering his translation of the character with touches of Anthony Hopkins' interpretation. Rather than coming off as a character to be despised, Ulliel manages to give the notoriously reserved Lecter a certain twisted charisma (much in the same way Hopkins' gave his Lecter a strange magnetism) and utterly cements the reputation of Hannibal as one of the most infamous (and strangely like-able) villains in cinematic history.Gong Li does a superb job of portraying Lady Murasaki, at once both effectively portraying her regal elegance and the impression that she is a woman not to be crossed.I, personally, was never disappointed at any point in this film. Well paced, well acted, and well executed, I recommend it highly.(My only suggestion? Continue the story of young Hannibal in another film!)</fullReview>

That was not a bad thing though, because it kept the pace of the previous films and did not make me dislike or like it anymore than i did the others.

		<fullReview>I really liked 'Hannibal Rising'...the setting, the story and, in particular, Gaspard Ulliel. 'The Silence of the Lambs' remains one of my favorite "scary" movies to date (although I wasn't as big a fan of 'Hannibal') and I absolutely loved the idea of a prequel that would delve a little deeper into Lecter's past. As the story of his childhood unfolded and the catalyst for his madness was revealed, I could easily separate the grieving boy from the murderous monster I knew him to later become. I actually LIKED &amp; was cheering for his character and thought it was such an interesting twist that Hannibal was really the hero here, rather than the villain. There were so many good points to this movie - not the least of which is Ulliel's absolutely brilliant portrayal of Hannibal. While his character, at times, resembled something more along the lines of a vampire rather than a psychotic teenager, he easily adopted some of Anthony Hopkins' classic Hannibalistic mannerisms that made your blood run cold. Although many people seem to think the Hannibal-the-Cannibal story has pretty much been played out, fans should be extremely pleased that the writers were able to craft a story here that showed a whole other dimension of Lecter's character. This movie did have a few minor setbacks - the Japanese aunt (well-played by Gong something-or-other) got all over my nerves for reasons I still can't determine (perhaps because the move seems to drag when she's present). Also, the story left me feeling a little empty, but through no fault of its own... I think I just need to go back and catch-up on the other stories ('Manhunter', perhaps) to try and figure out what happened between 'Hannibal Rising' and 'Silence of the Lambs' - I really don't have a clear understanding of how Lecter went from revenge-seeker to serial killer. At any rate, I thought this movie was imaginative and chilling and Ulliel was strong, solid - and graceful - in his performance. In all, it was time and money well-spent.</fullReview>

Gaspard Ulliel seemed well chosen to play the title role, and the film did seem to carry on a dark path (I was very happy to see it was rated '18'). However, I did worry about the closeness of the release of the film to the release of the book, as well as the less than stellar reviews of the recent instalments.REVIEW - However, upon watching the film, I have to say I was immediately impressed. Ulliel's portrayal was the utter highlight of the film. Growing from a damaged mute to the killer we all know was handled with such sensitivity, even sympathy, but continuing across the moral line we stop at, into something more. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role better. A special nod also to Aaron Thomas as young Hannibal, who's portrayal gelled so well with Lecter as an older man later on. His protection of his sister really lent itself to Ulliel's memories. Rhys Ifans was a shock piece of casting as Grusas, but it worked. It really worked. His "eyes of a wolf" set the whole character off, and the fear he brought to the screen was only matched by Lecter himself.The atmosphere throughout was dark, clinging to the screen, and growing with tension as Hannibal grew into the man we knew he would. The cinematography by Ben Davis was beautifully orchestrated and helped no end with the sense of foreboding.The only negative points of note I had were the length, and the occasional 'lack' of violence. While I did leave the cinema very happy, I did feel that a few minutes could have been trimmed to appeal to the audience at large, although to some degree every second of the narrative built up the character wonderfully. As for the violence, while there were scenes that had me cringing, I was able to watch it fairly easily. I thought some scenes (such as the Jew being shot, and Kolnas being skewered through the head) could have been done in full view, as opposed to being somewhat 'off-screen'.Overall, the dark nature of the film, and the perfect performances of Ulliel and Ifans, made this instalments a perfect continuation of the series.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent 90min film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a good film, an unrelenting continuum of insanity ran mysteriously in the background to Hannibal's history and at various points both crossed to chilling ends. It was a good 2-hour film. The acting was good, but not of the Anthony Hopkins level, performances were believable: the passion Hannibal had for his work was brilliantly conveyed. The story smoothly progressed as did the decent of Lecter into what we know him to be today, cunningly evil. The effects were realistic and wonderfully chilling without being overdone. The main problem with this film was its length, the ending also felt a little aimless or insignificant, it was not open so much, nor closed... The direction and the writing were good however. If you have not seen it, I recommend doing so, but do not expect brilliance or the superb quality that its predecessors had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this even a movie? It was like sucking up some flour; absolutely vapid. From the start began the descent into the banal, lifeless, beige, reduction of the character which I actually really thought was interesting, but only in past renditions. The flashbacks were corny, the dialogue boring, the story OH GOD. This movie was dreary, unredeemable, but what was really so disturbing was that throughout the movie there is no one to care for. It should have been left as a trilogy, but it's no surprise to me that Hollywood had to milk the hell out of the book series with this movie. This movie is drivel. Don't see it. I know this because I like good movies, and I'm fun. Go see Volver instead.and how many times do I have to hear the lame utterance "We got a runner." This was not in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of no gray areas; it's either 'awesome' or 'awful'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment I finished reading the "novel" I thought to myself that the movie, despite its crappy writing, could be better in the hands of an experienced filmmaker. I thought I'd like the movie best, quite honestly.But it just so happened I felt no differently from when I read the 'Hannibal Rising' novel: the portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was OK, but everything else that once made him great was lost(]SotL-great, not Hannibal-great). I have no problem understanding the man behind the serial killer and cannibal, I just want it to be done with style! That's what happened to Rising, there was nothing smooth about the plot and the supporting cast. This will sound quite strange but... it was all about Hannibal and "Hannibal" can't exist without the other flawed human beings to compare him to in an ironic, kind of pathetic way. There is not depth to Popil or the Lady and I dare you to find a handful of background characters who actually say anything.All in all, I was hoping the movie could provide me with a more human and less "Hannibal Lecter" side of things, perhaps in an attempt to connect all plot-lines on screen. It turns out they removed characters, going as far as not doing as much as introduce the man who guided Hannibal into creating his Memory Palace.That doesn't mean 'Hannibal Rising' was a bad movie. It was a film of extremes: when the scene had any quality or any depth to it, it was as exciting and Lecteresque as ever; but when any element was inconsistent or slightly out of place, the whole thing went crashing down into silliness.I had fun watching 'Hannibal Rising'. I thought the death scenes were entertaining and Gaspard Ulliel did an astounding job not trying to imitate Hopkins but incorporating the character traits offered by his adaptation of Lecter.Of Gong Li I have very little to say, as there wasn't much of anything to her character. Dominic West was Popil and that was it. Like Lady Murasaki, I think he was a poorly developed character from the start. Rhys Ifans was a good enough villain and his scenes were always entertaining, I give him thumbs up.The music was simply amazing (WHERE IS THE SOUNDTRACK?!) and there was nothing to as much as nitpick about cinematography. Some segments felt a bit rushed, but the movie didn't feel cluttered (like the "Chronicles of Narnia") or too vague.I will probably watch 'Hannibal Rising' again and recommend it to friends. It's not a movie I'm ashamed of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading what I thought to be a well crafted book I was very excited to see the movie. Imagine my disappointment when I saw the this film and what I can only explain as a feeble attempt to act by Gaspard Ulliel. So much of the story was left out of the film, I assume for the sake of time, but it really created a situation where the audience is left with more questions as to why certain things happen in the film. Thomas Harris wrote an incredible book and unfortunately the screen play did not even come close to doing it justice.My recommendation is read the book. Let the story play out in your head. And then don't see the movie it is a waste of time and money and will only ruin the story for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great, and not a fitting tribute to Hannibal Lecter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not bad, but without reading the book, you really don't know what's going on. There's so much internal monologue that's just completely left out -- it'd have had to be narration or something, but still. There's also a very large section of the plot that's completely cut, and at least two characters that were completely removed. So little of what made the book good was cut from the movie, which is really sad, especially since Harris wrote the screenplay; I have to assume that a LOT of the substance was left on the cutting-room floor.The movie is way more hack-and-slash than the book. The murders are similar, but Hannibal is so much smarter and more elegant in the way he does things in the novel than he is in the film. You also get a great deal more information on his life before the war and his work at the medical school (he was paying his way through by making anatomy sketches, which is very much glossed over, and ties in to parts of the story that were left out).It's not bad, and there are some decent moments (coupled with some really out-of-character ones, which grate on the nerves). Overall, I was disappointed. Not worth the ridiculous price of a ticket -- rent this one.If you liked it... or if you like Hannibal at all... do yourself a favor and read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising truly gets the Hannibal Lecter series to an untouched low. A simple slasher flick supposedly about Hannibal Lecter, with little to no suspense and a common revenge story. And why the heck does every movie pumped out of Hollywood now have to have at least one thing that has to do with martial arts or Asian culture?One can only fail to see how this disturbed young man becomes the enigmatic monster that we all know him as in Silence of the Lambs. There was simply no connection from Ulliel's Lecter to Hopkins's other then the name and cannibalism. *Different MOs *Different Intellectual capacities *Different weapons of choice *Different independence level Did any one see a true connection between these two characters?Regardless of the lack of connection to the Hannibal Lecter that we all fear, the revenge story wasn't that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising is a film that can be easily dismissed as unnecessary, but my main point will be that if you watch this film without expectations, you will be satisfied, mostly because of the terrifying and electric performance of Gaspard Ulliel in the title role that nearly mirrors Anthony Hopkins.During WWII, Hannibal Lecter (Ulliel) watched in horror as the Nazis murdered his mother and father right in front of him, soon taking he and his young sister Mischa hostage within their own home. After the Nazis kill Mischa in the most brutal of ways, Lecter vows revenge on the men responsible, and nearly a decade later, transforms into the cannibalistic genius that has become the most legendary villain in film history.Unknown French actor Gaspard Ulliel is the perfect choice for the Young Hannibal. He embodies every emotion required for one of the most complex characters ever created, becoming the highest level of evil imaginable. Easily the best villainous performance in quite a long time. Ulliel has a sickeningly mad grin and piercing eyes that really help him out. And his voice is spectacularly creepy in a way that will make you turn in your seat. He will scare you, no matter how old you are, or how much you think actors can't scare you. He is terrifying. He also perfectly captures the spirit of the other films starring Anthony Hopkins. In exception to the voices of the actors, there is not much difference between the performances. Obviously, it is because Hopkins assisted Ulliel in his performance, but Ulliel does everything he can to make the character his own, and it really works. In supporting roles are Gong Li, Rhys Ifans, and Dominic West. Li is a very good actress, and she does a great job here. Her character's relationship with Lecter is an awkward one that I won't even begin to describe, as I'd be taking away some of the movie experience from you. Rhys Ifans is the central villain of the movie, even though Hannibal Lecter is a villainous character. Ifans is very scary as well, though not as much as Ulliel. Ifans gives a good performance that is on par with Ralph Fiennes performance in Red Dragon, though Fiennes's character was much different and had much more screen time. Dominic West is a good actor, but it seems like his character of a police inspector was there to be there. He really didn't serve a purpose, because like the other films, the police never really bother Lecter. It's because West's character is not a main character like Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs or Edward Norton in Red Dragon.The writing, as much as it pains me to say it, isn't really that good. Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal Lecter, should stick to writing novels, because that's where his true strength lies. The film seems slow at times, and becomes extremely rushed at the end, with an ending leaving much to be desired (possibly another film after this and before Red Dragon? I'd love to see Ulliel do this again.) Harris fails to manage the suspense of the film in a good way, so at times it feels like Lecter is going on a killing spree. Ulliel's acting saves Harris from losing a lot of points with fellow writers. I'm not knocking him though, because without Harris, there is no Hannibal. Peter Webber is also partially to blame for the slow feel, then the rushed feel. However, what Webber does do is provide a mood of intensity and the good old 'evil reigns supreme' feel, which in this case, is awesome. Hannibal Rising contains extremely graphic content, including scenes of cannibalism and graphic gore violence, and therefore should not be viewed by anyone under 17. Gaspard Ulliel may be the next great villainous actor, because he is literally scary as hell in a film that is not overly great, just good. Ulliel is truly a star in the making.7/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a movie series like this one, it anything after first film, in this case "The Silence of the Lambs", every film thereafter receives a lot of flack. Now I am a huge Hannibal Lecter fan, and love and cherish the series just as much as anyone else. When I read the book, I had a lot of mixed feelings, and wasn't sure how I felt about the film, but as I watched the trailers for the film my anticipation grew. I saw the film last night, and I can say that I was completely pleased and satisfied. DO NOT GO INTO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING TO SEE ANTHONY HOPKINS, OR THE SAME HANNIBAL THAT WE ALL LOVE IN SILENCE. I will say Gaspard Ulliel did a beautiful job with the character from the book. There were quite a few parts in the film where I was misty eyed, especially the parts with him and his family, in specific his Mischa. I give an 8 out of 10. Most people will hate it. I loved it. If you love The Silence of the Lambs, go into this movie realizing that they are 2 very different films with very different casts. I loved it.</fullReview>

The movie in general was a good movie, but having seen the other Hannibal movies (Silence, Red Dragon, and Hannibal) i had high hopes and expectations. I thought it would be more creepy and gruesome than it was. I think the acting was pretty good and the little girl who played Mischa was adorable. I vote to go see the movie but erase anything you thought you knew about Hannibal, then go back and watch the other movies. The book Hannibal Rising is also a good read, not as good as Silence of the Lambs, or Red Dragon but a good read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003) director Peter Webber who alongside cinematographer Ben Davis and Thomas Harris, author to the Hannibal Lecter franchise, has brought forth a movie both enchanting and embracing.Altogether stunningly fulfilling in its visual and literary senses, as the first course of so far four parts, Hannibal Rising brings the Lecter myth to our screens once more.In 1944 Lithuania Hannibal Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel), slightly older brother to baby sister Mischa, are inseparable; it is their love for each other that ties their bond. Their companionship is forever binding, until, with their family, while hiding from the Nazi war machine during a twisted set of circumstance sets the pace for a most vicious attack on the future of one Hannibal Lecter for the sworn vengeance for the brutal killing of his baby sister. Years later, we find Hannibal, the teenager, setting up in Paris, and living with his aunt Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Li Gong) and studying at medical school here he finds his forte. Still searching for his sister's murderers, still bitter and still ever hopeful of satisfying his desire for retribution. This chance arrives, and soon we are to learn that for a pound of flesh lost a pound of flesh must be repaid. This is the horrific tale of justice and honour, a young mans growing pains that will have the guilty paying with more than just flesh and bone. This is the up and rising tale of the young Hannibal. This is a life that holds no bounds in the state of the art of vengeance.This time the feeling of fear and disgust are reversed into empathy and pity. Charming in a way for whose pace loses no ground and wavers no ill toward its viewer, not once do we feel the need to drift away here. We are constantly besieged by the complexities of young Hannibal's life that are both enduring and dextrous.Enchanting because of his plight, for the stench of death and corruption abound, after all, this is post World War Two Europe and some of its evils had slipped through the nets of Justice.Embracing to the point of knowing this young mans madness and sorrow are both inexcusable and worthy both at the same time. It is here we venture with him to the long roads across the forgotten paths of the war criminals, their war crimes, and the absolute inhuman atrocities committed. This is no ordinary horror, killing for the sake of killing; this is killing a past that gave no choice to others futures.The surprise of this movie has to be the excellent starter Rhys Ifans as noted more for his comedy roles in Notting Hill (1999), Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large (2000), Little Nicky (2000), and Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (2006), as the evil Vladis Grutas. Proving that versatility and just plain good acting can bring a whole new perspective to a movies "bad guy" role; chilling, charismatic, calculating and callous. We too have the beautiful Chinese born Li Gong, a side dish that brings a little class and sophistication to the banquet.For the main course, it is up to French born (1984) Gaspard Ulliel to conjure up an aperitif before we are feed his speciality; tongue in cheek. With a notable demeanour that would terrify any head chief. From the very beginning, we are delivered a cold and heartless killer. Gaspard Ulliel plays him well, his true self, Hannibal the killer, hiding under a pose of yearning and steady sly wit while the true identity shows no remorse and relentless aptitude toward his goal.A pleasant surprise of a movie, Hannibal Rising with its marvellous cinematography, surprising acting and a tense, heart stopping, horrific and justifiable means to an end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fourth installment of the Hannibal Lecter/Lecktor series is a quite satisfying and mostly intriguing affair. Here we see the events that shaped and turned the most popular cannibal ever into what he is. Gaspard Ulliel is utterly convincing and impressive in the title role. I believe no better choice exists for this part, both his appearance and acting suit this horrifying but fascinating character perfectly. Rhys Ifans also does extremely well as the main villain of the film, the equally horrifying Grutas. Li Gong is a breath of fresh air as always and handles her part capably.The catch with this film is something that has rarely been done before: it makes the sadistic and twisted look justified. Hannibal is more like an antihero than a villain. Although he displayed hints of humanity in previous films, at least in his relationship with Clarice, here he is shown as much more human. And that is natural, since this is about the conflict in him, where the dark, sadistic urges prevail in the end. As such it is a powerful film. My favorite scene is when Hannibal is lying on his bed, after giving himself the shot and listening to the music. Then the nightmare comes and the music and everything gets twisted. A wonderful touch by Webber.I don't really understand the negative reviews the film has got. It really hardly could've been done better. Ulliel is the perfect choice as Hannibal and the atmosphere and photography are awesome. There are some beautiful nature shots, moments of beauty amidst the horror and it perfectly illustrates the story of a darkened and tortured mind. Hannibal Rising is both sad, shocking and intriguing and thus matches the two first movies of the quadrilogy. It is better than "Hannibal" by a mile and only "Manhunter" is edgier and better, but not by much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller of origins. Not as deep as I'd hoped, but still a strong film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising is a dark and thrilling grand guignol excursion into the formative (but still plenty brutal) years of the infamous Hannibal Lecter. Considering the amount of psychological material the film would appear to have to get through, I think it definitely errs on the side of briskness. In a broad sense, many important sequences are played out and edited very quickly, and this saps them of some of their resonance, but the mood does gradually coalesce into something followers of the prior films and novels will recognise, and will be rewarded in revisiting.The teen-adult Hannibal as played by Gaspard Ulliel is pale and handsome, and his red slash of a mouth is always very much in evidence, signalling violence and malice, and reminding us of the flesh that we know will come to pass through it. After surviving some murky carnage on the Eastern Front during World War II, he eventually seeks out remaining family in the form of his widowed aunt in France (Gong Li). He begins to open to a more regular life under her curious guidance, but the post-war environment is conducive to grudges and violence, and these are the sparks that are quickest to ignite in Lecter. Direction in this all-too-brief part of the film is some of its best, as it visually and thematically stitches together Hannibal's fascinations so that we can feel them wrap around each other - blood, violence, his own incestual leanings towards his aunt, and his childhood bond with his late sister, Mischa.After the first murder, though, (which definitely doesn't disappoint) it's a straighter ride through many more on the path of vengeance. It all makes for a fine thriller, but development in Lecter's character beyond this point is harder to read, and Ulliel's performance offers much relish but not-so-much variation. Of the other films in the series, this one has the most in common, stylistically and in subject matter, with Hannibal. As my friend also suggested when we left the cinema, I still feel there could easily be another film out there to deal with Hannibal practising as a psychiatrist and murdering folks on the side, pre-Silence Of The Lambs. This one offers the concrete details of his origins within a thrilling story, but somehow doesn't feel as deep or profound as I'd hoped it would - and I wish it would just relax and offer some longer scenes and more ambiguous moments at times. Nevertheless, Hannibal Rising is a strong film.</fullReview>

I know it was filmed in Czechia and Lithuania shown in film was unreal, even names are not like we have here -- there are no names Valdis or Kolnas or Bronys and others -- but I can understand it was in the book. I really liked Gaspard Ulliel in "A Very Long Engagement" and Peter's Webber film "Girl with a Pearl Earring" is very good and interesting, but this one is so awful bad. I heard a lot of laughing during the film -- it was so unreal and stupid. To compare with first film about Hannibal Lecter "The Silence of the Lambs" this one is really very poor.

Most films whose casting contains a plethora of actors not well-known to the public, especially in prequels and sequels, do not carry over as well unless the actors can seriously pull off the role. However, in Hannibal Rising, Gaspard Ulliel does just that by captivating the audience in a stunning and tenable performance! The phenomenal acting displayed in this film by the new Hannibal will surely make Hannibal Rising yet another major hit in the Hannibal series, and a career jump-starter for Ulliel!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very intrigued seeing the previews, and the almost constant commercials. Gaspard Ulliel has always been a brilliant actor, and this film only added to his successful career achievements.The plot summary took on an angle of Hannibal Lecter never discussed, and certainly never shown in film, that being his early developmental years. Where and how his lifestyle was molded from childhood, the inner brooding of such a complex and dynamic individual.This sense was grasped, the methodical mind games and sheer torture engraved down to his inner core.Unfortunately I left the cinema with a rather blaze and dulled feel. I only sympathized with what he was forced to endure, when I went in to experience more of the terror and madness of his mind and self.I'd pass on the movie, except to take in the brilliance of another sparkling performance of Ulliel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Lecter: The unnecessary origin story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From personal opinion, Hannibal Rising is not the complete and utter abomination as described by a lot of people. It is however still a huge disappointment, and by far the worst of the Hannibal Lecter films(the only one below average too).Hannibal Rising does look great at least. The locations are really strikingly beautiful, the photography is stylish, the editing tight and the costumes appropriate, with Peter Webber also directing with class. The best scenes in Hannibal Rising are the harrowing World War II parts and the river barge climax has some disturbing tension as well. Gaspard Ulliel does try too hard at times but still plays young Lecter with sinister intensity that's gripping to watch, and Aaron Thomas shows himself as a promising child star as a touching 8 year old Lecter. The film is hauntingly scored too, there are some genuinely moody parts while not overbearing the film at all, and in a way that still sounds engaging.Gong Li is less successful however, she has a beautiful and dignified look but that doesn't translate in her rather expressionless and flatly delivered acting skills. Dominic West doesn't look very involved at all with his character, like he didn't really want to be there, and seemed a little out of place. Rhys Ifans was the most disappointing, Grutas is far too one-dimensional and cartoonish for a villain- the worst Hannibal Lecter villain by a long way- with no development to him at all, and Ifans plays him with very little sense of threat or subtlety, instead the acting is an uneasy mix of hamming up laughably and underplaying to the point of being dull.The script is a giant mess throughout, with the dialogue being ludicrous in particularly some of the one-liners, the cringe-worthy dialogue in the butcher scene and a lot of Grutas' dialogue. It also sounded incredibly ham-fisted and underdeveloped, some intriguing ideas here but almost all of them glossed over. The story had its moments, but has more unintentional silliness(i.e. Lecter's first murder), both in the dialogue and the over-the-top murders, than it does suspense, tension and mystery and is often very tediously paced, also not doing a good job at all tying in with the other Hannibal films with some frustratingly sloppy continuity errors. Tension and suspense are minimal apart from the beginning and the climax, the mystery elements are too obvious and too simple to the extent that they don't feel mysterious at all and there was just too much unintentional humour for it to be shocking. It was interesting potentially to see how and why Lecter turned out the way he did, it's just a shame that it was executed badly with the story nothing more than a clichéd and forced revenge story with a mess of done to death clichés and very little that's representative of Hannibal Lecter.Even worse is how it simplifies one of cinema's most iconic, mysterious and most complex characters/villains, Lecter's reason for revenge was reasonably compelling, though I didn't completely buy that it was solely that for why he became such a monster, and did succeed in garnering some sympathy but the motives for the rest of the murders felt pointless and ridiculous. That he had a back-story wasn't the issue, it was the contradictory and unneeded execution that was. Hannibal Rising also attempts to allude to the other films in the series but instead of being nice homages they just came off cheesily and nonsensically, especially the samurai mask alluding to Silence of the Lambs(which was also a contradiction).Overall, not terrible but hugely disappointing and the worst of an otherwise solid film series, as heavily flawed as Hannibal was it still had enough solid things to make it watchable. This just had too many frustrations and if it weren't for Lecter's presence you could have sworn it was something else entirely, that's how far removed it felt from the rest of the series. As much as an insult as Hannibal Rising seems to be to fans of the overall series, this review is a judgement on the film purely on its own terms as an overall film. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for European atmosphere, for cast and performances, for Gaspard Ulliel as inspired choice for lead role, for music, refined tension, for a form of rare delicacy of details, for romanticism or for Li Gong. a film about revenge who seems profound different by the other parts of Lecter series. the key could be the links between survive of young Hannibal and the gloomy past of Europe, the crumbs of late Romanticism and the drops of Oriental arts. the good script and the inspiration to adapt the novel without be victim of eccentric solutions. but, more important, it is the virtue to be a story for itself, a kind of oasis, explanation but, more important, testimony about a fight. a kind of gem. not brilliant, not extraordinary but lovely adaptation and good seed for reflection about history traces in a life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This series should have died with ?Hannibal"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read Thomas Harris' novel "Hannibal Rising" just shortly before the movie made it into cinema, thinking to myself, "what is the man doing?" Only later did I learn that Harris was afraid to loose control over his creation (the rights belonging to film-producer Dino De Laurentis) and must have literally written "Hannibal Rising" in frenzy, where there was no place for passion or inspiration. Hannibal Lecter no longer a charming yet dangerous sociopath but some warped, avenging anti-hero, something like a psychopathic Robin Hood? An aristocratic history that seems to have climbed out of a Hammer-Horror-film, a random Japanese aunt and pseudo-Samurai-ethics? "Hannibal Rising" would have made a mediocre comic-book, let along a novel. Or a movie. Expectation for the film-adaptation were low-to-non-existent and essentially were not disappointed.The root-problem sits at the core: who ever in their right mind came up with the decision to cast the French kid as lead-character (and was Absinth or any other hallucinogenic drug involved)? I could imagine him in some "Twilight"-movie (which I wouldn't have to watch because I'm beyond puberty), but that's about it. Where Hopkins (at least in the first two movies) both captivated the viewer and gave them the creeps, this kid trying to mimic Hopkins features and body-language is simply embarrassing. What is being performed here is the definition of ham-acting, no more and no less.At the very moment the Hannibal-actor raises the Samurai-mask to his face (and yes, you've seen "Silence of the lambs" and know which iconic mask it is supposed to resemble), I felt like leaving the theater. By the time the same non-actor carves an M on the main-villains chest and yelps "M for MEEE-SHAAAA", I wish I had followed my instinct.If anything good is to be said about "Hannibal Rising", it's an able cast of supporting actors (namely Rhys Ifans, Richard Brake and Kevin McKidd), or shall we say: the antagonists in a movie that doesn't have a protagonist. Same goes for Dominic West, who at all times seems uncomfortable chewing the dialog that the script puts into his mouth.This Hannibal isn't "rising" anywhere. It taints the franchise and predecessors "Silence of the Lambs", the underrated "Hannibal" and "Manhunter", making even the lackluster "Red Dragon" excellent in comparison. I can only give recommend: If you're a fan of the first novels / films and Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter, don't waste your time on this drivel and rather use your own imagination to envision Hannibal's past, present and future (it will likely be more imaginative and plausible than anything that Thomas Harris has dished out here).A further word of advice: watch the "Hannibal"-TV-Series and rinse your eyes with that. Takes a few episodes to get into, but at least it will make you forget this dreadful garbage here.3/10 for camera-work, a decent soundtrack and the supporting cast. The rest deserves nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not scary. It is just crap. How did I man who's family was kill by n.a.t.z.i.e.s in the war became a guy who kill people who had nothing to with it? Because he takes revenge for is parents and his sister and kill the n.a.t.z.i.e.s who killed them. Our it is because when the n.a.t.z.i.e.s kill his sister they force him to eat her. This movie makes no sens. According to this movie Hannibal is a kid in the war. By the time of Hannibal which is the last part to the is series in chronological order Hannibal should run from the F.B.I with a walker. The movie this is prequel to Red dragon is one of the scariest movies ever made. The original vegan man hunter is also very scary. But this movie is just pooh pooh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had its moments, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it was interesting to get some more background history to the Hannibal Lecter character, then "Hannibal Rising" wasn't really particularly interesting as the other movies.I am not saying that "Hannibal Rising" is a bad or boring movie, it is just very different from the other movies in the franchise. Good or bad? That is a matter of personal opinion of course.The pieces or segments of the movie that impressed me the most was the ones where we saw Hannibal's early childhood with his sister Mischa, as they were the most visually impressive and the most storyline-driven for the later movies. The movie sort of lost its momentum for me once Lecter got to Paris and right up to the end."Hannibal Rising" is a movie for the fans first and foremost. But for people not already familiar with the Anthony Hopkins movies, then "Hannibal Rising" is the movie to start off with, to fully get into the storyline and have the movies build up the story, instead of going from great movies (the ones with Hopkins) and then back in time to "Hannibal Rising".The acting in the movie was good, although I am not sure about Gaspard Ulliel portraying the young adult Lecter. He was just lacking that hint of devilish intellect behind his eyes that Hopkins had managed to put into the character. It was nice to see Gong Li in this movie, despite having a rather small role."Hannibal Rising" is entertaining, but for me it just wasn't fulfilling. And as such, then I am rating it a mediocre 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really great and I enjoyed it very much. I really like learning about the character of Hannibal Lecter. He's an intriguing character. I understand the point of this movie- getting revenge for his sister but there's something I don't understand. If he accomplished killing all the people who killed and cannibalized his sister, why would Hannibal keep going till he became the well-known serial killer cannibal? Why did he decide to murder and cannibalize innocent people?That's what I really want to know. I haven't seen the Red Dragon and I'm planning on watching that soon. Hopefully I will get the answer from that movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Hannibal Rising' is about the life of psychotic killer, Hannibal Lecter, and what led him to his cannibalistic ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film was sublime, owing to Gaspard Ulliel's dynamite performance. Throughout the film Hannibal's hair is a metaphor for his growing anguish and lust for vengeance. Following Mischa's untimely death, his hair is very short which represents his crippling pain as merely a fresh wound in the process of healing, ordinarily. As the film progresses, his hair is in time with his obsession to protect his loved ones, i.e. Lady Murasaki. He grows a fringe which he pushes to the side, this can easily be defined as a repression of rudeness as he later refers to it as an "epidemic" when he is justifying his murder of the butcher for being obscenely rude to Lady Murasaki. Towards the end of the film, Hannibal's hair is slicked back when he is being interrogated by Inspector Popil, much like Anthony Hopkins' in 'Silence Of the lambs'. Hannibal's evil can now, at this stage in the film, be easily identified by the naked eye. My theory is supported by a comment made by the Inspector moments later in the film, when he says that the only word left to describe Hannibal as he is now is "monster". I rated this film an 8 because although Gong Li's performance proved an interesting one, her character, Lady Murasaki sometimes irritated me, or was it her acting??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading opinions below I could help wondering what do people expect from a movie, or from this story in particular. For me this is not only the best movie in the series (along with Hannibal, 2001), but one of the best movies ever made. Gaspard Ulleil is absolutely fantastic actor, making it hard to believe that this is just acting. I share that opinion with a few of my friends who happen to be psychiatrists. They are unanimous: one could not do better than this ("he is just acting?!"). Of course, it is a must to know "how it all started" and why and from this aspect this movie is a perfect behavioral study. Excellent direction, well balanced story, extraordinary cast - this movie has it all. For me, the "original" - Silence of the Lambs - is the weakest point in this chain, but good nevertheless. Now that the series is "finished", you should watch chronologically and get your own opinion. There are many "franchizes" in movie industry but this one is by all means the best. Go for it and be open minded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply brilliant,of course with a new director comes a different vision but what makes Hannibal Rising such a wonderful addition to the Hannibal Lecter story is the amazing performance given by Gaspard Ulliel,a young actor who has since gone on to become one of Frances most popular actors.He is so believable as the tormented young Hannibal haunted by the visions of his sisters unfortunate end his mind set on seeking revenge on those who brought about his sisters death that in the process he becomes what we have all come to know him as Hannibal The Cannibal.I found myself almost cheering for him as one by one he seeks out and like his sister torments and executes each of the men who have made him into the monster he has become. Don't be fooled by the bad reviews the critics gave this movie,it stands alone as a worthy addition to the story of Hannibal Lecter with an amazing performance by a brilliant young actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>laughable... full of flaws!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, i've NEVER written a review before.. but i had to write one for this embarrassingly bad movie! I hope that it may save others from watching this piece of garbage. This movie is so full of flaws it's embarrassing. It would take me all day to write down every mistake in this film, but I'll try to keep it short. Within the first ten minutes, i should have turned it off, but of course, i had to see where the movie went because i had no idea. Turns out it just raised more questions. OK, let's start: 1. The obvious - the young Hannibal looks absolutely nothing like Anthony Hopkins' character. In fact, he couldn't be more opposite. He's very tall(?) has very sharp features(?) is very thin (?) and has a scar on his cheek that an older Hannibal doesn't have. And they didn't even take advantage of the idea that the evil rebels could have cut him while debating eating him, making unexplained scar. Whatever, on to the story. 2. The rebels expected to be recruited into the SS with their exploits, and they go on a rampage when they are not. Excuse me? The Nazis recruited foreigners directly into the SS?? Ridiculous. Any idiot knows that the Germans only promoted from within the purest of bloodlines into the elite SS units. 3. The Russian tank that stopped for water stared firing at a German plane a half mile away. This again is ridiculous. It's not a tanks job to fire at planes, especially one that was already occupied in a dogfight. Planes were used to obtain control of the airspace. 3b. In being shot at, the plane turns and starts attacking the tank on the ground. Oh, i didn't know that in WW2 planes could destroy tanks! Are you kidding me? How would a plane expect to destroy and armoured tank? And turns out, it can't. The only way that the tank was destroyed was by the plane crashing into it when it got shot down by the tank's own fire. And don't try to say that it was a Japanese kamikaze because it was clearly a German plane. 3c. Oh, wait after the plane crashed directly into the tank and a massive (and I mean massive!) explosion ensued, later in the wreckage, we see the plane laying on top of the tank with only a bit of the tail missing. The plane was hardly damaged, and you could still clearly see the paint and emblems undamaged. What??? Look for yourself. 4. When the rebels are in the house, and one guy comes in the house after being out looking for food, he comes back with a frozen animal leg with maggots, and a bird hidden in his coat. Remember? OK, first of all, any dead animals would be eaten by other predators. Usually, they wouldn't last overnight in the forest. And second, i didn't know that maggots can grow in freezing temperatures.. but, whatever. 4b. This is the most obviously for me. The leader finds the "hidden" bird in the guys coat and grabs it from him. He then immediately takes a bite into and blood and feathers go everywhere. This image is used a lot later in Hannibal's dreams to show the crudeness and blood, etc. It's a miracle that this guy is alive later, just happens to be living in Paris, another joke, and he's still their leader and doing just fine. This guy would be dead. You can't eat a bloody raw bird!!! Ever heard of salmonella, campylobacter or listeria?? Eating raw bird meat is deadly to humans, that's why we learned a long time ago that we must COOK things to kill bacteria. What are we teaching the kids out there? 5. All this killing and eating of Hannibal's sister you think would completely turn him off the idea of ever eating a human, but no. 6. At the Russian orphanage, he gets locked in a room with tons of rope, metal objects, and other equipment that he can use to his advantage. This is supposed to be punishment? Oh, this room also has a large (hidden?) tunnel leading out so that he can be free. 7. When he gets to his Aunts in Paris, he's quickly told that he's SURE to go to medical school. Why? He has no education, is not even from France and has no citizenship, and has absolutely no money. Even his Aunt is told that she will loose her mansion, i assume because her husband died, and they move into an apartment. So, who pays for his school?? And, not only that, but he apparently has complete run of the place, and is the only person allowed to be there and work at night. 8. Let's talk about their ridiculous accents. The rebel team is supposed to be Russian or Lithuanian, but they cast all British actors in the roles. During the war, they try to put on accents, but later in France, suddenly they have British accents, especially the guy from the HBO series Rome, Kevin McKidd, who is from Scotland, and Rhys Ifans, who is from Wales. Not to mention an unbelievably famous Chinese actress Gong Li who play a Japanese, but yes, that kind of garbage happens all the time in ridiculous Hollywood. People are stupid. 9. Gong Li's character apparently has a history of learning the ways of the samurai? Of course, because women were considered as equals in pre-WW2 Japanese society right? And women were allowed to be taught how to use a sword and not just pour tea? When did this happen? OK, I'll stop now because I'm getting annoyed and have wasted enough time on this movie already. DON'T SEE this movie. It's Hollywood crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Loved This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this movie. Hannibal Rising was beautifully filmed. All of the actors were excellent. Gaspard Ulliel's portrayal of Hannibal Lector was equally beautiful, sinister, and disturbing. The director reveals just enough information at a time to keep you glued to the screen. I was eager to know what turned a sweet loving child into a bloodthirsty psychopath, yet dreading the revelation of this knowledge all the while. All of the nit-pickers who find faults with the location and the continuity of this film must have nothing better to do than to watch a film over and over again, hoping to spot something to complain about. The wrong type of leaves on a tree or some blood on a knife where it hadn't been isn't enough to turn me against a film that I enjoy watching. It's obvious that a lot of hard work and talent went into the making of this movie. I feel that Hannibal Rising is greatly under-rated and unappreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted people expected it to be on par with the other three (four if you count manhunter) but that is the thing each film is about a different person. Red Dragon was about Graham, Silence was about Clarice, Hannibal was about Mason Verger, and This movie was about Hannibal. Now I don't know this guys priors but Gaspard Ulliel is a great portrayer and I can see how it is difficult for him to do this. If you had to be cast in a role that was proceeded by Anthony Hopkins and Bryan Cox you'd think you were SOL. However he did a great Job he took what made the other two so great and added some of his own. Now the one thing that did disappoint me was that Hopkins wasn't involved, they shoulda done like a 30 years later thing on the last victim even if it was a surprise cameo all Hopkins had to do was be at least seen. However I am somewhat glad for 2 reasons one, because people would praise Hopkins more and not give Gaspard any respect and two it leaves it open for the new guy to play Lecter in possible remakes of the original trilogy. I myself would only hope he would do well in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the movie I thought it would be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was stunned at how good this movie was. I'm not saying that it was a great movie, just better than I expected. Today in Hollywood, every successful movie has to be milked it seems. I figured this movie would just be milking the success of the other Hannibal movies. But it wasn't so bad of a movie. I actually think the reviews would have been better for the movie had it NOT been a Hannibal movie. Here's why. 1. This movie is a revenge film. In a sick and twisted way, Hannibal is the protagonist. If this movie had been released without being a Hannibal movie, I think people would have liked it more. As sick as Hannibal was, the people who he was killing were sicker than himself (they murdered and ate his little sister). Letting them get a taste of their own medicine is something revenge enthusiasts love to see. 2. While the actor who played Hannibal did a great job of acting, he didn't seem like he was the best actor for the part. We didn't see that freaky and glazed look that Hannibal has had under Anthony Hopkin's tenure. While he was quite charismatic, the young actor's version of Hannibal showed him to be less charming, more chaotic, and less mysterious. It was hard to see him growing up to be Dr. Lecter. If this weren't a Hannibal movie, this actor would have been absolutely perfect for the part of a charismatic but sadistic killer.This movie was still a pretty good movie. It's still a must see for Hannibal fans. Just don't be surprised when you have problems connecting young Hannibal with old Hannibal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An eerie, gruesome look at the contorting and ravaging of a young mind, "Hannibal Rising" traces the formation of a serial killer. Gaspard Ulliel manages the challenge of making a slender, young male character menacing, frightening and murderous.The early part of the film - boasting vividly effective cinematography - is the best. It plays out like a war version of a Grimm's fairy tale springing horribly to life, depicting the devastating wartime terrors thrust upon Hannibal as a young child and effectively pulling the viewer's sympathies over to side of a psychopathic killer. That's no easy task!The rest of the film is an odyssey of graphic revenge with a dash of Franco-Oriental exoticism thrown in. Although it is both riveting and revolting, this part of the movie is weakened by some incredibly unlikely coincidences in the stalking and fight scenes which deliver our anti-hero from an early demise. These coincidences push the viewer's capacity for suspension of disbelief to the breaking point; they call attention to the artifice of the medium and the film's verisimilitude is thereby damaged. In general, a good - not a great - film. Not for the queasy or faint of heart!</fullReview>

Accepting it for the "less than Oscar material" it obviously was, we were hooked tight to the film from the beginning and all the way to the end. The best way to enjoy this film is, in a way, to try to "forget" that it was supposed to be about the early formative years of Hannibal Lector - and see it as a fairly straightforward but well-constructed revenge thriller.The only thing about the film which strongly irritated me was the casting of the world's best known Chinese beauty film actress, Gong-Li, as a "Japanese" person (for goodness sake!). Given the "intellectual" property and standing of this (still enjoyable) film, I felt this casting was somehow demeaning of her international stature as an actress.I know I "shouldn't", but I wouldn't be too surprised that if a cheaply-priced DVD of the film comes up in front of me on the internet, I shall purchase it (even if it makes me feel somehow "guilty!").</fullReview>

He doesn't need to be killing or torturing somebody to make the viewers get scared, his own way of talk and act gives this sensation by itself. Li Gong was also perfect in the movie; she gave a romantic and seductive air in a heavy atmosphere.On the other hand, sometimes the rhythm is slow and takes too long until something happens.

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Hannibal Rising was released in theaters, I dismissed it with a "psssssshhh" and didn't give it a second thought. I immediately thought that Hollywood was reaching, hoping to resurrect yet another movie "franchise", if you will, and destroying it in the process. Well, I caught this movie on cable a few nights ago and I was pleasantly surprised.The feel of this film is different from the others. The glossy Hollywood veneer isn't quite so conspicuous and the lack of major celebrity actors works in the movie's favor. Yes, this is a prequel, but not as formulaic as one might expect. It's set in WWII era, but does not give the film a period-heavy feel. And while it does fall last in a string of Lector films, it creates a new spin on the character that is subtly different, but not defiantly so. Rather, this film seems to have been created and scripted to still follow in the same footsteps of previous Lector films but without trying to echo them. I would have liked for this film's exploration into Lector, his psyche and what made him the way he is, to have gone more in depth and given us more detail, but as it is, I felt this film was quite good. Especially the lead actor, Gaspard Ulliel.An admirable effort on a film that could have been much worse.</fullReview>

Harris wrote a good back story which gives us an insight into the origins of Hannibal's blood lust. Rhys Ifans (someone whose work I have never liked) was an excellent uber-villain and I for one relished his unpleasant end!!

		<shortDescription>Finally the roots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book was perfect, the film is even more perfect than perfect. It is exactly what we could have dreamed of. The story is the absolute logical explanation of the previous volumes about Hannibal Lecter and we cannot think of one detail in these earlier volumes that is not the direct consequence of what happens in this later volume that tells the infancy, teenage and youth of Hannibal Lecter. What makes it so fascinatingly believable is that this period of his life is situated in Lithuania during the war and in the Soviet union and in France after the war. The political elements, allusions or direct references are correct even if at times slightly simplified, for instance the butcher, the first victim of Hannibal Lecter's on the French territory, who was a collaborator during the war and took part in the sending of some Jews to deportation could go on with his profession in spite of the hatred he had accumulated among people because as a butcher he must have taken part in a lot of black market operations and most post war higher ups or councilors and representatives in his zone must have used his services in a way or another during the war, to sell the meat they produced on their farms or to buy the meat they could not have with the food coupons. But that lack of precision is already in the book. But a little bit of research on such a point, and others, would have made the film even more believable. The man Hannibal Lecter, and his psychology are really clarified. He was traumatized by what he went through and he never managed to get out of it, to forget it, to forgive the criminals, etc. But is a man that resilient to be able to forgive and forget seeing his own younger sister being cooked in her own copper bathtub and then eaten by a bunch of wild human beasts? I guess we would like to think so. But what we are sure of is that no matter how much you forget something, that thing remains in your mind and can manipulate you any time anywhere unconsciously. All people who suffer such traumas do not become criminals but most of them have some blank moments and their general attitude is either one of distantiation or one of extreme orthodoxy along some ethical or ideological line. For example we have not really thought of the impact of the torturing and execution of the early Christians on the very corpus of their beliefs and principles. How can some persecuted group defend the principle of loving their enemies who are putting them to death in atrocious ways everyday? That is what this film is all about and it shows how relentless the victim of such violence can become, and that is not vengeance. It is justice in the eye of plain humanity, in the eye of what they have suffered, in the eye of God even. But the good question remains to know where the police, or more generally the forces that are supposed to defend law, order, justice, freedom and many other principles, were at the time of the crimes. No one can answer even when one war criminal of that type is caught up like Papon in France who was tried in the late 1990s for crimes against humanity he committed in Bordeaux in 1944 after a complete career in the top administration or the government of the country. He was the police and the direct representative of the state in Bordeaux hence law and order in 1944. The problem we have to solve is then what do we do for these people who suffered such horrible crimes after the end of the period concerned. What do we do with the victims of the war in Iraq, both American GIs who come back completely disturbed and Iraqis who are going to be haunted by what they suffered for decades. There is no easy answer to that question.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

I won't go into details to prevent spoilers. The scenes during WWII were very well filmed and gave an authentic WWII-era feel to them. Much like Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. Hannibal's childhood was very well captured and he was very well played also. I know he's the bad guy in SIlence of the Lambs and all of that, but in this film he is portrayed as the good guy believe it or not. And all of his kills seemed to be justified in some way or another. However, later in the film you can start to see his present-day mentality show and start to become the Hannibal we all know and adore. All of the characters were very well played, all of the scenes authentic looking, all of the action well placed. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a bad movie but Ulliel ruined a lot of it with his performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I met Hannibal Lecter in the big screen was with the excellent film Manhunter.On that movie,Lecter's appearance was minimum but the brilliant Brian Cox made an extraordinary performance.Then,Lecter became in a popular character with the film The Silence of the Lambs in which Anthony Hopkins brought an excellent performance.Now,in Hannibal Rising we see the origins of Lecter.The film is not bad but Gaspard Ulliel was a very bad choice for the character.He ruined a lot of this film with his performance which is pathetic.Ulliel can never transmit Lecter's evilness and the moments in which he tried to be evil produced me accidental laughs.In other words, he was a very bad choice for the character.The other aspects of the film are good but they are nothing special.The film kept me entertained and the ones who are expecting to see a lot of blood will not be disappointed.But,in a movie like this,the most important element is the performance from the main actor and the film fails on that.In other words:Hannibal Rising would have been a much better film if a good actor was chosen for playing Lecter.But,at least,the film did not bore me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch for all Hannibal Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I was reluctant to watch this one thinking no little kid could do justice to the Character of Hannibal Lecter played by the cunning Anthony Hopkins! But the young man 'Gaspard Ulliel' exceeded my expectations, Fantastic performance by him!!! Cleverly directed, excellent locations and the Terror of Hannibal portrayed extremely well! A story of revenge and brutal murders, showing exactly how Hannibal became the Monster of a man he is! It is difficult to live up to the iconic brand of Hannibal and I have seen several reviews that put me off but two thumbs up to Webber, he delivered a great movie, A must watch for all Hannibal Fans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate doing spoilers so I'm not going to talk about the plot except to say that the principle goal of the movie is to explain why hannibal is a stark raving loony, and it does a great job of that. If you don't feel at least a twinge of compassion for him after seeing this movie, then you need to get your feelometer tweaked. Maybe get e-metered or something. I thought this was going to be a totally lame cash grab that was trying to milk the franchise to death. After watching for a while, I started to feel as if this movie stood up very well on it's own merit. My wife and I were drawn in, and really got into it without being totally grossed out unlike the other movie where he was feeding the other guy his own brains. The subject matter was very dark, but it wasn't quite as creepy as the first one with 'it puts the lotion on the skin'. I liked it. My wife liked it. Not the best movie ever made, but it greatly exceeded our expectations. It had a much different tempo than the first one, and in some ways I thought it was better in that they did a great job of re-creating the time period that this movie takes place in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intensely interesting, mostly a study in the mind of Lecter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone is well familiar with the Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins, and characters such as Clarice Starling and Will Graham seen in Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, and Hannibal. The character Hannibal Lecter redefined cinema, and the common idea of a "villain" as we know it. Many of the people who saw Hannibal Rising claimed it wasn't needed to show Lecter's background, but I thought it was... well, there isn't really a word for it. I've been in love with the character for years, and was thrilled to see him return to the big screen. I admit, I've wondered whilst watching Silence of the Lambs and the other films "What makes a person into something like this?" Thusly, Thomas Harris provided us with an answer. A lot of people hated this because it didn't include Anthony Hopkins. But what purpose would the film serve in featuring him? The Lecter in this movie is barely sixteen years old, roughly, making Hopkins too old for this part (though it would have been cool if they gave him a cameo at the end, with a subtitle reading "X years later") Overall, if you want to get to know the character, watch the other films first, and if you're interested enough by then, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Birth of a cannibal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the first introduction of the most famous cannibal in movie history, we have always been in the dark as to how a person could become so vile. Even though I have been asking this question myself a few times, I always thought it was better that we didn't know too much. The reason why Hannibal Lector is such an interesting yet frightening character is because of the lack of motive behind his killings.This is what "Hannibal rising" is set out to do. It provides us with a background story why an innocent kid eventually becomes one of the most notorious movie killers ever. To some extent, this works fine. However: this movie seems to focus a lot more on personal revenge than on his cannibalistic eating habits. Which is why it becomes hard from time to time to link this prequel to any of the other future films. It's a bit of a stretch to have to believe that a person who decides to hunt down a couple of criminals suddenly turns into a vicious man-eating mass murderer ... even if all deaths are of a gruesome kind. The ending of this movie is a bit abrupt too though.The choice for the part of the young Hannibal Lector is very good. The French actor Gaspard Ulliel may not be as great as sir Anthony Hopkins but he is definitely up to the task. The acting is riveting and the fact that the actor has a real-life scar in his face only makes the whole thing more creepy looking.In short: A good movie that lets you dig into Hannibal Lector's dark and disturbing past although the very knowledge that you gather here makes him more human and takes away some of that eerie mysteriousness that surrounded him in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece but well worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the whole I felt that it was easily the second best of the series.Sure, some things aren't explained - Hannibal descends into violence, viciousness and cannibalism because of what happened to his sister, but throughout the film he still seems to have a moral compass, however skewed.So how did he go from being someone killing purely for vengeance and a sense of justice (with the symbolic taking up of cannibalism along the way, of course) to killing and eating someone just because they were a little off in their musical performance, later on in his life? We just don't know.What made it for me though, was the moral ambiguity. I grew up watching films about cowboys and indians, rebels and stormtroopers, etc. You always knew who the 'goodies' were. Not in this movie - monstrous though his acts might have been, the people who he killed were undeniably evil.I often wondered what I would do in Hannibal's place, and I think that I'd probably go after them just as he did, although I'd make an exception in the case of the man with the daughter - maybe he'd genuinely changed, but the rest were just trash and killing them would prevent them from ever hurting anyone else.I wouldn't eat them though (just in case anyone was thinking of tracking down my IP address and notifying Interpol). In the end, I like forgettable action movies as much as anyone, but this wasn't one of them - it was something that genuinely made me think and question myself sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, Thomas Harris Really Did Write This Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HANNIBAL RISING may not be in the same league with its predecessors, especially SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it was written by the same author - both the novel and the screenplay - and so we must accept that the arc of the story of the murderous cannibal is intact. Where this version of how the child Hannibal became the crazed and bizarre man due to his witnessing the loss of his young sister to the appetites of hungry soldiers is less successful than the studies of the grown man is the lack of including the genius mind, epicurean stance, highly sophisticated art lover, and macabre sense of human relationships as shown in the boy to young man period.Filmed in beautiful color and atmosphere the story begins in WW II as stated above and as Hannibal the lad escapes the carnivorous appetites of the Nazi solders (including the evil Grutas as portrayed with gusto by Rhys Ifans!) and becomes Hannibal the young man (Gaspard Ulliel) who with the aid of his aunt Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li) continues to search out all of the soldiers who ate his sister. And in the end we do discover some hidden secrets about the now mature Hannibal Lecter.Director Peter Webber keeps the pace and the gore going and has at his side a fine supporting cast (Richard Brake, Kevin McKidd, Stephen Walters, Ivan Marevich, and Goran Kostic among others). Ulliel is credible in the minimal dialog is given and it probably is the fault of Thomas Harris that this young Hannibal doesn't show all the key characteristics he will eventually flaunt. It is not a bad film, just not one that will be remembered as well as the originals. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very distance second best in the Lecter film series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't mind this recent version showing the development of Lecter, and I rated it 2cnd in the "series" to Silence of the Lambs. I would say a far 2cnd as well. Personally, I much prefer MANHUNTER to any of these other Lecter films. The other two, Hannibal and Red Dragon were just grotesque and morbid exercises in celebrating this grisly character, and that's offensive to me. I actually do not have a fondness for the Lecter character and I think Hopkins overplays him, possibly because he views the character as cartoonish. It is certainly not his best acting and barely his average. In Lambs, he had fairly limited screen time and the hamminess was not too evident, plus he had character development to explore.However, the fascination of this character by some, to the point of adoration, is bizarre. Here is a character who if profiled on a Most Wanted program, would be reviled nationwide, but to certain film buffs becomes the subject of fan worship. I honestly hope for the day that some fictional investigator or detective will best Lecter and place him where he deservedly belongs.In regards to Rising, though, I found it to be an easy setup for Lecter fans and others, to contrast Lecter with the horrible Nazis and similar criminals, upon whom he takes revenge. Nazis and the like are easy to hate, and we are supposed to revile them as well because of the terror to which their victims were subjected. But it is also interesting how revisionist history will now show the Japanese as the victims in WW2, strongly hinted at here, since hipster and wannabe hipster white guys now must have Asian girlfriends.The growth of Lecter from seemingly normal kid to a killer without conscience is itself lacking in development, and psychologically suspect as well. It's the kind of instantaneous, external cause leads to internal character psychosis, result that pop film psychology loves because it fits the time allowed. Plus there are several inconsistencies in this character. Has he no conscience, or perhaps he does? The film vacillates.I wonder what a writer the caliber of Dickens would have done with the same basic setup? Certainly, Lecter would have fallen to the depths, but would have seen a way to rescue himself. But that's not something that would sell to this character's current fanatics (fans). Not a great outing, but compared to the tripe of Hannibal, Hannibal Rising is a relative masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Hannibal rise to the level of Silence of the Lambs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem that besets any sequel (or in this case prequel), is that the audience already knows the grander story and how the story will resolve itself. That being said, Hannibal Rising is a rare find in the Hollywood Franchise Machine. Gaspard Ulliel superbly embodies the creature that would eventual come to torture Jodie Foster and the rest of us in his later years. "Hannibal Rising" is a mind twisting head-trip that will surely entice the followers of the series, and may even bring a bit of new meat to the table.In Eastern Europe, near the end of World War II, a young boy watches his parents violently die, and then sees his younger sister gruesomely murdered by marauding soldiers. What he witnesses will change him forever, and the memory will haunt him through the years as he travels from a Soviet orphanage to the streets of Paris, always plagued by nightmares. And when his aptitude for science gets him accepted into medical school, he begins to hone the skills that will allow him to exact revenge upon those whom destroyed his family. Meet the young Dr. Hannibal Lecter in Hannibal Rising, the new film based on the best-selling novel by Thomas Harris (who also penned the screenplay).The plot is exactly as we would expect from Harris, with deep psychological ploys and a tendency to almost feel sorry for the young Hannibal. The major problem with this venture is that there is so much time issuing flashbacks and scene wraps, and not nearly enough time fleshing out Hannibal. The story strains at times to avoid the normal happenings that befall criminals in reality, as well as to try to blend in the horrors of German war crimes. Aside from Ulliel's superb portrayal of the mastermind of human delicacy, Gong Li gives an impressive performance as Hannibal's aunt, Lady Murasaki Shikibu. With nearly 30 films in her native country of Japan, Li's American debut borders on insulting to the highly acclaimed Asian actress. The plot stretches to give power and knowledge to a female lead whom, in historical context, could simply not exist. Li however, works with what she has, and brings to the screen a tension and power that helps drive the film and keep the story alive. Ulliel, an avant-garde veteran of the French prime program, also makes his American debut, but has a far better storyline ? obviously ? to work with than his constituent.All things considered, Hannibal Rising does manage to rise to the level of its predecessors. The cinematography is excellent, the locations are believable, and to watch Hannibal's humanity slowly die is worth the price of admission. A new legend has completed his saga. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is now fully amassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not brilliant but it could have been a lot worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My own personal opinion is that they rushed this movie out too soon. It's been less than a year since the book came out so they must have started making this right after the book was released. What they SHOULD have done was wait a while and make the movie properly. But on the whole, I was actually pleasantly surprised because it could have been a lot worse.This is obviously a very different type of Lecter movie because Anthony Hopkins is not in it. Instead the honour of playing one of Hollywood's most well-known and infamous bad guys falls to Gaspard Ulliel and he actually does quite a good job of it. You can see him trying to sound and look like a younger version of Hopkins and he succeeds in this. It sent a shiver down my spine when he has his victim tied to a tree and he is talking quietly but menacingly to him. I half-expected him to say "hello Clarice!" Prequels seem to be all the rage these days and the Lecter saga is no exception. This story goes back to Lecter's childhood in Lithuania and how his family suffered at the hands of first the Nazis and then the Soviets. Lecter escapes to western Europe where he settles in France and finds a surviving relative (Lady Murasaki played by Li Gong). He starts to study as a doctor but he is tormented by what happened to his sister during the war. He was there when she was taken by German collaborators but he can't remember what happened. He finally decides the only way is to travel back to Lithuania and find out the truth. When he does find out the truth, it unleashes a murderous fury which extends all the way back to France and finally the USA.When the body-count starts to ratchet up, Paris sends out a chief inspector to find out who the murderer is. He suspects Lecter but can't prove it. As Lecter kills and maims, he has the chief inspector snapping at his heels, determined to catch him in the act.All in all, the movie is surprisingly faithful to the book and isn't that bad to watch. But I can see someone in the future trying to do a re-make to better what was really a rushed movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie, marred by its main actor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead.There are many good things about this movie. In the context of other movies also featuring the Hannibal Lecter character, it provides some background and interesting "biographical" details. On its own, it's a decent revenge story, with an unusual depth to it---the act for which our protagonist seeks revenge turns out to have been at least ambivalent ethically, and most of the "bad" guys are actually not entirely evil (with the exception of the main bad guy, who just begs to be slaughtered).The movie is for the most part well executed, with some great actors (such as the beautiful and enigmatic Gong Li, and the amazing Rhys Ifans---the guy who ate the mayonnaise in Notting Hill, in a VERY different role) turning in excellent performances. Unfortunately, the main actor, Ulliel, isn't one of them. He has a number of scenes that just make you cringe, when he tries to affect evil madness, but just ends up looking ridiculous in his helpless overacting. He just isn't it.To me, that significantly spoiled the experience. Mad serial killer characters need to be played with depth and subtlety for the audience to care at least a little for them in spite of their horrible deeds. Hopkins did this with his Lecter, and Jeffrey Renner did this with his spectacular (IMHO) performance in "Dahmer". Ulliel, on the other hand, has no idea what to do with his character, and obviously just tries to produce facial expressions that he hopes will look like what he thinks they should. Consequently, when his character gets into trouble, you worry more about what this might mean for Lady Muarasaki, or the girl in the bathtub scene, than whether Lecter will get out of his predicament.It's still an okay movie, but with a better lead it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannibalize the Critics from the Tribune, Times, and Post...Hannibal Style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the person who currently has the most popular assessment of the movie, I do not recommend this film to "everyone". Those who are lacking in the ability to recognize the subtle intricacy conveyed in, arguably, the most complex and fascinating character of all time, I would strongly recommend that you do not watch it. In the collective unconsciousness of viewers who relish in the profound displays of raw brutality converging with exquisite refinement and intelligence, we do not wish our sense of enjoyment for this movie to be tainted by ignorant dullards who make their close proximity to retardation apparent by saying childishly inept comments like, "Der, dis movie iz umm borin' n gross".Nevertheless, those who truly appreciate seeing raw brutality, artistic sensibility, crafty intelligence, and bloodthirsty cannibalism coalesce into a masterpiece about the beginnings of a morbidly unique and abysmally deep character will be quite pleased by this stylistic triumph. Hannibal in this movie is the vicious opposition to all of fiction's dry and generically unrealistic characters lazily placed into the diametrical role of being either all-good or all-evil...this movie is a must-have in your collection. In it is a character, who, although a "monster", embodies someone who has just as much of an extreme sense of cultural civility as an extreme sense of savagery. If that is not enough to convince you to see it, or if you have a problem understanding the jargon in my above description, then this movie will be a waste of your time which could be better spent playing minesweeper or solitare. However, if even the lack of complexity in Juiliane Moore's loathsome and tediously inaccurate portrayal of Clarice in the movie Hannibal was not enough to ruin the movie for you because of your intense appreciation for the greatness of every other aspect of the movie, then you are in for a very pleasant surprise when you watch this one. Nothing ruins it. It is very similar to a great song that can be played over and over again, only to increase its meaning and enjoyability. -Paul Nathaniel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal falls below expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the Hannibal series, I must confess I was looking forward to this newest installment of the story immensely... and instead of Hannibal RISING to the occasion, I felt rather let down. The film failed to meet the expectations that its predecessors instilled in fans far and wide. The acting was mediocre at best, and the trademark charisma and sizzle of the character of Hannibal was missing entirely. Where Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal and Red Dragon had us biting our nails, sitting on the edge of our seats in suspense and our hearts beating uncomfortably loudly in our chests, regardless of how many times we'd seen the film, Hannibal Rising failed to continue the trend, no even instilling a modicum of alarm even at its most gruesome moments, which, compared to the other films, were considerably tame. Perhaps fans of this series should consider sticking to reading the book, which was fantastic. I myself plan on striking this film from my Memory Palace, and advise that others follow suit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing tale of revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read many reviews on Hannibal: Rising but the few people I spoke with prior to watching the film seemed to have mixed reviews when delving into the specifics, but in general found the film 'enjoyable'. The general sympathy however, was that the book was better; that usually seems to be the case anyway. Having never read the book myself, I think my opinion was somewhat less biased.Firstly, the acting: Gaspar Ulliel was a ~wonderful~ Hannibal! When I first saw him, I found him way too beautiful to play the part of a madman, but that faded quickly. What was once almost angelic became comparable to a black rose; beautiful but ominous and almost frightening, enhanced by Li Gong's performance of Lady Murasaki, who was both in love with and afraid of the young Lecter. Gaspar absolutely mastered the look of a psycho as he brutalized his victims in ways gore-hounds (like myself) would enjoy; slowly. Li Gong, as mentioned above, plays her part and really made me feel the kind of complicated love that would come from such a relationship. On a whole, however, I felt she was somewhat wasted and should have had more on-screen time. The character of Lady Murasaki was complicated and at times, as possible of brutality as Lecter, if only for his sake. I would have liked to see that more.Now that we covered the acting, on to the gore; GOOD STUFF! Seeing as this is a spoiler-free review, I can't delve into the details. Needless to say, however, there is plenty of blood and, in the case of a specific character, implied brutality that rivals Lecter's and shows not only the reason for his psychosis, but may actually have people rooting for him! How many movies actually have you rooting for the psycho serial killer? Not very many, at least that I've seen to-date.There are some pitfalls to the movie, I must admit. On many occasions, both Gaspar and Li's thick accents, though ridiculously sexy, had me rewinding the movie several times before I could understand what they said. A few times I gave up trying to understand at all and just made up words in my own mind to help progress the story along. There were also some scenes that, as typical of Hollywood, would have been much more interesting if the camera didn't turn away at the pivotal moment.On a whole, I found the movie very enjoyable and great eye candy. Definitely worth an hour and a half of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer I thought it would be like the original or Hannibal or even Red Dragon but it did not live up to the expectations that it's predecessors did. Granted, it had some great scenes like the forest scene and the beginning but it wasn't like I thought it was.The acting was stale and I expected a little more philosophical dialogue from Hannibal. Gaspard Ulliel, who plays Hannibal, plays him okay but I think he didn't show all of his potential, especially for an elegant role as Lector. Li Gong and Rhys Ifans were pretty good when the time called for it. The casting was superb but if the director could have encouraged the actors to put everything into it then it would have been better.I guess another factor was the whole 1940's to 1950's setting. I was waiting for them to get into the more recent years but they stayed in Europe, which to me just felt out of place. I don't know why but it just did.But the biggest disappointment for me was the ending. It's like he smiles and drives off. What happened? Were did he go? What happened to the guy? Is he going to the United States or what? It was too big of a cliff hanger and it was inappropriate. Overall the movie had some chills, some good dialogue, and some good scenes but don't waste more than $3.00 on it. I would not buy it.</fullReview>

Reading most reviews so far it seems that most reviewers don't know that the Lecter movies are adoptions to novels. It's the same as Bourne, Bond and a certain 'nobody' named Harry Potter. Looking at movies as a series is beyond immature. Unless its intended as an obvious link to previous movies in a series don't join the dots. The reviews I have read on this link show how ignorant people have come. Everyone knows about Silence of the Lambs movie but obviously not as a novel. How many out there think that Red Dragon is a prequel to Silence the movie? Red Dragon was the first novel. Then Silence of the Lambs came. To everybody out there that doesn't know this I call you - "dumbasses". I have given an 8 to the book. The BOOK!!!!!!!!!!! It exists. Some of you might need to brush up on your literate side. Movies don't come out of thin air. Some come from imagination, history and very often works of literature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a lavish production, with some spectacular widescreen photography and set decoration that you'd expect from a Merchant-Ivory film, rather than a gory serial killer thriller. That doesn't keep the film from being predictable at every step. Even though there's a tiny twist at the end, it's not much, and it's not hard to see it coming.A prequel film always has its work cut out for it, because there are certain things you know from the start (i.e., Hannibal survives). This makes it very tricky to maintain suspense, and here "Hannibal" falls flat on its face.The story is about Hannibal's unhappy childhood. During World War II, after the death of his parents, he and his sister are imprisoned in their house with a gang of brutal thugs. You can guess the rest. As soon as Hannibal grows up, he sets about getting revenge.Naturally, his late uncle married a Japanese woman (Gong Li) who's a skilled martial artist, so we get the usual "ah, grasshopper" scene, which helps explain Hannibal's invincibility as he destroys one after another of his enemies.The film's biggest problem is that it explains too much. Hannibal Lecter was terrifying in "Silence of the Lambs" precisely because his character was so mystifying and inexplicable. How could this charming, cultured individual also be a monster? Thomas Harris put his finger on the pulse of something real. For example, war criminal Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs and director of the some of the worst atrocities of the 90s Balkan War, was a practicing psychiatrist, and also known for his polished, urbane charm.Real evil like this is genuinely frightening, because it's so baffling. Once you explain the mystery away, especially with a by-the-numbers revenge fantasy like this, Hannibal is merely appalling. Added to that, for most of the film, we're encouraged to sympathize with him. His enemies are so outlandishly brutal and repulsive that we don't really mind his dispatching them. Only at the very end, when he seems to have morphed into the monster we love to hate, does the film ask us to disapprove of him, and by then it's a bit late.While the production values are high, the story is ridiculous and obvious, there's no suspense, and it's ultimately a remake of "Death Wish II", "Sudden Impact", and a zillion other Hollywood revenge pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They still haven't accepted that this is now mainstream Hollywood horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They are really trying...they really still want to make you believe that each installment of Hannibal Lecter is still artistic and critically brilliant and far more superior and intelligent than your run of the mill horror but I think that entire idea ended with Silence of The Lambs. That's not to say that Hannibal and Red Dragon weren't worthy sequels, quite the opposite in fact and Hannibal Rising goes in a direction that any Hannibal fan would want to see and with a very stunning and worthwhile predecessor to Sir Anthony Hopkins. The only issue is that instead of focusing on making Hannibal Rising truly horror entertainment they are still trying to make it look like that critically acclaimed film so long ago. Hannibal Rising immediately impresses by opening up on an extravagantly done World War II scene where the Lecter's are forced from their home and into hiding in their local cabin. I don't think any other film of this kind could boast this kind of War scene right off the bat and it really does hook you in. Unfortunately from there the film takes some rather slow and odd turns into obscurity and despite the very best attempts by screen writer and character creator Thomas Harris the film tries far too hard for it's own good.Who would even dare try to take over a role made famous by Sir Anthony Hopkins?? And think he could pull it off!! Young French actor Gaspard Ulliel and damn does he ever do it!! Ulliel's haunting accent, rigid movements, emotionless expressions...single handedly make this film worth while. He studied Hopkins' so closely that you actually see his movements mimic that of the older Lecter. Something in the eyes and the voice make you believe that this could be the younger version and that is exactly what they needed for the key to this film and Ulliel is brilliant!! The unfortunate part of all of this is that his performance is the only one that matters in the entire film. You probably have a great cast of actors but no other character is explored or even utilized in the film. There is barely co-stars but rather a huge cast of very supporting actors. His performance is terrific but you still need a good cast of characters to play off of. The closest who comes to co-starring is Li Gong who plays his mentor and trainer and sexual fantasy Lady Murasaki Shikibu. She has a few scenes with him and a few lines here and there but is mostly a very unimpressive character. Everyone is simply a victim or family member of Hannibal's and it's simply not enough.After the downright gory death scenes of 'Hannibal' I expected Hannibal Rising to take that to the max and it didn't. Granted he killed...a lot...and in most cases in some unique manner but not near the intelligence, creativity or gore that we have seen from previous installments. This was like the PG-13 version of Hannibal. I'm not sure that director Peter Webber has the experience necessary to take a cinematic legend and make this epic story around him. Hannibal Lecter could be played on a horror pedestal next to Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers but this installment seems to down play him significantly. It's not that it's not worthwhile because Hannibal Rising is entertaining, decent, story, good action but it just felt like it wasn't quite right...the way it should be. Still I hope that for the sake of all his fans the legendary Hannibal Lecter will rise again in some form or another and I pray that some day Sir Anthony Hopkins will rise again and play him just one more time. Until that day they should never have to worry about replacing him with a terrific performance and actor like Gaspard Ulliel. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A useless and crappy prequel, but a good horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(written March 2007)Prequels. How useless they are. I personally don't see a need for them, they always end up going too far back and just acting as fodder for Hollywood's wallets. They explain every detail of the past of the franchise, and end up dragging the story way too far away from the actual plot line, and into completely new territory. Hannibal Rising is no different, this movie pretty much veers off on a loooooong detour away from the glory days of Silence of the Lambs. I could say this was made as a cash grab, as it does seem a lot like it, but it's a book adaption, an addition to the series. Albeit, an unnecessary one, but this movie is good all the same.It's the story of how Hannibal Lector came to be the evil mastermind we know him as today. Telling us of how his family was killed by the Nazis in World War II, and how he witnessed the death of his sister at a concentration camp. Flash forward 8 years and Hannibal is still haunted by choppy, distorted visions of the past in his nightmares, not able to remember all of what happened. He escapes from a boy's boarding school and seeks refuge with the author of the Tale of Genji, Lady Murasaki Shikibu, who he becomes close to. And then he begins to seek vengeance on all those who killed his sister, killing them off one by one...becoming a monster.This movie is bogged down by quite a lot of things. For instance, we're barely given time to get to know Hannibal's family, as they are killed barely 15 minutes into the film. The whole first half hour of this movie is way too fast, and they're all dead before we know it. We don't see much of this boarding school he goes to, and they could've just scrapped that part of it, honestly. It lasted less than 5 minutes and he didn't even say anything.This movie doesn't explain why Hannibal Lector became who he is today. Rather, it careens off in a new direction and gives us a back story that we don't need. The Hannibal Lector series didn't need a back story, and now because of this Hannibal appears as more of an anti-hero then a true villain. Not a good move. Silence of the Lambs was fine on it's own, and would still be fine if this didn't exist.Despite all that I do like the movie, for if it were not a prelude to the Hannibal saga, then it'd be a decent B horror film ala SAW and similar films. The acting is mostly pretty well done, especially by our young Hannibal, Gaspard Ulliel, who delivers a thoroughly creepy performance. And the movie is nice and long, although both the beginning and end felt rushed. The kill scenes were very nice, and you really got to hate the Nazis. I do like this movie, and if it were a standalone "revenge" flick then I'd definitely give it a point or two higher. Recommended to horror fans, not necessarily fans of Hannibal Lector.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this prequel to the "Hannibal Lecter" series we see how an innocent little boy grows up to be an emotionless monster that seeks revenge for his little sisters death whom he seen get killed &amp; eaten by Nazi war criminals. 8 years pass &amp; he moves in with his uncle &amp; his wife. From there, Hannibal is accepted into medical school &amp; finds he has a fondness for art &amp; music. Soon he is hunting down each of the criminals who committed the deed &amp; bumping them off with ghastly relish until only he &amp; the leader of the criminals remain, a heartless, cold blooded villain that will reveal a shocking secret to Hannibal that he never knew &amp; will shake him to his very core. Upon hearing about this prequel going into production, I was quiet worried that Hollywood was biting off far more than it could chew, the fact that we were getting not only another Hannibal Lecter movie, but a prequel at that, had me feeling skeptical, I mean to be honest, another sequel much less a prequel to one of the silver screens most interesting, yet at the same time terrifying cannibalistic villain, wasn't really needed, in fact even though I greatly enjoyed this movie (I actually prefer it over RED DRAGON &amp; HANNIBAL) I still couldn't help but get the thought out of my head that this prequel was really only written by THOMAS HARRIS (Based on his novel) in order to make more money off his popular most, memorable character &amp; pumped out by a Hollywood studio with the same intentions, regardless of this fact, I greatly enjoyed HANNIBAL RISING, I felt it had a very interesting premise &amp; was much more involving &amp; interesting regarding Hannibal's character than previous films in the series &amp; had an very great cast in the roles to help make the movie &amp; it's characters all the more enjoyable. GASPARD ULLIEL filled the role of Hannibal quiet nicely &amp; made the character very enriching &amp; fun to watch &amp; the suspense was nail biting! great direction too. A definite must see for Hannibal fans. You won't be disappointed with this edge of your seat thriller! Followed by RED DRAGON/MANHUNTER**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course they don't. They don't share borders on this planet. But to a casting director this ignorant of world geography, this type of thinking is quite possible.I'm trying to understand the casting director's thought process for casting this movie."Okay, we'll hire a French actor with a heavy French accent who has trouble pronouncing R's to play a role made famous by an English actor who converses with an extraordinary clarity, and, lets' see, we'll hire a notoriously bad Chinese actress to play a Japanese Character." Dude, get out a map. France and England are totally different countries. Same thing with China and Japan. What's next, a Mexican playing George Washington? Don't get me wrong, Ulliel is a tremendously talented actor and he's surprisingly convincing in capturing the emotional center of the role. But the accent... oh, the accent. It will drive you up a wall.Gong Li and a paper bag. You know where I'm going here. The moment she pops up into a picture, you know that substance is being sacrificed for style. She's absolutely gorgeous, but to compare her acting ability to cardboard would be an insult to cardboard.I could also complain that the plot's been done a thousand times before, but you know what? I've seen it a thousand times and I still enjoy it.Those are the extent of my complaints. Other than that, I thought it was okay. Beautiful cinematography, a nice brisk pace, along with a fascinating looking into the creation legend of one of the silver screens most beloved villains. It's worth seeing, but definitely, expect to gnash some teeth at least once during the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...not about Lecter. This would've been a great serial killer movie on it's own. Although Gaspard Ulliel did a superb job as a serial killer, he wasn't Hannibal. I did enjoy the photography and the all around feel of the film. I actually found myself rooting for the supposed bad guy which only goes to show that there are badder guys than the bad guy. The way I read about Lecter was a smooth calculating monster who eats parts of his victims. Lecter was a psychologist. ZIt just didn't feel as tho this was tied to what we know as tried and true. I didn't expect another "Silence Of The Lambs" but in my opinion,this was a good film about a serial killer but not Lecter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries and Fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I loved the book. I think it was an excellent, well paced and romantically characterized story. It is very unlike the second two Hannibal stories (a bit like the final), and that is okay. Harris did a phenomenal job of coming up with a truly unique and unspeakable evil to serve as a catalyst for creating one of the most unique and intriguing movie villains (?) in history.Where the movie fails is in its ability to capture the romance of the novel. It fails to show Hannibal's aristocratic roots, his love of high culture and civility, which are the consistent source of his passion throughout the series. His uncle is absent in the film, as is his early educational background, and the relationship with Lady Muraski much too simplified. In a sense, it devolves into a lackluster revenge story, nothing more.The film does a great job capturing the scenes with Mischa as well as the looting, but absolutely destroys its own credibility with a mind-blowingly stupid scene in which Hannibal affixes a "Samurai Mask" to his face that just so happens to be identical to that he will wear years later in a Maryland detention facility, for which he is so famous. This is an absolute insult to any rational movie-goer, and was clearly thought up by someone in the marketing department who thought of a cool poster idea (which they used).In conclusion, I don't blame them for not being able to pull the aura and atmosphere, the romance, of the book off. It's really hard to do. The movie did not need Anthony Hopkins to be good, it just so happens that it wasn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal: the making of a monster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Webber directs and Thomas Harris provides an intense screenplay from his novel...another chapter in the Hannibal Lecter saga - the beginning. In Eastern Europe, World War II is waning and the atrocities go beyond nation against nation, it seems to be personal survival. An eight-year-old Hannibal(Aaron Thomas) witnesses the death of his parents and is left to care for his sister Mischa(Helena Lia Tachovska). The death of his parents pales in comparison to the brutal death of his beloved Mischa; it will change his life forever. All alone, fending for himself Hannibal leaves a Soviet orphanage and flees to Paris to live with his uncle's beautiful Japanese widow, Lady Murasaki(Gong Li). She bonds with the young man as he enters medical school, where he will hone his skills to avenge the death of Mischa. He becomes obsessed with seeking out the war criminals of his nightmares...and dealing out horrific punishing death. Hannibal Lecter...cannibal, serial killer...monster. Gaspard Ulliel is superb as the cunning, rising Hannibal. Also in the cast: Dominic West, Rhys Ifans, Kevin McKidd and Ivan Marevich . Grisly violence and very disturbing content. Don't be ashamed to flinch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Rising - the start of a 'monster'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to Hannibal Rising having seen the other films in the Hannibal series, Silence, Red Dragon and Hannibal and having read nearly all the books.Hannibal Rising of the books gives a far more rounded and fascinating character than the film. There is greater depth and warmth which makes the person far more than the two dimensional character 'monster' of the films. Certainly, Brian Cox, Anthony Hopkins and Gasper Ulliel help to flesh out the man but for the real Lecter, read the books.That said, Hannibal Rising has a rushed feel to it but it isn't a bad film. Ulliel, as the young future doctor and tormentor/friend of Clarice Starling (and in the final book, her lover) is very good. Presumably, he has watched both Hopkins' performance and Cox's to get all the foibles and 'ticks' of the character just right.The film gives us that rare reason as to 'why' Lecter became as he did. He was certainly not born a killer but due to the brutality of the second World War and the actions of a group of Eastern Europe thugs who kill and eat his sister out of contempt and desperation, he swears revenge on them. Despite trying to live a life free from trouble and enjoy a relationship of sorts with his step-aunt Lady Murasaki, through his vow to Mischa, his dead sister, he is forced back to killing. With a certain sort of relish, Lecter becomes a very accomplished murderer. From the rude and nasty butcher who insults his relative and would be lover to the group of thugs he is forced to confront, Lecter slowly gains his revenge and then the film ends. After that, we are finally to speculate that until the events of Red Dragon, Silence and Hannibal, he becomes a doctor and enjoys (or tries to) a life of good food, fine wine and pleasurable, agreeable company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing of quality is Rising here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many instances in film history where actors become permanently related to a particular character. Johnny Weismuller was forever Tarzan, George Reeves became Superman, Bela Lugosi could rarely be thought of other than as Dracula. Typecasting, while not gone, is perhaps less prevalent today, but there are still actors who find themselves immediately recognized as a particular character. Anthony Hopkins in the role of Hannibal Lecter is one of those. While he was not the first actor to essay the part on screen (that was Brian Cox in 1986's Manhunter), he made the role inseparable from his visage with 1991's The Silence of the Lambs, and then furthered the connection with follow-ups Hannibal and Red Dragon (which was a remake of Manhunter). So, the thought of a film featuring the character of Hannibal Lecter without Hopkins in the role is immediately suspect, before anything else has been accomplished on the project. In the case of Hannibal Rising, the origin story of Hannibal Lecter, the filmmakers compound the lack of Hopkins' presence with the unfortunate reality of making an absolutely abysmal film in almost every capacity.The film, penned by novelist Thomas Harris who created the Hannibal character and has written all the novels featuring him to date, opens during World War II, as the Nazis are invading Lithuania, home of the Lecter family. They flee into hiding in the woods, but are eventually discovered by the invading forces and Hannibal's parents are killed in a accident near the hunting lodge they have taken refuge in. Shortly thereafter, a group of Lithuanian traitors who believed that the Nazi's would enlist them in the cause but eventually discovered otherwise , led by the brutal, immoral Grutas (Rhys Ifans), arrive at the hunting lodge and take Hannibal and his sister, Mischa, prisoner.Eventually, Hannibal emerges alone from the woods some time later with a chain around his neck and an unwillingness to speak. He is sent back to his family home, which, after the fall of the Nazi regime, has been transformed into a Russian school, where he grows to young manhood (in the guise of Gaspard Ulliel). He eventually escapes the school and arrives at the home of his Uncle's widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), who takes him in and teaches him martial arts and various other exotic skills. Hannibal eventually enlists in Medical School in Paris, and has learned to begin taking his unhappiness and frustration out on others in the form of deadly, typically lethal, violence. Hannibal discovers that those who held him captive as a child are still alive and he plans to take revenge against them for the things that he begins remembering happened.Thomas Harris has never been a particularly prolific author, but most of his novels have been met with critical acclaim. With Hannibal Rising, he proves that his ability to write must be deteriorating quickly, and that he also has little real understanding of the character he created several years ago. Hannibal Rising, by design, is supposed to introduce us to the character and show how he came to be what he is later in life, but fails miserably at this task. The events which occur offer little or no insight into the character of Hannibal Lecter at all and suggest that his experiences during the war made him into a monster. Yet, it is difficult to believe that what occurs in Hannibal Rising would actually shape him into a killer of random individuals, as Hannibal is depicted later in life. This is a revenge tale, but how does taking out revenge on those who wronged you in the past transform you into a multiple murderer later in life against people who have nothing to do with the events that scarred you. Harris seems to be grasping at straws to create a backstory for Lecter where one isn't really necessary.Adding insult to injury, while Harris is busy damaging the character he created, lead Gaspard Ulliel is also turning in a terrible performance in the role of Hannibal. If we are to believe that Ulliel is attempting to mimic Anthony Hopkins' performance to some degree, then apparently Hannibal Lecter speaks slowly, with unnatural pauses inbetween words, draws out almost every syllable to an extraneous degree and sounds like he is reading words off a page in front of him. Ulliel's performance is uniformly bad, sounding like a man who is attempting to imitate what he believes to be sophisticated speech but just ends up looking ridiculous. Gong Li proves to be a little more adept with her English language dialogue than she was in Miami Vice, but hardly manages to impress in the role of Lady Murasaki. She is gorgeous to look at, but the film provides her with nothing to do.Hannibal Rising is competently photographed, including one eerie-looking scene in a room containing a pool filled with green liquid, the music score is present but doesn't really resonate, and that is about all that can be said that is positive about Hannibal Rising. The script is terrible, the lead actor equally so, and so eventually you find yourself just counting the minutes till the film is over, assuming you haven't turned it off yet. Unfortunately, no one's stature will be Rising who was associated with this dud.</fullReview>

I thought the story line to Hannibal was good, and if anything it was rather a revenge movie than anything,I in fact enjoyed this movie more than i would have though, i also think that Gong Li and Hannibal gave great performances with chemistry.View it before you say no!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal fell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing continuation of the Hannibal Lecter franchise finds the iconic cannibal slipping from mediocrity into laughable exploitation. Though it is filmed on a decent budget, and lensed to appear as quality, this unfulfilled origin story plays out like the intellectuals' Friday The 13th. Hannibal Rising does not shy away from it's share of disturbing violence, but without much depth to back up the bloodshed, the film feels little more then an artsy version of Saw.Primarily, outside of the mediocre script (penned for the first time by original author Thomas Harris) the main fault lies with the casting of this younger Hannibal. Producers must have known it would be tough to find someone in their early twenties who had the ability to portray this menacing psychopath with some believability, making the casting of young Frenchman Gaspard Ulliel seem like at least they were taking casting seriously. Ulliel may bring the suave euro-vibe that was needed, but does little else then gaze unrelentingly and unconvincingly while bathed in blood in futile attempt to disturb. Instead, most of his scarier scenes come across as slightly self-conscious and a tad silly. It is true that he was not given the proper script to work with, but time spent recording an empty glaze in his eyes which viewers are supposed to equate with a murderous lust just reiterates the production was more concerned with style then substance.And it is basically that style over substance which robs the lukewarm revenge-oriented plot of any forward momentum. We watch as Lecter tracks down a group of soldiers who have profoundly wronged him as a child and proceeds to torture with rapturous delight, and we care little. No good amount of time is spent developing any of these antagonists past the point of a stereotype, so many viewers will feel severely underwhelmed when placing stock in Hannibal's grisly motives. As the film reaches an obnoxiously hypocritical resolution, one can only sigh at the potential one such project detailing the young life of one of Hollywood's most lovable cannibal killers held.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising was not particularly brilliant and could have probably done a lot better.my main concern is with the script itself which seems to add a lot of material that just was not necessary (e.g. kendo practice and Bushido code which was definitely never a part of Hannibal's mentality) and exclude a lot of things that we discover about Hannibal in Silence of the Lambs and sequels. Although this movie does try to juggle the idea of how a twisted person like Hannibal Lector came to be and what must have happened to him in the childhood, I definitely didn't feel satisfied and frankly, it was way too mellow in general. The most gruesome thing we see him do is nothing compared to what he does later on.Also, the profile itself is completely off the real profile of a serial killer. The trauma that we see him experiencing in the childhood would have never made him what he was in sequels. trying to justify a creation of serial killer through 'vengeance' is just ludicrous. It's not the mentality that we find in so many cases of serial killers we know today.And although the directing was okay, I thought it could have been done much more spectacular, seeing how subsequent movies are a lot better.overall, this is worth a watch just for the sakes of watching. But I wouldn't make this a collector's movie and would probably never even bother buying a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deteriorates into boring film-making after an OK beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's make it known right away that this is my first Hannibal movie. However, after surviving this expose, I don't have much enthusiasm to watch any others in the series- even critically-acclaimed thriller The Silence of the Lambs. What hurts Hannibal Rising so much is that there's nothing too it- a thriller which bores you. After an interesting beginning, the film began a down spiral of unmemorable events and pointless murders.First things first: everyone is bitching about Hannibal Lector and how longtime Hannibal actor Anthony Hopkins didn't play him. Well, too bad for you- he's gone. After all, this is a prequel, so it would make little sense to have a senior citizen somehow play a man who's supposed to be a young adult. Then again, I probably wouldn't have noticed if he got crammed into the script and replaced Gaspard Ulliel as our deranged killer. The thing is, Ulliel does a very good job playing the part of Hannibal. He is an intriguing actor who does what he can with a misplaced role. Like my friend said who was watching the movie with me (and he really enjoyed the film?somehow), "Ulliel is the only good actor in the film." But then again, he failed to mention Gong Li, who does a nice job playing the part of Hannibal's wife who lives in France. She introduces Hannibal to her Asian rituals, which are arguably the most enjoyable parts of the movie. All the other actors/actresses are either unimaginative (the Nazi's), bland (the head Nazi's) or they will never be remembered again (I can't remember any).Hopefully, we all know that movies can still be good even if most of the characters are underwhelming. Remember The Day After Tomorrow? Of course you do! That film featured a corny love story and eye-slicing acting (for the most part), but that movie was still a monster success. However, Hannibal Rising doesn't have either the special effects nor the imagination that Day After Tomorrow had. The movie, after the solid beginning, drained away to something like this: 20 minutes of boredom followed by a vicious, gory kill. Then repeat the process over and over again. Luckily for us, director Peter Webber spares us and gives us a few brief scenes of real tension that actually had me really interested in the movie.Maybe I'm being too tough on the film. It is possible that I may've enjoyed it more had I seen at least some of the others in the series. But with this being an advertised prequel, I shouldn't have to watch the other's first to understand how they all came together in this. It makes no sense. Not only that, but Hannibal Rising is just plain dull. When it comes down to it, it doesn't really take much to impress me when it comes to movies. After all, eyeball my previous reviews. Most of them score above average in terms of the grade they get (C+ or better), and I've never given a movie an 'F'. As long as a movie isn't intentionally confusing, gore/torture-thirsty, and unimaginative, I have no problem with it. Hannibal Rising fails in most of those categories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the 1950s World War 2 scene during the German invasion of Europe, a kid's heart was torn apart as he slowly witnessed the massacre of his family members (who sought refuge over at a lodge from their château) right in front of his eyes. And if that's not enough, wait till you find out more. A small group of German SS soldiers wannabe, whom detached from their main company upon the lost of a battle; looted all they can from the surrounding houses and the military equipment, whatever's left of it. Having put into a situation of restriction due to the multiple road blocks organized throughout the streets; the MP's were given a direct order to silence all enemy soldiers and looters of war. Receiving this news over the radio truck they were in, about 7-8 of the small squad of looters set for a small lodge where the boy and his family sought refuge. Prior to this, all but he and his sister were killed in a small battle confrontation just outside the lodge.Back to the small squad of these German fighters which puts the storyline on the run - they took over the lodge with much ease and decided to keep the children for negotiations of hostages if they were caught by the opposing army. Time went against their patience and their physical capabilities, as the blizzard gets stronger and the security around them heightens. Their decision of hunting soon became impossible due to the strong winter storm, in which upon then, to survive from the lack of food amount, they murdered the little girl and carried out an act of cannibalism. It is during this scene that the audience will be sent back in time to view the flashbacks from what Hannibal dreams every night he closes his eyes. About a fraction of everything, he was not capable of remembering the full picture as he was semi-conscious.But that's all about the main plot of the story which is more than enough to throw the little boy's mind into confusion initially, depression and sadness, loneliness, solitude and weakness. He faced a hardship much more severe than any of whom could have felt. Such innocence were wrecked and turned into an evil beyond human description. He made a pact and promised Mischa that he would avenge her. Despite all the movies which depict hatred, evil and vengeance, this movie (author) crafted the implications with such beauty, suspense, evil and hatred that you would feel the edge of your seat moving in every murder scene.The little boy spend most of his growing up years in his own house which was converted into a monastery and an orphanage. Even at his years of growing up, he had already shown much enthusiasm and eagerness towards revenge, being self-satisfied over his act. He managed to escape from the orphanage and discovered from his mother's documents; his uncle's address in France with a photo of he and his Japanese bride, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). He left for France and it wasn't long that he came to the knowledge of his uncle's passing away about a year ago as a victim of war. While staying with his aunt, he learnt the technique of the Japanese samurai in which he eagerly applied this new skill of beheading and displaying the head on his first victim who tried to embarrassed his aunt.His hatred grew stronger upon his needs and desires to find out the murderers of his sister, and most of the remaining scenes would show you his adept cannibalistic skills and basic instincts in eliminating his enemies in a most spine-chilling yet skilled manner. Though claimed a thriller, it contains a strong inch of horror in each murder scene, enough to send you appreciating the comforts of the arm-rester of your seats. A killer with plenty of instincts but no guilty-conscience and furthermore without any reaction towards anything, he was described as a monstrosity towards the population that displeases him; those who owe him and the ones he loved. But then again, he's had no more room to love...Highly recommended for those who've watched the older prequels of Hannibal movies - Red Dragon and Hannibal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as people would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first things first. Hannibal Rising is nowhere near as good as The Silence of the Lambs. The two films are impossible to compare. Now that we have that out of the way, lets look at Hannibal Rising on its own grounds, shall we? Firstly, we'll look at the flaws. Despite being written by Thomas Harris, the original author of all four Hannibal novels, the script is mediocre. Most of it is fine, but there are some moments that could be handled far better. The part where Hannibal gives exposition by talking to his family photo is cringe worthy.The direction, however, is top notch, as is the acting. Gaspard Ulliel crafts a fantastic young Hannibal. Gong Li is also very good, as is Rhys Ifans.I could go into more detail, but the fact of the matter is, the good outweighs the bad, making Hannibal Rising a worthy entry to the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising I was not going to see this movie because most places the movie rating was average. With nothing to do on a Sunday, and the sun shining bright in the afternoon in Amsterdam I thought of venturing out for this Hannibal trilogy, knowing quite well that the movie would not be so good.We might have seen "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991) and / or "The Hannibal" (2001), this is the first part of the same story of Hannibal's transformation from an innocent child to a monster. Sounds interesting! The movie starts in World War II setting, when Nazis have attacked France and 5 Nazi soldiers take refuge in a house, and kill and eat Hannibal's younger sister Mischa to survive. Hannibal grows up to be a young medical student and takes revenge on the 5 soldiers one by one. This is the simple plot of the story.The movie is okay; quite entertaining (if you forget the earlier sequences of Hannibal) in terms of projecting an anti-hero who gets sympathy of audiences. The movie evolves from a war movie, to closely lingering to a love story before taking a nose dive to a revenge saga of seventies movies. At the end I felt as if I was watching a Chinese or an Indian Bollywood movie, where justice is done and all villains are killed by the hero.Gaspard Ulliel who plays Hannibal is sincere but is no match to Sir Anthony Hopkins. If you compare this with earlier Hannibal sequences ? this is like a third rate movie, so let us not compare it and spoil the show. Li Gong as the lead lady looks and acts beautifully ? she plays the aunt and love angle of Hannibal.The production values are very good ? throughout the movie. The Director Peter Webber has done a good job ? but tried to make this movie too commercialized.When the movie started after half an hour my rating was 7 out of 10, then it became 6.5, then 6, and I think at the end of the movie I will settle down with..5.5 Stars out of 10.(Stars 5.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the continuing saga of the world's most cuisine-conscious serial killer, I saw now the 4th installment. As before, the ending is open, so there is room for a sequel or more prequels. If this one was From Minor to Major, will we see the same kind of succession as with the Adrian Mole books: The Wilderness Years, the Gillette Years, the Butcher's Apprentice Years? This movie recreates 1950s France as its setting quite stylishly, and it leads you into a Jean Genet world which is filled with twisted individuals, sophistication and raw perversion. As recycled items, one can espy masks, blades, operation tables, swords, boars, handcuffs and other trademarks that the makers have picked up from the previous installments.Seriously speaking, in this one Hannibal "bares" his heart, which beats to the memory of his dead sister, Mischa Lecter (not Barton). I am sure that I won't spoil the fun for many a moviegoer by saying that our man will avenge for her in a dozen ways. Killing all the killers should be enough for any Democrat-minded average jilted citizen, but Mr Lecter is of a different tribe. He is the most vindictive right-winger that you can find, and such he remains after his formative years.Young Lecter and Lady Murasaki steal the show frame after frame. Even though he looks quite adolescent, he has spent time learning well enough the manners of Anthony Hopkins' Lecter: wagging the finger in mock reproach, moving slowly, putting on the devilish "You're gone" smile and using song and dance as entertainment during acts of homicide. She is dignified and something Hannibal can look up to as a sparring partner and calm conniver. A French-Japanese late upbringing under the aegis of the Hiroshima-orphaned aunt Lady Murasaki sends envy down my spine. What a great first girlfriend would that woman have been! Hannibal's unrequited monstrosity is of course another matter, as Murasaki says: "What is there left in you to love?" A French lieutenant says that there is no other word to describe the young Lecter than "monster", but I disagree. Even then people probably knew the monikers "sociopath" and "psychopath". Hannibal is both of them, since he both taunts his victims before he kills them (sociopathy) and then kills them (psychopathy). Because Hannibal often leaves the intestines and other stuff intact and focuses on the soft outer tissues such as cheeks in the bad guys, there might be room for an eating disorder in him, too. Maybe he's afraid of some small bug in the flesh, which causes brain damage? And the cure? 300 years of listening to "Intensive Care" at the Robbie Williams Memorial Hospital for psychoes.Hannibal is an anti-hero and gorefiesta for the highbrow set. If you count yourself among them, you will get your fill, but inside of you there may be a small voice which says that Hannibal is one-dimensional. Enjoy the ham. Have cognac afterward to smooth over the bloody aftertaste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the movie fails ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first heard of that there would come a prequel to the Hannibal story i was very happy. At last we would come to see what the story was behind the man.After all , the one burning question in our minds was: " Why was Hannibal doing the stuff that makes him Hannibal?" And that question was the reason why i wanted to watch this movie.Sadly to say it was also the same question what led to a disappointment after watching the movie.The movie tells nothing about why Hannibal does what he does.We only get to see a child who had his sister eaten before his own eyes and wants to payback the people that killed his sister.The reason for his killing in the movie is pure revenge. BUt wasn't the Hannibal that we came to now from the other movies a man driven by something else then revenge. Why didn't he stop the killing after he had his revenge? Who was his first innocent victim? Not the people in Hannibal rising , that's for sure. They were all villains. And its exactly those questions that needed to be answered. But unfortunately the movie doesn't answer those questions at all.And for that reason the movie fails for the purpose it was made.At the beginning of the movie you'll see young Hannibal having the chance of cutting someones throat at his former mansion (at the orphanage house). He doesn't kill the person and walks away! Why? Cause the person in question isn't his purpose for revenge. He only wants to kill those who took his sister from him. But after the revenge we don't get to see what the reason is why he kept killing people. The only thing u'll get to know is, is how Hannibal could manage to eat and cut people without throwing up and not what drives him to kill people. Afterall in silence of the lambs he doesn't have to get revenge! And that's why i think the movie is a 6 worth for the movie on its own. But as a sequel it is a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Rising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to add my voice to those who disagree with the reviews panning "Hannibal Rising." I enjoyed it. As a matter of fact - I enjoyed it immensely. I thought it was exactly the movie it was meant to be. Gaspard Ulliel is a wonderful actor and was perfect in the part. Gong Li is perfection always and Kevin McKidd was great. One minor flaw was the martial arts aspect of his relationship with his aunt - a little silly. More exploration into their physical attraction for one another would have been fun. Technically, it was stunning. The cinematography was stellar and the locations were a feast for the eyes. I feel like "Hannibal Rising" did a fine job exploring the making of a criminal. I appreciated the fact that one comes out of the film with ambivalent feelings regarding the "evil" Hannibal. Reality is never black and white. Evil springs from somewhere and it is always enlightening to explore that aspect of a story. I'm not sure what critics are looking for sometimes. It wasn't meant to be "Gone With the Wind" or "La Dolce Vita;" it was a "Silence of the Lambs" prequel and as such it was pretty close to perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to "Batman Begins" Hannibal Lecter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 years ago, Chris Nolan and David S. Goyer accomplished the most remarkable task: to turn a superhero that had become a joke for nearly 7 years into once again one of the most respected icons in both comics and movies. Through the process of telling the origin story of the frightened boy who would become the very reason people should be afraid of the dark and by doing in a fashion that also seems canonical to the often-times messed up continuity and make us care for the character. After this movie, Sony Pictures decided to "Batman Begins" James Bond in the new Casino Royale, Rob Zombie is doing the same with Michael Myers in Halloween(technically it's a remake, but it's also a re-invention), and now they've decided to "Batman Begins" the notorious serial-killer Hannibal Lecter whom was played originally by accomplished thespian Anthony Hopkins. Is it a good movie? It's not bad as some paint it to be(looking at the review trackers in Rotten Tomatoes)but by no means is this a masterpiece. The plot is pretty much straightforward, Lecter decides to hunt down the soldiers who killed his family, but most importantly eaten her sister(Hannibal partly suppresses this memory) in order to survive the cold winter. Before that he escapes a communist castle in which his family lived and goes looking for a surving member of his family, so he can begin his revenge. Needless to say that the outcome should be predictable, unless this is the first Hannibal movie you've actually seen. In the same style of the previous Hannibal movies, expect lots of blood and gore, though sadly not as much suspense as I would expect. In a nutshell it works as a decent horror film, but some things just don't fly. Everybody speaks English in this film, even though the vast majority of the movie takes place in central Europe? Corny, indeed, but I'm OK with that (even though some German is spoken, or rather sung, but it wasn't translated so I'm not quite sure what they said). Lecter having a Japanese step-aunt and also love interest? Also corny and somewhat out of place(the scene where Lecter and her aunt spar with kendo also seemed corny... I mean was I suddenly watching The Last Samurai?), but I'm cool. About the pseudo-incest,if you wanna push buttons, I guess it's OK to go an extra-mile. Mandatory detective out to get Hannibal? OK with that too.... Hannibal Lecter himself? That's the real problem, while the actor playing young Hannibal has moments where he channels Anthony Hopkins, , those moments are very far apart, ever since I saw the trailer, french actor Gaspard Ulliel looks and almost sounds like he belongs in an American Pie movie, this is no joke. I was also waiting for Stifler to show up at one point. Hannibal Lecter's murders are somewhat gruesome, but he's just not as scary(save for that one part where he returns to be hut and discovers one of the original killers, in which he uses a rope and sings to his victim) as the producers/directors probably wanted, I mean Christian Bale scares me more as either Batman or Jim Davis(Harsh Times), but this one, meh. Not to keen on cheering for this guy, but honestly who will. Like I said, it's not as bad as the critics say, but hardly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly the worst of the series, but still a good movie in its own rights.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the Hannibal series ever since seeing Silence of the Lambs at a young age, my curiosity led me to view this film. The plot is very well laid out, and carries along very well. It was very easy, for me at least, to follow the progression of the story, and it did a very good job of keeping me interested.***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** While I enjoyed the film, it was very predictable at times. Mischa's death and manner of stuck with the canniballism theme. Also, in the fight scenes, we knew Hannibal was going to live, so there was not really any suspense as to who the winner would be.I found it very interesting to learn about Hannibal's educational background--not only the schooling he had, but his self-defense training by Lady Murisaki Shikibu. The movie does a very good job of explaining why and how Hannibal became the person that he did, and that impressed me most of all.Overall, I saw this more as a story of a child of war that became deranged due to all the events that he had encountered. Of course, that's what the film probably intended it to be, so they succeeded in that department. However, I feel that it lacked the "Hannibalistic" theme that we've all become familiar with. The absence of Anthony Hopkins didn't help matters either.All in all, the movie was very entertaining, but if you're expecting another Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs, you'll probably be let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the other Hannibal movies. They had a depth in it which was terrifying. may be we owe it to Anthony Hopkins. Hannibal Rising tells the story of how Hannibal came to be what he is. But they tell it in a way that is more cinematic. This is more of an action movie with slick dialogues (it lacks the depth shown by Anthony Hopkins - we can owe it to the formative years of the boy). There were periods in this movie which were concentrated on making a point than showing the reason behind why it was the way it is. Never the less it was a good movie - Gong Li and Gabriel Ulliel are fantastic. If you are a normal person who likes a good 2 hours of entertainment this is not for you. It has too much of blood and violence in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really believe the acting and the plot were great, however I can't get over how miserable I was at times waiting for things to develop. The movie was worth seeing as it allows you to create an understanding of how Hannibal moved from a child to a killer. Granted Sociopaths are born sociopaths.I felt other than the death of the butcher, the creativity of Hannibal was lacking. However, the explanation of how he became a cannibal was well explained and really supported the development of his character.Once again, it just took too long to develop and I felt like something was missing. But the explanations of Hannibal and acting were awesome. A must see if you are a die hard fan, but a rental if just a casual fan like myself. This way you can fast forward through some of the boring slow scenes.</fullReview>

The new Hannibal played a great job being very evil and brilliant at the same time with his elegant way of behavier and his witty sense (please excuse me for my spelling it is quite late and i am very tired). In other words i loved the movie and i think it will make a greeeeeat addition to the Dr. Hannibal Lecter collection. I only hope that Thomas Harris doesn't end his reign of evil now and continues on from the ending of Hannibal as we all know to be far from dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sickest Entry Into A Horror Franchise So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this today. It was the most shocking thing next to Hostel I have seen. I've seen pretty much every violent Horror Flick in the past few years including the brilliant Saw trilogy. Anyways back to this movie: It starts off good with a war twist but then descends into a revolting film that only the most die hard Lecter fan would enjoy. This film makes Hannibal look like a walk in the park. Its violence level is on par with Hostel but its more realistic. This was the worst instalment in the Hannibal series so far. The acting was superb but was constantly ruined by violence so sadistic it made me feel as if this movie should have been edited a few more times (thats coming from someone who loves the horror genre). I'll give you a taste of the violence thats in this film (SPOILERS AHEAD)Hannibal ties this guy to a tree and puts the rope around the guys neck. He then pulls the horse along until the guys eyes fill with blood and then I presume his eyes and neck burst for when we see the remains, its just his head with the cheeks cut out.Hannibal stabs a guy through the lower jaw and the blade comes out the top of the guys head.Also one thing that was annoying to me was why the Japanese lady stayed by Hannibal even after he killed so many people, it just doesn't add up.END SPOILERSI really hope this is the last Lecter movie as all they added with this instalment was too much graphic and sadistic violence to a series that is usually quite psychological.</fullReview>

Several people I spoke to about this agree that this movie was supposed to help us understand why Hannibal continued killing and what he was trying to accomplish. This particular story gave him some initial motivation but it's really not sufficient to sustain his behavior into his 40's. And we could have done without a montage. Can someone explain to Hollywood that it's bad form to just throw a montage in a movie to fast-forward through blatant plot manipulation? Bah. The actor did a fine job with what he was given, but I don't think any other actor could have saved this film either, regardless of their skill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, i just want to say i hated this movie. The word "disappointment" doesn't do my feelings justice. For some reason, the whole first half of the movie reminded me a lot of Batman Begins. Think about it, a kid brutally looses his family, gains a mentor, gets revenge... the difference being people who go through things like that don't usually become a superhero, more likely a Hannibal. I don't feel like it stayed true to any of the other Hannibal movies. The story was weak and it dragged way more than it should have. To me, the best part about the other Hannibal movies(Silence of the lambs, and red dragon especially) was the suspense... the only suspense i had was when I found myself just waiting for the next gruesome murder just so something would happen(It would not have hurt to crank the kill count up a bit as well). The movie itself lacked the right aura... It was just another story of revenge. You end up almost feeling sorry for Hannibal. That being said, Gaspard Ulliel was absolutely amazing. They could not have found a better actor to play young Hannibal. He nailed the whole ruthless yet sophisticated, animal with class characteristic. He is pretty much the only thing that saves the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite a worthy prequel but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The speed with which both the novel and film for the Lecter prequel have been rolled off did concern me somewhat when approaching Hannibal Rising. This film does not match the intelligence of Silence and Dragon or the 'horror' in Hannibal. However, that does not make it a bad film.Hannibal Rising tells of Lecter's early life - the destruction of his family, his adolescence and his revenge. The story itself is quite simple, there are no really shocks or surprises for the viewer, everyone knows what to expect when they enter the cinema and that's what they get. It is all in how the story is told rather than the story itself.And I think it is told quite well. The flashbacks I felt were overdone somewhat but other than that the style and pace of the story were well suited to the topic - the pace being quite slow but that is how Lecter likes to play things so it seems appropriate.Gaspard Ulliel is never going to encapsulate Lecter the way Anthony Hopkins does but he does a good attempt as portraying how he would have been when so much younger and not quite as refined or controlled. Criticisms have been levelled at the film saying it is like a slasher film rather than the reserved and clever Hannibal we are used to but surely you would assume such things come with age. His eyes and smile in particular are very sinister and show the pleasure that he is experiencing as he exacts his revenge. Gaspard also does a passable imitation of how Anthony made Hannibal sound - especially when using words he considers vulgar.Li Gong's portrayal of Lady Murasaki was very enjoyable, the struggle she feels trying to reconcile her love for Lecter with her disgust at his deeds is well displayed but yet controlled.It was also good (and a surprise) to see Kevin McKidd appearing in this film, he is an excellent actor and I am constantly surprised he does not get more starring roles.The main criticism of the film is that it does feel very much like filling in the missing pieces - it does not tell us much we did not already know about Lecter. And the story itself is quite slight and straightforward which may leave some disappointed.Hannibal Rising is well worth watching to complete the Lecter story - but lets hope they stop here, I don't think there is room for any more Hannibal films (especially with the discrepancy between the endings in Hannibal the book and Hannibal the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Hannibal Rising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Hannibal Lecter continues, what with so many movies starring everyone's favourite cannibal - Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal and Red Dragon. In most of these movies, Sir Anthony Hopkins brought to live the vivid horror of the character, sending chills down your bones with his measured performance and that steely gaze. It's natural that in following recent trend, there would be a prequel movie made of sorts which goes back to the origins of the primary character, in an attempt to explain and discover who he is, and what made him to be.Written by Thomas Harris, which makes the proceedings of the mythos here canon, you would have half expected something special. Instead, it turned out to be rather run-off-the- mill, succumbing to many instances of easy coincidences for the most parts, with its revenge theme making Hannibal Lecter more of a vigilante rather than a calculated serial killer.Then again, we're looking at his past, all the way back to 1944 towards the tail end of WWII, where the Lecter family have to vacate their Lithuanian castle. His family gets massacred during a crossfire, leaving him to fend for himself and his sister Mischa. But in times of chaos and hunger, the advancing Russian troops ate what they could, hence leading to revenge burning deep inside Hannibal, probably snapping his mind in the process. It then played out like Bruce Wayne's quest to seek justice, with his travels, attainment of skills through medical school, and from an acquaintance with a distant aunt, played by Gong Li. And as all brash youth go, his techniques lack finesse, and he makes a number of mistakes which he learns from.Gaspard Ulliel takes over from Sir Anthony Hopkins as the title character, since the latter can't possibly play the role of a much younger Hannibal without the prolonged aid of digital effects which did the job for Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in X-Men 3. Some of you might have seen Gaspard in A Very Long Engagement, and I thought he did quite an OK job with the role. Don't compare him with Hopkins as he'll definitely fall short, relying for the most parts on his snarl and stare.Gong Li seemed to have taken up a lot more roles in the West, barring her inability to speak good English. You can't fault the lass for trying, and here, although her diction is still poor and you scratch your head wondering what she had just said, it has definitely improved. However, the role as Lady Murasaki Shikibu is almost decorative, adding little depth to the Hannibal role besides being an alternative of a life that could have been, an abandonment of love for revenge and the thirst for blood.Some of the gruesome bits got censored here, but I suspect that even if they were left untouched, it'll probably be more for the gore factor rather than to serve up real fear and horror. Plenty of decapitations, but no scene that'll really make you reel from and cringe, which I thought that finale scene in Hannibal is the scene to beat. And that pretty much sums up the movie - plenty of potential to tap on the origins, motivation and rationale of the Hannibal character, but ended up very much vanilla plain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All previous Hannibal Lector movies including Manhunter show him aiding the police against a killer as he provides them an insight into the mind of a madman , but Hannibal Rising takes us behind the mouth piece and gives us into an insight of the events that made him everyone's favourite cannibal. A prequel to the prequel Red Dragon , we are taken to second world war Lithuinua and we are given a look of the chain of events that drive this sinister individual to his days growing up in France and his hunger for vengeance consuming him. Gaspard Ulliel done a smashing performance of a younger Lector and shows the madman unfolding in front of your eyes whether it be down to the gory deaths or his masking him-self as a samurai on a mission to defend his families Honor I really would like to see more of this young , talented man. Gong Li was expectational as Lectors suffering aunt and not to mention Rhys Ifans as Gratus who you just want our anti-hero to take care of and also Dominic West as Inspector Pompil. The director done a smash up job of location and use of imagery not to mention the way he shows us Lectors torment which I also felt a little uncomfortable to watch which really could be enough to drive anyone into madness. I think the only flaws where that it was a little too long in places and ended a little to abruptly , but apart from that well worth my time. To conclude Hannibal Rising has defiantly moved to number 2 in my Hannibal film ratings , although the critics are panning it I say ignore them and check out for your-self Hannibal fan or not and you probably will sympathises and route for the anti-hero and I shall check the book out as well.HANNIBAL RISING - 8.8 OUT OF 10FOR THE SUFFERING YOUR ENEMY WILL INFLICT UPON YOU , YOU SHALL EAT THE FLESH.</fullReview>

Hannibal Rising, as a stand alone film, is not bad. The acting is good, the story is a bit weak, but tolerable, and the conclusion is a bit wicked but rewarding. As a translation of Thomas Harris's novel, it is horrible. There are major story elements left out or just plain out changed that ruin the flow from Hannibal Rising into Red Dragon. First off, Hannibal was rescued from the orphanage by his uncle in the book. In the film it claims his uncle died and Hannibal ran away to find his uncle's mansion. Secondly, the relationship between Hannibal and Lady Murasaki is ruined by the film. They had a very deep and special relationship that intensified as the story progressed. The film leaves it to pure sexual tension. Last, but definitely the worst change, is Hannibal faking his death to run away to Canada. Sorry guys, but Hannibal graduated from the medical school in France and was transferred to John Hopkins Medical. The stop in Canada was on the way to Baltimore. This change ruins the continuity of the whole series. With an extra hour of footage to deepen the character relationships, fix the story modifications, and bring life to the story, this could have been almost as good as Silence of The Lambs. Hollywood is ruining potentially great films today by forcing new and not so well know director's and casts to appeal to the younger crowds. This movie, unfortunately, is a glaring example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Joe Cool Experience: Hannibal Rising(2007)Starring: Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal Lecter Gong Li as Lady Murasaki Shikibu Dominic West as Inspector Popil Rhys Infans as VladisPlot: During World War II young Hannibal Lecter witnesses his family die thanks to the Nazis and then his sister is eaten by Russian soldiers. Years later he makes his way to his only family left, his uncle's widow Lady Murasaki. He develops a taste for revenge, and human flesh, against those who ate his sister. So I'm a fan of the Hannibal series...although I have yet to see Manhunter. Silence was great, Hannibal was okay and I liked Red Dragon better than most, and I was very much looking forward to a prequel about his past. I hadn't heard many rumors, outside of possible Anthony Hopkins involvement, so I really had no expectations going in other than the movies I had watched before now. Then the previews came along and I saw a pretty boy going on a killing spree and had concerns. Had they turned a unique psychotic into a run-of-the-mill slasher? Read on...This movie has a lot going for it, and I'll say that Gaspard Ulliel does a pretty good job of channeling Anthony Hopkins here. The guy must have studied the previous entries because he pulls off the accent and mannerisms of his predecessor perfectly. He still manages to bring a certain charm to the role and look quite menacing at times. He's even somewhat sympathetic, which I guess would have to happen in order for a movie centering around a revenge plot to work. The supporting cast does okay, Gong Li i fine as the romantic interest, Dominic West doesn't do much as the Inspector and of course Rhys Infans played the villain with enough sleaze to not be likable. Acting was top-notch in my opinion. The gore was also nice, with beheading, cheek removal, stabbings, slicing and of course biting. I also was never bored by this movie once, which says wonders about how they move the story along.The story left a lot to be desired, however. For one, I never felt like Hannibal was terrifying in the least. He should have went after at least one innocent to make me believe that anyone other than the people he was exacting revenge on were in danger. How does all this make him crazy enough to feast on random people later on in life? Secondly, there was a plot twist thrown in towards the end that is just there seemingly for shock value. I also didn't like how there was even a love story to begin with(dude, isn't she kinda like related to you?) and when they went there I didn't buy it. Creepy kid moves in with you, you know he's killing people and not only do you understand, but it makes you hot for him? Doesn't make much sense. Nevermind the fact I doubt he's going to take time out from vengeance to get it on. While overall the acting and pacing of the movie save it, the story was just kind of flat and there and hurt this movie a lot from becoming the true horror film it wanted to be. Respect goes out to Gaspard Ulliel because he's definitely going places and this was a showcase of what he can do. I still recommend Hannibal Rising.Rating: *** of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved for the most part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie after having read the book. First of all, I think the actor that portrayed Hannibal did an excellent job. His speech patterns and mannerisms made it easy to believe that he would become the Hannibal portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. I agree with a previous review in that I think they could've delved more into the flashbacks of his childhood and what was actually occurring in Hannibal's psyche. I also think they could've gone more into the mind games between Hannibal and the inspector, which is one of his cardinal trademarks. I think if all you're going for is to see a horror flick, then this movie might not be the one I'd choose. However, for true fans of the Hannibal story, I would definitely encourage seeing it. I thought it was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Believe the Critics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been an avid fan of the Hannibal Lecter movies since first I saw "Silence of the Lambs" perhaps ten years ago, though I have never read any of the books, including the newly published "Hannibal Rising".Despite my fear than a Hopkins-less Lecter movie might seem dull, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie; from the beginning, my eyes were glued to the screen, and when it was over, I left the theater not only with a sense of cinematic satisfaction, but also with a newfound understanding of Lecter and how became who he was.All of this surprised me, considering all the negative reviews I've heard. I guess I should know by now that movie critics as a group are unreliable, pretentious, and often jump on the bandwagon.Gaspard Ulliel (Lecter), I thought, was very impressive, and a capable Lecter. Sure, once or twice I thought he looked stiff and awkward, but by and large I thought he gave a powerful and intense performance, displaying several of the vocal and physical characteristics we've come to love (in some morbid way) in Lecter. The other actors, though perhaps not outstanding, performed their parts well enough to keep me interested.The atmosphere was excellent, very dreary and disturbing, and the special effects were wonderful.My main complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the editing was sometimes a tad cliché, but for the most part it didn't bother me.Some people complain that they are "milking" the Lector story. Perhaps it's true, but this well-made movie provided great insight into the might of the young Hannibal, and it's a valuable addition to the Lecter mythos.Don't believe what you hear! Different people can see the same movie in different ways, but before you believe the bandwagon, watch this for yourself. Perhaps you, like me, will be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While acting was great, the plot ruined my view of Hannibal Lecter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I saw Hannibal Rising today... not the greatest movie in the world... not even close. If you have read Silence of the Lambs, or particularly enjoyed the movie, I would recommend avoiding seeing this new installment. After watching what Thomas Harris decided was Hannibal's past, I realized that I really didn't want to know. The thing about Hannibal that really intrigued me when I read Silence of the Lambs and then saw the movie (which I think portrayed the book quite nicely) was that I didn't know anything about him. I was able to imagine what made him the man he was. The problem with Hannibal Rising is that it doesn't leave anything to the imagination, and the history that it told was not the one I thought should have been. Hannibal Lecter IS NOT a monster. Or at least I don't think he is. Sure he eats people... Hannibal the Cannibal, you know, but he is sophisticated. I always viewed him as a man who had particular tastes, but he was not a mean man at all, he just wanted to be treated well. Hannibal Rising turns Lecter into a man driven entirely by passion and revenge. Before I saw the movie I thought of him as passionate only for analyzing people and playing games with their heads. Hannibal Rising didn't play in to his brilliance at all, only his skills with the Samurai sword.Even though I basically HATED the plot, and have lost a good amount of respect for Thomas Harris for writing this book/screenplay, there was one GREAT aspect of the movie: the acting. Not just in the lead parts, either. Gaspard Ulliel did a fantastic job being the creepy guy that you should hate... you know you should hate... but you really just like him. He did well portraying the mannerisms of the character Hannibal that Thomas Harris created, and Anthony Hopkins brought to life. But the supporting actors and actresses did phenomenal too. Everyone seemed devoted to making their character real, it made the movie that much better.So while I believe that this was a horrible addition to the Hannibal story, if you are totally impartial having not read the books or seen the previous movies, this is a good film. The acting is superb, the plot is good (even if I don't like it in respect to the BIG picture), and cinematically it qualifies as a great movie. Too bad I ended up being biased on this one :-P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I Thought Hannibal Was A Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Think that Hannibal Rising not only is a bad movie, it destroys the other Hannibal movies as well. Part of what makes Hannibal so exiting is that you do not know what drives him to eat people and we are not supposed to know either. Apparently that has not crossed the minds of the creators and they explain to us how his childhood affected him; I just think it is a shame. Another issue i had with the film is Hannibals relationship to Lady Murasaki. The fact that she teaches him martial arts and she has these swords and stuff just smells like a complete Hollywoodification of Hannibal. Is it just me or does Hannibal become evil in a matter of seconds in the movie. It is like he is this silent shy guy and the second he starts speaking he just has this evil "hannibal style". To me that just happened unnatural in the movie.What a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest of the 4, but still enjoyable and worth the watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite many of the negative reviews I read before seeing this film, I was still eager to watch it. I can honestly say that I was not disappointed.I believe the reason many people didn't like Hannibal Rising is because they were expecting to see a younger actor portray the exact same performance as Anthony Hopkins in the previous films. In my opinion, Gaspard Ulliel does a brilliant job at portraying Hannibal as a young adult.Some complain that this film weakens the Hannibal character because he is driven purely by revenge, and is no longer an image of pure, unexplainable evil. This film is intended to show WHY Hannibal grew into the insane person that he was, it answers the questions of what started him in his cannibalism. I believe that many people wanted to believe that Hannibal was just born insane, and didn't want to see how he actually became that way. I suppose this is why many writers leave certain questions unanswered, and leave it up to the audience's imagination.Gaspard's Hannibal is not quite as charmingly sadistic as Anthony Hopkin's portrayal, but he definitely shows some of his early, sick pleasures. You have to remember that this is Hannibal as a young man, not quite as educated, or as experienced in murder as he was in the first 3 films.Just remember what Lecter told Will Graham in Red Dragon... "It was his first time...." He may be driven mainly by revenge in Hannibal Rising, but would you expect someone such as Hannibal to simply STOP murdering and eating people after his revenge? I wouldn't, I would expect it to become a sick pleasure for him, one of the few things that keeps him going in life. His only way of truly enjoying life.I give it a 7 because I enjoyed it, and I believe it was a great introduction for the Hannibal character. Brilliant acting by Gaspard, and some very enjoyable scenes. However, just doesn't give the same joy as the previous 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a great addition to the Hannibal saga. I have recently read many reviews that critics wrote, and I am displeased and confused on how they could have rated this movie so low. Sure, it may have not been exactly like the other Hannibal movies because it was less of a thriller, and more of a dark action movie. But who really cares other then the critics, I honestly don't know why they rated this so low. The actor was perfectly sadistic and cannibalistic. The critics must be on something. All of the actors were great as well. This is truly the best movie based on revenge that I have ever seen. It is at times sad, and it has great scenes of grisly deaths. The new Lector filled up the shoes of Anthony Hopkins better than anyone else possibly could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite surprised to discover that Hannibal Rising (HR) received just 16% from critics and 5.3 (just yesterday) on IMDb. It seems that HR is the most misunderstood movie in years. Whether it is the demonic presence of Hopkins, and Hopkins only that most were expecting to see yet again, or the fact that *minor spoiler here* HR gave previously unjustified evil a great deal of justification to the point that audience pretty much has to take side of the monster, i would still expect any experienced movie fan to appreciate Peter Webber's vision. HR is well crafted, nicely shot, with good performances and solid characters. I am sure that audience largely expected more of brain-eating and guts coming out without any explanation why. However they got the well-founded explanation of why and how this monster came to be. Too bad that we so often become victims of out own preconceived notions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought "Hannibal Rising" was executed very well despite my concerns. I was worried about the writing as Thomas Harris has a great imagination, I find his writing style to be very amateur. I was impressed, to me the script is the most primal and crucial part of the movie. The murders were done tastefully, not like Saw or other moronic slasher films. There's an art to them that is all Hannibal Lecter. However there is one big part of the film that irritated me: Lady Murasaki. She brought a love interest to the story that would have been better suited if it was someone like Clarice, a better mirror for his attractions to the lady of his life forty years later. Lady Murasaki served as a great mentor, not love interest. Really not that bad. I'd rank it way high above "Hannibal", but lower than "Red Dragon" and "The Silence of the Lambs".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the people on here never read the book and the movie was written really for the people who read it, but even my friends who haven't read it yet loved it for the graceful gore.I was shocked as hell the parts I loved in the book were in the movies because almost always my favorite moments in books are cut out to suit the needs for the pathetic viewers that never read the book (Im still sore over HP4). The only thing that bugged me was1. He took a WATCH not a RING from the dying man. 2. Hannibal's mother was on fire and was crushed to death and frozen to the ground, not dying in his arms. I only mention this because that image haunts him for a long time. 3. On the haunting note: where the hell was the skull in bathtub part? The noise it made hitting the side of the tub haunts Hannibal for the rest of his life. 4. They made Lady Murasaki tres faible. very weak. Or at least weaker then her independent self in the book. 5. His uncle wasn't dead when he arrived! He actually picked Hannibal up from the orphanage and was later killed by Paul the butcher. geez. 6. I really wish they went in more on Mr Javoc and such. Im happy they cut out all that paintings stuff tho. It was boring to read. Im one of those people that if a movie is based on a book, it better follow the book in a way its not perfect and these guys did a great job. Even if you didn't read the book, its still enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a prequel I thought this to be wonderful. Young Hannibal developing all of the traits that he refines in his later years. His love for music, cooking and distaste for the free-range rude. However, there are some differences between novel and film that should have been kept closer to the novel. The orphanage scene in the novel was more Hannibal like than the one portrayed on film. The Popil character could have been better developed in the film. The casting, acting and cinematography are excellent for this type of story. The cast could be used to further the story of Hannibal prior to his SOTL days. This is one of the few movies that I have paid to see in the theater and will purchase for my own collection. Bon Appetit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More or less this film was made just to bank off of the reputation of the other films, and why not, who doesn't like to make money? The thing is I think a lot of people aren't satisfied because there's little suspense to the film. It can't be compared to the others. There's hardly a murder mystery to it. It's just a character profile for Hannibal, and it's reasonable enough. I work in the psychiatric community, forensics included, and I've personally met people who've committed just as horrible acts as most movie's fictional characters and they did it for much less a reason then the film I'm writing about.

Hannibal fans beware though, you may be slightly disappointed. I, however, enjoyed it for what it was. It's the beginning of the Hannibal tale.

So all of the plot in this movie was new to me, and I found it interesting to learn about Hannibal's childhood. The plot in this one seemed better than all the others movies. It's much more interesting to think about the question 'what turns a person into a monster?' than to just see the monster in action torturing people (like the other movies). The beginning World War II scenes were very well done and made you think about how scary it must have been for the people in those countries. There were good dramatic elements, it was suspenseful, and the movie made me empathize with Hannibal and cheer him on. The soundtrack was a little weak - that's the only complaint I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes Well with a Nice Chianti, but More Drama than Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I wasn't going to see "Hannibal Rising." I'd seen the commercials on TV and it looked like it was going to be a big let-down. I fully intended to give it a pass. I only saw it because I had to evacuate my house for the roofers and decided to take in whatever happened to be showing at the local movieplex, and it was either this or "Norbit." I was pleasantly surprised. Despite the marketing campaign that promotes this film as a psycho-killer horror movie, it's more properly described as a drama with horror elements. It's not a perfect film; there are some unnecessary slow bits, and the ending doesn't jibe well with what we know of Hannibal Lecter from "Silence of the Lambs." Still, the story is good, although the revenge theme is nothing new. There's some good acting throughout, particularly by Gaspard Ulliel, who successfully pulls off the mannerisms and cold, calculating violence of Lecter quite well, managing to build the character slowly into what we know he must ultimately become. By the end of the movie, I was expecting a sibilant "Clarice" to be delivered. His performance left me wondering if he'd received some coaching from Anthony Hopkins on how to play the role.There certainly is some gore here as well as strongly implied violence that we never quite see, and there are two scenes which might be a bit much for those with weak stomachs. Still, the expectation built up by the marketing for "Hannibal Rising" is likely to leave a lot of horror fans with a bad taste in their mouths when they see the film. Nevertheless, it's quite a bit better than I expected it to be. No "Silence of the Lambs," to be sure, but at least on par with "Red Dragon."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faithful Recreation of the Thomas Harris Bestseller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising is a pretty good movie that suffered by comparison to the earlier films in the franchise and an absence of series star Anthony Hopkins in character as Hannibal Lecter. Gaspard Ulliel is quite good as a young Hannibal coping with madness and questing for vengeance against the soldiers who tormented him and his beloved sister Mischa. Ulliel captures the vocal inflections, body language and facial expressions of Hopkin's Hannibal at times to perfection while making the character also his own. The de Laurentis' have gone to considerable expense to recreate the battlefields of Lithuania and various locations across Europe circa 1950. Hannibal Rising is a lavish looking film which adheres closely to the novel with Harris himself overseeing the screenplay. The problem is the novel isn't great. It's a good read but it lacks depth and the soldiers Hannibal is hunting don't have the same fascination as Buffalo Bill, Mason Verger or the Tooth Fairy. There's no one up to the challenge of Hannibal and even the criminal investigation of Lecter feels like a sub-plot and not a genuine threat. Sherlock Holmes needs a Moriarty. Batman needs The Joker. Hannibal needed something more here to bring it up to the level of the other films in the franchise. It's still worth a look, especially for fans.</fullReview>

There are no dull moments &amp; the production is all round top class. I loved the soundtrack and cinematography - both beautifully sinister and compelling. The acting was great from most of the cast and the story itself is gruesome and interesting. No it isn't perfect, what movie is? But the criticisms I've read on this site read more like sour grapes than objective reviews. There seems to be a lot of snobbery going on about the Hannibal character and franchise that really has no place in determining the overall worth of this movie. Ignore all the naysayers. If you like a good psychological thriller with well-paced well- choreographed action, interesting settings, a bit of wartime drama &amp; lots of explosions in a great production with wonderful acting then go ahead and watch this. If you are obsessed with Hannibal Lecter and have some internal fantasy about how he came to be a monster that you cant let go of then you should probably steer clear of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad for the not so stupid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually write anything for movies that are just average or about, but after having read all the negative comments about this movie I really felt like I had to say something. First, Silence of the Lambs is a pretty good movie no doubt but it is not the Holy Grail like some folks here seem to think... I personally think that there were some bad choices made about Hannibal Rising. Some scenes were totally unnecessary (Hannibal learning kendo to show his fascination about the Japanese culture hence his quest for revenge to collect heads) while other parts were not stressed enough (Hannibal being bullied at the orphanage). Some of these bad choices made the movie less credible but it surely made this movie completely worthless for the careless or stupid audience. Do you really need a full scene with drawing on a board to explain that Hannibal's father is a Lithuanian aristocrat who married an aristocrat French woman whose brother, count whatever, married a Japanese who eventually kept the family château after his death since her family (and not her like some said here, was at Hiroshima)? OK, maybe the Japanese part is over the top? but what do you expect in a movie about a cannibal serial killer?! Fortunately Hannibal rising glosses over some useless explanations (let's have more scenes of Hannibal being taught how to cook and of him studying so stupid audience can understand he's not a dumb ass, like Rocky getting ready to fight. Since Team America, there can't be any montage for short cuts anymore?) but that, made it a bad movie according to some. Acting was pretty good I thought except for the cop whose role part was too stereotyped, yet indispensable for giving Hannibal the choice of either going for blood, or going for justice. Gong Li (who is 20 years OLDER than Ulliel for those who thought they didn't look of different age?) is superb as usual even though she could be more expressive when she decides not to side with Hannibal any longer. Ulliel was not bad actually. He had to play the quiet type with occasional bursts of anger, that's the character? The cinematography is gorgeous, the real villains are a bit too real villains (even though they pushed the guy with the family and his restaurant, we can feel that for the director once a villain, always a villain - come on! Human trafficking?? Wasn't the war enough?) and the violence is not really graphic, but mostly off screen (unusual these days of SFX). To sum it up, a pretty good Hollywood flick, which says it all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i should have read the jacket more carefully... that will teach me i guess. i was thoroughly disappointed in this movie. a.. no anthony hopkins,, well i guess you're saying , it's supposed to be about a y oung hannibal lecter and anthony hopkins ain't young anymore. what i think they could have done was done like a psycho 4 kind of thing where someone is interviewing hannibal and use flashbacks... but back to the umm movie,, i did like the world war 2 pieces, the plane crash, the bullets , the snow, all of that,, the movie though was way to slooo.. to get to the point,, okay, then we have the revenge factor, which i can understand,, get the men who ate you're sister,but the getting there was horribly long and ardous,, the murder scenes were good, some pretty gruesome,ropes, drownings, swords, all good, loved the scenes in France , they were g ood, didn't get the whole Japanese thing, but i loved the ending. overall this film is average, but being a prequel to a great modern story, my expectations were high. and unfortunately that gives this movie an average score only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Falling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Anthony Hopkins first smacked his lips with an unblinking smile, taking home five Oscars for the triumph that was The Silence of the Lambs, the character of Hannibal Lector has permeated the public conscience in a fashion rarely paralleled in cinema history. Considering the mass fascination with the oddly sophisticated serial killer, an origin tale, a chance to finally delve into the fascinating yet warped mind of Hannibal the Cannibal, was actually a sensible and intriguing idea, rather than being yet another cheap Hollywood cash in. However, disappointingly, the end result failed to end up too far from it - quickly thrust into production to directly follow the release of Thomas Harris' new novel, the film feels far too rushed and shoddy to ever have ever become the horrifying glimpse into the mind of a monster it deserved to have become. It is surprising indeed to find that Thomas Harris himself wrote the screenplay, as the film's storyline and characters feel like amateurish take offs on Harris' original works. Harris, who crafted some of the most quotable lines of dialogue of the decade in his original novels, seems at a total loss here as to how to craft a decent screenplay, and the result feels too imbalanced and poorly written to come close to matching any of his prior works (lending credibility to the rumour that he was pressured into writing the film by unflinching studio executives who threatened to tell their own version of the tale in the absence of one told by him).Apart from the disappointingly weak pacing and dialogue, for the most part, the film's flaws follow the flaws of the source novel: the plot meanders around into irritatingly irrelevant subplots (most of which were mercifully cut down for the film version) and despite providing a suitably macabre catalyst to morph young Hannibal into the sophisticated murderer he inevitably will become, we as an audience never really get to journey inside his head. Rather than FEEL his pain, follow the psychological derangement and gradually sympathise with his twisted but intact sense of ethics, the audience is kept at an odd emotional distance, simply witnessing the events which spawned them, and ultimately failing to empathise with Lector. The film's visuals are surprisingly excellent, with a suitably crisp look and feel to the period details without them ever being overdone. The strong cinematography and editing also add a welcome touch of quality in a film with a distinct overall absence of it - Lector's flashbacks to his gruesome childhood memories are wonderfully chilling and the film's violent content is surprisingly tastefully handled: without question present, but without being reduced to a shock value gorefest. However, the musical score is far too clichéd and prominent to ever be effective, and manages to detract from the film's quality more than one might expect. The film's cast echo the overall feel for the film by producing work that is by no means terrible, but too nondescript to be considered quality. German actor Gaspard Ulliel plays cold, silky menace shockingly well, but he is hampered by far too many terrible lines and a tendency to overact in key dramatic scenes, making him an acceptable leading man, but devoid of the real spark always associated with the character. Gong Li is passable as Lector's cultured and mysterious benefactor, Lady Murasaki, but the character is devoid of the quiet charisma and dignity presented in the novel, making her little more than a slightly more authoritative damsel in distress role. Rhys Ifans as a vicious World War Two mercenary and Dominic West as a harried police inspector stand out from the supporting cast, but both also fall prey to being disappointingly bland in their roles, falling short of their true potential. Overall, Hannibal Rising may not have been reduced to the inane lack of sense or purpose befalling many such belated prequels, but considering the rich tapestry of character the filmmakers had to work with, there is no reason for the end result not being far superior to what it was. The audience's ultimate inability to empathise with the character renders the intent of the story somewhat irrelevant, and what transpires is a passably entertaining thriller, but a far cry from the chilling look at the roots of a murderer it should have been.-6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is their problem?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with the bad reviews I've been hearing about this movie, I was so excited when I heard it was coming out, I watched the movie, read the book, and it had all the juicy bits expected in a blockbuster movie and yet the majority of opinions I heard were so negative! What's the problem..?This movie and plot line was different, the actors were good and relatively unknown (which adds a realism to the film), it had great murder scenes, a little luurve, and the picturesque colour and tone of early 1950's gave this brilliant feeling of being in that era and that culture. The Hannibal Lecter of this film was a great representation, for a girl like me I must admit I wasn't at all disappointed at the slight romantic tone that was placed on Hannibal. Ulliels acting was the most suitable for the character and it was quite clear that he is a good actor, it didn't seem necessary or realistic for him to copy the older Hannibal to a T. I even preferred Gaspard Ulliel over Hopkins (who was still fantastic!), I found Hopkin's Hannibal too distant and too emotionless, almost like a robot. The prequel Hannibal was cold and complex, yet still retained a sense of humanity, just enough to make him interesting and just enough to ensure Ulliel had another hundred female driven fan bases erected in his honour.The lady Murasaki in the book Hannibal Rising was a bit stereotypical and corny, what with all the philosophical pronouncements and flower arrangements and bla bla bla, however Gong Li managed to save that tragic character and turn her into something that was much more fluid and likable.It is true, however, that there were some elements that revealed the production team's Mad-On for clichés. The over dramatized scene of Kendo fighting was unnecessary, and it didn't seem to tie in with the tone of the story, the book felt more like a script with many of the texts featuring Lady Murasaki overly dramatic for the book, her dialogue was as aforementioned: Corny. NTM The whole James Bond themed rescue mission was a little obvious.However, although it came to an expected conclusion, and although the book was a little shoddy and lacked true invention, it translated quite well, much better even, onto the big screen. which, you know, can sometimes happen. It seemed most critics had likely read the book before watching the film, and had the predisposition of reading the other 3 books when they went into the theatre. Then they come out criticizing everything and anything, my god give it a chance wouldjya?Case in point: (because I was hideously disappointed since the third movie premiered) Harry Potter. The books were Brilliant, i loved 'em, they were Fantastic! Wonderful! Unique! Hilarious! What do people come out of the theatre saying? "Fantastic! Wonderful! hilarious!" ...seriously are they kidding themselves?Can anyone really say that they have been great movies? i mean, really? Bad actors, choppy storyline, massive amount of money- not enough common sense.Basically, the problem was the book Hannibal Rising, not the movie, the movie was entertaining and that all that matters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HANNIBAL RISING 2007 (GASPARD ULLIEL) DIRECTED BY: PETER WEBBER ~ THE RUNDOWN: The good doctor returns again, this time as a strapping adolescent wise beyond his years who painstakingly enacts revenge on some Nazis in this badly paced bore. ~ Maybe it's that creepy impression in the left side of his face...but whatever it is, there's a definite aura amongst actor Gaspard Ulliel in this movie and his ability here to maintain the perfect charm and charisma of Hannibal Lecter while killing people basically saves it from absolutely sucking. Also, the movie starts off with a bang, blasting our psyche with a sequence of sound and intensity that sets us up with the beginning of Hannibal's ill-fated childhood. Unfortunately, HANNIBAL RISING gets very boring, very quickly, and Lecter's mental and physical abuse that supposedly makes him into the monster he becomes, even though often interesting and credible, is too typical at the same time and, essentially, the whole premise of the film does not by any means add to the brilliant series but rather detracts from the Hannibal mystique. And what the hell was up with all the 'Good Evenings'? I mean, come on, this isn't a 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequel; let's exchange some of the cheese for some class, Mr. Harris. In fact, like much of the dialog and the film in general, the completely tedious murders that Hannibal performs in vengeance of his sister really just make a mockery of the previous films. Aside from just being really boring, the plot just simply reduces one of the greatest villains of all time to something just too ordinary. ~ I guess I have mixed feelings about HANNIBAL RISING. Gaspard Ulliel could very quickly rise to massive stardom and so easily earns himself our admiration here, and, furthermore, as an avid fan of horror, I couldn't help but take sick delight in the immense violence in the movie, often innovative and easily living up to any expectations. However, like I've made very clear thus far, the film is very boring, and boring movies just plain suck, unless your 2001: A Space Odyssey, of course. Also, there's almost no suspense, either, something prevalent in all the other HANNIBAL films. The movie just goes on and on and on and the viewer finds themselves simply sitting there watching a guy kill people.</fullReview>

Anyone who had some high school education could have written a better screenplay. I haven't read the source material and I do not plan on doing so. Everything about this film was done in such a trite manner. Simple scares, poor directing, unsatisfying, clichés through and through. Big studios are simply trying to milk the Lecter cash cow. If you want a very simple revenge, 1-D, movie, by all means, see it. It is one of the least rewarding films I've seen on the silver screen. Total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A guaranteed number one bestseller, depicting one of the most haunting characters in literature, has become a chillingly brilliant motion picture; the story shows the evolution of Hannibal's evil and the way an innocent child, apparently growing alone, starts developing demons that will live with him forever. There's something more than an ordinary killer movie/novel, in fact, in addition to horror moments, thrills and a lot of blood, I saw kinda grandeur, erudition and wit. It's a literary evocation of evil, in my opinion recounted even better than in "The Silence of the lambs" and in "Red Dragon". Could say it is almost a masterpiece, as the monstrous character is disturbing but very fascinating as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film for Hannibal Lecter, but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising takes you deep into the past of our favorite "pilgrim" Hannibal Lecter. Usually portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Silence of the Lambs is probably one of the best films of all time, so I imagine this was hard for newcomer Gaspard Ulliel to fill some shoes. Still he manages to pull it off so well you totally believe he is Mr. Lecter in the flesh. He doesn't exactly sound the same nor does he deliver like Anthony Hopkins, but the look, the feel is all there so its enough for a great performance. The chemistry Gaspard brings when he is on screen with Gong Li is a nice touch. Despite some plot holes and noticeable continuity this movie is worth seeing. I suggest watching in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better served if it wasn't a Lecter film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say I enjoyed this movie, it was well shot and well acted it had a good sense of self and was well made. The defining characteristic of this movie over the previous Lecter movies is that this one is more of a revenge flick more than anything else. While it is not a bad movie or a poorly constructed one at that it doesn't change that this movie seems to give an origin to someone that the audience has come to know as a monster, a well spoken and refined monster. Here Lecter is portrayed as being a good kid gone bad.The story opens with young Hannibal and his younger sister in Lithuania during World War II escaping both Nazi and Russian forces from killing them. They run to a nearby lodge and are caught in the middle of fire and all of the adults are ultimately killed. A group of escaped convicts find the house and take it over and over the next few days of starvation decide to kill little Mischa Lecter. Hannibal finally escapes and is "rescued" by Russian forces where he is placed in an orphanage which just happens to be in his families castle. There he is angry and misunderstood and escapes to France to find his Uncle.As the story progresses Hannibal forms a strong and almost incestuous relationship with his Aunt (Li Gong)and this is where the movie really gets fun, one gruesome murder after another and a french war crimes inspector on his case young Hannibal goes to medical school and seeks revenge on those men who killed and ate his young sister.I liked the movie, it was well done, had good acting and I liked the finished product, the only issues here is that while you are watching this child become a beast bent on revenge for the last person he ever really truly loved you see the descent into madness in too trivial of terms.</fullReview>

Personally, I thought 'Hannibal' was a piece of crap (maybe because I couldn't accept Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling, however, I preferred Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford in 'Red Dragon').So for me at this point, I'll say... 1.Silence of the Lambs 2.Red Dragon 3.Hannibal 4.??? 5.???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It begins with mediocrity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When The Silence Of The Lambs was released nearly twenty years ago to critical acclaim and overwhelming box office success, the prospect of sequels was hungrily discussed among critics and financiers alike. But as time passed, studios went bankrupt, and markets were saturated, the hunger for stories of an articulate, clever serial killer diminished. And so it was in 2001 when director Ridley Scott set his sights upon author Thomas Harris' sequel, a rather dull and tepid novel named after its main character. Unfortunately, in deleting details from the novel that stood out and gave the novel its redeeming characteristics, Scott made a film that should have forever slammed the door on Lecter. Instead, a remake of Red Dragon (albeit a significantly better one) and another novel later, both Harris and director Peter Webber have brought us yet another mediocre serial killer film that in this case tries to pose as an intellectual human drama. It fails so miserably at this that in contrast to Hannibal, Hannibal Rising has not a redeeming feature.Part of the problem stems from the mentality of the audience that the film panders to. In the eyes of the audience, murderers are evil and therefore must never be understood, merely exterminated like vermin. Of course, the same applies in their mentality towards those who hear a repetitive load of garbage when others hear a grammy winner, but that is partly the point. A general, a warrior, or even a good chess player will tell you that in order to really defeat an enemy, you must first understand him. And that is, to an extent, what Hannibal Rising in both novel and film format has attempted to provide. The problem being the same as that experienced when dealing with the Daleks, Michael Myers, Pinhead, or any number of other villains you care to name. Namely, the more we know about Hannibal, the less interesting he becomes. Of course, this is partly the fault of the manner in which Harris fills in details, but it is also the choice of which details you fill in that make all of the difference.The Silence Of The Lambs allowed us to speculate about how Hannibal Lecter is able to escape some unusual containment measures. His guards get sloppy, and he takes advantage of the fact that he is much more clever than them at just the right point to necessitate 2001's Hannibal. This is more than enough to generate a good story and some powerful scenes. But Hannibal Rising has to take it a few steps too far. For instance, did you know that Hannibal Lecter had a Japanese aunt with whom he was beginning to have a semi-incestuous relationship? Granted, the film leaves out a mass of details that I picked up from the synopsis on the back of the novel, but that is partly my point. The aforementioned synopsis has it that Lecter puts up a struggle against the demons that have been riding on his shoulders since the end of World War II. The film does nothing to so much as indicate a struggle. He simply gets it into his head to kill someone he thinks he recognises in a fit of pique.This might have flown if they had picked an actor with enough charisma or presence to portray a teenaged Hannibal Lecter. I have grown tired of reading comparisons between the great Anthony Hopkins and his apparent successor, one Gaspard Ulliel. Gaspard is not merely a bad choice for Lecter because he is a lesser actor than Hopkins. Anyone who has read any of the Lecter novels will know that Lecter not only oozes class, but has a big problem with those who have no class or are impolite, or both. Being that I have not read the novel, I can only take a guess about this, but I have a funny feeling that if Hannibal killed a man who insulted his Japanese aunt, it would simply be a judgement upon the man's lack of class or communicative ability. It would not be such an emotion-charged execution. The use of an illustration of the man's severed head was a nice touch, but like the hanging and disembowelling depicted in Hannibal, it has all the impact of footage of a fluffy rabbit bouncing through the snow.Since people have been beating Ulliel's performance to death, I think it is fair to discuss the other poor performances. They say that a protagonist is only as good as his antagonist, so one has to talk a bit about Rhys Ifans. Rhys has a pretty thankless task, portraying a villain who is not only meant to be without any redeeming features, but has also been left by the screenplay without a third dimension. For this film to work as a tragedy in the sense that Hannibal ends the film as worthy of fear and scorn as his childhood captors, Grutas has to have more than just an evil face. He does not. He is not even a credible evil figure. All we know about him at the beginning of the film is that he is a deserter from the German army as the Russian army closes in on the Eastern front. We are never told if he had ambitions to be anything else, what he thinks of what he did towards the end of the war, or what effect, if any, the knowledge of the past has on him. He is a cardboard cutout, and this robs young Hannibal Lecter of any of the credibility or emotion he has as a character. Hannibal Rising is a two out of ten film. If it missed the mark any more thoroughly, it would be an episode of MST3K that does not even require commentary. With such a proliferation of better ideas out there, its presence is an insult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as it could have been, but a long way from great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of Thomas Harris' books, I was excited when I learnt that he was writing a new entry in the fantastic Hannibal Lecter series...but then disappointed when I found out it was to be a prequel, and it was to come out at the same time as a movie adaptation. This all stinks of a way to make some money, which is OK; but I prefer it when talented artists such as Thomas Harris write with integrity rather than dollar signs in their eyes. However, that aside, when I sat down to watch this film, I was more bothered about how good it is rather than how it came about; and while this isn't great stuff, it's not as bad as I'd heard it was or thought it might be. The plot focuses on Hannibal Lecter, at first as a boy as he witnesses his beloved sister Mischa eaten by hungry soldiers. Fast forward eight years and Hannibal is a young man, but an angry one. He wants revenge on those that took Mischa from him and will stop at nothing to get it. We then watch Hannibal as he sets himself up in Paris and proceeds to find the men who wronged him, and get his bloody revenge.The previous three entries in the Hannibal Lecter story worked because the plots were presented in a way that was both intelligent and well put together; but that isn't the case here. The main problem with this film is that it's far too simple, and actually turns out to be a lot like a simple revenge/slasher flick...and that's not what Hannibal Lecter, to me at least, is really all about. As you would expect considering Harris' obvious love for shocking murder scenes, the murders here are grisly and disturbing - and include things such as decapitation, drowning and someone being sliced up with a samurai sword. The film is obviously on the back foot somewhat before it even starts as the series star - Anthony Hopkins - doesn't feature, and Hannibal this time is played by French actor Gaspard Ulliel. Ulliel was never going to live up to Hopkins, and he doesn't really convince us that he will grow into the criminal mastermind. Furthermore, he often comes off as looking more like a thug than someone with any brains, but he looks evil enough...so that's a plus. Overall, this film doesn't sit alongside the rest of the series well; but it's not terrible and I'd say it's at least worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Miscast Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising is a great film, but entirely out of its element. It's an intensely fulfilling revenge tale, portraying a WWII occupation with surprising effect and giving a horrifying depiction of war criminals and the depravity they committed. The story sways through historical Europe during and after the Second World War, with dark and Gothic atmosphere. Revenge is taken with creative, clever, and absolutely grisly effect, each target of vindication being dispatched singularly in their own drawn out episode of sick and twisted retribution. Unfortunately, this doesn't work, because it is the beginning of Hannibal Lecter.The most frightening thing about Hannibal Lecter is that he's capable of getting inside the deepest, darkest caves of anyone's mind. Remember Miggs in The Silence of the Lambs? Hannibal made him choke himself with his tongue by talking to him. He wasn't even in the same room with him. And Hannibal did this to amuse himself. He thought Miggs was rude. This is why one is truly afraid of Hannibal Lecter. It isn't his physical cannibalistic urges that make him so scary. It's the fact that he is brilliant beyond the majority of people, and he knows how to use his brain and read people in a way most people hardly think to. It's a human advantage that makes him so nearly invincibly capable of such inhuman things. When a true Hannibal Lecter fan goes to see Hannibal Rising, he or she will expect to discover the backstory involving the early stages of his dangerously excellent psychological growth. They will be disappointed. There is hardly any sign of this in this so-called prequel. He flirts with the idea of a mind game here and there with the detective who follows him, but why? How has he grown into that sort of calmly penetrating exchange?In The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and Red Dragon, Dr. Lecter feels he is doing something to rid the world of its lesser souls when he targets someone to kill. He is seen as another serial killer by the FBI, but he has his very own agenda. This, however, is evident in Hannibal's beginning. So what you get as an audience is a satisfaction in the department of gore and violence. Fine. We all love gore and violence. We all love horror. But with a prequel that has a lot of 'splainin' to do with possibly the most complex and fascinating character ever put on film, it completely slacks off its responsibilities. Shoot. If only Hannibal Rising had a different title and a different name for its main character, then it could just possibly be one of the most fantastic films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She continues her triumphal conquering of Western Cinema as well as continuing her reign in her native China with CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER. First in Geisha, then in Miami Vice &amp; now Hannibal Rising she gives each movie a stamp of greatness. Her English continues to improve &amp; even tho she is now in her 40's she is still ravishing - much better looking in fact than all those Hollywood 20 year olds. She has a kind of old time glamour like Garbo &amp; Dietrich etc. The rest of the cast esp Gaspard Ulliel are fantastic. Mr. Ulliel should have a great career ahead of him. Rhys Ifans &amp; Kevin McKidd are terrific as two of the many villains. Dominic West is kind of left in the dust but he does his best to keep up with all the plot twists. All in all I think I like this Hannibal movie better than the last two sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great beginning to the tales of Hannibal Lecter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From start to finish, a nail biter. Ulliel has the beginnings of Hannibal down pat, with the leer, the grin, the sneaking up on people, the slouching walk and the macabre sense of humor. You learn soon why Hannibal is driven to do the things he does and why he does them so well. And another inspector goofs up and just isn't fast enough for Dr. Lecter. The early scenes in Lithuania at the hands of Nazis gives us the needed background and history to flesh out Hannibal's character. It also explains his bottomless old wealth that he draws upon throughout the Hannibal series for the travel and semi-extravagant lifestyle he leads. Meeting his "auntie" who teaches him self-defense and quick moves is also a treat. A "do not miss" movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Without Anthony Hopkins??,,,Nice Surprise!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE psychological thriller fan, Silence of the Lambs fan and more so, Anthony Hopkins fan. This was a very historical perspective on the character Hannibal that made certain parts a bit long..but over all relative to the entire story. Another aspect was the look into Hannibal's actual heart. The other movies portraying Hannibal touch in these areas, but never quite let you explore the possibility that he is not an animal, but a human that has endured more trials and tribulations that we can fathom. I really appreciated the aspect of the writers "humanizing" the character vs. depicting him as a ruthless animal. You also get to see more into how Hannibal acquires his culture and knowledge of different countries and medical information.I was skeptical in seeing a Hannibal movie without Anthony Hopkins in it..however, I was very surprised at the articulate nature the young actor portrayed Hannibal. The movements, demeanor and over all performance was amazing. You can't watch this movie and not see a young Anthony Hopkins at work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do people have such a hard time realizing that each of the movies dealing with Hannibal Lecter are supposed to feel like individual movies even though they are all part of a series? "Hannibal Rising" is a small, beautifully shot film about the consequences of one of the most horrific periods in history. It follows the story of a brilliant and broken mind as it tries to find a way to heal a secret so horrible that it literally eats away at his sanity like a cancer. The screenplay is thoughtful and in no way tries to "one up" or copy any of the other films. "Hannibal Rising" ties together the entire series beautifully and ties together why Hannibal became what he became. Even the boars are tied into the thread of the Hannibal series. By allowing the audience to know what happened to Hannibal and, in some ways, to sympathize with a wounded young man, it chooses to answer the question of Hannibal being a monster through external forces. However, knowing this story and his motives in no way makes what happens in the subsequent movies/novels ("Red Dragon", "Silence of the Lambs", and "Hannibal") any less terrifying, not does it attempt to excuse Hannibal. Six of us went to see the movie and each one of us agreed that it was a particularly original and entertaining (if not gruesome) entry into the Hannibal saga. The acting of Gaspard Ulliel (Hannibal) and Gong Li (Lady Murasaki) truly made the movie much more than just a revenge story, and they deserve a great deal of credit for stepping into and standing out in a brilliant series of movies.Mild Spoiler here:In the end, the only thing that truly disappoints me is that they changed the ending of the movie version "Hannibal" from the chemical and psychological brainwashing of Clarice at the end of the novel. That ending makes perfect sense as Hannibal has finally found a replacement for both Mischa and Lady Murasaki. Clarice is ultimately the embodiment of both of these women and the family that Hannibal lost through no fault of his own. True, chemically brainwashing, kidnapping, and turning a woman into cannibal is undeniably evil, but it does make perfect sense. More importantly, it shows that by knowing the origin of a monster does not make his subsequent actions any less horrific or monstrous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HANNIBAL RISING is not a bad film. The producers did not do it on the cheap - there's lots of location shooting, and the interiors are so lush, they should be Architectural Digest. The director does a good job and many of the shots are in fact beautiful and sort of meaningful to the story. Harris did the screenplay - more about that. The actors are all good. But as a prequel, where we know how the story eventually plays out, it's all sort of fated to fail. Trying to equal Anthony Hopkins is certainly a hopeless task, but the actor who plays young Hannibal certainly doesn't disgrace himself or the character. Interestingly enough they really make Hannibal a sympathetic character at the beginning so that you sort of root for him to somehow save himself - a lost cause of course. The movie, and I suspect the book which I haven't read, are attempts to explain Hannibal, and by extension monsters and evil. But really we don't want such things explained, to have reasons and causes. We want them to be pure evil, then we don't have to examine ourselves and the world, to take some of the blame for them. In the book, HANNIBAL, Harris at times addresses the readers directly in the authorial voice. You can't do that very easily in film, and he doesn't try it here, but I suspect the book, HANNIBAL RISING, will have lots of that because it allows the author to toss ideas and viewpoints at the reader which no character can reasonably state in the story. One more thing, do you suppose they'll do another one of Hannibal before he's caught, in his glory days so to speak. HANNIBAL RISING, then HANNIBAL'S REIGN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. Thomas Harris (you amazing man, you) wrote an amazing book, (and stuck to it for the most part) in his adaptation to screenplay. This movie was not meant to be a young boy on a killing spree, as most people are probably expecting. It's about a little boy who cannot deal emotionally with what he and his little sister were put through. It's simply about revenge. quit all of your complaining. If you don't want to see a good movie, and all you want is another slasher movie with more gore than any sane human being should be able to handle then go somewhere else. I must say that the casting was a little poor, not terrible, but not all that strong either. all together, an amazing novel, and a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hannibal Rising": a strong bloodline continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The terms beautiful and romantic are not adjectives that immediately come to mind when thinking of the homicidal, yet charismatic, Hannibal Lecter. But you may decide they apply after the latest entry into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most recently successful franchise. Shades of Claude Chabrol's "Le Boucher" haunt the framework of this exquisitely filmed entry into the life of the infamous cannibal. When "Silence of the Lambs" exploded in theaters, on the coat tail of the then little known "Manhunter", Anthony Hopkins horrified us while riveting us to the screen. When "Hannibal" came along, we were still horrified but gained insight into the humanity of a serial killer. With "Hannibal Rising" the eponymous antagonist has become protagonist as victim. Gaspard Ulliel brilliantly embodies the novice slayer. Universal did something similar with their monsters during the second world war, with Dracula and the Invisible Man fighting Nazi's. Everything old is new and a swastika carved on a bodiless head never seemed so cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The texture was incredible. Brilliantly shot. War torn Lithuania was shot magnificently by Weber. Ulliel was fantastic as young Lecter. Dominic West was brilliant as Inspector Pascal Popil. He had more of an impact on me than Pazzi in Hannibal, and believe it or not Ed Norton's awful portrayal of Will Graham in the needless remake Red Dragon. Pazzi was a coward, only out for the money, whereas Popil is his mirror opposite.This picture is much much better than Red Dragon in my opinion. No knock on Norton, but he was miscast in that film.Lecter's "departure" so to speak from humanity is gradual, yet riveting, and Popil plays this wonderfully as sees him as a being that is completely indifferent and without remorse.The score is OUTSTANDING. Very Gothic, like Hannibal.Rhys Ifans plays the chief Nazi Collaborator Vladis Grutas. Fantastically ruthless.Isolate this film from Silence of The Lambs and Red Dragon. An American police procedural it is not. Instead, it is a uniquely set period piece about walking the line of genius and insanity.A line from the novel Hannibal comes to mind. In the early stages of Lecter's brainwashing of Starling, he says to her "Do not say thanks." He is trying to form her into his Lady Murasaki. Li Gong, ever beautiful, and enigmatic, has a very "twisted" relationship with Hannibal.Always in the minority, I LOVED Hannibal, and this film is right there with it.This will naturally be panned by critics, as so few movies in this genre are ever praised. But, what do I know, I am not an all knowing movie critic.It's laughable to think that critics, and fans, know the character better than his creator Thomas Harris.To me, this backstory only ads depth to this uniquely engrossing monster.This truly felt like 40's or 50's styled film. The wardrobe, automobiles, dialogue, colors. Fantastic.Ulliel has Hopkins speech pattern down pat. Mishca's death, Ifan's ruthlessness...Hannibal being consumed with morbidity and revenge and a distaste for anything uncouth. It had more emotion to me than Hannibal, or Red Dragon.In closing, I left the theater in anticipation of purchasing the soundtrack, anxious to hear Weber's commentary when the DVD is released, and thankful that I took a half day to catch this entertaining flick that has action, drama, frights, art theft, Japanese culture, and a plunge into the most sinister mind in fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Prequel? Not quite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through the first 30 minutes of my film, I already found myself saying "Surely this will get better." but, as I would quickly learn, I was wrong.Let's start with the characters. Hardly any of them are given any real background besides Hannibal, and even his seems somewhat disappointing. You will find that this film, rather than adding to the overall character of Hannibal Lecter, it simply takes away from his infamy. In a sense, they tried to set him as a distressed man with an awful past, rather than just a complete psycho.This film was, more or less, a cheap attempt to milk a slightly good series of films for more than it is actually worth. This become's terribly obvious once you realize there are no great actors to even support this plainly written script. I found myself looking for at least one character that I could find interest in, only to find that background information on every character was simply non-existent.Not once was I in suspense during this film, and I wonder if my money would have been better spent renting a few cheap horror films and watching them with a few friends rather then seeing this waste of time.So if you are looking for a movie with a plot that's more dry than Pheonix, has characters who's background are about as intricate as buying a Big Mac at McDonalds, and who's overall effect will leave you wanting to spend the rest of your weekend at your grandmothers, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Rising was a great beginning to the berth of Hannibal "the cannibal" Lecter. It was not the cheap "gore-fest" that the preview made it out to be. Gaspard Ulliel plays a superb young Hannibal. His voice and character are so commanding. The way he carries himself, the body language, and the relationships he forms with all his characters, show how Hannibal Lecter become the charismatic villain that everyone hates to love. I felt the character that Gaspard Ulliel commanded. It has to be very hard to follow in the footsteps of a role that Anthony Hopkins will most likely be remembered for. Ulliel opened the door for Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Anothony Hopkins emerged. As life evolves and years pass, you grow. I can tell you that Gaspard Ulliel will become that Dr. Hannibal Lecter that we all know and hate to love. Why 8 out of 10: 1.) Personally, some of the supporting actors could have been better. I love Domonic West from HBOs The Wire and Kevin McKidd from HBOs Rome. I just felt they were wrong for the part. Maybe add ins because they had been successful in their HBO series and people like myself would recognize them. They were not bad, I just feel they were wrong for the part. Personally I would have tried to cast a famous actor who has that "bad guy" image. Like Christopher Walken (not for this film...but is known for his "bad guy" image). 2.) At times the movie seemed longer than it was. In the end, I loved it, but getting there at points was tedious. I believe it was necessary in the development of the character.....it was ashame that Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal came out before Hannibal Rising. I think the progression from the actual order of the events would have made the movies even better. The evolution of a killer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well we were so excited to be going to see Hannibal Rising tonight at the Cinema's. We bought the popcorn, drinks and ice cream, the movie seemed to start off good showing soldiers taunting Jews, meanwhile over at Lector Castle the family consisting of Hannibal Lector, his young sister Misha, their mother and father pack their belongings to move to a home in the woods, bombs going off everywhere! The first 1/2 hr looks like its growing to be a great movie, but then it died off. Mother and Father Lector are killed from Russians who invade their land and attempt to blow apart a plane flying overhead shooting it down, the bullets from the plane kills Father Lector, the plane crashes into the tank the Russian is firing from, whilst Hannibal and his sister look on from the front door of the house. The Russians are cannibals, eat his sister (which you don't see) but as Hannibal grows up every night he dreams the same dream of when they took his sister out in the snow to kill and eat her. Hannibal ends up back at Lector Castle only now it's turned into something of a boys home, he is teased and runs away after stabbing a boy in the hand with a fork.. OK.. he later finds his aunt who is Japanese and learns the art. His aunt is abused at a Butchers shop and so Hannibal kills the butcher, with a Samuri sword. Then he learns to be a Doctor preparing bodies for the University. One by one he finds the men who ate his sister and kills them, he finds out he also ate his sister, his Asian aunt obviously falls in love with him but the storyline is jumpy and annoying...by this it was so predictable and getting verrrrry borrrring.. I mean, we watched SAW III and it was more scarier than this.. but paying good money we sat through it, how? is beyond me but I know one thing is for sure I won't waste my time buying it when it is launched on DVD. We started the collection.. but I think we can live without this copy quite easily and thats saying something! Do yourselves a favor and forget about seeing it at the cinema, you may as well wait till its on DVD and save the money, then you won't worry about throwing $5 dollars away on rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rushed out and bought the book so that I'd have it read before it opened in Australia. Finishing it, I thought that the book didn't really do too much damage to the franchise, but really didn't enrich it at all. So off to the movie. It was much the same. Can't complain about the cinematography, direction, etc, etc, and it remains fairly faithful to the book (Harris did do the screenplay, after all). Ultimately though, as with the book, it doesn't add much to the franchise. To be honest, it was quite dull. The acting feels very stilted and there's no real chemistry. Whether you've read the book or not, there's no surprises. Wait for it on DVD, if at all. Probably really only for the fans. A lot of people are saying that it really doesn't explain why Hannibal became what he became; well, it is only a book/movie, and really, don't forget, by and large we don't really know why people in real life become serial killers either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a revenge/exploitation picture that (maybe) would've benefited from not having any connection to the Lecter saga...or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thomas Harris's adaptation of his prequel book Hannibal Rising traces the lineage of one of the most notorious villains in the movies. But there's a big problem, among some smaller ones, that keeps this from reaching anything interesting: I never got the sense that Hannibal was totally ape-s***. Harris decides to try and make the case of the how and why, I guess, by seeing what happened to him as a child, but what he fashions is far less from being a probing psychological study of the character than it is just an average revenge picture with delusions of grandeur. Basically, Hannibal, as a child, has to sit back and watch as a group of sadistic Nazis eat his sister, and so years later he hunts them down one by one in France. That's the main gist of it, anyway, but by the half hour mark I knew I wouldn't be seeing anything that would really take me inside of this character, as he's ironically so thinly drawn and performed. The actor, Gaspard Ulliel, has almost the same expression on his face from scene to scene (exceptions being when he has rudimentary flashbacks of his sister, and when he gets over-emotional in his homicidal moments), and actually made me feel totally disconnected from a character that was already perfectly drawn together by Anthony Hopkins. It's one-note creepiness from someone with the look of a perpetual mannequin.So in the case of not trying to take the movie seriously- and I knew I couldn't once his aunt, a Japanese widow (Gong Li, not bad but not given much to work with), proceeded to teach him the samurai arts, which in turn provided with the cheap image of Lecter having the samurai mask on, like the mask in Silence of the Lambs, ho-ho- I thought I could get into it with some campiness or something. But it takes itself too seriously to even have the camp factor of it (maybe it might work better as a bad party movie with friends, who knows), as it starts to dull away the senses through its conventions: the detective also on the ex-Nazi killers trails who is sort of on Lecter's trail, the turn around of the main villain (here played by Rhys Ifans, who is actually the only one who gets how stupid a lot of this is and digs into it when he can) who kidnaps the Japanese woman, and just the little notes in the 'filler' between the killing scenes. Now those scenes, I would more than likely guess, fulfill the quota of horror movie junkies looking for some fresh blood and guts et all. There were enough, I'd guess, that had some in the theater doing the typical 'ooh, that's harsh' type of reactions.But even with the cheap creativity of these scenes, it all doesn't do much to make it significant for the picture when there's not much stock put into the characters. We're also given the obligatory, 'super-stylish' flashbacks to the killing of the sister, and the "death" of the boy Lecter out in the snow. But I never could figure what was being claimed as how this influences the character for the rest of the series, and in depth and on surface there was not much more going on than a 2nd rate Death Wish scenario being played out. Even the 2001 Hannibal, which also acted more as a means to be exploitive of the genre and gave sort of facile explorations into already established characters, had some devilish fun as it went along, and compared to this almost looks amazing in comparison. I found myself occasionally laughing, however just out of unintentional befuddlement at an actor, writer, director, and production taking itself way too seriously on material that wasn't significant enough for the effort. It becomes a kind of dreary exercise in genre, and even the cheesy pleasures become dulled by film's end, where no real point at all has been made, and nothing significant established for the other films that would follow the Lecter lineage.In short, maybe the ones who already read the book Hannibal Rising, or the other Harris works, might find more of an interest in the adaptation. But it's practically a disservice to the rest of the series by not contributing anything more original past the world war two connection, and that any character in any genre picture could fill in the blank of the character- anything better than a blank-faced chap like the one here.</fullReview>

Go and see the movie , you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

To be completely honest, I didn't expect much from this movie - I simply watched it out of curiosity and, well, because I'm a Hannibal Lecter fan - and I was pleasantly surprised.Based on Tomas Harris' novel ''Hannibal Rises''(which is a prequel to the three previous books of the Hannibal Lecter series), this movie describes Hannibal's ''evolution'' from an innocent child to a cold-blooded killer. Don't let bad reviews stop you from watching this movie. If you presume this movie sucks because there is no Hopkins, you're wrong. Yes, Anthony Hopkins IS amazing, but let's face it; he is too old to play an adolescent. Besides, Gaspard Ulliel gave an outstanding portrayal of young Hannibal. Trust me, you don't want to miss it - especially if you're a fan of Dr. Lecter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important thing to know about Hannibal Rising is that it is totally unlike the original. It is a much more entertaining film. It has only a few loose ties with it, cannibalism and the name Hannibal Lecter. It is about the early years of Hannibal Lecter explaining how and why be became a serial killer.The movie is about revenge for ghastly WWII war crimes. Hannibal gradually seeks ever more dramatic revenge for soldiers who killed and terrorised his family in WWII.Gaspard Ulliel as the teenage Hannibal Lecter is handsome and serene. It is hard to dislike him no matter how badly he behaves. I only began to pull away from him in the final scenes. His revenges are imaginative, a propos, and humorous.The villains are extreme, fully deserving of their gruesome fates.The war criminals sometimes look completely respectable, with darling children of their own. Sometimes they are involved is the white slave sex trade. You could not tell by looking at the terrible pasts they hid.The movie is visually rich, set in post WWII Europe in picturesque villages and buildings. I found the Russian tanks and Nazi war planes completely convincing. The settings reminded be a bit of a James Bond film without the silly music. The settings greatly contributed to my enjoyment of this movie.I have an unusually strong dislike for war criminals, including those from Afghanistan and Iraq, so this revenge flic was unusually satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a nice bottle of Chianti, I suppose Hannibal Lector gets better with age?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what reason, you reckon, has Hannibal Lector always been one of the most ? if not THE most ? menacing and terrifying fictional icons in the history of cinema? Could it perhaps be because he was introduced to us like a mysterious and devilish personality and remained that way throughout the movies "Manhunter" and "Silence of the Lambs"? For cinematic psychopaths there's one golden rule: the more enigmatic and impenetrable their personalities, the scarier they are. The way Thomas Harris initially created Hannibal Lector in his first novel "Red Dragon", like a deceitful and mocking monster locked away somewhere in the darkest cellar of a psychiatric ward, he was the ultimate nightmare personified. Fairly aged already and obviously drawn by a lifetime of cynics, Lector intimidated rookie FBI agents and sent cold shivers down the spines of viewers from behind a thick protective wall of glass. And throughout all these intense conversations and haunting monologues, you couldn't never really derive who exactly was the individual Hannibal Lector, what caused him to turn into a frigid and antipathetic monster like this and what kind of indulgence he gets out of playing sick and twisted mind games against vulnerable FBI trainees. In my humble opinion, the whole mystery surrounding Hannibal Lector's persona is exactly what made these films so successful, but of course the Lector saga proved itself too profitable not to exploit to the fullest and the first sequel "Hannibal" ? released in 2001 ? was actually more of a spin-off entirely revolving on the cannibalistic killer's little escapades. If that movie wasn't money-making enough just yet, infamous producer Dino De Laurentiis now presents the myth-demolishing prequel "Hannibal Rising"; supposedly clarifying how the young Hannibal Lector grew up to become the relentless maniacal mastermind that he is. Okay I guess this concludes my rant because, in spite of its redundancy and lack of creativity, this is an overall endurable movie with a handful of brief yet memorable highlights. The story opens with the introduction of 8-year-old Hannibal, his cherubic little sister Mischa and two loving parents during the most devastating years of WWII in their home country of Lithuania. After the unfortunate death of their parents, Hannibal and Mischa remain behind and quickly become the hostages of a bunch of derailed war criminals. Eight years later Hannibal is alone, embittered and traveling to Paris to search for the only remaining family he has left. Only through brief flashbacks, we learn what happened to his little sister and come to understand why wants vengeance. Luckily his beautiful aunt has a couple of samurai tricks up her sexy sleeve and Hannibal develops an appetite for human flesh himself. Director Peter Webber ("Girl with the Pearl Earring") works really hard to keep the film lively and mature enough even for the most skeptical fans of the original fans. The post-WWII ambiance is fairly realistic, the settings are grim (obviously not as grim as the psychiatric ward in "Silence of the Lambs" but good enough) and there are some really nice touches, like the repeated use of a creepy children's tune entitled "in Männlein Steht Im Walde". The murder sequences are quite unpleasant and the gore effects are often downright repulsive, which will probably attract the bloodhounds among us and cause many inexperienced thriller fans to have stomach problems. Like most of my fellow reviewers here, I wasn't too impressed with the choice of Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal Lector in his late teenager years. Granted, this young French actor boosts a creepy stare but it isn't enough. He's not eloquent, sardonic, perceptive or intelligent enough to eventually end up in the body of Brian Cox or Anthony Hopkins. And, most importantly, I found it to be a huge letdown ? albeit an anticipated one ? seeing that the origin of Hannibal's evil persona comes from unprocessed childhood traumas and hunger for revenge. Can you say: clichéd?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giving the monster a face...a bad idea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2007 writer Thomas Harris released the prequel novel to successful 'Hannibal Lecter' series, which all had been turned into movies previously. The prequel purely was written with the intention to turn it into a movie. So it was a very commercial project and the end result as expected also isn't anything too good. I even wished "Hannibal Rising" never existed for the pure reason that it almost simply kills the Hannibal Lecter character by showing how he did become the monstrous cannibalistic and intelligent killer who all know so well and was so perfectly portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in 1991 in the movie "Sillence of the Lambs". It gives the monster a face and with that it makes the character more humane and understandable, which is taking away a lot of mystery and scary bits about the character. I'm not sure what this movie tries to achieve. Are we supposed to sympathize for Hannibal now suddenly?The movie shows a very young Hannibal in the beginning, who got traumatized after he saw his parents and sister getting killed during WW II, in his native Lithuania. It does explain how he got so messed up but it doesn't really connect well enough with the events and character of the other Thomas Harris novels and movies featuring the Lecter character. This movie is more like a revenge flick, in which Lecter avenges his sisters death. Charles Bronson would had been proud of him. In that way this movie simply doesn't connect well enough with the other Hannibal Lecter stories, in which his motivations are totally different.All of the events in this movie feel so obligatory and forced. The movie had to show Lecter's first killing. The movie HAD to show the reasons why he became such a monster. The movie just HAD to show how Lecter got interested in medicine. It could had all worked out better if the movie had some more depth and focused more on the psychological aspects but instead the movie more feels like a mainstream crowd pleaser by putting in as many killings as possible without ever going into detail or deeper psychological meanings to it, like all of the other Hannibal Lecter movies did, even the poorer ones. Weren't any of the previous Hannibal movie directors available for this movie? Peter Webber obviously wasn't the right guy for this movie. He knows how to shoot pretty pictures, as he had already proved before with the movie "Girl with a Pearl Earring" but some good effective genre story telling is a whole other thing though. The movie thinks that having a dark atmosphere is more than enough to create a good, tense, scary and mysterious movie with. It doesn't use much else to build up its tension with. The movie moves along in a formulaic way and the movie just isn't the most exciting one to watch. Also when you view and consider this movie on its own right for what it is and separately from the rest of the Hannibal Lecter series.The movie is pretty poorly cast. I must say I already had my doubts if Gaspard Ulliel would be the right choice for the classic and larger than life Hannibal Lecter character after seeing him in "Un long dimanche de fiançailles". He does give the character something new though; A thick French accent...He just doesn't make his character scary and he just too much of a pretty boy. He doesn't fit the character well. But also the other actors really feel out of place in this movie, especially Dominic West.It's a nice looking movie but too lacking as a genre movie and definitely as a part of the Hannibal Lecter-series.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather uninspired fiasco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From my point of view , " Hannibal Rising " is nothing more than a trivial ,nonimaginative attempt at making some more money out of an already overused story . No previous glory of the " Silence Of The Lambs " helps here , it's just good old commercial flogging of the dead horse. Let me dwell on this a bit .The screenplay is mainly plot driven and devoid of any deeper character studies . Hannibal is portrayed somewhat without his well - known charisma , and the reason for his monstrousness and cannibalism is rather unconvincing . There is a shocking , brutal story about a severe childhood trauma that's supposed to explain why Hannibal became Hannibal The Cannibal - but I think it's simply not working well enough . Actually ,it's a bit naive .Don't expect stylish and grotesque killings as displayed in " Hannibal " - no such thing here . Murders are rather unimaginative , not very gory at all . Oh ,did I mention there is also a love story involved ? Yup , Hannibal is in love again - he's such a romantic chap . We get to see his more gentle side - although , that doesn't give us any deeper insight into his personality and motives .Speaking of motives , this movie is mainly about the revenge . Yawn .You can easily predict the outcome right from the start .I suppose we can expect a sequel in a few years . One thing's for sure - I'm not going to watch it .Conclusion : the title of the movie is not supposed to be " Hannibal rising " but " Hannibal irreversibly declining " because it represents , as far as I'm concerned , the ultimate decline of an installment that started so well . Now it's just another money - driven show - biz banality , shallow , nearly empty and mildly entertaining .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from Hannibal Rising and I thought it was excellent. Gaspard is brilliant as Lecter. I think they did a really great job of making this film a thriller and not horror. There were grotesque things occurring and just the right amount shown so as not to be tacky. The only thing is, they might have to make one more prequel...maybe two in order to get to where Manhunter/Red Dragon started. Now we understand why he is how he is but there are still many unanswered questions such as...what happened to Lady Murasaki? Did she end up with the detective? What did Hannibal do up until he was in his 50's? Did he have contact with her? Did he ever love any other women? I haven't read any of the books and I don't know if there are more books. So far, my favorite Hannibal movie is still Hannibal, the one with Julianne Moore. She was a much better Starling. Don't get me wrong, I adore Jodi Foster and she is brilliant but Julianne Moore was better in that role.</fullReview>

Her face registered some shock and disturbance when I told her I liked it. Our conversation ended there. But really, it is not a great film, even a great Hannibal Lecter film (Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs share that slot), but it is an efficient little thriller for those so inclined. DO NOT be put off by the negativity of the mainstream critics; they don't get it and never will. If you want to read a really fine review go to Dread Central which gave it four out of five bloody knives. I give it a nine out of ten for being exactly what I expected it to be.</fullReview>

You won't get what you came for. For those of you who wanted to know more about the interesting character of Hannibal Lecter, don't see this movie because even a six year old just merely able to write could imagine a better and deeper characterization of Lecter. For those of you who thought the film might be a little better than the stupid and boring book, don't see this movie because that was the same I was hoping for when I bought a ticket for this movie after reading Harris' pathetic effort at being a writer and I did get this nonsense piece of crap that is Hannibal Rising. All elements that worked quite well in the novel (and there weren't many!)and that I thought would look quite passable on screen weren't even taken into consideration by the filmmakers! So, this film represents the overall dumb essence of the novel. For those of you who thought that Gaspard Ulliel might be an OK actor, don't see this movie because he is not! He is an anti-talent and his pseudo-evil looks give you the creeps only because it is so ridiculous. And he looks that way all the time! I think that if it wasn't for the character of Hannibal Lecter, this movie would only have been released direct to DVD.</fullReview>

Then tonight, this atrocity...There is no reason why one shouldn't wait until this movie comes on DVD- TO MISS IT. Very good acting and scenery is cool BUT nothing really original or clever. Same scenes are shown over and over again that really will bore you the second time. The gore lacks creativity. A new theme is introduced to invoke nationalism and it just backfires. I felt bad because I had seen Red Dragon as Manhunter but this is worse. It involves the continual rehashing of scenes that will make you lose interest in who Hannibal is. Why Why Why!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this with high hopes but - I'm afraid, my dears - it soon became apparent it has none of the sureness of touch and creepy black humour that made Anthony Hopkins' Lector so watchable and memorable, and little of the pace and tension that drove "Manhunter (1986)", Michael Mann's superlative version of Red Dragon.The film starts pacey enough but soon goes downhill.Part of the problem is that young Mr Ulliel is simply not up (yet) to playing evil personified. Unfortunately, the deficiencies in his performance are simply not shored up by the rest of the cast. The other characters are mostly gross caricatures; the baddies are diabolical beyond belief; and the role-reversal whereby Hannibal becomes almost the good guy is incongruous, implausible, and inconsistent with the rest of the corpus.It is however prettily photographed. Oh, and the voice coach gets my admiration for the range and breadth of funny accents.</fullReview>

I found Gong Li's presence fascinating; the night before, I saw her in Curse of the Golden Flower. Mandarin in the former and English in the former. Brilliant. I don't know if they'll make a sequel but everything here is just right. The acting is just perfect; nothing over the top. It's not as overrated or disappointing as the others. There are no excess scenes of facial close ups which pass off as good acting. It's very straight forward, no plot twists, and does not rely on special effects. Even the simple scene of Hannibal bending down and opening a leather pouch to pull out a huge fish was done with good taste. 'Yum,' he says, and that sums up the movie. This, Red Dragon, and Manhunter are excellent. I hope the book will be just as good, and the sequel too, if there is one. Four out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie today with my husband, mom, and brother, and it was KICKASS!!!! It deviated slightly from the book, which I read as soon as I heard about the movie, like at the beginning, Hannibal when he is at the orphanage, never escaped the basement, but the guy he stabbed with the fork took him into his shed and was going to beat him, and he almost did until Hannibal's Uncle came and got him.In the movie, Hannibal walked to his uncle's castle and his uncle's wife said he passed away a year before, but in the book, he was picked up by his uncle and he died a year after Hannibal moved in.But for the most part it stuck to the book, and the movie was exactly how I pictured it in my head reading the book, which was cool.They left one crucial part out near the end, one of the ways Hannibal found a war criminal was they stole paintings from his family's castle and sold them on the black market, and he tracked Grentz down by that method.But I give this film 2 thumbs up, and I encourage you all to see it. Gaspard Ulliel is a great actor.</fullReview>

Sure it's sombre and quite similar to the other films but this one has class. A classy noiresque ambiance which really makes the film effective.Another thing I will point out is that the film really makes you feel different. It makes you feel different because you have real empathy for Haniball and support him through his list of revenge. And as each of his targets meets their demise inside you cheer because it was justifyable.These are only a few points which make this movie amazing. I truly was amazed when I saw this movie because it's gore and violence with a purpose. Haniball was wonderfully acted and could not have been better.I hope you consider to see this movie.

		<fullReview>As a fan of the first two Hannibal movies I gotta say this one just made me sad for Hollywood. Although my girlfriend and I were extremely high when we saw it, and I'm still coming down while writing this, our judgment of this piece of trash was in no way impaired whatsoever. There is nothing original about the storyline at all. It follows the basic plot of any Greek tragedy, archetype characters included, and doesn't really strive to do anything more. Hannibal is obviously the tragic hero, or anti-hero if that suits him better, and everyone else just serves to play required roles in such a Greek tragedy. His aunt serves as a guide or helper, kinda like when Obi Wan came to help Luke. And oh no, that's not the only Star Wars reference I'm going to make. When young Hannibal is walking in the snow and he sees the soldiers in white coming out of the trees, their uniforms do nothing but remind me of the Imperial Storm Troopers on Hoth. And while we're on movie references, how about how every scene of him with his aunt is like something out of Highlander. Every time a white person touched a sword in that movie it made me want to cry. This is Hannibal Lecter, not Last Samurai. The farthest I got in the movie was when the other men found out that Hannibal knew where they were. That was when I left the theater. Overall the movie couldn't have been worse. The opening scenes could have been done in 5 minutes, instead they tried to make it out to be a war film. I would rather watch Indie films or play Superman 64 than have to sit through that movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When movie studios want to make a quick buck they take a popular franchise and decide to doop audiences' by delivering useless exposition with a catchy tag-line such as: "See how it all began." In this case you didn't want to know that Hannibal Lecter, the brilliantly demented psychiatrist cannibal we all know and love as Anthony Hopkins, has been reduced to some french-accented worm of an actor (Gaspard Ulliel). Sure he has that natural creepiness in his face, much like Cillian Murphy, but when he opens his mouth- the picture falls apart.We get to see young Hannibal in an orphanage, destined to become the crazed murderer, after enduring the loss of his family in a tragic war crime. We even see him all lovey-dovey with a young Asian woman (Gong Li)in the same boat as him (with the exception of her disliking the taste of man flesh), but what we don't see is that piercing mindset of his come into play. We're left with a line straight out of a bad 'Halloween' rip-off (something to the effect of): "The soul of Hannibal Lecter died that day. What emerged from then on was a monster." Oh my! Who knew this would become a witless barrage of a revenge story? What an embarrassment, a gore-less, scare-less film devoid of any recognizable talent on screen. All I can recommend with a slight bit of hesitation yet, is a fanciful score. But please let this franchise die now- quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The weak plot of the novel (which I have read) was masked by the rich prose and fine shadings of Thomas Harris' writing. Not so with the movie, also penned by Harris. The tone and look is exactly how it should be, and the violence is depicted with the appropriate relish without going overboard (note that the book is more gruesome). The casting was well handled, too. All of this counts for nothing though when the idea behind the project ? fleshing out the redundant biography of Hannibal the Cannibal Lecter ? is as pointless as THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING, which is a more entertaining movie by the way. In summary, read the book and think of it as the director's cut, since subplots and characters were discarded for the film version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have just this moment come back from the 4:00pm screening of Hannibal Rising and hand on my heart I have never in my life witnessed such a horrendous film such as this one. Titanic was awful - but at least it had a sort of drunken, mawkish grace to it -Hannibal disappears up its own ass from about twenty or so minutes into the film and you cannot believe that Thomas Harris actually ahem...*cannibalised* his own book to come up with a thin gruel of a film, something that makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like a true masterpiece. (And that has been said with the utmost of affection)Why, oh why was Dino De Laurentis allowed to flog the franchise like a dead horse? I suppose I'm one of the very few people who have a grudging tolerance for the two mediocre films that came after Silence of the Lambs, granted they weren't great - but they were all about the most iconic cinematic figure of the 90's - and what made him tick. Well in this film - you find out in the most toecurlingly inept way possible. Dino has effectiveley destroyed the Hannibal legacy and has taken what scant credibility it had and let loose his urine all over it.I know that Hollywood has been taking its film go-ers for granted for many, many years, but surely this ranks as the most fetid, devious, money grabbing attempt yet.It says a lot when the best actors in the film are the small children who play Hannibal and his sister when they are 8 and three respectively. Gaspard Ulliel acts his way through Rising like he is suffering a stroke. Rhys Ifans - a normally dependeble Welsh actor hams it up like Miss Piggy on slaughterhouse night. This film had me laughing at the absurdity of plot, acting, oh crap - everything. Only one little bit (the 'art' shot) where Hannibal as a little boy is stumbling through the snow has any effect whatsoever.Honestly when you watch it - you will think two things all of the way through the film.1: It should have been called Carry On Lecter: Don't Lose Your Head2:When did Lecter turn into David Copperfield? I hope to god they never bring out another Lecter film. But - they probably will - and yes, I'll probably still go and see it. More fool me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this on the strength of previous offerings. We (me and my husband) think that the acting in this movie is phenomenal ... Monsieur Ulliel has a huge future if he can continue to deliver performances of this calibre - he is arresting and believable. Ms. Li Gong was likewise amazing as the step-aunt with a twist. My only negative opinion is that the acting of the detective (Dominic West) didn't quite hold up to the other performances (incl. the nasty criminals) - but my husband disagrees on this so perhaps its a personal comment. Warning... many people out there will find this movie is confronting and graphic - it's all contextual but hey, *context* is awfully wide when it comes to a character like Lecter. I still think that its rare to go to a movie where the protagonist is simultaneously sexy, scary, accessible, intelligent and terrifying. Predicting a huge future for Mssr. Ulliel if he can keep up performances like this. The movie is outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a terrible movie, just a pointless one. Peter Webber's film is a decent piece of work, but not one I'd want to watch again tomorrow. The fault in this project goes back to Lector as a franchise that Thomas Harris, who created it, has allowed to overrun itself. It's he who could have left well enough alone. But he had to write a prequel, and then he had the temerity to write a screenplay from his book, which he'd never done before. A prequel is always the last gasp of such a series. The critics are falling all over each other in their eagerness to condemn the film ? but what they're really condemning is Harris' prequel. The idea that some childhood trauma would somehow enrich our understanding of villainy goes against the nature of real villainy. We don't want to forgive Hannibal Lector or understand him; we want to be horrified and afraid. Better he should have no childhood?or a placid, happy one.Hannibal Rising is a pointless movie but that shouldn't make us overlook the fact that it's also in many ways a beautiful and well made one with a good cast (including the famous-in-Britain Rhys Ifans), and Gaspard Ulliel is astonishingly elegant and invincible as the young Lector. Having never acted before in English, Gaspard manages to chew up his lines with as much deep-throated relish as if they were baby cheeks braised with mushrooms, and his ominous cheek scar and savage facial lines were not poorly chosen. This role does not disgrace him, though it's already seeming he's moving away from subtle dramas like The Last Day toward flashy epics like Jacquou the Peasant as his career takes off maybe a bit too fast.Peter Webber directed the beautiful and atmospheric film about Vermeer, Girl with Pearl Earring, and after the gritty and overbearing war scenes of Hannibal there are many lovely visuals ornamented by flash explosions, darkly glowing interiors, and the face of Gong Li among gleaming samurai swords. Lady Murasaki Shikibu she's called, a very odd name for a Chinese lady, and redundant to boot, since "Shikibu" means "lady" in classical Japanese. It's also the name not of a modern woman but an ancient author first translated into English by Arthur Waley. When I first heard it in the dialogue from the mouth of one of the villains ? that is, the men who wronged Hannibal and his little sister in their childhood, and must be avenged ? I thought it was a learned joke. Alas, not so; but again it's the author who's at fault, not the cast and crew.As with all work designed to satisfy the taste of cultists, this will delight some and enrage others. One critic has even damned Ulliel for not being as "chinless" as Anthony Hopkins. Well. The recent novel this is based on is as guilty of creating a fantastic, far-fetched youth for this now famous villain that we never heard of before, because there was no basis for it. Hopkins' Hannibal Rising wasn't a young Anthony Hopkins. There is no young Anthony Hopkins. After all, Demme's Silence of the Lambs is a brilliant effort even if it signaled the end of Demme as an original filmmaker. This will only blur that memory. Did I say I didn't want to watch this tomorrow? Make that the day after tomorrow, and the day after that. But I will forgive all who worked on this film ? except Thomas Harris ? and go to see their future work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon seeing the film twice now I can truly say that this is simply an astonishing piece of art. The film was shot well, the plot paced excellently and the acting was just...if one word can describe it then that word would be superb. Everything about the film was excellent, and I couldn't ask for a better prequel to carry on the Lector legacy. Ulliel played an amazing young lector, he had the look and his menacing stare. The delivery of his lines and his gestures truly added another dimension to the character we all know and love. As I stated earlier, the plot paced well, and kept me intrigued from beginning to end. Gong Li or Murasaki Shikibu played Hannibal's only surviving relative of the WW2, her beauty and courage really drives her character, for she is the only one who can appeal to the only thing that's left of Hannibal's humanity. The ending was great and will remind you of the previous films. Go to the theater with an open mind and see the film for yourself. Despite negative reviews Hannibal Rising to me is pure genius and is second in the Hannibal next to only The Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie in my opinion is terrific in all its aspects. The acting is superb especially from Gaspard Ulliel who is cold and menacing and portrays Hannibal Lecter 'truly' as if he was in real life. The storyline and direction is great expressing a vast emotional range of the characters, the beautiful and ugly side of humanity and how ones mind could work in such situations.The most noticeable thing about this movie which truly caps this off as a successful prequel is the tone of the movie. In Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal the tone is very different from what you experience in this movie which in my opinion is very refreshing from what we're all accustomed to seeing in these movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannial Rising starts in Lithuania during 1944 as the second World War destroys Europe, mom (Ingeborga Dapkunate) &amp; dad (Richad Leaf) Lecter escape from the relentless Nazi invasion of their country by holding up in an isolated log cabin with their two young children, the 8 year old Hannibal (Aaran Thomas) &amp; his younger sister Mischa (Helena Lia Tachovska). All seems well until they are attacked, mom &amp; dad Lecter are killed which leaves Hannibal &amp; Mischa to fend for themselves. They are then taken hostage by a gang of six thieves &amp; general scumbags who after getting very hungry kill Mischa &amp; eat her, this would obviously scar anyone &amp; the young 8 year old Hannibal is no exception. After breaking out of the Soviet school he has been imprisoned in for the past eight years Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) makes his way to France to find his uncle, he happens to be dead but his Japanese wife Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li) whom he becomes close to is still alive as he sets about taking revenge on the people who ate his sister...This French, English &amp; American co-production was directed by Peter Webber &amp; while I count myself as a big fan of both The Silence of the Lambs (1991), Hannibal (2001) &amp; to a lesser extent Red Dragon (2002) I don't really have much time for Hannibal Rising &amp; to describe it as a disappointment would be an understatement. As seems to be the norm these days for big budget Hollywood horror Hannibal Rising is available in two versions, the theatrical 'R' rated cut &amp; the 'Unrated' version which I think will be the one most commonly released on DVD, I will be basing my comment on the Unrated cut. The script by Thomas Harris based on his own novel of the same name is a pretty weak &amp; straightforward tale of revenge, there's none of the brilliant psychological horror here of the previous films as Harris turns his own franchise into nothing more than a throughly routine feeling slasher style revenge flick &amp; not even a particularly good one at that. We barely learn anything about Lecter except that his sister was eaten during World War II, after that it's just all very predictable as Hannibal bumps off the people responsible. His medical studies, thoughts, personality &amp; inner feelings are all but ignored, I didn't like the Japanse woman at all, the other character's were all pretty bland &amp; the exploitation levels are lower than a snake's belly. At over two hours for the Unrated edition it goes on for way too long, it outstays it's welcome &amp; is quite frankly boring with an awful ending as well.Director Webber obviously had a decent sized budget &amp; turns in a good looking film but it's nothing special. Personally I don't think there's a single scary moment in the entire thing, it's not creepy or eerie &amp; the young Hannibal Lecter just didn't send chills down my spine, in any way get under my skin or make me feel uncomfortable at all. I didn't like the referential little homages either including a Japanese samurai warriors mask which looks almost exactly like the mask the FBI make Hannibal wear in The Silence of the Lambs, I thought it was out of place &amp; felt odd. Gore wise Hannibal Rising the 'Unrated' edition feels more like a PG as all I can remember are a couple of decapitated heads, a severed arm, a knife stuck through someones head chin first &amp; someone being cut with a sword. I suspect most of the extra minutes are made up of dialogue as this is a really tame film.With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 this had a healthy amount of money thrown at it, it has that Hollywood polish about it &amp; is very well made if a little forgettable. The acting is OK but nothing special, I didn't like Gaspard Ulliel at all as Hannibal, nobody touches Anthony Hopkins period.Hannibal Rising might have impressed me more had it not had anything to do with Hannibal Lecter but it does &amp; I felt nothing but disappointment in between the bouts of extreme boredom, I'm sorry but it's as simple &amp; straightforward as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another betrayal of Hannibal, and a weak movie on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine yourself trying for the first time to paint someone else's portrait with the brush in your teeth. The result would surely be a messy abstraction of your subject. So it is with what Harris and De Laurentis have done to Dr. Lecter. By itself, this movie might have been okay as an HBO movie, but you must evaluate this movie as it relates to the other Lecter movies.This is a lame slasher film, but worse yet is how often the movie betrays Harris's back story about Lecter in his other books. Honestly, the first Friday the 13th was better that this movie, by far.Thomas Harris was commissioned to write the book this movie is based on. It read like he threw it together in a 1-week cram session. If it had been his first writing effort, I can't imagine it getting published, it was such plodding crap. The movie just plods further.Silence of the Lambs was so powerful because of the way it taunted your mind with right and wrong. Though "evil," Dr. Lecter was absolutely fascinating. Though he killed those guards savagely, the exciting part was seeing how he'd plotted his escape with perfect patience. The violence was quick and ruthless, not gratuitous.It's stunning how any competent filmmaker could see "Silence" and miss what was so powerful about it?minimalism. Hopkins was on screen for only 27 minutes of that film, mostly just talking.In "Hannibal Rising" (A stupid title) Hannibal is not mysterious, nor does he engage in any fascinating dialog, nor does he come off as especially monstrous, except when he's really mad. Gong Li's acting is perfectly horrible. She's good looking, but her acting was stiff.And for some added silliness?Rhys Ifans is in this movie. In case you didn't catch the movie "Once Upon A Time In The Midlands," Ifans was in it, and exclaimed to a women regarding her brother, "He's your FOSTER brother; he could have DNA strands from Hannibal Lecter for all you know!"</fullReview>

Finally finding out what made Hannibal Lecter tick or to put it another way, why he enjoyed a human leg more than a chicken leg, came with some superb set pieces and a believable premise. Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal Lecter gives a restrained and polished performance with the menacing stare that made Anthony Hopkins, Hannibal so frightening, copied to a tee. The individual killings were original and "tastefully" done (i won't be going fishing anytime soon, nor will i become a tree hugger!) I hope that Thomas Harris stops with the Hannibal Lecter series now. There is no more to be said. When the "Special edition Boxed Set" to this series comes out i'd recommend watching them in chronological order, so that you get the real feel and understanding of who Hannibal Lecter really was. Never has there been a more complex and thoroughly entertaining murderer in the movies. Where ever he is now, i hope that he stays there. 'Its not as if you need the money Thomas!!!'</fullReview>

With the technical elements of the film as overblown as they are, this movie's tone becomes almost unpalatable.

In fact, 20 minutes into the movie I realized that I really wasn't even going to like it. I almost wanted to leave the theater.One of the greatest things about Hannibal Lecture was the mystery behind him. How did such an intelligent man become such a monster? Well, That mystery would have been better left untouched.Even worse than the way the movie presents the story itself, The acting is pretty bad as well. I can in no way imagine this portrayal of Hannibal growing up to act anything like Anthony Hopkins or Brian Cox's version. This young actor had the face for the part, He certainly looked creepy enough. It was his voicing. It was just, annoying. He sounded as if he had something stuck in the back of his throat the entire movie causing him to sound somewhat like a French Rocky Balboa.Don't waste your money. This movie will only leave you wishing you hadn't seen it.Think of it like this.Take "The Crow". Add Cannibalism, exchange the black cop for a French one, and trade the guitar for a samurai sword.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw an advanced screening of it last week and I was just blown away by how well made it was. It was very interesting to see what happened to Hannibal Lecter and what provoked him into doing what he did. The movie is definitely gory, grisly, twisted,sick, and not for the children. I have to admit it was a little bit more then what I expected, but it was good nonetheless. Hannibal rising is for sure the best one in the trilogy, except for silence of the lambs, which can never be surpassed, but is still a must watch for fans of this type of genre. So if you want to see good story telling, with a mix of sadistic, inhuman edge of your seat action then Hannibal Rising might be the next movie you will want to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I work for a film distribution company I am lucky to have seen this film before its release.The basis of the film surrounds the upbringing and earlier years of Hannibal Lecter. It basically tells the story of why he became the monster he is and how his character was shaped. The story begins with Lecters upbringing in his castle home during the war which eventually leads to him being orphaned. Taken in by his uncle and his uncle's wife, he starts to mature as do the evils within him. If you haven't read the book, try to do that first, as the film is always an easier option, but the book is well worth reading before you see the film.It is a very accurate screen version of the book, probably because Thomas Harris also wrote the screenplay. It is a dark and chilling film which will remain in your thoughts for a time after.A great film based on a great book. Definitely one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this movie was going to be lame, but my girlfriend wanted to see it, so I had to see it... This movie is oddly similar to Batman Begins. A young wealthy boy is traumatized by his family's murder, then grows up and learns how to fight and goes after the murderers and other bad guys.Unlike Anthony Hopkins, Gaspard Ulliel was not able to make Hannibal Lecter a likable character. He was obnoxious and lacked the intelligence and depth that Hopkins gave to the character. It wasn't all Gaspard Ulliel's fault, the script he was given was bad to begin with.This movie could have been really cool, but it was reduced to a basic revenge film with a "hunt-kill-hunt-kill" structure. Toward the end, there was a really cliché scene where Hannibal yells "NOOOOOOOOOO" like Luke Skywalker after Vader says "I am your father." Worst of all, the film was just boring. I do NOT need a lot of action, just something interesting! This movie was by far the worst of the series and I'd have walked out of the theater if I wasn't with my girlfriend.</fullReview>

This movie is a re-write of the Thomas Harris novel; really its an improvement, the novel reading more like a treatment for a screenplay than an actual novel. But its total sin: "Thou shall not recompense evil; Vengeance comes from the Lord your God" (Proverbs). The only way to hate Hannibal Rising, is to compare it to Silence of the Lambs--the series' energy is not as high now. Its a "rape and revenge" film really. The thing that got my heart really racing was the preview for GrindHouse's two movies for the price of one: Planet Terror and DeathProof. AWESOME . . . . I can't Wait for that one!!!!! See HannibalRising for the Grindhouse trailer if nothing else . . . Oh Hannibal's main squeeze is the chick from Miami Vice so no; its no Silence of the Lambs or Manhunter, or Red Dragon because its . . . Hannibal Rising. In the 6th movie I guess we'll see Anthony Hopkins once again coming full circle and dying once and for all (of old age) in a nursing home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now we know why!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On my recent Visit to the States I caught 'Hannibal Rising' with a movie critic friend of mine. Whenever I hear the word 'Hannibal' which by the way has dug deep into our psyche as a pop culture phenomenon, I am reminded of the red, blink less eyes of Sir Antony Hopkins toying with Clarice. 'Well! Hello! Clarice!' .But here we have no Clarice Starling and Antony Hopkins. This is about 'the making of Hannibal'. It's about how a young Hannibal becomes Hannibal 'The cannibal'. It's a prequel. Hollywood has had a tremendous amount of success with prequels in recent times. I even heard of the idea of creating a prequel of 'The Lord of the Rings' doing rounds in the Hollywood circles (Tolkien must be churning in his grave). And no wonder Mr. Thomas Harris (novelist) was also tempted and the funny thing is the book also comes out at the same time the movie does. So we don't have any way that we can compare. That's good strategy.In any case let's talk about the movie. Any actor trying to fill Sir Hopkins's shoe will find it impossible but the producers did the smart thing by hiring an unknown French actor to play young Hannibal. That way we will have no expectations and this was set in a time when Lecter was yet to become who he was. We watch with awe and horror what happened in the early part of his life. We now know (from 'Hannibal' the book and this one) that Mischa and what happened to her played a very important role in turning Hannibal to the 'dark side' (sorry! Star wars).And he searches, finds and unleashes terrible revenge on those responsible. He slowly and inevitably becomes Hannibal 'the cannibal'. We watch the transformation with interest even though it feeds a lot on serial killer clichés. We also get to see a tender relationship with him and Lady Murasaki (China's Gong Li). If you come to watch this movie my advice is to forget that the other 3 movies even exists. Or else you will inevitably start comparisons which this movie will not be able to withstand. I will rank this one inferior to 'Silence of the Lambs', at par with 'Red Dragon' and of course superior to 'Hannibal'. People who always wondered why and how Dr. Lecter was created will have their answers. Hopefully to their satisfaction! But I'm sure a lot of the critics are 'sharpening the pen' for a scathing attack on this movie but I advice you to ignore them. Go and watch it. Its fun. I give it 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I walked out after about 30 minutes into the film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I don't do that very often.This was a horrible film and it tarnishes an otherwise decent series.Honestly...they should have got someone who at least looks even remotely like a young Anthony Hopkins to play the part of Hannibal...Personally I think they should have cast Giovanni Ribisi in the role.There's so much wrong with this film that I could literally write several pages on it, and to be honest, I just don't have the time.The audience was audibly groaning...My wife and I were the first to walk out...a few others followed suit.Save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesome. Gory. Grisly. All what Hannibal Rising is about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the preview for the film on television and then I saw a special sneak peek at the mall a couple weeks ago and I could not believe it. Many gruesome deaths and mesmerizing music. I never thought that a 5th movie in a series could be as good as its 3rd one, Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal Rising is definitely better than Silence of the Lambs.The tale begins in Eastern Europe at the end of World War II. A young Hannibal Lecter watches from only steps away as his parents violently die, leaving his cherished young sister in his care. Alone and without any means of support, Hannibal is forced to live in a Soviet orphanage that once served as his family's beloved home. He flees to Paris after he intentionally brutally injures someone at the orphanage. There, he finds that his uncle has died, but his gorgeous and mysterious Japenese widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), kindly welcomes and takes care of him. But even her kindness and love cannot soothe the nightmares and sorrows that plague him. Showing a sly aptitude for science, he is accepted into medical school, which serves to hone his skills, and he finds the right (and pointy) tools to exact justice on the war criminals'Hannibal Rising' is so terrifying and shocking, yet you can't take your eyes away. This film was done so well, that when the DVD comes out, I'm going to buy it on opening day, and I'm going to watch it over and over and over again. And the color tones: the reds, the browns, the blacks, and other dark tones really set the mood for this film.Even though Hannibal Lecter seems like a bad guy in this movie, he's really not. Once you see the movie, you begin to feel bad for him *****MINOR SPOILER HERE****because of his parents dying in the war, which drives him into madness.****MINOR SPOILER ENDS**** Therefore you are on his side. At least I was. You may have a different opinion.Gaspard Ulleil was utterly fantastic. Absolutely stunning performance. He can pull off frightening parts, smooth and silky yet clever and menacing talks with the Inspector, and even emotional parts so well.Inspector Pope (Dominic West) is also quite good. He did better than his character from 'The Forgotten'. This movie also stars brilliant unknown (at least in America) actors Gong Li (Miami Vice), Rhys Ifans (Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (the voice of McBunny)), and Kevin McKidd (Kingdom of Heaven). I realize that Gong Li is HUGE in China, and Rhys Ifans is HUGE in Britain, but we haven't seen them in many popular American movies. I am saying that because I got complaints from people about that subject. I am truly sorry and that's why I fixed this.Anyway...All in all, a creepy, mesmerizing, scary, and hypnotic revenge story that has a very dark tone to it, and many gruesome and unsettling deaths. I loved it.Official MPAA rating: R: Strong Grisly Violent Content, and Some Language/Sexual References My MPAA rating: R: Strong Grisly Violent Content, Some Strong Language, Including Sexual References My Canadian rating: 18A: Gory Violence, Frightening Scenes</fullReview>
