		<shortDescription>sympathetic reassessment of Wilde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was one of the best to appear in the late 90s, and is a sensitive, involving, honest and moving biography of one of the greatest writers of the Victorian era, the infamous Oscar Wilde.More realistic and better played than previous studies of the writer (Robert Morley and Peter Finch both played Wilde in the 1950s), this film benefits greatly from a cracking performance by Stephen Fry in the lead. Not even regarded as an actor, more of a comedian, prior to this, Fry (himself gay, and something of an intellectual) puts across all the nuances and contradictions of the subject perfectly. This Wilde is torn between what is accepted love (his wife, and children), and the 'love that dare not speak its name' (primarily his destructive relationship with the needy, selfish and petulant Lord Alfred Douglas, played here by Jude Law in the role which brought him to world attention). We see his charm and conviction when creating his plays or amusing friends, we also see his weaker side and why he was the cause of his own eventual arrest and imprisonment, we see how prison changed him and - as he wrote himself in De Profundis - broke his spirit and his health.Watch out for other, now big, names in the cast - Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Sheen, Orlando Bloom - alongside the established players such as Vanessa Redgrave (Oscar's mother, Sperenza), Jennifer Ehle (Lady Constance Wilde), Tom Wilkinson (Marquess of Queensbury, Bosie's father), Gemma Jones (Bosie's mother), and Judy Parfitt.A fitting musical score, a smattering of Wilde's epigrams, and a large chunk of his children's story 'The Selfish Giant' (driving and commenting on the action at key points) leave this film close to perfection when detailing the story of the misunderstanding of another age, not too far back from our own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The noblest form of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time over the weekend, drawn to it I'm ashamed to say for the fact that it contained Orlando Bloom's debut appearance, all one line of it. I was pleasantly surprised to discover Jude Law as Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas as well, making this film highly appealing to the voyeurs of the world. However distracting these heavenly creatures are though, they do become quite rightly overshadowed by Stephen Fry in a role that could not be more perfect for him if it were based on fiction rather than fact.I have been a fan of Oscar Wilde for some time, and this film gave amazingly accurate insight into the life of a great Irish literary. Indeed, many a speech by Stephen Fry has been quoted word for word from the actual trial monologues, and the uncanny resemblance of Fry to Wilde himself is astounding. 'Wilde' proved to be entertaining and beautiful, maintaining the historical biopic status is revels in, but never drawing away from the fact that this story is of real people and real events. So much can be gained by observing the prejudices of the past, and such sadness realized from knowing the suffering of those who were not meant for their time. 'Wilde' deserves credit in all aspects from accuracy to acting, direction and scene, it is a beautiful film and a credit not only the cast and crew, but to Oscar Wilde himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not really knowing alot about the life of Oscar Wilde, I looked forward to viewing this film, hoping that it would fill in one of the many gaps in my education. I was not disappointed.This is a film of exceptional human warmth and I can highly recommend it. It deals matter-of-factly with the "issue" of homosexuality, it doesn't condemn or condone what happened in Wilde's private life, the viewer just gets a look at the man underneath the legend.Stephen Fry does a great job as the title role, making Wilde a sympathetic character with whom the audience empathises. How he contrasts with the Marquess of Queensbury! I will long remember the confrontation between the two men, with Wilde giving as good as he gets against the Marquess' pathological hatred.Jude Law gives an expert performance as Bosie (or Lord Alfred Douglas), with his deeply contrasting nature shown to full effect, sometimes being tender and loving, at other times changing into a screaming "madman".Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can heartily recommend it to anyone who likes good films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The importance of being accurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wilde" is an elegant film with sterling performances by Fry, the title character, and a superb supporting cast. However, "Wilde" is also a shaded and skewed partial portrait of the 19th century playwright, poet, and master of the epigram. The film is not so much a biopic as it is a drama: A drama which spends too much time on the sensational aspects of the writer's life and not enough on his history, early life, idiosyncrasies, works, and last years. Nonetheless, "Wilde" is solid entertainment for anyone interested in Victorian period dramas or the man himself. (B+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mild Wilde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playwright, celebrated wit and persecuted homosexual Oscar Wilde is excellently portrayed by Stephen Fry in this biopic but without a hint of the expected waspishness. Instead, we see Wilde as a kindly, sensitive, almost avuncular man. What's more surprising is the parallel absence of manifest sordidness, self-loathing, or desperation, which one might have assumed would have been par for the course in an age where homosexuality was stigmatised and criminal. But as 'Wilde' tells it, Oscar, on discovering his true nature in early middle age, then enjoyed a number of halcyon years in a gay literary milieu, tensioned only by the childish behaviour of his lover, Bosie, and was taken quite by surprise when he suddenly became a figure of public scandal. Which may have been the case, but it makes for a less pressing and gripping drama than one might have hoped for. What's interesting is Wilde's defence in court, which has very little to do with "normal" homosexual behaviour or ordinary human relationships, but which rather comprised a divine idealisation of the bond between a wise older person and a beautiful younger one: hardly the sort of argument that gay rights campaigners would make today. A special credit should go to the team responsible for allowing Fry to appear so convincingly both a dashing young twenty year old and a ruined man, on the verge of death. But this is a mild and indulgent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earnest production with a great performance by Stephen Fry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film biography of Oscar Wilde is a showcase for Stephen Fry. He not only looks like Wilde, he breaths life into the many passages from Wilde's writings that are woven into the screenplay. The difference between reading Wilde and experiencing Fry's performance is like reading Shakespeare and seeing Olivier perform. An evening listening to Fry read from Wilde's works would be worth paying a tidy sum to attend.I had no idea that Wilde had married young to Constance Lloyd (Jennifer Ehle in a fine performance) and had two adorable boys by her. In an effective plot device, periodically throughout the movie Wilde reads to his sons from his children's story, "The Selfish Giant." The readings are presented in a way that cleverly integrates the storyline of the writing with the storyline of the movie, with Wilde being the selfish giant. And how many people know that Wilde wrote children's stories?There are many examples given of Wilde's biting wit, such as, "Give a man a mask and he will tell you the truth," "The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast," and "I find that alcohol, taken in sufficient quantities, can bring about all the effects of drunkenness." Fry delivers these with perfect tone.Of course a good part of the movie is devoted to Wilde's arrest and ultimate imprisonment for "indecent acts" with Lord Alfred Douglas (Jude Law). Wilde truly did live his life in accordance with his comment, "Where your life leads you, you must go. I defy society." As presented here, Wilde is a courageous and sensitive man who was forced into a tragedy by the strictures of a hidebound society. In current America most would judge his infractions with mild distaste at worst.There are some disconcerting transitions, mostly in scenes with Lord Douglas. Douglas is seen to have a volatile personality. He could be needy and tender, but he could also be a first-class ass and manipulator with an explosive temper. His fits of anger seemed exaggerated and disrupted the tone of the movie. I had a similar reaction to the sex scenes in terms of disrupting the flow. Robbie's initial advances were abrupt and without foundation. The explicit sex scenes between Wilde and Lord Douglas would have been better hinted at than seen - their kisses and embraces could well be imagined but they felt incongruous and unbelievable in the flesh.Wilde was much more than a wit. He could express emotions with eloquence. Consider this quote about encountering a previous lover after a hiatus of a few years:"Life cheats us with shadows. We ask it for pleasure, it gives it to us with bitterness and disappointment in its train. And we find ourselves looking with dull heart of stone at the tresses of gold-flecked hair that we once had so wildly worshiped and so madly kissed."The movie is nicely filmed with a good musical score. I wound up liking it more after having thought about it.Watching this has expanded my appreciation for Wilde as a writer and as a person - I have been left wanting to know more about him and his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this film was superb. As had many viewers--I suspect-- I had only seen Stephen Fry in the Blackadder and Wodehouse series. How delightful to find another actor intelligent and flexible enough to range from Melchett to Oscar Wilde! One cannot help but watch his face very carefully, waiting to see the mask slip. He seems strangely delicate in his huge, crushing frame...A nice follow-up movie to Velvet Goldmine, especially once you know that some of the dialogue from the latter was lifted from the works of Oscar Wilde.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting portrait.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wilde is a film about a man's passions destroying his life. Oscar Wilde was a very interesting man and discovered his dormant homosexuality late in life. The film was very tragic in a lot of ways. The love story between Wilde and Douglas was venomous and sweet. The performances by Jude Law and Stephen Fry were top notch. The direction was a little sluggish I thought and the film could have been better paced. The production design was great though and I loved listening to Wilde's sarcasm of the British class system. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde, you will probably like this film more than the average movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film portrays Oscar Wilde in a totally remarkable way. It should probably have focused more on his writing than on his personal life, but beyond that choice, the film is almost perfect.When it isn't completely perfect, it has to do with the plot, which has some rather weak points. The love between Wilde and Bosie is somewhat difficult to understand. They are completely different. Maybe opposites attract, but not when two people live in two completely different worlds, like Wilde and Bosie seem to do. Of course, one could look at it from a cynical point of view, and say that they both have what the other one want; Wilde has money and Bosie looks, but one can also look at it in a romantic way, give them the benefit of the doubt, and think that they really are in love. That makes the story nicer (for a while), and much, MUCH more interesting!Beyond that, I have only positive things to say about "Wilde". The script is fabulous, and adding a double story by putting in one of his nursery stories, was a great move! One of the most best parts of the film, is Wilde's speech in court. Really touching! The ending could easily have become extremely sentimental, but that is cleverly avoided.Stephen Fry shines as Oscar Wilde. He is so credible, and does his job so well that if I didn't know better, I'd actually think that it really WAS Wilde I saw on the screen. Law and Redgrave also put in top notch performances.Everyone will probably not appreciate this film as much as I did (it is a matter of whether you can deal with gay sex or not, and like dramas of course), but give it a try! It deserves two hours of your time, and much much more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not excellent, but not horrible...SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review is a bit of a mixed one. To start off with, I really like Stephen Fry, seeing as I'm a proud owner of the complete Jeeves &amp; Wooster. I also like Jennifer Ehle, who played Constance Wilde, though I've only ever seen her in Pride and Prejudice before.I didn't consider this a bad movie, but I didn't consider it an extraordinarily good movie, either. I kept having the feeling that it could be more than what it was. The plot seemed to jump from incident to incident without much time for the audience to fully appreciate each.In the first couple of scenes the relationship between Oscar and Constance is starting, then before I know it they're married. Before I could get a full grasp of the dynamics of their marriage Oscar is sleeping with Robbie, and before I could figure out how the relationships with Constance and Robbie were reconciling themselves in Oscar's mind, he was onto the next one. Then before I could figure out how he felt about that, he was meeting Bosie...Bosie was one of my favorite things in the film. Just when I thought he was a spoiled little rich brat he was cuddling Oscar, and then once I decided he was all right after all he was whining about how boring Oscar was when he was sick. (I'm sure you're witty and charming when you're ill, Bosie...*rolls eyes*)Then there were the renters. I liked the renters if only because they reminded me of the parts in the book At Swim, Two Boys where MacMurrough is thinking about Oscar Wilde, his hero. Of course, I am not going to complain about Jude Law in bed with a naked renter, either.Seeing as each relationship didn't have sufficient time to be developed, however, some of the nudity came across as gratuitous. Gratuitous nudity can be fine, but after a while my thoughts were less "Oh, nice arse" and more "Here we go, another naked renter, again."I found the dynamics of the Douglas family quite intriguing, and I'd love to see a movie in which Bosie and not Oscar is the main character. Bosie's father was sex-obsessed, had a fixation with cremation, and drove one of his sons to suicide (according to Bosie, that is). He carried a whip everywhere and apparently used it on various members of the family. Forget the naked renters, let's examine how Bosie became the way he was.Oscar on trial was of course fascinating to watch, as the real-life facts of the trials could never be ruined by any screenwriter or director. However, seeing as I didn't have much time to develop feelings about Oscar and his situation, I wasn't emotionally drawn in.Things I liked: Constance's slightly suspicious innocence of her husband's relationships. I was also fond of the scenes with their children, and the fairy tale that Oscar writes and tells to them; it serves as a metaphor for large portions of the film. My favorite Oscar/Bosie scene was early on, when they're walking around arm in arm while Bosie tells Oscar how he's being blackmailed. Oscar's advice on how to get rid of the blackmailing former lover was insightful as to the initial attractions Bosie has for him.In conclusion, the film certainly had its great moments, but it was choppy and sometimes sensationalized, which in my opinion prevented it from being truly powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Role Stephen Fry was Born to Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinematic biographies, even when they are based on a work of non-fiction, are generally fictional in form and often follow an established literary structure. (The filmed non-fiction, documentary-style biography seems, for some reason, to be more suited to the television than to the cinema screen). "Wilde" is essentially based on that age-old literary form- the tragedy of a great man undone by a flaw in his character.It is not true to say of the film- as Halliwell's Film Guide did- that it attempts to reclaim Wilde as a heterosexual, or even to claim him as bisexual, if by that term is meant someone with an equal sexual attraction towards both men and women. It does, however, explore the paradox that a man who has today become a gay icon was a married father of two children. The impression given in the film, however, is that Wilde's marriage to Constance was not based on sexual attraction- indeed, we learn that the sexual side of the marriage came to an end, by mutual consent, after the birth of their sons. Rather, it was a marriage based upon a desire for companionship, for social respectability, for children. (Wilde is here shown as a loving father).Today Wilde is sometimes seen as a foppish, effeminate dandy whose main characteristic was a biting, cynical wit. That is not, however, how Stephen Fry portrays him in this film. He is, certainly, witty, but also kindly, sensitive and generous, without any outward display of effeminacy. He is able to inspire great love in others; two of the other characters in the film are shown as being deeply in love with him. One is Constance, who remains loyal to him throughout and even after his disgrace refuses the demands of her family and of society that she should divorce him. (Despite the general Victorian disapproval of divorce, being a divorcée was evidently regarded as a lesser social stigma than being the wife of a man like Wilde). The other is his first male lover Robbie Ross who remains a true friend even when he realises that his love is not reciprocated.The flaw which proves Wilde's undoing is not, in itself, his homosexuality; in modern times it would be a strange and politically incorrect film which tried to paint homosexuality per se as a character defect. Rather, it is his infatuation with Lord Alfred Douglas ("Bosie") which clouds his judgement and leads him to act rashly and foolishly. It is a paradox that a man who wrote so wisely and perceptively of human nature in general should have shown so little judgement when judging the nature of individuals. Bosie was a young man of noble family and handsome appearance but who otherwise had little to recommend him. Here, as brilliantly played by Jude Law, he appears as spoilt, vain, selfish, petulant and cruel. Whereas Constance and Robbie are in love with Wilde, and Wilde is in love with Bosie, Bosie is passionately and obsessively in love with himself.Apart from self-love, Bosie's one great passion in life is his hatred of his father, the Marquess of Queensberry. Admittedly, Queensberry is an arrogant and domineering bully, but Bosie takes this family quarrel beyond the limits of reason, persuading Wilde to launch an ill-advised libel suit over an intemperate remark. It is this action that destroys Wilde in two ways. Physically, it leads directly to his conviction for gross indecency and subsequent imprisonment. Spiritually, it means that the man who has always claimed to hate hypocrisy more than any other vice is forced to become a hypocrite and to perjure himself by denying his homosexuality in the witness box. Giving evidence he interprets Bosie's line about "the love that dare not speak its name" as referring to platonic friendship between an older and a younger man; such a love dare not speak its name for fear that it will be misunderstood as sexual. It is a skillful performance but an insincere one, and Wilde knows it.In his native Britain at least, Stephen Fry is perhaps not best known as an actor. While he has appeared in a number of films, he is equally well known as a comedian, television presenter and novelist. Nevertheless, he can at his best be a superb actor, and Oscar Wilde seems to be a role that he was born to play. (To declare an interest, he was a university contemporary of mine, and I knew him slightly). For all his faults and his self-destructive nature, we are always aware that Wilde is not only a great man but also a good one. This is one of the most touching performances of recent years. Fry is well supported by Law and by Jennifer Ehle as the aptly-named Constance, a woman so attractive, tender and faithful that one can easily understand how a man who was basically gay could have felt such affection for her. The one performance I was less impressed with was from Tom Wilkinson as Queensberry, who I felt was insufficiently forceful and explosive.The name of the director, Brian Gilbert, was a new one to me; I have not seen any of his other films. Nevertheless, "Wilde" is a very accomplished piece of film-making, one of the best biopics- and certainly the best literary biopic- that I have seen in recent years. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent but plain, TVish Wilde biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1997 Stephen Fry was enjoying an unprecedented surge of sympathy and reverence from the British public. Only two years previously he had abandoned a West End play after only three nights and fled abroad. The fuss that his episode created effectively ignited the conscience of the British people who, given the choice of vilifying a performer for acting (apparently) unprofessionally or sympathising with an overburdened national treasure chose the latter.This is an important story in relation to Wilde, released only two years later. Oscar Wilde was a character not only of similar physical attributes, intellect and sexuality as Fry but also with the same standing in relation to society (and specifically London society = the media). However, for all his popularity, Wilde's pecadilloes ultimately brought him public opprobrium and he fell foul of the law. Fry however rediscovered his confidence to assume a more exalted mantle in the estimation of the British public following Cell Mates-gate.This film is Fry riding that public affection - and failing to really return to love, frankly. Wilde is a more of a document than a drama, despite super turns from Jude Law as Bosie Douglas and Jennifer Ehle as Wilde's wife. It's a competent film but it doesn't touch me at all. Most strangely perhaps is that the film fudges an assessment of Wilde's standing in retrospect: neither the document nor the drama come down in judgement either way on the man or the life. Given the personal affection of Fry for Wilde it's all very odd. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen Fry is well cast as the 19th-century Irish author/playwright Oscar Wilde. This biopic deals frankly with his homosexuality and torment of being attracted to young men. Married with children, Wilde entered a passionate love affair with Lord 'Bosie' Douglas(Jude Law)the son of the Marquess of Queensberry(Tom Wilkinson). The affair led to a celebrated trial and two year prison sentence for outraging the decency of a stoic Victorian society. At times this film seems to drag, but is punctuated with the vivid homosexual love scenes. Supporting cast includes:Vanessa Redgrave, Michael Sheen and Jennifer Ehle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Born To Be Wilde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Fry, alleged comedian, claims to enjoy a passing physical resemblance to the real Oscar Wilde (lost on me!) He is also gay. This 1997 film was the culmination of several years' courtship with the Oscar legend, with Fry asserting that he was "born to be Wilde". This bowdlerised piece of saccharine is a serious disappointment. Worst of all, it deliberately dodges the truth.Every generation concocts its own ways of lying. The 1960 treatment of the same material, "The Trials of Oscar Wilde", managed to avoid all talk of homosexuality - which is rather like making a film about J.P. Morgan without mentioning money. "Wilde" is even more dishonest than that. If your aim is to canonise the man, then you are under a duty to tell the truth.To the public, Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was a writer and late Victorian poseur who went to prison for being a homosexual. From our 21st-century vantage point, his was a kind of martyrdom. It seems barbaric to put a man through disgrace, not to mention two years' hard labour, on account of his sexual preferences. Many people today (particularly media types) are pro-gay, making Oscar a highly suitable candidate for hero. That's the film's big mistake.The film itself is pretty enough to look at. Production designer Maria Djurkovic has pulled off a tour de force, rendering the period detail with exquisite accuracy. It's a pity that the same can't be said about the screenplay's content. Jude Law's brittle Bosie exhibits the blend of effeminate elegance and semi-demented rage so characteristic of the real-life Lord Alfred, but the stables scene in which the sarcastic son tells the irascible father what he thinks of him is simply not believable. The Marquess was a walking volcano of insane anger, and in real life Bosie was intimidated by him. He only ever sneered at the Marquess from a safe distance ("What a funny little man you are"). The whole point about the historical Marquess of Queensberry is that he was an unstoppable, half-crazed bully. So why insert a fictional scene in which a debonair Bosie gets the better of him? Because this Wilde, the 1997 emanation, has to radiate Christ-like goodness. And his acolyte Bosie has to champion the paragon's cause.The film's ending is badly bowdlerised. After his release from Reading Gaol, our hero enjoys a blissful reunion with Bosie in sunny Rouen, beneath the cathedral bells. Fade out. Though the two men really did have an encounter in Rouen, it was brief and unhappy. The relationship was over. The three short years left of Wilde's life were spent in absinthe-sodden poverty, cynically corrupting the youth of France. Wilde's end was ugly and miserable, as these film-makers well know, but they choose not to refer to it.There is an argument which suggests that it really doesn't matter. Feature films are entertainment, not documentaries. Wilde's story is a fable, and can function on the merely mythical plane.And so it can. But when Wilde (in this screenplay) defines 'la vice anglaise' as hypocrisy, it is ironic, given the hypocritical stance of the film itself. Take, for example, the courtroom dramas which pop up towards the end. Oscar is a serene hero, a moral giant who (Christ-like again) permits his enemies to immolate him. This is simply not what happened. Wilde, the pampered socialite, chose - against excellent advice - to launch the libel case. When it all went horribly wrong, the fault was wholly his own. In the witness box, Wilde trapped himself with the utterly unnecessary flippancy of his answers. Wilde was no-one's saint. He brazenly lied on oath, and lied to his legal team. He seems an odd choice for a gay icon, this man who so squalidly denied his homosexuality. The real Wilde didn't bravely await his heroic destiny: he sank into morbid indecision.It gets worse. In this film, we see a dignified Wilde face down two cockney lads who make an affectionate, half-hearted attempt to wring money out of him. The truth was, these were rent boys whom he'd used, and they were blackmailing him ruthlessly. Far from seeing them off, Oscar cravenly coughed up the money. His wife Constance is depicted as a saintly type who forgives him for the devastation he's brought upon her and her sons. No mention here of her changing the boys' names to eradicate the disgrace.In reality, Wilde was not singled out for an unfair martyrdom. He brought disaster on himself. The arrogant attempt to 'punish' Queensberry failed, and in the process opened him up to criminal prosecution. He had been recklessly flouting the law for years. Plenty of homosexual men comfortably avoided scandal (the Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, was sleeping with Bosie's brother). Wilde flaunted his homosexuality, and knew what he was doing. A modern reader can trawl through the literary works of Oscar Wilde without ever hitting on an unambiguous statement of gay identity. Even "Dorian Gray", which is ABOUT homosexuality, never dares to speak its name. The film could have presented Wilde as he was - flawed, vain, cowardly - and still have captured the tragedy of his downfall. But it took the unimaginative route.Wilde's Irishness is sometimes trumpeted as redounding to his credit, as if he were a lovable leprechaun, teasing the staid English with the poetry of his charming Gaelic soul. Not so. Wilde was, like the rest of his tiny band of "anglo" exploiters, an absentee rentier with no love for his colonial underlings back in Ireland. He tried to be more English than the English. A rich fop, living off peasants whom he despised, found himself lionised, then spurned, by fashionable London society, because he thought that he alone could live outside the law. Now, THAT would have been a film worth making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Irish writer Oscar Wilde (Stephen Fry) returns to London from America and gets married with Constance Lloyd Wilde (Jennifer Ehle) in the Victorian England. They have two children, Cyril and Vyvyan, and he makes lots of money with his successful plays. He gets close to the young Robbie Ross (Michael Sheen) and "leaves the closet", assuming his homosexuality and having brief affairs with youths. When he meets the corrupt Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas (Jude Law), he falls in love for the young man; but Bosie's father goes to the court accusing the writer "posing sodomite" and Wilde is sentenced to two years of hard labor. His health is affected by the unhealthy conditions in prison and he has a short life in Paris after being discharged from the imprisonment. "Wilde" discloses the faithful biography of the Irish writer Oscar, with great and bold performances, witty dialogs and a beautiful reconstitution of the life in the Victorian period. My only remark is the excessive and repetitive homosexual scenes with the visible intention of pleasing the gay communities, but totally unnecessary to the context of the story. The running time of 118 minutes is too long and boring but could be shorter with the edition of the foregoing sequences. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Wilde"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is about the famous writer Oscar Wilde, and his forbidden love in the intolerant society.I watched this film two times already, and I really like it. Stephen Fry and Jude Law both give incredible performances. The script is able to portray their untainted and pure love. Their yearning for each other grips me very much. Jude Law portrays Brosie's spoiled personality well. The scene where Brosie intentionally sits in the middle of the restaurant with Wilde is particularly memorable.The story is touching and engaging, making me wanting more. Stephen Fry must be commended for selecting Jude Law, who was not as much of a superstar at that time, as his on screen partner. Orlando Bloom's brief appearance as one of the boys certainly comes as a surprise. Stephen Fry's eye for hot male stars is certainly to be admired!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen Fry's characterisation of Oscar Wilde completely overwhelms all the many other talents in this film. We are perfectly capably of believing he truly is Oscar Wilde, and that fact alone distracts us from superb performances by Vanessa Redgrave, Jude Law, Gemma Jones, Judy Parfitt and Zoe Wanamaker - for instance. Production values/Art direction are excellent and help make this one a truly unmissable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest, excellent presentation of the life of Oscar Wilde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure whether or not this movie would hold my interest for the two and a half hour run time on Bravo but to the contrary I put all else on hold and paid attention.Although the movie didn't tell me anything I didn't already know about Oscar Wilde, the writing, portrayals and presentation were most outstanding in all respects.I can see where many homophobes would have a problem with some of the material, the kissing and explicit sexual scenes were very honestly presented, but they are not the crux of the story. This movie definately changed my overall view of victorian England and society of the era on the whole. The depiction of Wilde during his two year incarceration for lewd behavior was enlightening as well.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone with an intrest in Oscar Wilde the society of turn of the century europe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a message to those of you out there who think that the film focusses too much on Wilde's relationship with Bosie. The film, in my eyes, is a love story - a tragic, cruel love story. It is a story of a romance that was not acceptable in its time and that led to the downfall of one of England's greatest literary figures. For those of you who think that the film should have concentrated more on Wilde's life and work - how boring would that actually be? This film is gripping and makes you unable to leave the room when you watch it. The film does that because it focusses on Wilde's relationship with Bosie (the unbelievably gorgeous Jude Law). The relationship is portrayed as any relationship would be. There are some incredibly touching moments where you realise how much the two love each other - maybe it's not true to life but who cares? That wonderful moment when Wilde is in prison and visiting hours end when Bosie grips the iron grating that separates them and clutches Oscar's hands just as all the other wives are doing with their husbands gets me sobbing every time.The film is beautifully made and perfectly cast. Stephen Fry is fantastic as Wilde, not just because he looks alarmingly like him but because he plays the part so brilliantly and so realistically. Jude Law is wonderful as the both sweet and irritating Bosie, whose moods change faster then Hugh Hefner's girlfriends. Micheal Sheen gives what I see as the most touching performance of the film as Robbie Ross, Wilde's first male lover and life long companion. There's one moment where Sheen shines (pardon the tongue twister). When Wilde is being taken out of court and down to the cells there are people on all sides of him spitting and shouting "Shame!" but Robbie very slowly and almost tearfully raises his hat to Oscar and nods respectfully to him. It's a heart breaking moment and Sheen does it so well. The female cast, though in the sidelines, are wonderful too. Jennifer Ehle is great as the ever suffering Constance and Zoe Wanamaker (one of my favourite actresses) shines as Ada. All in all this is one of my favourite films that never fails to make me cry. It is wonderfully written, brilliantly acted and superbly touching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The same story told in two very different ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film a day after I first saw Ken Hughes' "The Trials of Oscar Wilde" (1960). Seeing them both in rapid succession is an often-confusing experience that makes one want to run straight to the nearest Wilde biography to find out exactly what is the true story.That is, they present pretty much the same sequence of events, though with greatly differing perspectives. The most obvious being that of Wilde's sexuality. Now, whether it is because of Fry being cast in the lead role for the 97 movie (who was famously quoted as being "90% homosexual") or that the earlier film wouldn't have got past the censors, the two takes on the character are wildly different. While it can be interpreted that Peter Finch's Oscar and John Fraser are lovers, it is generally presented that they are not, and that Wilde was the innocent victim of a blackmail attempt that cost him his reputation. Certainly, the half-dozen or so "witnesses" in his trial are identified as criminals, not as "renters", and there is no nudity or profanity in what would then have already been a controversial film.While the former may have presented a more sympathetic edge, being authorised by Wilde's son, the latter presents an Oscar and Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas that are not only homosexuals, but also, Bosie especially, promiscuous ones. This also casts a different light on the trial sequences, where what was an innocent man wrongly convicted, becomes a man who, while not deserving of conviction, lacks the courage to admit his true nature. This also seems rather harsh on Constance, a woman whom he marries as "I have to marry someone". Jennifer Ehle is used for appearance' sake in this film, though in the 1960 picture Constance as played by Yvonne Mitchell is someone he once loved, yet merely bores him. On the other hand, Jude Law is convincing as the sort of man Wilde could have a sexual relationship with, while John Fraser strikes more of a masculine, "buddy" role in the previous film. What I missed in the second movie was the drama, such as when Wilde begs "Bosie" in tears not to kill him while in Brighton. With "Wilde" we don't really get to know the characters to the same degree, and all but Fry and Law are peripheral in its construction.Fry, meanwhile, almost matches Finch's portrayal with a softer, more vulnerable Wilde that seems less at ease in front of an audience. I was amazed when I found out that Wilde is only five minutes shorter than "Trials" - it seems far less, it's construction not as rigid. Maybe this is because it tries to tell so much more: the story begins before his soulless marriage to Constance, and continues after the point at which Trials concludes. Neither, however, features Wilde's death, though the Fry vehicle does have a postscript to account for this. Less coherent, Wilde lacks the pace or form of its predecessor. Where the Hughes film had a clear plot, Oscar caught between a father-son feud, this only forms after several minutes in the later film, and with less attention to Wilde's degeneration in the public eye. The major flaw with the second movie, is, of course, what the playwright was most renowned for: his wit. Where Peter Finch gets to try his hand at the best of Oscar's quips - at least until his eventual downfall - Stephen Fry gets but a handful of one-liners to try out. Rather like casting a man in the role of Jesus and not letting him utter a psalm or perform a miracle.The pace of each individual scene is longer, with classical music adding an easier pace, meaning large jumps in time must account for it's leisurely style. Two ways in which the second film does score over it's older relation is in Wilde's incarceration and the settings. In truth, the settings are very much a matter of personal taste, and "Trials" must be commended for having no outside filming, and conducting it's many horse-drawn carriages in the studio. Wilde, meanwhile, takes full advantage of rich countryside and stately homes to present its vision. And whereas for the former we got scant scenes in what was just another set dressed as a jail, here we get to see the "hard labour" only referenced in the former, and witness the dirt and desperation whilst in prison.If I had to choose between the two films then I would suggest the Peter Finch version to be superior in pacing, construction and interest. Though in truth they are both very different films, with very different agendas. Wilde is a good film, though it's wistful, often indifferent pacing and lack of drama make it slightly the weaker, but an interesting film experience nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a great reflection of the life and habits of Oscar Wilde. Like the cover says "We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars"... It says enough.. Pretty hard to be gay or have a sexual pro for men in that time, but he managed to get true this all. I think that the tragedy of Oscar Wilde is reflecting to this time. This story is an example for our community, because its a story about the modern awareness and the stamina of the now days society that is called by its surroundings.

		<fullReview>Mr. Fry as Oscar Wilde is magnificent, marvelous, realistic and believable from start to finish. The cast from his mother, with too infrequent appearances by Vanessa Redgrave, his beautiful wife, Constance (Jennifer Ehle) and his boys, all evoked the Wilde I imagined.Alfred Douglas (Jude Law) was just a little too pretty perhaps, and Robbie Ross (Michael Sheen) glowed in his warm friendship until the end, and certainly from the beginning.We've had other terrific films about English laws about homosexually and their rigidity, but this story is not imagined but the real life of an imaginative, spirited, true to himself man. I couldn't help weeping for Oscar as I watched Fry go from the bon vivant to the prisoner. I have only one objection to the film and it is the ending. Lord Alfred Douglas was a selfish man, with few scruples, and let Oscar Wilde down badly and unconscionably. This is not well conceived at the film's conclusion by expressing a joyous reunion rather the truth of Douglas' shameful behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Importance Of Being True To Thine Own Self</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two very fine films about Oscar Wilde came out roughly at the same time during the sixties and they starred Peter Finch and Robert Morley respectively as the great literary icon. But those were in the days before Stonewall and you couldn't be all that explicit. I'm not just talking about sex scenes though there are some here. As far as films were concerned homosexuality was the love that really dare not even breathe let alone speak its name.One reason I liked this film Wilde that starred Stephen Fry in the title role is that the others began with Wilde's involvement with Lord Alfred Douglas, played here by a sexy Jude Law. Here we get a bit of background and we discover that Wilde was a latent case for years because society dictated gay was an abomination. He married and fathered two sons whom he no doubt loved. Just some of the beautiful children's stories he did write attest to that.But as the film opens with Wilde in America and touring a mining camp and giving a lecture to miners below the earth's surface, you can see the look of love in his eyes as he beholds some of those hunky miners with their shirts off. Since you know who Wilde was and his story already, you're looking yourself for signs.Wilde was a latent case until he was seduced by Robbie Ross an actor in one of his plays portrayed by Michael Sheen. I can certainly attest to the fact that if gay is your orientation and you've been with women before, when you do it the first time, you KNOW it's right for you. Later on Ioan Gruffud who apparently is his inspiration for Dorian Gray actually falls in love with Wilde.But Wilde's like a kid in a candy store and when he meets the incredibly handsome Lord Alfred Douglas. Unlike the other two Wilde pictures I mentioned this version fleshes a bit more out of 'Bosy's' character and Jude Law may be pretty to look at, but he's a vain, shallow, selfish, and spoiled young aristocrat. Among other things Law introduces Fry to is the availability of rent boys on the street and at certain posh establishments frequented by closeted Victorians.But it all comes to an end when Bosy's dad played by Tom Wilkinson leaves a calling card accusing Wilde of being a sodomite. In the other two Wilde films, it's Oscar who just arrogantly think he can squash this thing in court with his fabled wit. Here it's Bosy who pushes Wilde into it.The other films concentrated on the trials, civil and criminal. In Wilde the emphasis is on Oscar's character and relationships. The women in Wilde's life are wife Jennifer Ehle and mother Vanessa Redgrave. In watching the two women how they interact it's like watching the families of Ennis and Jack from Brokeback Mountain and how they react to their husband's strange behavior.Also in the film very briefly is Orlando Bloom playing a rent boy. I'm surprised that the film received no Oscar nominations, no pun intended. Though it was honored in the United Kingdom.Some 40 years after Stonewall, the tragedy of Oscar Wilde not being true to his nature as he says he wished he had done from the beginning is still being played out in many areas, in many walks of life. Just look at the number of outings there have been of various political figures on the right and you know it is so.Wilde is a great film which speaks to this generation of GLBT people with current players to tell sadly an often repeated story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The mid-life years of (now genteel) decadent behavior by one of late Victorian England's celebrities, the Irish-born novelist-poet-playwright Oscar Wills Wilde (1854?1900). Director Brian Gilbert doesn't bandy about giving us the childhood torments of a literary genius; instead, he and screenwriter Julian Mitchell delve right into the more prominent chapters of Wilde's life, his marriage to a woman--producing two children--before realizing his homosexual desires, leading to some promiscuous indiscretions before finding love with churlish, childish poet Lord Alfred Douglas. Stephen Fry gives a masterful performance as Wilde, and the portrait allows for many shadings (this isn't a plea for the misunderstood gay artist, as Wilde himself is shown to be occasionally fickle, lusting, and selfish). Jude Law is equally good as ornery, demanding lover 'Bosie', whose tyrannical father brought about a court-case and two-year jail term for Wilde (covered previously in 1960's "The Man with the Green Carnation"), contributing to his early demise. A provoking, insightful, eloquent film--not at all stuffy or coy--which is due in large part to Gilbert's dexterous way with his actors and a keen sense of pacing and audience-involvement. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting film in that it illustrates the point in modern history where sexual orientation becomes labeled and the rise of Aestheticism; however, it does not illuminate those evens as much as it chronicles the life of Oscar Wilde. Stephen Fry does a marvelous job at portraying the title role. Fans of Jude Law will enjoy his rendering of Lord Alfred Douglas, a self centered, self important, manipulative, superficial son of the ninth Marquess of Queensberry (played by Tom Wilkinson). And Vanessa Redgrave is wonderful as Oscar's devoted mother. The film opens with Wilde visiting the American west, then follows his marriage to Constance, his exposure to gay sex, his success as a play write, his children, relationship with Lord Douglas, arrest, imprisonment, and exile. A life destroyed because of consensual relations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A amazing story of a twenty-first century man born in the nineteenth century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I watched this movie well after it's release. Like every movie version, I'm sure there's a bit of poetic license, but even knowing that, I still recommend it as an excellent exploration of a man born far too soon.Oscar Wilde was a fascinating person, really. Definitely born in the wrong time. His dry wit is exactly the sort that I enjoy best. And the fact that he enjoyed snubbing his nose in others' faces in a period of time when that sort of thing was not simply looked down upon, but actually quite dangerous to do, was probably what brought about his downfall. Had it not been Bosie, it would have been some other young man who would have eventually led him to the same or a similar fate, I think. It was only a matter of time.The actors were well-chosen, I thought. Vanessa was wonderful as his mother. Perfectly adoring of her son, and a bit odd herself, she shows a bit of where Oscar's wild (no pun intended) tendencies came from. Jennifer Erhle was perfect as his wife, at first innocent, then sad, then resigned to her husband's fate. She played each bit of Constance Wilde's life beautifully. And Stephen Fry played the perfect Oscar Wilde. Never over the top at all, but always out there, and always utterly believable as a man who was willing to be other than what everyone expected of him.As for his lovers, Michael Sheen (Lucian in Underworld) played the first young man to seduce Oscar, and his lifelong friend, Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur, Fantastic Four) played another lover, and Jude Law played the love of Oscar's life, Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas. All three men were fantastic (though Ioan didn't get enough screen time...).The movie is quite well-done, if you are interested in the story of Oscar Wilde. I highly recommend it to those who are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange movie because every word, sentence or definition about Oscar Wilde is ambiguous. In same time, a brave attempt to define a genius "sine ira et studio". Fruit of noble intention, the film presents a wonderful Bosie Douglas interpreted by Jude Law splendid and subtle. Stephen Fry offers to his Wild power, gentle innocence and soft attitude, the role of victim like result of sympathy and love.Is it important the truth of this portrait? The real gestures and attitude of great Irish? Is it the gay statute his emblematic mark? I don't know but I saw this movie like a poised exercise to discover a man for who the life was the beauty's exploration.Oscar Wilde was not a freak or a important writer. He is not an ordinary rich dandy or a homosexual icon. He is messenger of some values, very attractive, very deep in brilliant essence.In fact, the prestige of a work who moves the time consist not in obscure sin, but in generosity of message ( the first moments of film- his visit in America- are a great pledge).</fullReview>

He should have been an Oscar contender.The movie does a great job of showing what can happen when a person hides his true self. It also shows that a person cannot control who he falls in love with. Victorian England is often a paradox because in some ways it was so obsessed with the sexual, but at the same time, the official doctrine of the day was to stifle sexual expression. How interesting that so little has changed in 150 years!

And I was saddened to see the parallel betrayal of his wife. It seemed it might have been a wonderful marriage.

Stephen Fry plays Wilde as a flawed but basically good human being, not just a "legendary author," and does a brilliant job. He is well supported by the rest of the cast. In particular I'd commend Tom Wilkinson as Bosie's horrible father, Jennifer Ehle as Wilde's patient but strong-minded wife and Michael Sheen, who is wonderfully playful and sensitive as Robbie Ross. The direction is solid and unobtrusive but not remarkable, and the costumes and sets are gorgeous. The one problem I have is with the film's end, which I feel is too positive considering what actually happened to Wilde after he was released from prison.</fullReview>

The sex scenes are graphic, but when comparing them to other heterosexual sex scenes, show no more nudity nor sexual content. While it is shocking, perhaps that is the director's point. Stephen Fry, the great English actor and author does a superb job of potraying one of England's finest writers. his sad final days are now often forgotten and it is only fitting that this movie helps us to recall and remember the severity of certain political views, and the detriment to a country.</fullReview>

There is no question, why Law is considered a rising star - he can act! Another great performance was given by Tom Wilkinson (the tyrannical homophobic, Marquess of Queensberry), Bosie's father. Sadly, this film was based on real life events, which made the ending quite heartbreaking for Wilde and companions. By all accounts, Wilde was a brilliant man but he did have one major flaw (not his sexuality, but his idealism about love). Wilde's courageous stand against British law was a stand to protect Bosie from his dysfunctional father and not Wilde's own convictions to publicize his sexual proclivities. Had it not been for Bosie, would Oscar Wilde have ever had the courage to come out of the shadows?</fullReview>

I originally rented this movie to see Orlando Bloom. However after his sorrowfully short role as a "gentlemen's valet" I was immersed into a really intriguing film about the so called "pure" society and how Oscar was less than conventional. I saw a parallel of the small town I currently I reside in and the equally small minds and the film was a real eye opener, along with great acting by Stephen Fry and Jude Law (who made quite the amazing spoiled brat). I also was pleased to see Jenifer Ehle again because I rather enjoyed her role in "Pride and Predjudice" and it was good to see her as other that Eliza Bennet. The faery tale narrative was also a great addition to the film. I would give the film an 8.5 out of 10 because I think that the role of Sphinx should have been more so developed.

		<fullReview>Having just watched Wilde on the BBC, after hearing tv reviews about itin 1997, I would say that the movie will most likely stand as a masterpiece. Stephen Fry, however, often seems overwhelmed by the role. Also, his voice and accent are much less clipped and nasal than the recordings that are left of the man himself. What is also puzzling is Wilde's (who's supposedly brilliant) readiness to throw away his life on a court case he couldn't possibly win. Or for that matter, his wife's loyalty to him. The strange thing is, that I actually started to like the Marquis of Queensbury, for his own strident, "take no BS" attitude. If anything, Wilde should have slapped "Bosie" and simply not gone ahead with it. At least, that's what would be apparent from the movie. It is also clear that Bosie saw Wilde as a surrogate father, who he both wanted to love and hated/wanted to destroy like his real father. And Oscar should have been a lot wiser than he was, instead of letting himself be destroyed by him. In this movie, "Bosie" Douglas is very much played as an oedipal figure, out to destroy Wilde in a way he couldn't destroy the Marquis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wilde" is an episodic, Masterpiece Theatre-style look at the famous playwright Oscar Wilde and his notorious trial and imprisonment upon sodomy charges at the turn of the last century. While not a penetrating or in-depth look into Wilde's character, it does keep your interest with a fast moving look at a fascinating life.Unfortunately, the film begins with an already famous Wilde, and gives us no real insight into his beginnings or character. Stephen Fry is an inspired physical choice as Wilde, but is content to show us only a genteel, endlessly patient and saintly man, whom young men are constantly throwing themselves at. One longs to see a more multi-faceted depiction. (Also, there's a distractingly awful makeup job in the prison scene with his wife toward the end, looks like he's coated with gray paint!)The gay sex scenes which some other commenters have alluded negatively to are actually pretty mild, I thought - some kissing and hugging, some rather discreet huffing and puffing under the sheets, and a few bare buttocks. Nothing anyone would get worked up over if it were a man and a woman doing it onscreen, so why the double standard?A special word of praise to Zoe Wanamaker, who plays Wilde's society friend "Sphinx", and who is acerbic and wonderful in her few scenes - one wanted to see much more of her!</fullReview>

The way he can mix wry humour with tragedy is flawless. Also Jude Law (Gattaca) as Lord Alfred Douglas, gave a very good portrayal as the spoilt, petulant and trouble stirring Bosie. Also with a good performance, Tom Wilkinson (The Governess) gave a good, but underused effort as the Marquis of Queensbury. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An undisputable masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of my favorite movies. WILDE beautifully conveys the life of a most extraordinary man. The heart wrenching injustices of a repressive Victorian society and the toll it takes on a true romantic, as the ritual hypocrisy he so masterfully parodied turns its full force against him. Previous knowledge of Oscar Wilde's life might remove the suspense, but not the impact of the film. Stephen Fry provides a delightful portrayal of Oscar Wilde. Jude Law expertly plays Bosie. I found myself detesting one of my favorite actors. Performed and written wonderfully. The picture is an incontestable 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar Wilde lived those words ? often to his detriment. Against the advice of friends he chose to live his life as he saw it unfolding when it would have been so much simpler to run away.A brilliant screenplay that interwove one of Wilde's children's stories throughout the narrative and liberal use of Wilde's poetry and quotations from his life are a major part of what makes this film so good.The superb casting of Stephen Fry ? who bears a striking resemblance to the real Oscar Wilde ? was a stroke of genius.All of the supporting characters are equal to the strong performance by Mr. Fry: Jude Law as Lord Alfred Douglas, Vanessa Redgrave as Speranza; Wilde's mother, Jennifer Ehle as his long-suffering but always supportive wife, Michael Sheen as the ever-faithful Robbie Ross and especially Zoe Wanamaker as Ada all deserve a standing ovation for their incredible acting skills and the characters they brought to life.Never have I seen a bio-pic that captures the pathos, and also the wit charm and elegance of a person and a period as well as `Wilde.'It was brilliantly directed by Brian Gilbert and from the opening scenes in the unlikely location of a silver mine in Leadville, Colorado to the closing scene when Oscar and Bosie are reunited after Wilde's incarceration in Reading Gaol for `unnatural acts' there is not a false or unbelievable moment.This is a true work of collective genius ? but the real laurel wreath of excellence lies with Stephen Fry. In spite of its painful and difficult subject this is a film that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adored the film, but then Oscar Wilde is one of my favorite authors. Stephen Fry is fantastic in this. I didn't expect him to come off so well in a dramatic role, since he is more known for his fine comedy. The dialogue is well written, and the overall feel of the film is one that both instills respect and leads one to question morality and love. Just a hint though, don't watch this with your parents unless you have VERY open minded parents! I've been grounded from the video store now! Still and all, Wilde is a film worth seeing, and any lover of his works will find it an accurate and entertaining portrayal of the artist as a man and not just a name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wilde" is an excellent film with marvelous actors and superb cinematography. I think all of the acting was superior with special merit to Stephen Fry and Jude Law. Of course, I am just a little biased since I am a member of the Wilde family (Oscar and I are cousins). Although his grandson, Merlin Holland, did not like the screenplay's emphasis on Oscar's homosexuality and wanted the movie to portray more of Wilde's genius as a poet/playwright, I feel that the movie is a fair adaptation of Ellmann's book. I don't see any Academy Awards for "Wilde" but do consider it superior to most films that have been produced in recent years. I give it a rating of 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the past few months I have had the pleasure of viewing several top-class films (once I reached my 15th birthday!): Little Voice, Shakespeare In Love, The Blues Brothers are just a few examples, but this has to stand out as being one of the best. The quality of acting was of an outstandingly high standard and I enjoyed the wit of Fry's Oscar immensely. The fact that it is told through the form of one of his stories for children is original and clever while the film looks stunning producing an amazing experience.This film is an outstanding success for British cinema and for Fry himself. The supporting cast is also superb - Redgrave turns in a fantastic performance for example. The second half of the film is mesmerising and any sort of description I could give would not really describe it. Admittedly the music could transcend into mediocrity at points but on the whole it was good as were the sets and costumes. It looked lavish. There was only one other weak point; Fry's occasional lapse into his 'Irish accent' (Oscar being Irish) - the accent wasn't terribly convincing (to say the least) but this doesn't really matter.10/10 and a pat on the back must be awarded to the cast and crew of this film - It is at this point that I've only ever read his children's stories... I think that this film has convinced me to go out and buy a copy of 'The Importance Of Being Earnest'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but avoids ugly truths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this a number of times over the past few months on a satellite TV movie channel.It is charming, but Wilde fans will know how destructive he thought charm was.It purports to be factional, but it avoids many ugly truths about Wilde's life. That's not surprising in a politically correct world where gayness is held to be almost superior to heterosexuality.Today, Wilde would probably be even less tolerated than he was in those Victorian days. In 'intolerant' times, even until quite recently - the Fifties and Sixties - people turned a blind eye to all sorts of things as long as you kept it under wraps. Remember, in this movie, he was not hounded for his activities. The hotel staff knew what was going on, and the male brothels were not raided. He brought the court case, and his 'persecution', upon himself. Today, Wilde might be considered a paedophile. The film shows the rent boys as grown up men in suits and ties, when in reality the boys that he and Lord Alfred Douglas exploited with money were as young as 14.The sordidness of the evidence in court (faecal stains on hotel bedsheets) is absent in this sunnily-photographed movie. As is the fact that Wilde was syphilitic because of his adventures - not very pleasant for his wife.And this was, I'm sure, the true reason for the cessation of their marital sex life.If the film had been historically accurate, Fry would have been shown with black teeth in later life - this was a side effect of the mercury treatment at the time for syphilis.Not very charming.The movie also ignores the main reason for Wilde's obsession with Bosie. Like many middle class people of the time who were successful in the public arena, he craved the approval of the aristocracy. He was a snob in the true sense of the word, and sucking up (pun intended) to the upper classes and the presumption that they are better beings comes out in his work as well as his life.On the plus side, I thought Tom Wilkinson's performance as the Marquis of Queensbury was brilliant and very true to how a tough old Victorian aristocrat would have behaved.A much better portrayal than earlier ones which dismissed him merely as mad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragedy of Oscar Wilde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian Gilbert's version of Oscar Wilde's story falls a little short of my expectations. It is a basically a remake of Ken Hughes' 'The Trials of Oscar Wilde' (1960) with fleshed-out secondary characters and gratuitous sex scenes thrown in for effect. Those scenes do nothing to enhance the story but provide "shocking" diversions for people unused to men humping each other. These scenes are a bit phony and ridiculous as shown here, taking screen time away from the trial scenes which resultantly go for little in this film. Ken Hughes' film is much more involving in this regard and still stands as the best portrayal (brilliantly done by Peter Finch) of the sad life of a genius, cut-off in his prime after a killing term in prison. Stephen Fry looks like Oscar Wilde but plays him so flatly that he becomes more of a wind-up mannequin mouthing some of the famous Wilde platitudes and quips. Peter Finch, and Hughes' screenplay, did it much better in 1960.Jennifer Ehle is the most vivid performance, equally as good as Yvonne Mitchell, as Constance (Wilde's wife) for Hughes. Ehle manages to bring Stephen Fry into life in her moving scene in the prison visitation cell. Fry proves in this scene that he CAN act convincingly given impetus from a fine colleague and good writing. Mostly, though, watching Fry I kept thinking of Jeeves in a fright wig.Zoë Wannamaker, playing Ada Leverson, "Sphinx", Wilde's devoted and life-long female friend, is very good too. It was nice having her role, as well as Constance Wilde's, expanded in this version. Hughes made these two ladies fringe characters in his version, out of necessity, in order to include the three riveting trials in his film. Michael Sheen, playing Robbie Ross, Wilde's true friend who really loved him, is the most satisfying of the male leads. Tom Wilkenson's Marquess of Queensbury is a poorly written and directed part. By contrast, Lionel Jeffries' volcanic and rabid Queensbury for Hughes is memorable and terrifying. Bosie is performed by Jude Law as a direct imitation of his counterpart in the Hughes film; petulant, spoiled and shallow. Wilde's attraction to him is a bit of a mystery if indeed Lord Douglas really was this callow. Law's Bosie only devotes himself to Wilde, intermittently and not for long, because Wilde flatters Bosie's vanity. A despicable person, Bosie. Wilde's preference for rent boys and a generic infatuation with "youth" reflects the often ice-thin "wisdom" of many of his more famous quotes; clever but not profound. Oddly the sets in 'Wilde' are as sanitized as they were in the Hughes version; the music equally as soap-opera-ish and the dialog even more stilted than the 1960 film. This new film comes off as more of a costume drama than the previous. The characters move around like dolls on a child's play-stage, rarely evoking sympathy for any human elements they are attempting to portray. I was disappointed with 'Wilde'. I hadn't realized it was simply a re-make of the Hughes' film, with extra sex and profanity.For a more interesting, and visceral, experience of Wilde's life, on film, I'd stick with 'The Trials of Oscar Wilde' as being the better attempt. Though, like Wilde's life, films about him are tragically hard to make, so it seems. Maybe someday someone will really put some thought into his inner workings and get it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen Fry meets the performance of his life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely in Stephen Fry's prolific career, such a tailor-made role for him, and he is the leading actor in this biopic of Oscar Wilde, the 19th century Irish author, poet and playwright, whom he resembles not just in physical appearance, but personality and gift as well.Directed by Brian Gilbert, the follow-up after TOM &amp; VIV (1994), WILDE is a lush period drama, where Fry's representation of Wilde is purely magnificent, sympathetic and pleasing with a tender soul inside his bulky facade, from his principled marriage with Constance (Ehle), the homosexual foray with Robbie Ross (Sheen), to meet the love of his life Bosie Douglas (Law), a doted aristocrat whose stunning pulchritude and youthfulness toxic-ally enchants Wilde for the rest of his life, till his downfall in imprison after losing the libel case and the subsequent trial of sodomy and gross indecency prosecuted by Marquess of Queensberry (Wilkinson), the abominable father of Bosie. Like the warm voice-over of Wilde's own short story THE SELFISH GIANT whenever the story draws in with Oscar's interactions with his two young sons, Wilde is the giant, who is destined to suffer from the wounds of love, again, Fry's performance is unarguably the film's strongest suit, notably his speech about "the unspeakable love" during the court scenes.Oscar Wilde's astonishing talent and homosexuality are two sides of his personae, as one might expect, the film follows suit in exploring the more sensational latter, while the former can only be glanced through his witty loquaciousness and the aforementioned court speech, truly, the gay melodrama is what audience ask for, only if we could also given some leeway to enter his kingdom as a writer. Then the drama, Bosie is viewed as a capricious, needy, ungrateful and selfish good-for-nothing, who is the undoing of Oscar Wilde's tragedy, ended with an early death in destitute. There is unequalled devotion between them, which Wilde is not too blind to notice, but his naivety, a common characteristic among great artists, convinces him that Bosie is a spoilt boy who needs love wantonly and inordinately, and he is willing to do whatever he asks, and eventually comes down from his high horse and becomes a convenient lever utilised in the detrimental father-son retaliation between Bosie and his father. Fry gives a sympathetic performance, but for Wilde, we can only assume that he has only himself to blame, meanwhile, the film makes Robbie, his sole loyal friend in his last days, watch the doom befalls on the one he loves, they would make a much better match, only if Wilde could be more sensible in his mind (takes the gargoyle- looking over the pretty boy), that's the typical gambit for a melodrama, as if that happens so common in real life.Jennifer Ehle, who REALLY should play Meryl Streep in a biopic, is the benevolent but tormented wife who marries a closeted gay man, but instead of hatred and complaint, her support of Wilde, defiance against the convention, even in his lowest moment is a shining beacon in this biopic, Ehle elicits amazing nuance in it. This is the very first role introduces Jude Law into the international cinema, where his Adonis attractiveness would peak two years later in Anthony Minghella's THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (1999, 8/10), in WILDE, he is less refined but incredibly right up Bosie's rally, an amoral, wayward snob, a self-seeker banks on his vainglory, so is Wilkinson as his father, a showstopper with his boorish umbrage, like father, like son, indeed, one might protest the upper society doesn't get a fair treatment in the movie, but de facto, they are the last bunch on earth who needs a sentimentally sympathetic response from the mass, so, whatever, R.I.P. Mr. Wilde.</fullReview>

It is a quite good film, I'd say, about Wilde's highs and depths. I do have to say that I am not fully pleased with their portrayal of Wilde. I think they have wanted too much to make him sympathetic and make him a victim of his age. I am one of the people who doesn't really see him as a victim though, so it can be me. Besides that I have to say that I think this portrayal of Wilde makes him less interesting by making him less eccentric and too innocent. I did like Jude Law's portrayal of Bosie and Sheen's of Robbie Ross, though I don't know how accurate those are,but as it is a film, that doesn't matter. I do have to say that I'm better at picking the points I thought could be better from something,so I probably don't think as badly about this films as it might look to you. I think I'd mostly recommend it to people who are low key interested in the life of Oscar Wilde. It definitely lets you know more about him and the film is quite good, but if you ain't really interested, it probably won't be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine, artistic biopic of famed writer, despite slow first half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Wilde' is the 1997 film biographical film of the legendary playwright, author and poet, whose career was cut short after being prosecuted for being a homosexual in 19th century England. It stars the enormously versatile Stephen Fry, who bears a striking resemblance to the actual Oscar Wilde found in old photographs taken of him. Jude Law, who plays Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas (aka 'Bosie'), also resembles the real 'Bosie' of history. The 1997 version towers over the 1960 film starring Robert Morley, who was completely miscast as the sensitive Wilde.One of the main objections to this new 'artistic version', is that not enough attention was paid to Wilde's professional career as a writer. May I respectfully disagree with these opinions? If one wants to find out about Wilde's career as a writer, why not go and read 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' or watch 'The Importance of Being Earnest'? There is nothing inherently dramatic about his rise to the top in the literary circles he moved in. What is FAR MORE dramatic, is the whole history of Wilde's fall from grace, following his malicious prosecution by an intolerant Victorian society.Another objection from critics on the internet, is that there's too much emphasis here on Wilde's moments of intimacy, particularly with Bosie. Ignoring those prurient souls who find any images or suggestions of gay sex to be abhorrent, a case can be made that those scenes emphasizing Wilde's sexual proclivities, do slow the film down in the first half. On the other hand, by refusing to ignore them, screenwriter Julian Mitchell, has faithfully rendered Wilde's desires as well as his compulsions.The first half of 'Wilde' indeed is quite slow, as most of the real 'drama', doesn't kick in, until the second half. In the first half, we're introduced to Wilde's caring wife and two children, along with Bosie and how Wilde gradually becomes enamored with him. The danger Mitchell almost falls into, is making Wilde into too much of a nice guy. As it turns out, Mitchell makes it clear that Wilde did have his Achilles heel. And that of course was Bosie. Why did the brilliant and sensitive Wilde, fall for a lout like Bosie? Clearly, the younger man is continually unfaithful and goes as far as attending orgies, where he has sex with other men, and Wilde has no guilt feelings about playing the part of voyeur. There was obviously something that Wilde saw in Bosie and chose to concentrate on the good points and not the bad. On the other hand, Wilde did indeed recognize that Bosie was quite troubled, but due to his good nature, forgave him, arguing that his unfaithful lover couldn't help himself, due to being victimized by an abusive father.Wilde is much more than a story about a great writer. The prosecution of Oscar Wilde is a seminal moment in the history of society's attitude toward homosexuality. In the modern era, the trial of Oscar Wilde marked the beginning and the Stonewall Riots, perhaps marked the end of society's non-acceptance of homosexuality. The most absorbing part of 'Wilde' is the conflict that develops between Bosie's father, the Marquess of Queensbury, who accuses Wilde of corrupting his son. As it turns out, Wilde falls into the trap that Bosie's father has set for him: he sues him for criminal libel, ignoring friends' advice that the father's accusations that he actually engaged in sex with men, were true. Wilde's poetic defense of himself during the trial, sadly holds no weight, as the Victorian judge and jury, make it clear that they no have tolerance for Wilde's behavior, regardless of his motives.'Wilde' is a very well made, artistic film, that does an excellent job of recounting Oscar Wilde's personal history and sad, public fate. If you're willing to tolerate a slow-moving first half, you will be rewarded at film's end, which emphasizes the tragedy of a brilliantly talented man, whose career was cut short, due to a society which wasn't ready to accept him, merely on the basis of his sexual predilections, alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like tea with a favorite uncle?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We yield to no one in our appreciation of Stephen Fry (except maybe for that woman who sings the song on YouTube about having his baby), but this tastefully appointed biopic was a bit of a letdown. Fry as Wilde sails serenely through the opening scenes, wowing a crowd of shirtless miners in Colorado, wedding a beautiful young admirer, then, suddenly squeamish after the birth of their second child, allowing himself to be seduced by another young, male admirer (Michael Sheen, the guy who always plays Tony Blair), trading up to Ioan Gruffud, then to JLaw himself, as Bosie. Fry and Law may have seemed like strong, perhaps inevitable, casting choices, but neither one brings much intensity to his role, and their relationship seems oddly uninvolving?more like tea with a favorite uncle than "feasting with panthers," in Wilde's famous phrase. A few sparks fly when Tom Wilkinson looms up, in a fine nutball turn, as Bosie's father, the Marquess of Queensbury, but the pace slackens again in the crucial courtroom scenes, and we had to resort to Wikipedia to find out why the MoQ thought that Bosie's brother Frank was getting "buggered by that Jew Rosebery" and what Frank's (alleged) suicide had to do with Wilde's disastrous decision to prosecute the marquess for libel. Jennifer Ehle, as the almost-all-forgiving Constance Wilde, Vanessa Redgrave and Zoë Wanamaker don't have much to do besides show up for their costume fittings; Orlando Bloom, who gets one brief scene as a cheeky hustler, looks great in a bowler hat, though I pity the LotR fans who got the DVD from Netflix because they saw his name in the cast list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very tender port railer by Stephen Fry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very tender portrayal of Oscar Wilde (16 October 1854 ? 30 November 1900) by Stephen Fry; Stephen literally seems to be Oscars reincarnation and Jude Law as Bosie is just perfect casting.Great chemistry between the two. Concentrating rather on the 'drama',and mainly on the incriminating homosexuality in the playwrights life, of which one ought to be familiarised a little before watching. Some mild but explicit fornication scenes weren't necessary and could have been omitted in my opinion (as well as a couple of scenes with the hysterical father of Bosie) and replaced these with more instructive clips in reference to Oscars plays and poetry. We were being taking through 'The Selfish Giant', as well as some of his most famous epigrams (slipped into conversations), however I was missing a few more literary references. But all in all, a fine film, brilliant acting and biographically and historically accurate, although somewhat shortened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances all round, especially from Fry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then in cinema, a performance comes along that seems so right and so fitting, that it is almost as if the actor was born to play the role. Robert DeNiro as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976), Max Schreck in Nosferatu (1922) or Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend (1945) are examples of career-defining performances, where you couldn't imagine any other actor filling the role. Okay, so Stephen Fry's performance here as the tragic poet, author and social rebel Oscar Wilde is hardly the greatest performance ever, but it seems that no other actor could capture the authenticity of his performance. Fry is a well-known author, intellectual and mostly comedic actor, with a deep-rooted love for literature and history. He is also homosexual with a history of depression and feelings of social misplacement, much like Wilde himself.Brian Gilbert's film follows Wilde from his early marriage to Constance Wilde (Jennifer Ehle), which produced two children, until his sexual awakening with lifelong friend Robbie Ross (Michael Sheen). He describes his awakening as "being like a city under siege for years, and then the floodgates are opened". He has massive success with his only novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, and his social comedy The Importance of Being Earnest, when he meets his true love Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas (Jude Law), a spoiled youth living under the tyrannical reign of his father, the Marquess of Queensbury (Tom Wilkinson). The Marquess' disapproval of the 'friendship' between his son and the well-known provocateur leads to a libel court case, which sees Wilde imprisoned for social indecency.Unlike many biopics, Gilbert wisely chooses to stay away from detailing his work, and instead keeps the focus on the man himself. This allows the film to explore the mind of the subject, and a complex and vastly intelligent mind it is. The main focus though is of the social attitudes towards homosexuality (especially the relationship between an older and a younger man) and the prudishness towards the idea of following pleasure rather than duty. Wilde states in the court case that he is championing the ancients, the Greeks, and this now-taboo relationship was the focus of many a celebrated academic, namely Plato, who used it as a focal point of one of his key philosophy works. Society, it would seem, had gone back in time.There are many great performances here from a hugely talented British cast (which also includes Vanessa Redgrave, Ioan Gruffudd and Zoe Wanamaker), namely from the always-excellent Sheen. He is now established as a great impressionist (his performances as Kenneth Williams and David Frost are near-perfection), but here he is stripped- down and gives his best performance as the dedicated Robbie Ross, a man who is in love with Wilde but remains loyal despite the love not being returned. But ultimately, this is Fry's film. Years of seeing him as quizmaster in panel show QI has made me forget what a talented performer he is. If ever there was an argument made of re-incarnation, then there is no finer example than here. Apart from an uncanny resemblance, he seems to embody the very soul of Wilde.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilde at heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finished the Ellmann biography some days ago, and I acknowledge I am still in a state of shock - the rise and fall of the Roman Empire would not have that much of an interest for me, probably, for, having the life of a man thriving in paradoxes that still invites the most scrutinizing of speculations, I feel that having escaped the most classical, straightforward wondering of what he was REALLY after, we still but skim the surface. How much paradox does one man need? Perhaps his Irishry, or just plainly his conviction that the social being of our lives is as much one can hope and cope for, in order to outplay the paradoxes that constitute us, or is simply undifferentiated from what we "inwardly" are, is a grim intuition undifferentiated from its enactment.That said, it was the biography that compelled me to see again the film. It was in an art-nouveau cinema in Paris that I first saw it, the time of its release, and that was good, it was nice the way the vitreaux rhymed with Beardsley's engravings in the beginning! -and with one's youth. I was cherishing the display of paradoxes from one of my idols. Yet, being young, the whole effect of the film was somewhat depressing, for reasons I was too young to fathom.Revisiting the film now, I almost considered it a light-hearted experience, after the detailed ordeal of the book. Fry stroke a resemblance welcome and somewhat haunting, yet I found him a bit lacking polemical drive: his voice was a bit too passive here and there in order to fully convey the eccentricity of his genius.Maybe it is that the film was too focused on the Bosie part of the story, leaving out of the story, as one finds out, that the outcome was more complex that the film lets it be. For example, his marvelous quip "My dear Sphinx, how wonderful of you to know what hat to wear in the morning you're meeting a friend that has been away," after his being just released from prison, was not spelled outside the prison, but when he had gone to her family house. This I find crucial, for he was waiting for some time to be received, and then when they finally lodged him - he was homeless - he stayed in the room of her son, with toys scattered around. "Would you like the toys to be removed?" she had asked him, and for the first time perhaps his response was - literally - without wit, he answered just "No, leave it as it is." I found that detail staggering: imagine the Giant (and I consider this a detail the film should have exploited since it relies so much on parallels drawn from his bedtime stories, to call them that) lying destitute in a child's room.There are many such details transposed to a more dramatic handling for the sake of being narrated in the space of less than two hours in a film, as a great part of what actually passes between letters could not but turn into dialogue, even if the part after his release, which was really sordid, till his complete downfall, is omitted, for love's slow-motion, fading images. Here one should turn and thank the actors for they have imagined their characters justly, even if in accordance to an adaptation (that some times has a television quality). This is going to be for some time the definite film for his life, perhaps graciously leaving out the more complex, human stuff, demonstrated in an exhausting inclusion out of the picture as his last days in Paris witness, even if this is what makes his life exemplary in more than one way ("I am fighting a duel to death with my wallpaper, and one of us has to go" was one of his last witticisms). I wouldn't want a film to dwell too much on what binds together an intuition from its enactment, would you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an incredible Oscar Wilde fan I have to give credit where it's due. And in my opinion this movie definitely deserves a lot of it ! My expectations of this movie were rather high before watching it and it has not disappointed me in the slightest. The acting was absolutely wonderful, the directing superb and the setting just beautiful. The cast were amazingly well chosen and suited to their characters. From the very beginning I was enthralled by the performance of the cast. Most notably the magnificent Mr. Fry !The movie gave a remarkable insight into the impassioned and tumultuous life of Oscar Wilde. Him as a budding writer, him getting married to Constance, his realisation of his homosexuality and eventually his demise as the most famous and renowned writer of late Victorian society. It shows everything and covers the most important details of his life as a famed writer without becoming boring or slow. It is an extremely flowing, fast and easy movie to watch ! The majority of the movie centres around his furious relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas. The movie gives you the impression that from the very moment Oscar met "Bosie " he fell for him straight away, which by all accounts is very true. Even though he loved his wife dearly he could not deny his over powering and all consuming love for "Bosie". And yes. I believe it was love. Oscar was sincerely devoted to "Bosie " and that comes across in the movie. He fell for him like no other ! But in the strict, conventional and Victorian London their relationship and fumble's with other men were to be ostracised and deemed disgraceful. This movie shows the sheer outrage Oscar's affair with Lord Douglas and his dealings with other "men ". Who were known to be lower class rent boy's. It shows an outstandingly talented yet somewhat self destructive genius persecuted for his lifestyle. When Oscar Wilde (Stephen Fry)is facing small number of years in prison his great friend Robbie Ross gives him the chance up to go abroad and escape the harsh sentencing and public abuse. But no, Oscar refused to go and decided to stay and face the music, so to speak. Not only does this reflect a man of astonishing courage it reflects a man of truth, honesty and nobleness. Another thing I adored about this movie was the significance the makers of the movie put of the conventionality, snobbery and close-mindedness of that time. And they way Oscar Wilde was destined to not only be an individual who wasn't afraid to push boundaries and be daring. But to be a man of exceptional excellence ! Stephen Fry captivated the endearingly flamboyant, bold and imaginative Oscar. Michael Sheen seems to have Robbie Ross down to a "T" as the more kind, caring and likable of Oscar's lovers and as the movie progresses- friends. They become great friends and it is clearly obvious that Robbie Ross had Oscar's best interests at heart. Of course, he does not approve of the treacherous "Bosie" ! And neither did any of Oscar Wilde's acquaintances, family and friends. Stephen Fry couldn't have possibly been more convincing as Oscar Wilde. He embodied the very essence of the genius that was Mr Wilde himself. Seeing Stepen Fry play the lovable, vulnerable and affectionate Oscar was spectacular. The best thing I've seen Stepen Fry in yet ! Jude Law was also the perfect choice for the part of the spoilt, devious and manipulative Lord Alfred Douglas. Aka "Bosie". Who in certain parts of the film who can't help but feel an ounce of sympathy for. I know, I must be a very empathetic person ! But the fact is that he comes from a rather unstable family with a brutal father who over the years has viciously tormented and verbally abused his son. Oscar Wilde wants to love "Bossie " and show him that the beauty of love. Only Mr Douglass is not the most loving individual. The fact that he encouraged Oscar to be indulge in a depraved love life shows that he was a man out for himself. I'm not saying he didn't love Oscar, I'm sure he did but in a very selfish, inconsiderate and mercenary way. As for Oscar he appears to be the complete opposite. He is enchanted and enticed by the youth of Lord Alfred Douglas. It was a pleasant surprise to see how brilliantly Stephen Fry and Jude Law complimented each other's performances. The is a sparkling energy between them both that is delightful to watch and observe. Stephen Fry rained supreme as the loving, gentle and tender Oscar and Jude Law was marvellous as the not so loving or forgiving Lord Alfred Douglas. Micheal Sheen was perfectly suited playing Oscar's great friend Robbie Ross. Tom Wilkinson was fabulous as the spiteful Marquess Of Queensbury. Jennifer Ehle was marvellous at playing Constance Loyld. She captured her introverted, shy and quiet personality wonderfully well. Vanessa Redgrave did the most stunning Irish accent. Her acting was also pretty sharp too as the proud Mother of Oscar. Last but not least- Zoe Wannamaker was grand at playing the honest and interesting Ava Lerverson. I found this movie to be an absolute must see for any literature fan. It's dialogue is terrific and the acting tremendous. Director Brian Gilbert and screen writers did a magnificent job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this film, as I am very fond of Oscar Wilde's work. The Importance of Being Earnest is absolutely delightful, and The Selfish Giant I fell in love with on first hearing at primary school and still have affection for it. So what did I think of Wilde? Seriously, I think this film is wonderful. It is the sort of film that is very thought-provoking, intelligent and desperately sad. The exploration of male love is quite graphic and it mayn't be to everyone's tastes, but I thought it was done with real sensitively and care.Wilde certainly looks beautiful- the scenery is striking, the cinematography is breathtaking and the costumes are wondrous. Another asset I loved was the music score, it was absolutely gorgeous, almost reminiscent of a John Barry score. I also feel it is underrated too, very touching and really gives the film the emotional punch it has. Wilde is also beautifully written, the references to The Selfish Giant are very moving, and Wilde's witticisms are superbly expressed. The direction is very good, the pacing was fine and there is a great story as well.The acting is superb, one or two of the actors are underused in my opinion but there is no bad performance as far as I could see. Stephen Fry(who I consider a sheer delight in Black Adder) is mesmerising in the title role, elegant, witty, sympathetic and charming, while Jude Law is every bit as good as a character that is volatile, passionate and irritated. Vanessa Redgrave, Judy Parfitt, Michael Sheen and Zoe Wannamaker are all note-perfect, and I liked Jennifer Ehle as well, she was heartbreakingly sympathetic but she was underused I felt. The best supporting performance though came from Tom Wilkinson, who was absolutely brilliant as the nasty, brutal and bitter Marquess of Queensberry.Overall, this is a very moving and intelligent biopic that is beautifully written and faultlessly performed. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The love that dare not speak its name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) Even though the Irish born Oscar Wilde, Stephen Fry, was one of the most celebrated men of letters, in his poetry short stories as well as a playwright, during the British Victorian Age it was the extremely prudish and restrictive ideas of that era in European History that in the end destroyed him.In the film "Wilde" we see a vibrant and full of life Oscar Wilde" brought down not really by his own in your face sexual conduct, in his homosexuality, but by those young men that he was sexually involved with. It all started out so innocently in Oscar getting involved with young and gay Alfred "Bosie" Douglas, Jude Law, who was anything but discreet about his relationship with Oscar. It's when Bosie's father the ultra macho and "fists of fury" the Marquess of Queensberry, Tom Wilkinson, found out that his son was both gay-as if he didn't know by then-and having an affair with Oscar that he decided to destroy Oscar's literary career as well has his life. Oscar at first just ignored the vulgar and load mouth Lord Queensberry but when finally forced to fight back by using his both sharp and stinging wit, like a left jab, and overwhelming intelligence, like a combination straight right and left hook,to keep Lord Queensberry and his foul and guttural language directed towards him at bay Oscar thus made him look like the unsavory and low class fool and ignoramus that he really was.It's was when Bosie, who hated his father for driving his younger bother to suicide and his mom into an insane asylum, goaded Oscar to take his father to court for insulting him by calling Oscar a "queer" and "sodomite" in public that sealed his fate as well as end his brilliant career as a giant in the history of English Literature. There were just too many skeletons,live as well as dead, in Oscar's closet to prove Lord Queensberry's accusations about his secret life, Oscar was in fact married with two young boys at the time, to be absolutely true. Put on trial, after Lord Queensbery was found innocent, for acts of gross indecency Oscar's witty and brilliant defense of his actions were not enough to convince a jury get him off. Convicted and sentenced to two years of hard labor at Reading Prison Oscar, who never as much as picked up anything as heavy as a book in his entire life, was subjected to such inhuman treatment by working on a treadmill for six hours at a stretch, together with his incurable syphilis, that he eventually fell completely to pieces.Finally released from prison, after serving his two year sentence, Oscar ended up broke and alone with his faithful wife, who swore she'll never leave him, Constance, Jennifer Ehle, dying at an early age and his two sons, with the court declaring Oscar an unfit parent, taken way from him. Forced to flee England Oscar, now calling himself Sabastian Melmoth, died broke and forgotten to everyone but his closest friends and family members in Paris France on November 30, 1900. Just six weeks after his 46th birthday.Truly a giant of his times, as well as now, Oscar Wilde was a victim of the same kinds of ignorance and indifference that we have even among us now in people not trying or caring to understand those that are somewhat different-racially religiously or sexually-then themselves. We in fact see in the movie that homosexuality in Victorian England was wide spread and in many cases openly exhibited with very little punishment to those involved in it. It was that the flamboyant and outspoken Oscar Wilde stuck out like a sore thumb and took his sexuality as a badge of honor not a curse that made him a target for persons like Lord Queensberry, who he accused Oscar of turning his pansy son Bosie into a sissy, to take pot shots on. In the end it was Oscar's pride self righteous as well as self respect that had him take Lord Queensbery on that unfortunately ended up destroying him!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Wilde aficionado, I have to say that despite the screwing around with the timeline and the origins of a few characters such as Robbie Ross (in the interest, I feel, of cinematic plausibility and tension), the movie really does do an excellent job of presenting Oscar Wilde to the general public. In particular, the film retains much of the spirit of Joseph Ellman's celebrated Wilde biography, showing a usually neglected aspect of Wilde's character--that of the "unselfish giant".As a Stephen Fry whore, I don't really need to tell you how stunning his performance is, showing us Wilde's deceptively sharp wit alongside his surprising innocence and gentle spirit, a delicious contrast to the petulant arrogance Jude Law brings to Bosie. The relationship with Constance and Wilde's children is particularly well done, commentating lightly on the nature of family versus art--and the slow telling of "The Selfish Giant" seems almost like a commentary by the author himself. Perhaps my only criticism would be that the sheer magnitude of time attempted by the film might be overwhelming to anyone not at least vaguely familiar with Oscar's life. Rather as though the director looked at all the salivatingly wonderful times in his life, and decided to do them all, instead of just one or two. Wilde's life as a writer and an aesthete is largely overlooked, perhaps forgivably since the modern audience is always more concerned with romance than achievement. We'll save the movie on Oscar's ulterior decorating for later.All in all, I can honestly say that Wilde is one of my most favorite films, stuffed with visual loveliness (Really? A young, hot Stephen Fry AND a pouting Jude Law? Who could ask for more?) wickedly genteel humor, a subject to end all others, and a sort of quiet dignity and elegance lying underneath it all. To anyone who disagrees, I have only this to say to you-- Well. It's perfectly easy to be cynical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an admirer of Oscar Wilde, I really enjoyed watching such a fantastic, extraordinary and extremely great movie in which Wilde's life, personality, desires, attitudes, and wit are reflected as a unique treasure. Casting is great, director is aware of the seriousness of his work, and illustrations as well as characterization are completely extraordinary. "The world is at my command, yet I cannot command myself, I cannot command my feelings for you" says Wilde, in one of the most romantic scenes of the movie. "Yet each man kills the thing he loves...", the movie ends tragically with the touching lines from Wilde's great poem. I have always been interested in everything about Oscar Wilde- that movie was not being sold in any format in my country- it took me a long time to find it when I was in Bournemouth last year. I have bought many movies up to now, and that is the best one- I can never become bored of watching it!! The tragic and extraordinary life of a great and unique man, Oscar Wilde!!!Strongly recommended for Oscar Wilde admirers, it can be the masterpiece of your collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bosie" would have been a more fitting title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the movie is named after the main character, Jude Law steals the show from Stephen Fry who plays the part with a nauseating understated, deadpan sincerity. I'm usually not a big fan of overacting but this is Oscar Wilde, a man infamous for his flamboyant personality and sparkling bon mots. "Do you want to know the great tragedy of my life?" he once said to Andre Gide. "I have put my genius into my life and only my talent into my works." Given the enormous stature of the latter, one can only imagine the immense flair and charm of the former. Unfortunately, Wilde's "genius" and larger than life personality which made him the toast of salon society where ever he went has gone AWOL in this film and in this void the viewer is left constantly wondering why all these gorgeous young men are love sick over him. However, there is no wondering why Wilde, at the height of his career and fame, would risk it all by falling for Bosie and suing Bosie's father for libel as played by the stunning Jude Law. I'm a big fan of Jude Law and he can play a "homme fatale" like no one else. In a way, Bosie is similar to Dickie Greenleaf but Bosie is more childish and petulant than innately cruel and Jude plays him pitch perfect.The other major fault of this film other than Stephen Fry's lackluster performance, is the trial itself. I simply can not forgive the director for leaving out the best line in the real court transcript. "I think people should be allowed to do what they want, as long as they don't do it in the street and frighten the horses." Surprisingly, it was not uttered by Wilde but by the cleaning lady. Overall the film has a great supporting cast and kept my interest so I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly bad, but not particularly good, either. In many ways a biopic by numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen the 1960 film The Trials Of Oscar Wilde, with that very good actor (and womanising hellraiser Peter Finch as the man himself, and in the light of that film, I should like to edit this review. This is what I originally wrote: Like John Wayne, Stephen Fry is always Stephen Fry in a film: he never manages to get the viewer - well, this viewer, at least - to suspend his disbelief. And that rather kills any film he's in stone dead. The Duke had the same problem for me: it was never anyone else but John Wayne acting in a film, and the sad conclusion could well be that neither gent can really act. As for Wilde, well another reviewer here has described it as a document, not a film, and that about sums it up. It is said to be based on Richard Ellman's biography of Wilde and what we get is just that, a more or less potted two hour lesson in the main events of Wilde's life. And perhaps being somehow contaminated by Fry's lack of acting ability, Michael Sheen, Jude Law, Jennifer Ehle, Maggie Smith, Zoe Wannamaker and the rest also come across as 'being in a costume drama', which more or less kills the film's other virtues in a trice. And that's a shame, because it is a rather handsome looking film into which was put a lot of thought. But given that it is, to put it very harshly, somewhat brain dead, all that effort has rather been wasted. Oh, well. It's not actually bad, but it's not very good, either.That was it, to which I should like to add that for for a far, far, far superior and more intelligent portrayal of Oscar Wilde and his trials, go and see Peter Finch in The Trials Of Oscar Wilde. For one thing you realise quite how gratuitous and irrelevant the gay sex scenes are in Fry's version. The earlier film covers exactly the same ground and conveys exactly what Wilde was up to without any such scenes at all. That is, however, by the by. This version just isn't up to it. Finch's version was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen Fry is towering in the lead role of this Oscar Wilde biopic, and Jude Law offers some interesting support; otherwise it is a rather dull film though, and from what I have read, not all that accurate. The film is on the long side, yet it still feels like a few events (such as the marriage) are being compressed. The length problem comes from the film spending too much time on the sexuality issues in Wilde's life. Other films, such as 'Maurice', have dealt with homosexuality in English literature before, and it seems like the same old ideas and issues are being recycled here. Had the film spent more time on Wilde's work rather than his personal life, I think it would have been slightly better. By no means is it a poorly made film, with such good costumes, excellent makeup design and good casting, but I find it difficult to think of it as very good overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that fails in portraying Oscar and his relationship with Bosie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who is a great admirerer of Oscar Wilde I was thrilled to discover there had been a movie made about him and even more so when I heard who was in it.I had great expectations and was incredibly disapointed and even a bit angry because I know lots of people don't bother checking if a biographical picture is indeed based on true facts;this one isn't.I've read a lot about Oscar and his life and the first fault I found in the movie is that it wasn't really based on him;we don't see his life,we just see a part(not always true to facts)-the movie is based mostly on his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas which is why the title of the film should not have been called "Wilde".I could have viewed it as a movie about a relationship but I refuse to do so simply because of the way it was presented and marketed.Even if viewed as such it fails to rise to the task;if they wanted to show that relationship they should have done it completlly and they didn't do that either.In the movie,it seemed bad but in life it was worse than that-the happy end in the film suggests that all was well and that Oscar died in Bosie's hands but the truth is far from it-Bosie left Oscar banckrupt and he died alonne,later Bosie married claiming he was seduced by Oscar and died a bitter old man.Not quite the fantasy relationship is it?And,while some other things that happen in the movie aren't true the piece that could have been an enormous help in portraying the relationship,or rather the bases for creating a movie based on it;De Profundis wasn't used.That letter is merely mentioned like it meant nothing to Oscar,like it was a matter of small talk while anyone who'd have read it would know differently.Wilde's work is not important in the movie,we only hear a few of his own sentences and that's one of the very important reasons why this film fails in showing us Oscar Wilde himself-the script writers don't strive for showing the viewers his genius-we don't get to see the brilliance of his mind or it's broadness.Yes,I realise it's hard to make a movie about a writer and show his extraordinary talent but it can be donne and here it just wasn't.The only thing that I admired about the movie is the acting;Stephen Fry does an excellent job(considering the matterial he was given-I belive that if that was better he would have also been better)and Jude Law is amasing-I'm not talking about his looks but his portrayal of Bosie which is fantastic.But,even though that is the redeeming feature of the film because of the bad matterial it isn't enough to save the picture.I guess we'll just have to wait until someone makes a movie good enough that it can be presented as "the movie of Oscar Wilde" because such a man deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WILDE OFF THE MARK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can resist anything but temptation!In this case my Sun newspaper like review title.I have read all the customer reviews below and all of Oscar Wilde's complete works.I have seen most of his plays ("The Importance of being Ernest (1895)" many times over) and seen many other portrayals of the great Irishman.Yes Fry does look uncannily like Wilde and as he stated,it was the role he was born to play.What a pity then he was let down by the producer/scriptwriters!How I agree with my esteemed colleagues below who bemoan the trap the producers have fallen into of plugging the homosexual thing (presumably to sensationalise the purient aspects of his life to "put bums on seats" by the non cognoscenti) but not showing on screen Wilde's flowing bon mots/aphorisms/epigrams/literature and sparkling conversation etc.We all have our favourites.Whereas we were treated to Fry vocalising excerpts from his "The Gentle Giant" read to his children, I was left frustrated by the lack of interest shown by the producers in Wilde's literature.Where were the scenes set in his publishers office as they discuss his latest work?.Where were the sophisticated dinner party converstions with other intellectuals?Where were the scenes showing him develop from his youth in Dublin and at Trinity College university there to produce the character he became?.Little was made of the relationship with his mother although this film did show his love for his children.We had to endure an obsession with the "Bosie" a.k.a.Lord Alfred Douglas thing but this was only part of his life!His failed scandal law case brought against The Marquis of Queensbury (father of "Bosie") and subsequent incarceration in Reading gaol,always hogs the attention of film producers for rather obvious reasons.But why no scenes of him thinking out his "De Profundis" while he composed it in his cell?I know some people may think I am being unfashionable since homosexual matters had to be suggested in older versions rather than the modern "in yer face" style of modern adaptions.I had hoped for better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost makes you want to read Wilde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie definitely provokes a desire to know more about Wilde, even if only because you suspect it of simplifying him - he s hardly culpable for his own downfall, pushed into the libel suit by Bosie. In a way, Wilde almost seems superficial in that brilliance flows from him effortlessly - if forced into contemplation (like in prison) he finds only hollowness, if not mediocrity. The movie is fairly frank about Wilde's homosexuality - the decadence of the male brothel-type place is overwhelming, and we see Wilde watching Bosie have sex with another, and being subjected to his screaming fits and recriminations. But this makes his speech about the love that dare not speak its name seem like a bit of an evasion - since we know how much it s about the pleasures of the flesh as much as about scholarly bonding between older and younger men and the other stuff that s cited. The trial itself and the mechanics of the decline seem over a bit quickly and the ending is soft, although it s hard to imagine too many people objecting. Fry is sometimes moving but is rather on one note - the film though conveys a great sense of his charm and genuine celebrity, no more than in the opening sequence where he goes down a mine and spellbinds them with a history of Cellini - throughout Wilde provokes so much enthusiasm that his downfall ultimately seems tragically avoidable.</fullReview>

However, I believe that these small things done with such perfecttion are not what makes this an outstanding movie. It's Mr. Fry's impeccable portrayal of a highly emotional, charitable and intelligent man that makes it so wonderful.This film is amusing, intriguing and intellectually stimulating, but it also provokes a deep and healthy anger towards a hypocritical society that is able to destroy even the greatest talents it produces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Wilde About This Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stayed up till the wee hours to catch this on IFC. What should have been engrossing, I found distant and rather boring. The film seeks to make Wilde a revolutionary, but we're not given a profound insight as to what made him tick. No mention of the woman (yes, woman!) he fell in love with who left him for Bram "Dracula" Stoker! No mention of his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements and the socialist writings that sprang from it. Or his trashing rooms in drunken rampages. While he was, as shown, well-received in the rough-and-tumble Leadville during his tour (the film doesn't mention he was in America to repair his wilde-man rep and counter the popular backlash against aestheticism), it omits that he was ripped by the upper-crust, especially in San Francisco, of all places! Worse, Fry's and Law's performances reek of the gay stereotypes of cattiness, selfishness and narcissism. I got little feel for how big Wilde was (George Bernard Shaw was a fan) and how truly spectacular his fall was. Nor does it show him conflicted in the least. You get the impression he knew he was gay, married because it was expected, and expected the Mrs. to put up with his shenanigans. The film then alters the key episode of his life. Douglas was arrested (not shown) after Bosie egged Oscar to charge the old man with libel (as shown). Since, on the trial's second day, our hero admitted to perjuring himself (also not shown), it's understandable why it was revised to make Wilde the ultimate poster boy for "the love that dare not speak its name." How ironic that Oscar's great love (besides himself) later converted to Catholicism, married, and spent the rest of his life attempting to bring gays to "justice."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film certainly seemed well cast and is quite opulent (the Costume Design was Oscar nominated) but although it treats its subject sympathetically, it is overall rather dull. Fry is a perfect incarnation as Wilde but lacks the flamboyance we associate with him by reputation. Jude Law in his third screen outing is stunningly beautiful as Bosie and plays him like a true sociopath, as so many beautiful young gay men are. He makes us feel he truly loves Wilde although his true nature makes it impossible for them to ever settle down as lovers. The facts are covered but the passion is missing. (For those prurient Law fans there is an incredible shot of his naked rear plowing a young man in bed as Wilde looks on). Mr. Law is certainly not afraid of baring all for art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this movie, 'Wilde,' is really somewhat of a misnomer. A more accurate title would be 'Wilde: A Homosexual.' If you come into this movie as I did expecting to learn something about the writings or the history or the life of Wilde, you'll be disappointed. It is about his homosexual love affairs - that's it. I guess I should have known given that I saw this movie on Bravo's 'Coming out of the Closet Festival,' but still... Wilde is famous because of his writings, not his sexual orientation. His sexuality is an important aspect of his individualistic, non-apologetic personality, but deified and separated from the more important parts, this aspect is relatively unimportant and uninteresting. Not too bad of a movie as long as you keep these points in mind.</fullReview>

As for the rest of the movie, well, don't expect a story about the writer Oscar Wilde, expect a story about the homosexual Oscar Wilde. Filled with many scenes of either Boise humping some other guy or Boise humping Oscar, the whole movie doesn't really have anything to do with his writing until the end. For the most part, it's a "coming out of the closet" movie. And it made me mad...Oscar's out and about doing every guy he meets, calling it "love", when his poor wife and kids are at home!! But, oh well. By the end of the movie, Oscar and Boise's relationship was well built-up and I was glad to see them together. It kind of made me have more appreciation for homosexuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too wilde about this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should have probably known better then to watch this movie. I know altogether too much about Mr. Wilde to enjoy any sort of interpretation on him. Thought the first ten minutes I was al together busily yelling at the screen `that is not what he looked like' or `that is not what she looked like', or `is that really supposed to be?' After I got used to all the unrealistic looking people (what was up with Robbie? I could not bare to look at him) I finally settled down to noticing all the other problems in this movie. First of all, well, no, first of all the actors were chosen poorly, besides Wilde himself. Second then, right, second of all, the movie skipped around in time a lot, though mostly in the beginning. One felt uncomfortable with all this skipping. First Wilde meets his wife, then they are married, then kids, then? Slow down or don't show it at all! Third, this movie concentrated too much on Wilde's sex life. One could almost forget why he was famous in the first place. The relationship with Bosie was shown well, as was the relationship with his mother (though that was brief) and the relationship with his wife. The court proceedings were also nicely done. Mostly the movie had it's problems in the first half where it felt rushed, as though it just couldn't wait to get to the climax (of the story I mean!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilde as a Long-suffering Soap Opera Heroine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "Wilde" (**1/2 out of ****) an engrossing and handsome production (glad I saw it in widescreen). However, the film seems intent on ennobling him in the "saintly martyr" tradition by downplaying his indiscreet flamboyance and blatant stupidity. Here is a man who neglected his devoted wife and children to go running after a spoiled and petulant brat, and who very foolishly thought he could win a flimsy libel suit against the Marquess of Queensbury while arrogantly perjuring himself in court. It's true that the movie points all these facts out along the way, but Wilde seems genuinely shocked when he has to go jail, and I wouldn't be surprised if the film's makers intended for us to think of Jesus being led to the crucifixion as Wilde is being led away to prison. Stephen Fry is certainly eloquent in the title role, but also a little too long-suffering and magnanimous to be believed-rather like a soap opera heroine who maintains her air of injured graciousness despite all the mean things that are done to her. Jude Law does everything the script requires as the destructive "Bosie," but other than good looks it's impossible for us to see the things in him that Wilde must have seen in order for him to be so in love. Why would a great man like Wilde throw away marriage, career and reputation over this monstrous little twit? I think that's the great tragic mystery behind the story of Oscar Wilde, and it remains one here. Tom Wilkinson approaches the role of the Marquess as if he were playing a roadshow Mr. Hyde, except in one of the film's best scenes: Wilde attempting to charm the beast in a restaurant. All-in-all, a well-made movie, but I thought the script prosaic and shallow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great cast, awful script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wilde" is a competent and interesting movie, well worth watching, despite its obvious flaws. If you expect a careful consideration and analysis of Wilde's life and work, you will be disappointed: this film jumps straight to the "juicy bits" regarding Wilde's homosexuality. You can't really blame the makers for this- I don't remember any successful biopics of Wilde's near contemporary, the celibate George Bernard Shaw! The main strength of the film is its excellent cast. The brilliant comic actor Stephen Fry may not have much of a range when it comes to a straight (in one sense) role, but he really inhabits the character and puts in a most affecting performance. Jude Law is just perfect as the physically exquisite but morally repulsive "Bosie". All the minor characters are played by top drawer British talent, and cannot be faulted.Unfortunately, the production values are a good deal less impressive, with the sets, costumes and make-up looking adequate for a television movie, but falling well short of the standards expected of a major cinematic feature.The biggest problem with "Wilde" however, is the script. The pacing seems all wrong: the trial scenes which ought to have been the centrepiece are just thrown away. The device of using "The Selfish Giant" as a unifying conceit just doesn't work, and the fans of the story will be disappointed by the omission of the story's conclusion. Bosie is written as such an unsympathetic character that we can't begin to understand why Wilde loves him so sincerely and deeply, as opposed to simply lusting after his beauty. The character of Queensberry is a crude cartoon. We see him chatting amiably to Wilde and enjoying his company over dinner, and then in the VERY NEXT SCENE, he forbids Bosie to ever see Wilde again, and launches into one of his many homophobic diatribes. Poor Tom Wilkinson also has to battle against the handicap of the least convincing facial hair since Groucho Marx's moustache.Nevertheless, the film is well acted, historically accurate and emotionally engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult subject, homosexuality, but a well-done story of Oscar Wilde.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit that English Literature was about my least favorite subject in high school and college. Although the name "Oscar Wilde" was familiar to me, I could not have told you anything about him. I watched this film, "Wilde", because it received fairly good critical reviews.Oscar Wilde was an enigma. He was married, had a family with children, obviously loved his family, but he also was attracted to young men. He saw nothing wrong with it, and summarily let it virtually destroy him and his family.I am assuming this film was a fairly accurate depiction of Wilde. The homosexual scenes were many, and quite graphic in an "R" rating sense, and at least for this heterosexual viewer, quite difficult to watch. In the same vein that one might watch someone eat raw chicken livers. While we grant that they have a right to do it, trying to imagine ourselves in that situation is replusive and certainly not enjoyable. The film could have gotten across the same message with less graphic sex, much as most depictions of heterosexual sex are usually too graphic and unnecessary in movies.Stephen Rey, who plays Wilde, is just remarkable in his characterization. Or, maybe he was just being himself, I don't know. This might be a film deserving of an 8 or 9 rating, but my personal rating in "7" because it deals with an unpleasant subject - infidelity and loss of family values. Still, for anyone who is a student of literature and Wilde particularly, this has to be a "Must see" film.</fullReview>

The rest of the film looks just like one of those tedious BBC costume dramas. Queensbury`s ridiculous stick on sideburns typify the quality of the wardrobe department.I suspect that the character of Bosie (played extremely well by Jude Law,) was entirely based on the performance by John Frazer in the 1960 Finch filmThis film is the result you can expect when a production is based around a single actor's (Fry,) desire to do the part rather than a competent director's vision.</fullReview>

"Wilde" doesn't respects the life nor the works of Oscar Wilde. "Wilde" doesn't respects the Truth. There are some reasons: (1) Why Wilde's Best Friend (devoted friend), Robert Ross is considered a Wilde's lover? This is absolutely false! As a consequence, more people thinks that all of Wilde's friend were un-normal persons. All friendships could be confused! (2)If there were a good point, it would be the "Selfish Giant" narrated by Fry. But Fry and Co., without an explanation, don't finished the tale!!! (3) The approach to Wilde is an approach to a pathetic writer, without spirit, without self-respect, without personality. And we are talking about the most quoted writer of ever times. Enough? Not really. The consequence of this tribute to Falsity, continuous being the accumulation of a false-seeking of Wilde's Works and Life. Instead of being remembered as a great writer, the most successful script-writer of his time, Wilde, thanks to Fry and Co., will be remembered as a snob, with a ridiculous suitcase that he never wore!!.</fullReview>
