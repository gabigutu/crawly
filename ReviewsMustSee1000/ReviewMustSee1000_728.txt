		<shortDescription>Best of the Bonds?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first three Bonds (Dr. No, FRWL, Goldfinger) are without question the best in the series, though From Russia with Love may well be the best of the best. It has all things we look for in a great Bond film - exotic locales, sinister villains, beautiful women - but it was made before Goldfinger established the ingenious-yet-demented-supervillain-plus-indestructible-henchman formula as canonical, so its plot line may surprise viewers reared on the later Bond films. For one thing, there's little or nothing in the way of gadgetry (though Q does provide our hero with a pretty nifty briefcase). Beyond a brief encounter with the faceless Number One, there's no arch-villain looming over the action, and the henchmen are at once less invulnerable and more interesting than most of their successors in the series. Particularly memorable, of course, are Lotte Lenya as the hatchet-faced Colonel ("She's had her kicks") Kleb and Robert Shaw as the brutish Donald "Red" Grant. Kleb's edgy menace is neatly offset by her terror at the prospect of failure (an option which Number One refuses to countenance); her subtle come-on to Tatiana Romanova was positively daring by 1963 standards, and she manages to do for footwear what Goldfinger's Odd Job went on to do for head gear. Grant is no superman, but a vicious, small-time thug, recruited by SPECTRE and transformed into a fearsome enforcer; his bitter encounter with Bond on the train speaks volumes about the class tensions that still underlay British society in the post-war era.Connery, for his part, gets to build on the character he first fleshed out in Dr. No. His Bond really emerges here as a complex man, formidable but flawed. He's genteel and sophisticated, but he doesn't always keep his cool; unlike the too-often unflappable Roger Moore, Connery's Bond betrays both anger and fear when the circumstances seem to warrant it. He intervenes chivalrously to stop a fight between two Gypsy women, but he's not above slugging a woman in the service of his mission. I've always enjoyed the humanizing chemistry between Connery and Pedro Armendariz's larger-than-life Kerim ("I've led a fascinating life") Bey, the most charming of Bond sidekicks; their friendship comes across as genuine and multi-dimensional. Today's viewers (especially women) will likely find Daniela Bianchi's Tanya ("I LOVE you, James") Romanova an uncomfortably passive damsel-in-distress, but, hey: she's drop-dead gorgeous and has some nice scenes with Connery. The Turkish and Balkan settings are spectacular and the train sequence at the end is both exciting and suspenseful. Cold War scenario notwithstanding, this one has aged very well. Shake yourself a pitcher of vodka martinis and spend a Friday night watching Dr. No, From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond in a Cold Climate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'From Russia With Love' is the second and last of the Bond films to be made without a rigid formula. With 'Goldfinger', the expected elements of the later films would all accrue in a single film, setting a template the series would struggle to escape from (and, for the most part, would not bother trying to). So, like 'Dr. No', there's only a single sex interest (let's not use the term 'love' too lightly), rather than the good-girl-survives, bad/tragic-girl-dies dichotomy that would later structure all the films (bar OHMSS and, interestingly, the Dalton films), and unlike 'Dr. No', the villainous plot is rather small beer and resolutely real-world - to steal a code machine and humiliate the British Intelligence community in the process. There's also no bombastic theme song, although Matt Monro provides an easy-listening version of the theme tune at the end (it's not half bad, actually, although Shirley Bassey's brassy 'Goldfinger' makes it seem antediluvian in comparison).Effectively, this means that it's the last Bond film in which the makers were trying to make a film, not a Bond film. It didn't matter if the motifs were all there or not, it only mattered if it was a good film. Unsurprisingly, it has a good claim to being the best film of the series, and it's certainly the least self-conscious (compare with 'Thunderball', an artificial attempt to replicate 'Goldfinger' but making everything bigger).So, Daniela Bianchi isn't really just the latest 'Bond Girl', but the character at the heart of this thriller - she pretty much is the story. Ursula Andress might have had an iconic entrance in 'Dr. No', but she was so much window-dressing, irrelevant to the plot, arriving late and with almost no agency in the events that unfold around her. By contrast, the crucial pivot of 'From Russia With Love' is whether Bianchi's Tanya will side with Bond or SMERSH - the age old 'love or duty' dilemma.The film also takes time with detours that have little to do with the main plot - as in the sequence at the gypsy camp. There is a real feeling of a functioning world around Bond's escapades, rather than just colourful 'exotic' backdrops.There also isn't an undue emphasis on big action set pieces - Bond's encounter with a helicopter (very 'North by Northwest' - in fact Hitchcock's influence is detectable throughout this film, from the Cathedral sequence, to the cool Blondeness of Bianchi, to the train setting of the second half) and the climactic speedboat chase are well-executed, but miniature next to those of later films. Tellingly, the best remembered action sequence is the fight between Connery and Robert Shaw on the train, and the series would never better this intimate, brutal struggle.Shaw is by far the best of the series' bull-necked heavies - he's intelligent and charismatic as well as forceful, almost a Bond-equivalent. Lotte Lenya and Pedro Armendariz are both excellent in their supporting turns, reminders of a time when the series actually featured fully developed supporting characters, and Bianchi is good - she may lack the overt sex appeal of Andress, but she's a better actress, playing innocent without being either stupid or dull. Connery really grows into the role here, a long way from the pork-pie hatted clod he was in the first film but still untamed and prickly enough to be an exciting screen presence. It was a long slow decline from here to the tubby jobsworth of 'Diamonds Are Forever'.The early Bond films often escape the critical gaze, and when they are subjected to it, it is usually through rose-tinted spectacles. 'Dr. No' is dull and poorly acted, 'Goldfinger' fun but rather shapeless, and 'Thunderball' just tries too hard altogether. 'From Russia With Love' is a polished little gem, a cold-war thriller done with great style, and a minor masterpiece, irrespective of the series around it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the surprising success of Dr No, it became obvious that Broccoli and Saltzman's next step as producers would be other cinematic adaptation of Ian Fleming's work. Their choice this time was From Russia With Love, a novel once pointed out by US president Kennedy as one of his favorite books.Trying to capture the unique mood and look of Dr No, the producers brought back almost everyone involved in the first Bond outing ( excepting mediocre composer Monty Norman, whose clumsy tunes were replaced by a magnificent John Barry's score, in his first "official" collaboration in the Bond series). This includes Broccoli's long-standing collaborator Terence Young, screenwriter Richard Maibaum ,and, of course, Connery, that rough Scottsman, initially despised by everybody as a "lorry driver" , who nevertheless delivered an unforgettable performance as James Bond.All these talents combined to produce what no doubt is one the best Bond films of all time. Contrasting with the over the top story lines which would very soon become synonymous with Bond, From Russia With Love is a gritty and realistic Cold War thriller,filled up with sex violence and pure excitement. Terence Young considers this to be his best Bond film, and the movie proves him right. It is full of stylish shots( the famous close-up of Romanova's lips while Bond says "your mouth is just the right size") and really hot( by the 60's standards) seduction sequences. Even the back projection, a technical device often unfairly criticized , works wonderfully. Although many have criticized the action sequences following Bond's scape from the train, I think they're excellent, adding to the film's sense of danger and excitement. The helicopter chase, in particular, is a moment of brilliant film-making.(And it's even better than the sequence From North By Northwest that inspired it) The shot of Bond and Romanova embracing in the foreground with the helicopter exploding in the background perfectly encapsulates what the entire movie is about:danger, romance, violence.As for the cast, Connery seems more confident and relaxed this time, but when it comes to his job, he is as ruthless and cold as Fleming originally envisioned the character. Lotte Lenya wonderfully portrays SPECTRE mastermind Rosa Klebb ("..such a disgusting woman..." as Romanova states at one point) . But it is legendary supporting actor Robert Shaw who nearly steals the show as a cold-blooded hit-man with a psychotic strain to him.All in all, From Russia With Love is definitely a must-see not only for Bond fans, but for every discerning film lover.A true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be my favorite bond. It mixes the best aspects of an action movie with the necessary espionage. Recent Bond attempts have moved away from the "spy-game" aspect and rely more on large explosions to dazzle the viewer. Kerem Bey, the Turkish spy leader, is as much a partner and foil for Bond as there ever was. Any movie with a gypsy fight, absurd helicopter assassination attempts, and boat chase has to be great. Also, Daniella Bianchi is my favorite Bond girl. Her truceau is as sexy as it gets, though this is a subject every true Bond fan will debate about. The only objection is that they dubbed her voice into a more coarse, Russian accent. Overall, it is a wonderful movie that spans the globe and defeats SPECTRE. James Bond will return, but never with as much intrigue, beauty, and suspense as "From Russia With Love".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film introduces "Q" to the series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time, we are introduced to the leader of Spectre, Ernst Stavros Blofeld known as number one, and whose face remains hidden until "You Only Live Twice."His goal is to steal a new decoder, the Lektor, from the office of the Russian consulate, heats up the Cold War by killing and attacking the Russians and the British, through their respective agents, the Bulgarians and the Gypsies...Spectre has a feeling of resentment against Bond, because he eliminated Dr. No... He instructed number 5: "Let his death be a particularly unpleasant humiliating one."Sean Connery's second portrayal of the Secret Agent 007 is right on target... Our patriot-libertine is always ready to seduce a pretty spy for his country... He is hard during his interrogation of Tatiana... That slap must have hurt... He has trouble disabling his vicious adversaries... His ultimate match with Klebb's poisoned toe cap left him sweaty... Luckily Tatiana knows which side to stand...The charming Daniela Bianchi is Tatiana Romanova, a young Greta Garbo... She plays a pawn in Spectre blackmail scene... She knows her defection is fake but doesn't know that Klebb is a Spectre agent who will try to acquire the Lektor, and trap Bond at the same time... She also ignores that behind the mirror above the king sized bed, Spectre agents are secretly filming her love making with Bond from a cabinet de voyeur...In his final appearance, Pedro Armendariz plays Bond's most memorable Turkish Ally, the delightful Ali Kerim Bey, head of Station T, in Turkey... Kerim Bey is the perfect combination of aggression and intelligence... (Dying of cancer and hospitalized in Los Angeles, this great Mexican actor, took a pistol from under his pillow and shot himself...)Lotte Lenya plays number three, Rosa Klebb, former head of operations for SMERSH, and now a sadistic Spectre agent placed in control by the mysterious number one, who found Donald "Red" Grant fit enough for duty... This repugnant lady recruits the good-looking Tatiana from the Istanbul consulate... For her, "Training is useful, but there is no substitute for experience."Robert Shaw is "Red" Grant, a psychopath training on Spectre island who has to take the decoding device from Bond... He is, perhaps, the most memorable assassin who succeeds in making Bond kneel... Walter Gotell (later known as General Gogol) makes his first appearance in the series...Vladek Sheybal plays the master planner, Spectre top operative on the mission, number five, Kronsteen... He is a chess master known as the "Wizard of Ice." His plan involves using Bond and Russian cipher clerk Tatiana as pawns...Fred Haggerty plays the Bulgarian killer Krilencu... The way he is dealt with is very original..."From Russia with Love" introduces "Q" to the series... Desmond Llewelyn isn't called "Q" yet, but the credits refer to him as Major Boothroyd, the equipment officer..."From Russia with Love" is a straight spy adventure with lots of action and beautiful women: The attractive masseuse oiling Grant in the garden of Spectre training camp; Sylvia Trench, the "interesting old case" who returns to frolic in a canoe on the Thames; Kerim's slinky mistress lying on the settee, chews 'her breads and whines for attention;' Leila, the belly dancer at the Gypsy camp overwhelming Bond with her abdominal skill; the stunning two Gypsy girls (Vida and Rosa) whom Bond is told to select the victor in their Gypsy fight to the death; the lovely Tatiana lying naked in Bond's bed with only a black ribbon tied around her neck..."From Russia with Love" is a splendidly entertaining film against exotic Istanbul and Venice backgrounds...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond as a spy, rather than an action hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Dr. No, it was only a matter of time before James Bond returned for his second installment of espionage and adventure. Of course, it wasn't until the phenomenal success of Goldfinger that the Bond series really took off, and established the formula soon to be followed by every subsequent 007 movie and virtually every other action movie. But 'From Russia with Love' proved to be an equally effective, if slightly quieter little film, with more focus on the undercover espionage portion of James Bond's occupation, and less of the glamorous saving the world which would later become daily routine for him. In fact, one of the things that makes 'From Russia with Love' interesting is that it is a 007 movie made before the "Bond movie" formula was established, and noticeable differences in the storyline can be seen. 'Russia' is more of a slower film, with fewer action sequences and more focus on Bond actually being a spy rather than an action hero. This leisurely, tension-building storytelling likely would have garnered terrible reaction in the 90s, but 'From Russia with Love' is still a very strong, if less formulaic addition to the Bond series. Another noticeable difference is that Bond himself is much less the star of the show than is usually the case. Much more focus is placed on the supporting characters of the story, including minor characters such as chess master Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal) who likely would simply have been eliminated from the story had 'Russia' followed the standard formula more closely. And for once, Bond isn't completely all knowing, capable of solving any problem independently - he teams up with the wise Kerim Bey (the charming Pedro Armendariz, his last film role) who shows Bond the ropes of Istanbul. But more standard story elements from the Bond formula are still present, such as menacing villains Rosa Klebb (the terrifying Lotte Lenya) and hit-man Red Grant. (an utterly intimidating and menacing Robert Shaw, the film's standout) And of course, there is still a slew of beautiful women for Bond to seduce, especially Russian decoding clerk Tatiana Romanova, played by the immensely gorgeous Daniela Bianchi. Also watch for a tense boat chase near the film's climax, the kind of stunt frequented by future Bond films. So 'From Russia with Love' is really a quieter, more suspenseful addition to the Bond series, with more focus on Bond doing some actual spying rather than explosions every five minutes and Bond saving the world from some elaborate scheme. It may drag at times, and may not prove quite as exciting as today's audiences might hope, but Connery is at the top of his game here as 007, and his opposers are genuinely menacing and intimidating. For those wishing the Bond franchise would place more emphasis of the espionage portion of Bond's occupation, 'From Russia with Love' should prove the perfect film for them.-8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Fleming's Novel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to believe, but the movie is actually an improvement on Fleming's novel. Rather than have the Lektor operation be a simple Russian scheme to discredit Bond as Fleming did, SPECTRE takes a hand here in their first on-screen appearance as an organization. The plot is improved considerably because of this. The movie thrives on its supporting actors and Sheybal. Connery is somewhat outshone by these greater lights, but gives a credible performance. From Russia... is a different pace of movie: no one here is intent on wiping out the world's population, or destroying the gold supply, or stealing submarines. Basically, it's a quiet little plot focusing on an elaborate "sting" operation. Until the end, the pace is kind of slow, and might lose more "modern" audiences, particularly those used to incredible stunt sequences every 20 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the James Bond series, probably the best of the spy genre as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Connery came, he acted, and he conquered as James Bond in this second installment of the James Bond film franchise. With some of the most realistic fight scenes for a '60s movie and terrific story by Fleming, this film has a recipe for a masterpiece.As mentioned in my review of "Dr. No", his charm and intellectual wit is still there, and then in some scenes in a whole lot more better than before. How he tries to commence his mission, you just couldn't fall asleep. A-grade acting by Connery here.Then-newcomer Daniela Branchi is good as Bond Girl Tatiana, who is the wrong girl at the right time. Desmond Llewelyn, in his debut as gadget man Q, shows us an impressive array of gadgets that Bond would later find quite useful. But it is Robert Shaw, who almost steals the show as the murderous, merciless, assassin Grant, who will stop at nothing to prevent Bond and Tatiana from commencing their mission.Crew also return here. Producers Brocolli and Saltzman and director Young have returned, with double the budget and double the thrills in return. Also, the musical score by John Barry is memorable, it really sets the tone for a realistic spy adventure.The story is not meant to be an action picture. It is more like the adventures of a spy, with the dangers of being a spy. In short, it is a complex spy thriller, made to suit the target audience which are spy fans and intelligent viewers. I do not understand how anyone could call such a film "boring." This truly is a pinnacle of the James Bond series, one which will remain for years to come.9.34/10Delton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best and the Brightest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Bond film that stands out among all other films as well as the Bond films, From Russia With Love is filled with not only a heavy dose of nonstop action and adventure, but also an intelligent plot that commented heavily on the world state of affairs in 1963. Capitalist and Communists are set to work against each other by SPECTRE, an organization which does not give any special considerations to economic systems, but wishes to weaken the balance of world power and take control itself. The survival of the Bond films depended on their ability to change with the decades, and From Russia With Love is no exception. Great acting performances from not only Sean Connery, but Robert Shaw, Pedro Armendariz, and Lotte Lenya (the wife of Kurt Weill).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery never failed to charm as James Bond.His charm,coupled with the terrific story line that you see here in from Russia With Love,makes this film second only to Goldfinger in terms of ranking all of Connery's efforts as 007.Nearly stealing the show is a fresh faced Robert Shaw as a trained assassin with his eyes zeroed in on the agent.Sadly,we also see the final performance of Pedro Armendariz,who committed suicide the year of the film's release upon learning he had terminal cancer.Even if you are not a Bond fan,this is a very well done good versus evil story that is carried out very well.If you are a Bond fan,you probably have all the films in your collection,whether they are good or bad,but if you are someone who only collects films you consider good,you'll want to consider this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The SPECTRE Number 1 assigns the SPECTRE Number 3, Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), who was ex-SMERSH operative before defecting Russia, and the SPECTRE Number 5 and expert planner Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal) to plot a scheme to steal the Russian's Lektor decoder and revenge on James Bond (Sean Connery) for killing Dr. No. Rosa Klebb recruits the SPECTRE assassin Grant (Robert Shaw) and lures the naive and loyal Russian Corporal State Security Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), who works at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul and believes that Rosa Klebb still works for SMERSH. Meanwhile M (Bernard Lee) summons James Bond and tells that Tatiana wants to defect to London and has offered the Lektor as part of the bargain. However, she wants to go to England with Bond.Bond and M suspect that it might be a trap, but Bond sees Tatiana's photo and decides to go to Istanbul, where he has the support of the local operative Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendariz). He meets Tatiana and they plot a plan to steal the Lektor and return to London. But they do not know that they are actually pawns in the scheme plotted by SPECTRE. "From Russia with Love" is an unforgettable adventure of James Bond and one of my favorite movies of this franchise. The poisoned spike in the toe of Rosa Klebb is maybe the most famous scene in 007 movies that I never forget. Daniela Bianchi is one of the most beautiful Bond girls and James Bond is a top-notch spy but also vulnerable and I like that. The story is very well written and has great characters.I do not know how many times I have seen "From Russia with Love", but the last time had been on 24 January 2000 on VHS. Yesterday I saw it again in a magnificent Bly-Ray in DTS. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Moscou Contra 007" ("Moscow against 007")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-the-top James Bond movie in which he confronts Spectra and killer hoodlums around the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bond (an excellent , as usual, Sean Connery) willingly falls into an assassination ploy involving a naive Russian beauty (Daniela Bianchi who subsequently starred an Italian spoof titled OK Connery by Alberto Martino) in order to retrieve a Soviet encryption device that was stolen by Spectre . The world's masters (Lotte Lenya , Walter Gotell , Vladek) of murder pull out all the stops to destroy Agent 007 . Bond goes to Turkey , there he has an ally character called Ali Kerim Bey (final filmed appearance of Pedro Armendáriz , ill by cancer when he shot Conqueror of Mongolia along with John Wayne) . James is being lured into a deadly trap , and he will need all of his force , intelligence and cutting-edge technology to triumph over the enemies that seek to destroy him . Bond is pursued by a hulking blond assassin named Red Grant (Robert Shaw) , whose character provided a template for a number of blond European henchmen that would proliferate the James Bond series .This solid , slick thriller with magic mix of action-packed , dazzling stunts, gadgetry, and romance provided by sexy company as Daniela Bianchi . Sean Connery as James Bond is very fine , he does remarkably well , he has toughness , irony, humor and sympathy, however also has coldness ,cunning , intelligence and roughness . Sean Connery said that this movie was his personal favorite out of the Bond films he did . Here Bond is an efficient , relentless agent trying to chase obstinately the criminals , traveling around the world as always , as this time is mostly set in Istanbul , Turkey . Bond to achieve his aims , along the way uses violent means , pulling off brutal killings against enemies who wreak all sorts of havoc . As always Bond will use "state of the art" and fantastic gadgets provided by ¨Q¨ in his first intervention by Desmond Llewelyn , he would reprise the role of "Q" in 16 subsequent Bond films ; in fact , Bond's trick attaché case is the first true Bond film gadget . In addition , there appears the usual as Lois Maxwell, ¨MoneyPenny¨ , Bernard Lee as M , and Walter Gotell (later played General Gogol) as Morzeny . Here appears three wonderful women ; both of them Beauty Pageant Queens are actresses in this film: Daniela Bianchi, Martine Beswick, Aliza Gur. Bianchi (Italy) and Gur (Israel) were roommates at Miss Universe 1960, which Bianchi won.The picture contains comic-strip adventure , sensational pursuits , silly set pieces, great stunts , tongue-in check humor ,frantic unstopped action , amazing gimmicks and stimulating images like are the spectacular chases , the overwhelming scenes, and the breathtaking fights . There is a love scene between Sean Connery and Daniela Bianchi , it caused censorship problems in Britain . In the scene, a sweating Spectre cameraman films James Bond and Tatiana Romanova in bed from a cabinet de voyeur and The British Board of Film Censors mandated to producers that the voyeurism in the scene was too explicit . As is like a roller-coaster , as is fast-paced , light, excitement, funny and entertaining ; it's a winner for oo7 fans and non-fans alike . The chase and suspense formula wears strong in this entry . The action-packed includes : impressive helicopter chase scene that is a homage to Hitchcock's cropduster sequence in ¨North by Northwest¨ , exciting battles at a gypsy camp , and fights aboard a train . Hoping for an end to the Cold War, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman didn't want James Bond's main enemy to be Russian, so for the film version his nemesis is the fictitious criminal organization Spectre , seeking revenge for the death of their operative . The budget was $2,000,000 , double that of ¨Doctor No¨ . Enjoyable title song and stirring musical score fitting to action by John Barry in his classic style . This is the first James Bond film to feature John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer ; the score allegedly still contains riffs from Monty Norman's work on ¨Doctor No¨. Barry himself felt that ¨From Russia¨ was the first film in the series where he had complete creative control over the soundtrack. Riveting and fancy main titles by habitual Maurice Binder , furthermore eye-popping production design by Syd Cain . It's brimming with colorful and fascinating cinematography by cameraman Ted Moore . Evocative photography ,much of the film was shot on location, with only a bare minimum of back projection used ; something quite unusual for a film of 1963. The motion picture was well directed by Terence Young ,author of three best James Bond films : ¨Dr No¨ , ¨Thunderball¨ and ¨From Russia with love¨ and directed to Audrey Hepburn in a good thriller titled ¨Wait until dark¨ and a failed film titled ¨Bloodline¨.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By no means a great movie, but a top-notch BOND movie. Connery isn't yet as entertaining as he later became (especially in "Thunderball"), but he is certainly more confident and likable than he was in "'Dr.No". This is probably the only GENUINE spy movie in the series, and it contains (in my opinion) the best-sustained sequence of all the Bonds (the Connery-Shaw fight and the 15 minutes leading to it). Unfortunately, the two following climaxes (especially the boat chase) can't approach the same level of quality. It's still above-average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPECTRE Sends Their Love To 007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Dr. No, the movie going public could not get enough of Sean Connery as James Bond. From Russia With Love was almost demanded to be made and it's proved to be one of the most durable of the Bond series in popularity.That infamous third echelon SPECTRE is after a new Russian decoding machine that the West would certainly like to lay its mitts on as well. But SPECTRE has something additional in mind. Knowing that MI5 will send its best in 007 after the decoder, they have it in mind to kill James Bond. And the alluring bait will be Daniela Bianchi, their agent.Of course as always no woman can resist the sex appeal of James Bond as packaged by Sean Connery. Personally I've always liked Roger Moore best in the part, I like Sean Connery as well, but more for his non-Bond roles. That I'm sure will be appreciated by Sean Connery should he ever get to read this review.The cinematography in a story that takes place in Istanbul and along the Mediterranean Sea is gorgeous. Connery gets a really outstanding cast in support including Pedro Armendariz for whom this was a final performance as Bond ally Ali Kerim Bey.Robert Shaw has a part of few words as the paid assassin SPECTRE has trained for the purpose of killing James Bond. Shaw is terrifying in his role and the fact he did it without much use of a voice that was one of the best in the English language, testifies to his ability as an actor. His confrontation with Connery on the Orient Express is one of the great fight scenes ever done on film.However I have a warm spot in my heart for Lotte Lenya as Rosa Klebb, the Russian defector now working for SPECTRE, the woman with those killer orthopedic shoes. Kenneth Cole never designed better.From Russia With Love has everything you want in a James Bond film, action, sex, and exotic locations. And Sean Connery, who could complain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is directed by Terence Young and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum &amp; Johanna Harwood from the Ian Fleming novel of the same name. It stars Sean Connery, Daniela Bianchi, Lotte Lenya, Robert Shaw &amp; Pedro Armendáriz. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.James Bond's second cinematic outing has 007 sent on a mission to Istanbul to try and acquire a Russian cypher machine known as Lektor. It's a trap set up by SPECTRE, who formulate a plan to upset the world order whilst murdering Bond in revenge for his killing of their agent Dr. No.Spy Hard! A certain JFK had announced From Russia With Love as being one of his favourite books, thus making the minds up of producers Broccoli &amp; Saltzman to make Fleming's Cold War thriller the follow up to Dr. No. It's a favourite of many a Bond aficionado because it represents one of the few occasions where Bond was still down to earth as a person, a hard working spy forced to do detective work. The adaptation is very literate as well, with a high fidelity to the source material a major bonus to Fleming's fans. The story is tautly told, often with dark tints the deeper Bond gets into things, and a number of excellently constructed set pieces fill out the latter half of the picture. It's not hard to understand why Connery cites this as his favourite Bond film.Though it is mostly free of the gadget excess that would become a trademark of the franchise, it's still very much a quintessential Bond movie. Exotic locations and exotic foes, eye poppingly gorgeous ladies (Bianchi smouldering like few others can), pre-credits sequence, the snazzy title credits (here on a dancing lady), title song crooned by a big name (Matt Munro), Barry's blending of the Bond theme into the score, Blofeld (a faceless Anthony Dawson) and an impressive cast list. One of the film's big strengths is the cast assembled, Connery (firmly moving into iconic realm) is aided considerably by the presence of Lenya, Shaw and Armendáriz, while the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Boothroyd (latterly to be known as Q) is a telling point in the series.With a $2 million budget in the coffers, the makers were able to really push the boat out technically, and they were rewarded as the film went on to gross nearly $79 million Worldwide. Crucially it became apparent that James Bond was popular outside of Britain, the template had been set, what would they do with the next Bond outing we all wondered? 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Cold War Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If that electric guitar in the opening credits doesn't do it for you, the rest of the film will certainly give you the ultimate expression of everything that the word BOND is. Here is Agent 007 in his purest form, and it's in the form of From Russia with Love.First of all, this movie improves on absolutely every aspect from the first film, Dr. No. The acting, the directing, the story, the dialogue, the music, the spectacle...everything is at least half a notch higher. Perhaps the most difficult thing for any sequel to achieve is to top the first one, and with a bigger budget, a bigger story, and a stellar cast, this movie nails it.We get one of the most well thought out James Bond stories, as well as one of the closest portrayals of Fleming's literary works. The manipulative SPECTRE organization is arranging to steal a cipher machine from the Russian government and draw Britain into the scene, in an effort to assassinate an interfering 007 while at the same time pitting the two super powers against each other. Ignorant of the scheme, Bond is sent on a mission to snatch the Russian encryption device and accompany the beautiful Russian cipher clerk, Tatiana Romanova across the Iron Curtain, while avoiding any potential trap. What begins as a simple mission turns into a strategic battle of wits between 007 and his adversaries.Although, one might find this film to be a bit slow on the pacing compared to more recent Bond films, I personally love this film for two reasons: 1. It was made in the 60s. Bond was originally created during the heart of the Cold War, and he was a man of his era. In the current films, there is always some sort of need to be retro. There is always a nod to the old days. Well, this IS the "good-old days" so to speak. We have grey suits, fedora hats, travel by train, cigarette cases, along with a tremendous clash of East versus West. There's just something that feels pure about the atmosphere of this film?what Bond films were meant to be.2. This movie is arguably the most intricate piece of film-making in the series. Nothing is taken for granted. There are so many subtleties and when something happens, it's always for a reason. There are so many turns in the story, little bits of symbolism and foreshadowing here and there, and some characters, in the beginning of the film, are not the same when you reach the end of the film.Also, this film isn't hindered by the usual Bond formula. Rather than a single master villain, we have multiple bad guys in different places, all with their own agenda. Likewise, the movie doesn't settle in one place, but rather, is continually moving from one place to the next, and the gadgets don't outweigh the characters or the story, but compliment them instead.If there is one Bond movie that steps out of the realm of sheer entertainment and into the realm of a great cinematic achievement, I think From Russia with Love may be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond number 2: mad helicopters, train fist-fights and romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>International criminal organization SPECTER starts a skirmish between British and Russian secret agents to capture/protect a precious decoding device, planing to play one side against the other and get hold of the device itself.Bond's second screen outing perfected the formula's ingredients while being the most realistic and grounded of his adventures. "From Russia with Love" isn't only vintage Bond for introducing key components such as Desmond Lwelyn's Q, SPECTER mastermind Bloffield (cult phenomenon and the model for Austin Powers' Dr Evil and Insepctor Gadget's Dr Claw), while perfecting the Bond character (played to a tee by Connery). It is a cracking cold war thriller in its own right when most Bond films classify as action/adventure films.The lean and mean aspect serves the film well in its numerous set-pieces, from the Hitchcockian helicopter chase to the famous train fist-fight. Very helpful are Daniela Bianchi as a touching woman finding herself way out of her depth and Robert Shaw as the ruthless assassin Red Grant."From Russia with Love" is up there with the very best of Bond in that it keeps growing on you with repeated viewings. Another home run for agent 007!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie proved that Sean Connery is really apt for the Monty Norman "James Bond Theme". From the start of this movie, you would really notice that the man in the screen, holding a Walther PPK, is James Bond. This movie is really impressive. The best scene (with sounds) here is when 007 inspects his room. The sound is just apt. Pedro Armendariz is a good portrait of Kerim Bey and Desmond Llewelyn is really the best Q. As they said, "Bond, James Bond" really showed himself out in this movie. There are no too-exotic locations, no super-high-tech gadgets (although the suitcase is hightech even at this time) and no all-powerful villains (Robert Shaw is really good!)10 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Sean Connery Era Bonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Russia with Love" is the sequel that improves upon its predecessor in terms of action, scope, spectacle, and thrilling storytelling. The plot concerns Bond as he is sent in to Istambul to bring in a Russian defector named Tatiana Romanova who has supposedly fallen in love with Bond. Knowing that its obviously a trap he goes anyways because the bait is a Lector decoding machine. From there the plot takes many twists and turns from Lonton to Istambul to a Gypsy camp to the Orient Express to the final showdown in Venice.Sean Conney once again proves that he's James Bond and this time his role is more defined than in "Dr. No". Daniela Bianchi as Tatiana is just beautiful and gorgeous (also like Ursula Andress was also dubbed because she couldn't speak English. She was voiced by Barbara Jefford ) and has a much more involved role as a double agent. Lotte Lenya as Rosa Klebb is just fantastic because in real life she was a sweet woman but when she acted her role was cold, ruthless and sadistic making her one of the best Bond villains. Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz plays as Bond's ally in Turkey Kerim Bey which was his last role before sadly committing suicide after filming when he discovered that he had inoperable fatal cancer.( His role was memorable.) Robert Shaw plays as Red Grant, an assassin who has an ominous presence thruout the film without talking up until the Orient Express. Desmond Llewelyn joins the cast as the gadget master Q who would be series regular up until "The World is not Enough" in 1999. "From Russia with Love" also marks the first appearance of the sinister leader of SPECTRE (played by an uncredited Anthony Dawson and voiced by Eric Pohlmann who would both reprise the role in "Thunderball") who's face is never seen but his hands are shown holding and stroking a white cat.Terence Young returns as director and his directing is much more focused and solid than in "Dr. No" (even though I said that "Dr. No" was well directed, I find this one to be more focused) with exotic locations and well choreographed and iconic action sequences. "From Russia With Love" has everything a good Bond movie needs: Great well choreographed action, great acting, great storytelling, exotic locations and of course beautiful women. This is one of the best Bond movies of the Sean Connery era and my personal favorite of the Sean Connery Era Bonds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Personal favorite of the Connery Bond films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most people usually cite Goldfinger as their favorite of the Connery Bond films, I will stick with the second underrated entry in the series.Bond: Connery is still at his peak in the role exuding charm, sex appeal, machismo and humor.The villains: Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya are excellent and create two of the most memorable villains in the Bond pantheon. Shaw's muscle-bound assassin Red Grant contributes one of the more exciting action pieces on a train. Lenya is pure malevolence and her battle with Bond using a poison spike as a weapon is terrific.The woman: Daniela Bianchi is almost never mentioned in lists of memorable Bond women, but she is sexy, vulnerable and (unlike her predecessor Ursula Andress) actually has a compelling role in the action.The plot is more complex and unusually grounded and believable for a Bond film. Pedro Armendariz is a delight as a fellow agent and compatriot to Bond. The action moves along at quite a fast clip and the screenplay has enough development and repartee to engage even non-Bond fans. A true gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of the Bonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely an excellent movie (Bond series or otherwise). Some may not enjoy it as much- because of its age or it is not part of the later formulaic Bond movies, but they miss the point. The plot is solid, understandable, believable, and full of twists. The scripting is fantastic and the character interplay, introduced in "Dr. No," are more fully developed here.The story involves a plot by SPECTRE to steal a soviet encoding/decoding device (the Lektor) and discredit James Bond at the same time. If it also pits the West vs. the East to the profit of SPECTRE, all the better.A soviet encoder tech in the Russian consulate in Istanbul, Tatiana Romanova, (played by Daniela Bianchi) is asked to fall in love with Bond and promise to hand over the decoder if he helps her defect. However, the mission is not Russian, but SPECTRE originated. The Brits smell the trap but send Bond anyway, in hopes of foiling the trap and getting the Lektor themselves.A story of plots within plots and devious turns until the very end, the movie moves, and best of all, ties up the loose plots by the end. Fantastically choreographed, filmed in wonderful locations (Istanbul/Turkey, Italy, and Scotland (posing as the Balkans region of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria), it is quite extraordinary for its genre and time.What makes this Bond work is that Connery is still young and into the idea of being Bond, and the supporting cast is brilliant. Along with most of the Bond regulars like M (Bernard Lee) and Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), a slew of wonderful characters aid or oppose Bond along the way. Of special note is Pedro Armendariz (who was dying of cancer during the filming) who plays Karim Ali Bey, head of Station T (Turkey). His performance may be the finest supporting role in a Bond film, both clever and humorous, he really steals his scenes. Robert Shaw plays the brute/heavy Red Grant and is maybe the best heavy of all the Bond films. Some may like Jaws more, but Shaw's Grant is diabolical and cold-blooded in ways Jaws could not be (also, Grant is not victimized by some corny jokes as Kiel's Jaws was). Lotte Lenya plays former Russian SMERSH agent Col. Klebb and is equally brilliant. And if you watch close, you may see one of the first ever suggestions of gay/lesbian orientation in major cinematic history.The movie is a wonderful "spy" movie with lots of action as opposed to an action/special effects film with a spy element. This is Bond as it should be- intrigue with detective work, traitors, hidden allies (and enemies), mystery, suspense, and action. This is a tale of espionage- fighting the Cold War (or criminal element), not saving the whole world from one maniac with a paid army.</fullReview>

This movie is perhaps the most realistic of all the Bond films. The action is believable and not too over-the-top. The Bond girl is great as is the villain. The plot is intelligent. Pedro Armandallez is fabulous as Bond's Turkish counterpart. The scenes at the gypsy party and on the train are beautifully done.

From Russia with love is the most realistic bond film ever made. Everything about this movie is top notch. I love the classic simple plot that is made sophisticated by an excellent acting performance and good script. This movie is so smooth in its delivery from the beginning where the main villain played by a very healthy and strong Robert Shaw to the end where Bond is romancing the beautiful Tatiana Romaneva.The movie is so smooth that i often watch it just to relax. Its Connery at his best and Bond at its best. This is the mold that all Bond movies should be designed to fill. This is the Creme De La Creme of Ian Flemming's James Bond!</fullReview>

This film feels exotic and tense with great action set-pieces, the two villains are superb and memorable (red grant is a relentless silent assassin, bad English accent apart! &amp; Rosa Klebb, spectre number 2 and KGB defector who is the mastermind behind spectres plan to steal a lektor). All the classic bond elements are starting to form here, M, Moneypenny, Q are all starting to take on the characterizations that make them such fantastic characters. Also the gadgets in this film are helpful, believable and don't take away from bonds skills as a secret agent!! All in all a fantastic film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best of the Bonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A letter from Russia to British intelligence brings an incredible offer. A Soviet Embassy clerk in Istanbul will defect with Russia's latest encoding machine on one condition: she must be accompanied by Agent 007, James Bond, who she fell in love with after seeing his picture. It's clearly a trap, but the payoff is too good to pass up. And no-one, not even the bait, knows what the real game is. Thus begins one of- if not the- best James Bond movie, From Russia with love.Today, the Bond franchise is second only to Star Wars in value, and second only to Godzilla in number of films. It's MGM's mainstay, and its title role is among the most coveted in the British film industry. But at the beginning, it was far from clear that it would be this way. Dr. No, while hardly a flop, was also less than a resounding success. It did decent box office, but reviews were mixed, and Ian Fleming himself was reported to be somewhat unhappy with the result. If the second Bond wasn't an improvement, the series might not have continued much longer. But From Russia with Love was better, in practically every way, an interesting fact considering that it had the same director and leading man.What makes the biggest difference here is the story and setting. From the moment he enters Istanbul, Bond is immersed in a colorful world of espionage and surveillance, plots and counter plots, not unlike Kipling's great game. It's a world of secret passages and Gypsy assassins, where everyone has a tail and you can count on your hotel being bugged. It's so rich in the Cold War intrigues that Dr. No was missing. And that's before SPECTRE becomes involved, seeking to play the British and Russians against each other in a truly ingenious scheme that will leave a long trail of bodies on both sides. From Russia is further buoyed by one of the series' best supporting casts. Daniela Bianchi plays Tatiana, the aforementioned embassy clerk. She and Connery generate amazing chemistry as they play two people who must pretend to love each other, only to fall in love for real. Each of them knows that the other is only following orders, and yet they develop real feelings for each other, even as they remain suspicious and remind themselves that they have a job to do. There's just something right and pure about a love that can transcend nationalities and agendas, and it makes this perhaps the most romantic of all the Bond films.And this movie features one of Bond's best sidekicks, Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendariz). The head of a local, family operated spy-net, Kerim is a larger-than-life figure. He's open, friendly, and a consummate host, even to his enemies. He has an infectious zeal for life and a wonderfully unconventional sense of humor. His set of connections and knowledge of Istanbul is second to none, and he relishes every aspect of his profession. All in all he's one of the most likable, eccentric characters in the series.And, this being a Bond film, there are excellent action scenes. The shootout at the gypsy camp and the fiery boat chase are well done and exciting. Another high point is the death of the Bulgarian assassin, which generates a great deal of suspense and provides one of the series' most iconic sights. Best of all is the climactic confrontation between Bond and SPECTRE assassin Donald Grant (Robert Shaw of Jaws fame). It's a hell of a fight scene.From Russia with Love has got action, suspense, humor, romance, beautiful locations, and beautiful girls- in short, everything a good Bond movie should. The writing, direction, and especially the editing are greatly improved. The stunts and effects are flawless. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is in a dead heat with Goldfinger for the title of best Bond film. It's an all time classic, and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russian with Love (1963) Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 3 things I think of when I think "From Russia With Love" are:1. A long train ride.2. The awesome shoe-knife.3. A cat that is the center of attention of dialogue ;)I enjoyed this film a lot and was excited when seeing scenes that I loved but forgot were from this film. The color was great of course, especially being from '63.I feel like MGM stepped it up, knowing how the previous Bond film, Dr. No, was a big hit. This film had the first "Bond" intro sequence to many that followed in the series. By that I of course mean the exciting introduction, then the intro credits with a sexy girl next in line.Overall I liked the plot and I was always intrigued. I feel like this film was more exciting than Dr. No, as Dr. No had some pauses too long to talk about plot. Both films are great, but they aren't trying the same thing, and this review isn't about comparison.I didn't care for the ending of this film. The second to last segment with Number 3 was good, but it was second to last. The next scene was a short boat ride and then that was it. There didn't seem like enough closure to me.I give this film an 8 out of 10. It is very enjoyable and keeps you active. There aren't really any slow segments here. The plot was good, the color was great, and it's has plenty of memorable scenes. This is a great start to great things to come.</fullReview>

Kudos! The story is well-thought. The whole friendship-rival thing between Bond and Grant, is really nice to see in the movie. The Bondgirl of course, is foreign(which isn't bad), and as usually, helpless.As for the action scenes... amazing! The movie had some memorable scenes, nobody will forget. The chopper scene, the fight in the train... the boat chase... brilliant. I have to say, that the action is one of the best of all Bond movies, excluding Goldeneye and Casino Royale of course.I give this movie a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second Bond movie is possibly the best true spy story of the series. There is a little bit of mystery, a lot of double dealing and spy-counter spy plotting, and enough action to satisfy even modern day action junkies. However, the action doesn't get as out of hand and absurd as in more recent films.Connery was fully into the role even in the first installment, Dr. No, and by this movie he moves and acts like a spy ... even more so than in some of his later ventures into the role where Bond movies were already becoming somewhat of a parody of themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second run for the Bond series trips and stumbles it's way through...not a proud moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the original outing Dr. No, From Russia With Love was like it's ugly cousin. It puts proof to the sequels are never as good as the original idea. Now considered a classic but I only thought it to be a rush job to cash in on the original surprise success from Dr. No. It just didn't mesh with the entire idea. They doubled everything and expected it to be as pleasing as the first and again although a classic it doesn't fit the bill. On top of that Connery's Bond comes across as a real ass...I mean he is meant to be smug and sly but in this installment just seems to be a jerk plain and simple. He seduces his women ten fold and even slaps them around a little but he just seems like he woke up on the wrong side of the bed and you don't really get attached to Bond like the previous film. The plot is seemingly simple enough which has Spectre (the evil organization) out to kill Bond with an elaborate plan to exact revenge for him killing Dr. No. The elaborate plan though is too complex and it's just stupid and half the time you don't even know what's going on. All this revolves around Russia somehow and yet they never go to Russia (I realize during this time Russia was off limits and at the height of the cold war.) Sean Connery returns again as super suave James Bond and he is still the ultimate in cool and sophistication. As I touched on earlier his Bond performance just seems to be a little more harsh, a little rough around the edges and maybe that is the story moreso than the character but still it sits in my mind as not my favorite Bond performance thus far. (Remember I am seeing all of these for the very first time.) Bernard Lee, and Lois Maxwell return in their respective roles with the same effort as the previous film. They have small but well remembered roles to play. Daniela Bianchi is the latest Bond girl and she has a significant role and even some back story to her character but I found her insatiably winy and annoying which Bond keeps her in check by dragging her around but she still doesn't really add anything to the story. Bond seduces her and she becomes a love sick puppy for the entire film. Lotte Lenya is a very good villain...I'll give her that. She is memorable as the fake Russian military woman who gives Bond a run for his money.The seemingly endless scenes on the train sit in my mind and in some ways they are memorable and in other ways it seemed like everything happened on this train and it just kept going and going and going. I suppose when you have a classic like From Russian with Love, it has the tendency to grow on you and this one probably will for me as well. I just really loved Dr. No so I found this installment not nearly as exciting or well made. Still directed by Terence Young, I thought he did a good job with Dr. No in creating this spy world and espionage mission but something fell flat with From Russia With Love. I still recommend to anyone who hasn't see the Bond films to watch it because it is still a classic and if you're going to see one might as well see them all...I certainly am and not regretting it. 6/10</fullReview>

The excitement within the viewer fades though, as the movie proceeds to it's finale, due to the lengthy and detailed depiction of the escape.

		<shortDescription>One of the Very Best of the James Bond Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is considered by many to be the best Bond movie. It's definitely up there. This is one of the few Bond films that truly feels like a spy thriller.Sean Connery has mastered the role by this outing. He exudes charm and charisma and is more than convincing as the man of action. He shows us why he's the true James Bond. Daniela Bianchi may not be too special personality-wise, but she's very beautiful and has great chemistry with Connery.Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya make an excellent pair of villains. Red Grant is one of the best Bond henchmen as well as one of the most realistic. Rosa Klebb is very creepy and very dangerous with her poison-tipped shoes. Also in the movie is Blofeld, whose face wouldn't be shown until "You Only Live Twice".The plot is gritty, realistic, and keeps your attention the entire time. There are many thrilling action scenes, such as the gypsy fight, the boat chase, and the struggle with Rosa Klebb. The stand-out, however, is the famous fight scene between Bond and Grant aboard the Orient Express. You will rarely see any better.The locations in Istanbul and Venice are very atmospheric and John Barry makes a terrific debut as the music composer. I also really love the theme song by Matt Monroe.This film is also notable for the first appearance of Q, played famously by Desmond Llewelyn. He would be in every Bond movie until "The World Is Not Enough," with the exception of "Live and Let Die."A fan favorite, and for good reason, this is not only a great James Bond movie, but a great movie, period.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Second's out, and one of my Connery favorites. Twice the budget of Dr. No, and surely some experience's for the production team since that. Great, grave opening scene with a look inside the "hitman school". The sinister SPECTRE organization shows to be a tricky enemy for any Secret Service, not just MI6. Some great casting and good settings in the environment makes good spy movie-mood, and the last half of the film wind things up to a great climax with some classic action scenes. The gadgets thus far gives no more excitement than small scale equipped brief cases, but that will change dramatically, soon.... This is a true classic chapter in the Bond history, among the top 10 in my mind. ( As I intend to put the 007 adventures facing each other, with deepest respect for the individual era of decades and players, as of directors and of course the technical time line aspects.) The Golden Years wasn't far away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond strikes again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, the second of the Bond franchise, the British secret agent finds himself involved in a conspiracy of the criminal organization SPECTRE, which plans to assassinate him using a beautiful and naive Russian agent.This film is one of the few films of the early period of the franchise to focus on the reality of the secret services of the sixties: the Cold War. It is curious but only during the eighties and nineties, at a time when the USSR was agonizing, is that the Bond films will again focus more directly on the rivalry between the Soviet bloc and the Western powers. Directed by Terence Young and again with Sean Connery in the role, Bond will face and seduce Tatiana (Daniela Bianchi, another "Bond-Girl" that cinema forgotten after the passage by the franchise) and defeat Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya). Bernard Lee (as M) and Lois Maxwell (Miss Moneypenny as) also appear in the film, which is introduced one of the most popular and charismatic characters of the franchise: Q, Director of MI-6 Equipment Branch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right off the bat in this film do we see the Russians are on top of their game and are preparing for James Bond. They even had a man wear a Bond mask to make it seem more realistic. The point is, for pretty much the entire film, you know that the Russians, or rather, Spectre is in control. Spectre as a whole is a much more formidable opponent than Dr. No was. That film was good, but From Russia With Love is great.We don't actually see Bond for a full 20 minutes into the film. Of course, we find him with an entirely different woman than the last time we saw him. While he does have his fair share of adventures with the opposite sex, this time around is toned down a bit since the last film. Although, I will say that the belly dancing opening credits and middle-of-the-film sequence may have been a bit overdone. For the most part, this film is much more of a spy thriller than Dr. No. I felt like this film went more for dramatic storytelling than the explosions. But it also had one of the best fights I have seen in pre-70's cinema. The train sequence is utter brilliance. For once, I actually felt Bond was in danger, which is something that these franchise films have a difficult time with.As I said before, Tatiana is very different than Honey Ryder. Where Honey Ryder was spontaneous and couldn't necessarily handle herself in combat, Tatiana has her share of punches and sometimes even outsmarts Bond himself. She's no Rebbecca Ferguson in MI5, but still fun to watch on screen. As much as I liked this film now, I think it will be even better once I have seen Goldfinger. All in my path to review every Bond film before Spectre comes out in a few months.+Spy elements more present this time+Spectre+Train sequence+Darker-Maybe a little bit too much belly dancing8.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bond Review Title: A catchy title that smartly invokes thoughts of the exotic and romance.Pre-Titles: In the first pre-titles sequence we get villainous henchman Red Grant stalking Bond in a garden maze and garrotting him to death, only for it to have been a training exercise. It's a good and quietly intense way to open up.Theme Song: The instrumental theme is very memorable and has a colourful quality to it. Matt Munro croons his way through the end credits version and does a fantastic job.Plot: Bond is sent to Istanbul to acquire a decoding device from Russian Tatiana Romanova and help her to defect. However it is SPECTRE behind the scheme as they plan on taking revenge on Bond for killing their operative Dr. No. This is one of the most grounded and possibly best of all the series plots. Bond feels most like a spy in the film as he tries to help Romanova and avoid those who are on his trail. There is a real sense of vulnerability to Bond throughout the mission and the story remains gripping throughout as we await SPECTRE's next move.James Bond: Sean Connery grows more into the role in this film and this might be his most accomplished performance. He once again portrays Bond's many different sides without having to compromise and delivers many witty lines with ease, we really believe that he is fearful for his life and he isn't afraid to rough up anyone who might be against him.Bond Girls: Former Miss Universe contestant Daniela Bianchi plays Tatiana and does a brilliant job. She comes across as sweet-natured as well as intelligent and is pretty much at the centre of the story. She is no pushover either and her conflicted loyalty is played-up smartly. There is also a real chemistry between her and Bond which makes you get behind the story even more.Villains: Lotte Lenya is pitch perfect as SPECTRE number 3 Klebb. She plays Klebb as someone who is uncompromising and vicious when it comes to getting things done. The lesbian undertones and unique climactic fight only add to her character. Robert Shaw is superb as the calm and imposing Red Grant, being possibly the best heavy to appear in the series. He doesn't say much throughout, but Shaw has a great presence and he plays Grant as someone who is always planning his next move. He is also a physical match for Bond which is something that we rarely see. Support: Pedro Armendariz really shines as Bond's Turkish counterpart Karim Bey. He has a real likability that makes you warm to the character quickly. He brings plenty of charm to proceedings and throughout the film it is made clear that he has a large amount of respect for Bond. Bernard Lee is enjoyable once again as M. Action: There's plenty of exciting action scenes here. The truly brutal train fight between Bond and Grant remains one of the series best. Every blow looks like it hurts and the sloppy aggressiveness makes you think that's what a fight to the death would be like, while the dark lighting only adds to the atmosphere wonderfully. The shootout at the gypsy camp is a good set-piece, while the climax has both a North By Northwest inspired helicopter attack and a battle on a lake that are both very entertaining.Score: John Barry delivers another excellent score. He varies his sound a little more and creates some really memorable melodies. He is a composer that knows what is needed for certain scenes, he is always spot on at building tension or being the backdrop to some thrilling action parts.Production Values: As said one of the films strongest aspects is its tone. This feels like a pure spy film and crafts the perfect atmosphere for that, only The Living Daylights would come close to having the same feel. Young's direction is again quite simple and it works to the films advantage, drawing the audience into this adventure. Istanbul looks beautiful on screen and the scenes on board the Orient Express have a real elegance to them, very little blue screen work is done and even when it is it looks pretty realistic. The editing and pacing is very impressive too, despite a lot of dialogue heavy scenes the film never gets boring or feels like its rushing important areas. We also get the first involvement of Blofeld too.Conclusion: From Russia with Love is easily one of the best films in the whole series. I think it is the grounded tone that makes it such a pleasing piece and gives it something of a unique edge, this is Bond in pure spy mode. Every key area of the film is done to near perfection as Connery is terrific, Romanova is interesting, the villains are memorable and the action is simply outstanding. Even the quite straight-forward story is really engaging and keeps things moving along an enjoyable pace. This is Bond at its most real and most daring, keeping things gritty whilst giving the audience the all-out action that it craves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best James Bond Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is the best Bond film. Sean Connery is the best Bond. There are many pretty Bond girls, but Daniela Bianchi is beautiful. The locations - Istanbul primarily, and on the Orient Express are fabulous. The plot is based on a real conflict - that between the West and the Soviet Union. The movie captures the Cold War vibe. Lotte Lenya, Vladek Sheybal (who I have only seen in one other movie - Women In Love) and Robert Shaw are great villains. The scene at the gypsy camp is exotic and the belly dance is great. It's a classic.So is the fight on the train. That fight has to be one of the most realistic movie fights ever. And, it's so well-choreographed. I love it!Goldfinger is generally thought to be the best Bond film. I can understand why some think so. It captures the mood of confidence that embodied the early 60s. And Sean Connery is very sexy and handsome in Goldfinger - probably his most handsome. The Goldfinger theme song is one of the best Bond songs. But, I feel that From Russia With Love tops Goldfinger as being a classic and realistic spy movie, which is what Bond is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Bonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's so especially great about From Russia With Love is that it is a spy story. SPECTRE plays a huge role but, for the most part, we have a tale of two countries on the brink of war and the spies doing the battles in the shadows. Bond goes Istanbul to steal a decoding device and save a Russian defector. It's obviously a trap and Bond knows it. The following two hours are a cat and mouse game between Bond and SPECTRE as war threatens the future of mankind.What I like is that this movie isn't as action centric. We get time to see Bond and the other characters as humans and when the action does happen, it's grand and exciting. Romanova is an interesting female lead while Connery again shines as Bond.It's hard to say much about From Russia With Love that hasn't been said before. It's a terrific film, Bond fan or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia With Love Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the midst of the Cold War, it's inevitable that they'd send James Bond on some kind of mission that would pit him against the Soviets. In his second official film, the man goes to even more exotic locations with even bigger stakes, in a spy adventure that would set even more trends for future films to follow.The film starts off rather dry - a collection of standard scenes where Bond gets his mission and jets to Instanbul. Even then, these scenes are pretty eye-catching, and fans will geek out at seeing Q and the members of SPECTRE for the first time. In the film's last act, however, a bunch of huge twists emerge, and it becomes one thrilling action scene after another. There is a pretty neat train fight, followed by the characters being run down by a helicopter, followed by an explosive boat chase, and just when everybody seems safe, there's one more henchman to fight. It adds up to a complete and satisfying action film.The story always felt rather random to me throughout the first half, but the second half pulls out some interesting twists that put it in a pretty neat perspective, and helps keep the film in line with others in the series. A few conventions are introduced that will carry over in future films, such as the introduction of gadgets, and having one final fight scene before the credits roll. Overall, the film is a pretty twisty thriller with plenty of action, but it's still well-grounded and satisfying.This film is crafted with good-looking photography and editing. Sean Connery continues to excel as James Bond. Pedro Armendáriz shows exceptional dedication to his role (he was battling cancer at the time of shooting). Daniela Bianchi and Tatiana Romanova look great in their roles and are quite playful in their roles. Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw are good villains we love to hate. I think the script could have been more focused, but parts of it are really good. This production uses good, real-looking sets, props, and costumes. John Barry's music score is decent.From Russia With Love is one of the essential classics in the series, and it deserves to be seen at least once.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Bond-wagon' really starts to roll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people think that 'Dr No' is the best Bond film. Yes, it was the first and therefore the most original. But I found that it was really just the 'opening bracket' for what was to come. In 'From Russia With Love' I felt that the (Connery-era) Bond was actually starting to get going.It has double the budget of Dr No and therefore feels like a much more grandiose. We have more action, more gadgets, more baddies and, of course, more women. Plus Connery himself seems more at ease with the character he's playing.Dr No felt distinctly low budget, whereas From Russia With Love feels a lot like the Bond that we're used to, i.e. big budget, explosive (and deliciously over-the-top) stunts and action. We're finally introduced to SPECTRE - a criminal organisation hell bent on causing trouble between the superpowers - who come up with a plan to pit the British against the Russians, involving a stolen coding machine and a beautiful Russian spy. Just as well Bond is on hand to sort it all out.This is one of the rare Bonds that is pretty much liked by everyone. It's got a great plot which weaves and twines nicely, but stays understandable at all times. The villains are not just wonderfully evil, but also memorable and there is enough action to put it up there with the best of them.But, best of all, it doesn't take itself that seriously, making it the Saturday afternoon film which the current (Daniel Craig) Bond films just will never be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a series where super villains concoct ludicrously convoluted plans to conquer the world, you got to love an entry where the whole mission is focused simply on killing 007 (disgracing him in the process) and the climax is about two brutes beating the crap out of each other in a dark train cabin. The characters involved in this terse action scene are James Bond (Connery, cementing in this film his reputation as the best 007) and Red Grant (Robert Shaw as a refreshingly no-nonsense antagonist).This minimalism becomes an asset - to make an exciting spy thriller you don't need to burn on screen in crashed Lamborghinis the equivalent of the gross domestic product of a small country. From Russia with Love ratchets up the tension in a masterful way, with Bond, Russian agent Tatiana (lovely Daniela Bianchi) and local contact Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendáriz in a fine last performance) as unwitting pawns inexorably falling in the trap ready to spring for them on the Orient-Express.Memorable exotic locations (an eerie Istanbul), iconic moments (the poison-tipped shoe!) and a sharp script ("You may know the right wines, but you're the one on your knees!") for my favorite Bond movie ever.8,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of Bond adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10From Russia with Love is a Bond with style, grace and also the kind of action we love to see, yes Bond here is at his ever best and although the film has it's ridiculous parts, Connery assures us he is right for the job. With this film you also get an adventure, a large adventure spanning a continent and with some great location, and a train, Bond get's to see all around the place and meet some dastardly villains. Overall I felt it was solidly a good movie, some feel it is better than that but here below is why I felt it was solidly good.The story can be slow at parts but really does speed up once Bond get's into the mood of things, his charisma in this plot Is perfection and very few James Bond's really draw you into the character himself. It had it's mad moments with mad gadgets but still manages to entertain, it definitely isn't absurd as some of the future Bonds but still can have moments where you think "did that just happen?", look out for the periscope and you will see what I mean. I felt Bond here doesn't mind getting into fights and we finally see him get into some good old action of which I think we all want to see.Connery assures us in his part and although I do feel he maybe holds back on the humour he extrudes so much in this one, he still manages to have a calm temperament about him though and can be what we want from Sean's portrayal of Bond. I did like Robert Shaw as the assassin who's role and character was done in such a mysterious way that we really didn't know much at all about him, and neither did Bond meaning we were left with very little information about him as Bond met him.I said about the film's stunts which are pretty good and it's the action scenes that really bring this movie to life, one scene with boats is fantastically done and although you can tell the bombs are being set off by a studio team strategically, it still makes for a thrilling sequence which Bond has to negotiate. I felt Terence Young did a better job directing here than he did in Dr No because he brings much more thrills to the forefront and finally brings Bond out of his classy shell where he doesn't get up to fight much.The film has it's moments where the effects and stunts done are ridiculous and really can annoy you because they could have done it much better, although they never truly affect the films plot, they still serve to make this a near tongue in cheek Bond at times. I did also feel that the first part of this film dragged too long and in saying that also, whenever a new scene came around Bond would stay there for a long time as if the producers didn't want Bond moving quickly, it does seem Bond stays in Turkey for forever at the beginning and then suddenly leaves.Bond fans should love this again and with Goldfinger coming after this, the two Bond films could be classed as essential viewing for any Bond fanatic. I feel those who aren't as obsessed with Bond as many others are may dislike this and find it oddly boring as although it is full of action it is also slow and the story drags for a long time over and over. For anyone wanting an adventure watch this as this is to be fair a perfect example of Bond on a crime adventure and with the action added in too.Overall I give it a 7/10 meaning it is Solidly a Good movie and with room to grow possibly for those who love Connery's Bond. The film is a good one indeed and although my review might criticise it a lot, the movie is in fact very entertaining and brings even more to the screen that we love about Bond than many other Bonds do, a great job. I just want to add the plot Is quite smartly done and I won't ruin it but some parts are very intelligently done and carried out in a way that makes you feel Bond has some great skills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery returns as 007 in this second James Bond film, where it is the first of many featuring Russian spies or agents - either as antagonists or protagonists. Here, Bond falls into an assassination plot involving Russian beauty Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) so he could retrieve a Soviet encryption device that was stolen by the SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion (SPECTRE), the main terrorist organization lead by Bond's arch-rival, Ernst Blofeld.The crazy and non-stop action and adventures continue in this Bond outing, with the introduction of MI6 gadget wizard Major Boothroyd or 'Q' (Desmond Llewelyn). He provides an endless supply of gadgets and weapons to 007, helping him on his exciting adventures and attempting to foil SPECTRE's plot. Connery's suaveness, one-liners and wits continue in this epic film, and he uses his "License to Kill" attitude to battle bad guy after bad guy. Too bad he had to slap around some woman in this film; I thought that was a little overboard.Robert Shaw as villain Donald "Red" Grant proves to be a formidable opponent (but Shaw would later be made more famous in the movie "Jaws"). In addition, the part where Bond walks in and out of his hotel room, full dressed in his Bond "Look" while the 007's music theme is an iconic display of movie cinema! Overall, this is another classic and amazing Bond film.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond's Second Outing is Even Better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the massive international success of "Dr. No," audiences were clamoring for more of James Bond, so obviously, a sequel was put into the works. What audiences got was "From Russia with Love," a film that significantly improves on the previous film in a number of ways. Returning director Terence Young continues to develop the Bond formula here, building on a lot of what worked before, and polishing it to create a sequel that completely outshines its predecessor. This film does not the bombastic action flick that one might expect, even though the action sequences are really well done when they do come around. This is a much more tense, espionage spy thriller fueled by the Cold War tensions that were rife during the time "From Russia with Love" was made. The film's main theme perfectly fits the tone of the film, a constantly building ballad with Matt Monro's clear vocals that create a slow burn that leads to a richly satisfying conclusion.This time around, Bond is sent to Istanbul, Turkey, to obtain a Soviet encryption decoder and, by seducing a former Russian agent, bring it back to MI6. However, the criminal organization SPECTRE is constantly pulling the strings, lurking in the shadows all the while. It's a rather complicated plot, and is difficult to sum up here, but in the film, everything ties together and makes sense by the end. A number of cast members return from the previous film, such as Sean Connery as Bond, Bernard Lee as M, and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, and they all improve on their prior performances. Connery seems much more comfortable and charismatic here, but he never loses that cold, animalistic intensity. It's classic Bond, no question.However, we're also graced with one of the best casts of characters a Bond film could ask for. Daniela Bianchi makes for a great Bond girl as Tatiana, and Pedro Armendáriz is a joy to watch as Bond's ally in Turkey, Kerim Bey. The film also boasts a great assembly of villains, SPECTRE and henchmen alike. Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb is suitably sinister, and in their limited screen time, Vladek Sheybal's Kronsteen and Anthony Dawson's mysterious Blofeld manage to leave an impression. But the most memorable villain in the film, and possibly in the whole series, is Robert Shaw's Red Grant. Everything about him is great, the way he's constantly watching silently from the shadows. He's intimidating, he's a formidable foe for Bond, and Robert Shaw does a great job going toe to toe with Connery. That fight on the train with Bond and Grant is one of the most iconic action sequences not only in the film, but in the entire series. If this film is remembered for one scene, it should be that sequence with Bond and Grant on the train.The action is less frequent here, as the film takes a more spy thriller approach. There's a constant build of tension throughout the film that, despite being slow paced, keeps the film from ever feeling dull. That doesn't mean there isn't enough action here, though, because the action is really well shot and choreographed. As I've already gushed about, the fight sequence on the train is a master class in film action. The movie is also notable for John Barry's score, which developed the trademark Bond sound that would remain as a mainstay for the rest of the series."From Russia with Love" is a masterpiece. It's got its fair share of strange moments, such as the scene at the gypsy camp, and it definitely shows its age, but like with "Dr. No," I can't fault it for that. So many defining elements of the series can be traced back to this entry, such as the stuff with MI6, the trademark Bond sound, the title songs, the cool gadgets that are a bit underplayed here, but still iconic, and of course, the iconic Bond himself in Connery's improved performance. It's a bit different from what you'd expect, but it's still got everything you could possibly want from a Bond film, in spades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not, on my first viewing of this sequel, I found it to be extremely disappointing and pretty dull stuff. Maybe it was because I was so enamored with Dr. No, but I didn't care for From Russia with Love at all. I decided to revisit this sequel a little while ago, and it's one of the smartest choices I've made in my life. It's not quite as entertaining as Dr. No, but it's an excellent movie in its own right. It has high levels of suspense, along with one of the greatest action sequences ever to be filmed in the finale, which involves a helicopter and one of the best fight scenes you'll ever see between Sean Connery &amp; Robert Shaw on a train. It's still amazing to this day. Any qualms? Well. I did find the middle section to be slightly plodding at times and fairly talky. It wasn't boring, but it just moved a little too slow for my liking. Other than that, I have nothing to carp about what so ever. Sean Connery is excellent as usual as James Bond. Robert Shaw isn't a favorite of mine, but I admit he was fantastic as the lead villain here. He's definitely one of the best Bond villains. Daniela Bianchi is a very pretty Bond girl, and I enjoyed her show for the most part. She had good chemistry with Connery. Lotte Lenya is infamously spoofed in the Austin Powers movies for her classic performance here as Rosa KlebbFinal Thoughts: It's amazing what second viewings can do for you sometimes.

		<shortDescription>One of the best James Bond adventures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of Dr. No at the hands of James Bond, the evil SPECTRE organization devises a plan for revenge by baiting the British secret service with a decoding device called the Lektor that they've wanted to get their hands on for a long time. Knowing full well that they're being lead into a trap, they send James Bond to meet up with a defecting Russian agent named Tania Romanova. As James Bond searches for the Lektor he must fight off SPECTRE agents who are trying to kill him at every turn.Once again, just like Dr. No, this is a James Bond film that shows how James Bond should be. Once again the film focuses more on plot than action, and keeps the one liners and over the top comedic scenes to a minimum. Connery once again plays Bond to perfection, portraying him as a ruthless secret agent with nothing on his mind but getting the job done. The plot to this film is much more exciting than Dr. No, and offers a few more exciting action sequences, so the movie doesn't drag as much. In this film we are introduced to Q branch, and James Bond receives his first real gadget. A briefcase that shoots bullets, contains a collapsible sniper rifle, and sprays tear gas if opened by anyone except Bond. We are also introduced to Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of the evil SPECTRE organization, though we don't see his face. This film also includes one of the most exciting hand-to-hand combat sequences in a Bond movie when James Bond fights SPECTRE agent Red Grant, played menacingly by Robert Shaw, on board a train.Even though this film drags less than Dr. No, some parts do drag slightly, but not enough to turn you off of the film. One thing this film lacks is a discernible villain. Bond only fights two SPECTRE agents while Blofeld sits on the sidelines through all of the film. This doesn't hurt the movie, but it leaves it quite open ended. Overall, a very good sequel and one of the best entries into the James Bond franchise.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Connery's Personal Favorite; I Could not Agree More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bond nation may consider "Goldfinger" the pinnacle of the series, but "From Russia with Love" beats, by many lengths, the other five Bond movies starring Sean Connery. It progresses more slowly than most of its successors. During this time, the movie builds its tension like a mason, one brick at a time. A long period of time passes with no action while the plot moves relentlessly towards an electric finish. Unlike "Dr. No," "From Russia with Love" tells an involving story. More importantly, the payoff does not disappoint. We are generously rewarded for our patience with four classic action scenes.The first is especially notable. James Bond (Sean Connery) and Donald Grant (Robert Shaw) engage in a close-quarters brawl inside a dual compartment on the Orient Express. I mention in my reviews of "GoldenEye" that the Bond-Jacques Bouvar fight that opens "Thunderball" is the series' best to that point. After re-watching these movies, my opinion has changed. On its own merits, this movie's showcase fight is superior. The wild fencing battle in "Die Another Day" remains at the top of the list, followed by: this movie's Orient Express fight, Bond vs. Janus in "GoldenEye," Bond vs. Bouvar, Bond's battle in Osato's office from "You Only Live Twice," the hotel room brawl in "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," and the stairwell combat in "Casino Royale." Bond's cargo net encounter with Necros in "The Living Daylights" and his showdown with Oddjob are too unique to be evaluated on the same scale.Despite the constricted space, director Terence Young manages to clearly and effectively portray what transpires in those adjoining rooms. When he chooses to make a cut, he does so in the middle of a motion so that nothing is missed. More importantly, he makes those cuts without needing to repeat part of the strike. Bond and Grant force each other into the adjacent room many times. When that happens, Young starts with a shot containing both men and then cuts to a view of one soaring backwards. His choice of angles captures the action in tense and fascinating ways. He amplifies the intensity with many close-up shots. In them, he uses the environment to his advantage. The camera can remain practically still without losing either of the combatants. The fight took three weeks to film because Young did not settle for almost-spectacular. He fully understood that the most proficient way to photograph action is to let the quality of the production speak for itself.The quality is extremely high. Both Connery and Shaw look convincing and lethal every second of their grand struggle. Sean Connery's hair is messed up after the fight is over; I love that. Bob Simmons, who choreographed Bond action at the time, was the Vic Armstrong of his day. It introduced a new level of violence, and the audiences responded with pleasure. The other three scenes, while not possessing the same potential, are made with comparable flair.SPECTRE, which employed Dr. No in the previous 007 movie, returns as the evil organization. Ernst Stavro Blofeld (voice of Erich Pohlmann) orchestrates a sting operation targeting James Bond. He entrusts this operation to Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya). Under her orders, Soviet consulate worker Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) offers the British a Soviet decoder. Her co-operation has one condition; James Bond must be the person to help her defect. Meanwhile, Grant stalks him and awaits the proper time to deal his deathblow.In Turkey, Bond works with Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendáriz), arguably his most interesting ally. Bey develops a unique rapport with James. Few of Bond's other companions could say, "My friend you're not using this," while tapping the head. Bey not only gets away with it, but Bond finds his light criticism amusing. When I heard Kerim declare, "I have had a particularly interesting life," I laughed because I had come to know him so well.In 20 other movies, nobody has matched the performance Sean Connery gives here. He can be caring as a loving husband or so enraged he can brutalize a helpless woman. Sean displays a lot of affection towards Bianchi. He buys several expensive dresses for her and holds her with a tenderness we do not normally see. All this time, Connery keeps it clear that James is not in love with Tatiana. Connery's James is the most business oriented here, and Sean gives his most serious performance. His every reaction is completely believable. When he smiles in awe at a belly dancer, prepares to pull the trigger with approaching strangers in his crosshairs, bemusedly teaches Romanova about their cover, and angrily jerks a door open; we see elite adeptness at non-verbal acting. Connery's finest moments come during the final conversation between James and Grant. I like all of the actors who have played Bond, but this performance may never be matched.All of the SPECTRE characters are created well. After Connery, Lenya contributes the standout performance. During her meeting with Romanova, she makes highly inappropriate physical evaluations of her. Lenya uses abrupt speech, flaring eyes and angry eyebrows to endow Klebb with a scary level of authority and sincerity. On the other end, she treats Blofeld with utter respect. She must answer to him when their project begins to fail. At this time we see how quickly she can be humbled. It is an unselfish performance by Lenya since her own beauty far exceeded Klebb's."From Russia with Love" contains more outstanding acting than any other Bond movie. It is never boring, but the somewhat slow pace works against it. That minor fault prevents many people in my generation from seeing its great accomplishments. This probably is the most artistically successful of the Bond movies. The only reason more satisfying ones have been made is because the producers had superior resources.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If 'Dr. No' set the table for the franchise, 'From Russia' skipped right to the main course. Easily one of the best films in the series, and Connery's finest Bond vehicle, 'Russia' proved that 007 was indeed the world's greatest secret agent. Later sequels would add gadgets and gimmicks, 'Goldfinger' the penultimate example, but no films were as gritty and Spy caper worthy as 'Dr. No' and 'From Russia..'.A 'Hunt for Red October' before it's time, 'From Russia..' mixed the Cold War paranoia with suave and sophistication, handling the chaos of the world in fistacuff ease.Connery versus Robert Shaw's Red Grant on the Orient Express, is still considered one of the best fight scenes in the franchise history, never mind on film.Before S.P.E.C.T.R.E. gave us too much Blofeld, 007 was upsetting their plans in style, with very little gadgets, a few guns and a whole lotta' girls. This film epitomizes Bond epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BOND#2: With the Lektor on a Train to Doom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MASTER PLAN: steal the Russians' decoding machine and blame Bond for the whole mess. Due to editor Hunt's innovations, we end up with the first pre-credits teaser here, a dark play on the death always hovering around Bond, and then into the ever more surreal credits. The fact that this is a sequel to "Dr.No" is emphasized by bringing the sinister organization SPECTRE into the forefront (it was mentioned briefly in the previous film, towards the climax) and even mentioning the killing of the dastardly Dr.No during the planning to get some payback against Bond. Despite the misleading teaser sequence, the heroic secret agent doesn't really appear until 18 minutes in, following all the preparatory scheming by the villains. Check out SPECTRE's training facility - a modern school for assassins/gladiators - intense! Bond first appears with the same girl he first bedded near the start of "Dr.No" and she was removed from future Bonders for obvious reasons: Bond can't have a regular girlfriend. Then we get the now-familiar scenes with Moneypenny, M and Q (first played by actor Llewelyn here), who contributes a fancy briefcase in this one. Bond's entrance into Moneypenny's den is probably the most amusing of the series and the subsequent briefing is great, as usual.The plan of the villains is fairly complex and relies more on traditional espionage than any of the future films. There's no grand plan for world domination, let alone setting events into motion which would effect a large section of the world. Bond's mission takes him to Istanbul in this one, where he is to meet a supposed defecting Russian agent (Bianchi) and steal a special decoding machine of the Russians. It's all a plot of SPECTRE's to mess up both the Soviets and the free world at the same time - it doesn't sound all that thrilling for a typical Bond fan, but for those into actual spy games and bottomless intrigue, this is in some ways a pinnacle of the Bond oeuvre. The master villain is partially revealed as SPECTRE-head Blofeld, seen only from the neck down, stroking his white cat, but he employs top agents #3 (an actual Soviet defector, played memorably by actress Lenya) and #5 (a chessmaster) to carry out the logistics. All this is wonderfully atmospheric for fans of wild, weird villainy and would be repeated in future films, such as "Thunderball." SPECTRE agent#3, also known as Rosa Klebb, is the de-facto main villain here, doing the actual field work for the plan, and no one would soon forget her. There are even undertones of lesbianism in her scenes with the femme fatale and main Bond girl, unthinkable in those days, copying the more blatant descriptions in Ian Fleming's novel.Connery's 2nd outing as Bond is, if possible, even more assured and professional than his first. He seems a bit more relaxed and there are especially fine, evocative scenes of him becoming friends with the Kerim Bey character, his contact in Istanbul, and becoming familiarized with the new locale (great location shooting). Just when things seem to be going along as a standard mission, we get a gypsy girl fight. Then we're on the train, the sequence which springs to mind for most of us when this Bond film is brought up. As Red Grant, actor Shaw played the first of those steel-muscled henchmen of Bond infamy - the extra tough brawn to complement the villainous brains (Klebb and the chessmaster here). But Red isn't simply muscle; he's somewhat psychotic, possibly vain and more than a little in love with himself. Besides wanting to kill Bond, he wants Bond to suffer, to humiliate himself; it's an added element which will be lost in most of the future films involving the big fight to the death. Here, it adds a palpable sense of urgency and tension, not to mention the usual sadism. There's no doubt this film was influential on the entire spy genre of sixties cinema. And, Bond would return in "Goldfinger." Bond:10 Villains:10 Femme Fatale:7 Henchmen:10 Fights:10 Stunts/Chases:8 Gadgets:8 Locations:9 Pace:9 overall:9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPECTRE's revenge, well not quite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bond is back in From Russia with Love and Connery seems a little more comfortable in the role this time. James Bond has to battle against SPECTRE in a race to seize the Soviet Lektor decoding machine, and SPECTRE are out to avenge the death Dr. No, by trying to entrap him with the device.There is a really solid story here, it's a genuine espionage plot, a feat that has not been repeated in a Bond movie since. Of course there is the usual sprinkling of beautiful women, bare fist fights and action that is woven into the story, but the main drive here is the spy theme and the tension, not the action that we are all used to seeing in the later films.It's definitely not my favourite Bond movie, but it's does still stand alone in many respects, one of them being the first appearance from 'Q' although he's not known as 'Q' just yet.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia with Love lacks the shine of its fellow Bond-films but is definitely memorable as a movie more true to the literary nature of Bond. The film has an excellent cast and plenty of interesting moments. The story is very low-key but exciting enough that it doesn't drag on.The Filming locations this time around create a great atmosphere. The action-scenes are consistent and not too flashy. Connery still delivers his witticism with style, but retains a human character, the like yours truly is used to.Also, most of the special-effects of the time were smooth and the film has a nice and clean look to it. The only real problem is that since we've come to expect so much bigger from Bond the film may seem rather petite. Nonetheless it is a great experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel worthy to be a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with the James Bond saga is that there are so many films in the series, that not all of them a going to be hits. From Russia with Love, which is the 2nd film in series send James Bond, played again by Sean Connery is sent to Istanbul and joins forces with Kerim Bay and Tatiana Romanova against the SPECTRE organisation. The film is longer this time and included an improved story, better action and non-stop fun and excitement.The story is basically a battle between MI6 and SPECTRE to gain a LEKTOR decoder. This films show the foreign stars are definitely stars. Daniela Bianchi, although not providing her real voice gave a good performance as the series second bond girl. Vladek Sheybal and Lotte Lenya gave wonderful portrayal's as SPECTRE criminals Kronsteen and Rosa Klebb. Walter Gotell, who also returned as General Gogal from The Spy Who Loved Me to The Living Daylights, also gave a good performance as Morenzy. Robert Shaw brought to life one of the best henchman, as he played the hard as nails Donald 'Red' Grant. All the MI6 cast were back. Bernard Lee placed M back into the office, with Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny. The new addition to the headquarters was Desmond Llewelyn as the quartermaster, otherwise known as 'Q'. This was the start of a long journey for the actor, who would portray Q in every film (with the exception of Live and Let Die) up to The World is not Enough. He died shortly after the release.John Barry provided an excellent score again. There was the addition of the '007' theme which was featured in a 4 other Bond films. Matt Monro gave a wonderful romantic rendition of the title song. An improvement this time, is the decrease if the James Bond theme used. It was used too much in Dr No, and was used just about the right amount of time. The title sequence continued the tradition as the opening credits was projected onto a belly dancer. A special tradition take place for the first time in this film, which is still continuing to today. The inclusion of a pre-credit sequence. This film includes a gripping confrontation of Red Grant and 'James Bond'. The action is on a larger scale this time with everything from diving out the way from an helicopter, to speeding across water in a speedboat, to preventing a poison tip shoe from striking him.The is one of the better ones of Sean Connery and should be checked out. James Bond will return in 'Goldfinger'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before the 007 series degenerated into a routine series of endless gadgets, explosions and clichés came this early outing which didn't strictly adhere to the soon-to-be-familiar formula with our hero more prone to using his noddle rather than simply relying on guns &amp; hardware. Connery is at his best here with a performance far edgier &amp; grittier than seen in Goldfinger before falling into auto-pilot mode from Thunderball onwards. The Rogues Gallery from FRWL is one which I don't think has been surpassed in a Bond outing. Vladek Sheybal as Kronsteen exudes evil as a chess grandmaster-cum-Spectre agent despite being a dead ringer for Buster Keaton. Lotte Lenya is superb as a despicable ogre of a Russian colonel who finds herself being attracted to our heroine Tatiana Romanova ( delightfully played by Daniela Bianchi). However, without any doubt the star of the show is Robert Shaw as Donald 'Red' Grant. This is one mean dude who poses a formidable threat to 007 without having to rely on gimmicks such as a false hand or a razor-brimmed bowler hat. Mention is certainly deserved for Pedro Armendariz who provided more than able support as Kerim Bey, Bond's charismatic ally.The screenplay is more deliberately paced than in later epics with far fewer stunts and explosions than usual which I'm sure won't go down too well with a lot of today's popcorn-munching audience. Of course the film HAS dated somewhat and the pace does lag on occasions but I still find this infinitely preferable to the juvenile, circus-like antics of Goldfinger.I remember reading a few years ago that From Russia With Love was apparently the last film John F. Kennedy ever watched, having viewed it the night before heading off to Dallas. Not a bad choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how FROM RUSSlA WITH LOVE rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: FROM RUSSlA WITH LOVE: Cute, real cute. But it also captures that blend of the kinky yet romantic mood of Cold War intrigue, at least as it is defined in the movies. 8 out of a possible 10 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: "Oh, my god, they've killed James Bond!" Yeah, right. Nice fake out. 6 points. Opening Credits: Maurice Binder cleverly has the credits projected on the gyrating torso of an attractive young lady. The halter top looks rather silly, but you can make whatever you wish out of the symbolism of projecting the distorted images of art and commerce on the naked flesh of an objectified woman. 7 points. Theme Song: Matt Monro sings a gooey pop ballad about "my tongue-tied young pride/ Would not let my love for you show/ In case you'd say no." Are we talking about James Bond here? It's an okay song, but somehow just not right for a Bond film. 4 points. "Bond, James Bond": Instant fame and international stardom generated by DR. NO allows Sean Connery the self confidence to flash that million dollar smile and strike a cocky attitude. He now gets Bond and the film establishes the character as someone who doesn't take all the killing and violence too seriously. There's now more than just grim determination; behind Bond's cool facade Connery displays intelligent wit. 9 points. Bond Babes: As pseudo-defector Tatiana Romanova, Daniela Bianchi offers a good alternative to NO's Ursula Andress. Bianchi isn't exactly an intellectual here, but she isn't raw sexuality either. 7 points. Bond Villain: Technically, the head honcho is Blofeld, though the famed cat fancier remains largely unseen here. Thus, the wonderful Lotte Lenya as the infamous Rosa Klebb is allowed to make her mark in the Bond Rogues Gallery of villains. She's a mean, feisty little troll of a woman, whose fashion sense leans toward lesbian dowdy. Definitely not a Bond Babe, but she no doubt gives Bond more kicks than a dozen bimbo beauties. 10 points. Bond Baddies: As the cold, unemotional assassin Donald Grant, Robert Shaw just might set the standard for all cold, unemotional assassins. It takes a certain talent to display no emotions and yet get across the point. He moves through the film with a wonderful sense of menace; the only complaint being that his confrontation with Bond is a bit too brief. 8 points. Plot: In a vague scheme to heat up tension between East and West, Bond is duped into smuggling some sort of decoding device across Europe -- though the real mystery is why he just doesn't put it in a box and mail it. Of course, then he'd miss all the scenery outside the Orient Express and passing time with Tanya inside. And the Orient Express is a nice nostalgic touch for a series that can get pretty high tech. 7 points. Production values: A bigger budget -- and a clearer idea about what the series should be like -- helps FROM RUSSlA WITH LOVE make a quantum leap in the right direction. The Bond taste for international intrigue and globetrotting, albeit lethal, is sightseeing that gives the film a greater sense of style and more aloof sense of humor. 8 points. Bonus Points: He doesn't get to do much, but Desmond Llewellyn makes his first appearance as Major Boothroyd, a.k.a., "Q." 5 points. Summary: In many ways, this is really the first real James Bond film as it sets the tone for the adventure and establishes the formula for most of the Bond films to follow. Bond-o-meter Rating: 81 points out of a possible 100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time,before Ian Fleming's death,the movies used to follow -roughly- the books.But of course they (the novels ) were watered -down. My favorite chapter was the scene in Rosa Klebb's office :Tatiana is intrigued to know why her boss has sent for her;she's asked very indiscreet questions about her(very) private life and she's offered a chocolate she finds hard to swallow (Fleming's depiction is priceless).But the second part of the chapter was totally ruled out by the scenarists: Klebb puts on a hideous negligé and makes advances to scared Tatiana ...who takes to her heels.The poor girl thinks her final hour has come,but nothing happens.Lotte Lenya is an excellent Rosa Klebb,she's exactly as Fleming wanted her to be ,even if she does not show her lesbian side.Daniela Bianchi is a gorgeous Bond girl.Martine Beswick,who would play a small part (Paula Caplan) in "Thunderball" plays one of the wrestling gypsies.Robert Shaw is one of the best villains of the series.And of course Sean Connery will remain the best Bond of all time.All the other ones cannot hold a candle to him.At the time,the Bond were getting better and better since "Russia" was superior to "Dr No' and is ,IMHO,itself inferior to "Goldfinger".It was not to last.</fullReview>

During his mission, he falls in love with this agent and she defects. Baddies from SPECTRE are sent after Bond to try and kill him, but as usual don't succeed.Highlights of this movie include the train journey, boat chase and the battle at the gypsy camp. Bond has with him a very lethal briefcase and one of the SPECTRE villains, a woman wears very lethal shoes with spikes.Sean Connery is great as Bond and is joined by Robert Shaw, Daniela Bianchi and regulars Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn.From Russia With Love is a must for all Bond fans.

Pedro Armendariz (Kerim Bay), a wonderful actor who had cancer and did himself in after this film was always a welcome presence in many films for many years. You knew after this one that Mr. Bond would never live up to the potential PLOTS (script-wise) that this series would offer in the future, although GOLDFINGER &amp; THUNDERBALL are wonderful movies, the gadgets and stories would have to become dumb-downed to keep the bucks flowing in.

		<fullReview>A good film in the spirit of reliance on actors' ability versus stunts and gadgets that plaque the rest of the series. Connery has a brooding and sinister presence as Bond. I recall the look he gives the bug hidden behind the picture in his hotel room as he backs away from it. Really mean! Villain Robert Shaw as Grant is an excellent foil to Connery as he has a definite screen presence as well. The knockout blow he gives to Bond on the train with the butt of his gun was pretty convincing! I think he really hurt Connery! Daniela Bianchi as Tonya is a very attractive companion for Bond (although I disapprove of Bond backhanding her across the face on the train)and Pedro Armendariz is instantly likable as Kerim Bey. One of his best lines is when he sees Tonya in her nightie: "Charming...charming!" His better line was to Bond: "Ahh, the old game: give a wolf a taste and then keep him hungry. My friend, she's got you dangling." The cinematography is great too showing vistas of Istanbul, Russia and England. One of the best duels between Bond and a villain was in this film as Bond and Grant fight in a train compartment. Interesting to note that there is no action music while this is going on. Just the sound of them scuffling and the train in motion. Very suspenseful! The movie itself seems to pride itself on 'taking it's time' as it build suspense through subtle devices. Some of these are the slow footsteps Grant takes at the beginning of the film while stalking 'Bond' during a Spectre exercise, the time it takes the character Kronsteen to look up at a messenger and back down again with his bulbous eyes, and Grant's relaxed interrogation of Bond on the train. A film that I'm sure Ian Fleming was proud of as it remained fairly true to his book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is the 2nd James Bond movie in the James Bond movies. This one was made in 1963, starring of course the great Sean Connery. I did enjoy this movie as i did like what was put into it. I think Sean Connery is great and is the best bond ever because he was the one that started it all when James Bond began with the first ever james bond movie Dr No in 1962. Sean connery did other james bond movies including Dr No, From Russia with love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You only live twice, and Dimonds are forever. He finished being james bond in 1971, Roger Moore took over his place in 1973 and began to continue making more james bond movies, Sean Connery came back as james bond in 1983, witn a one off special. Never say never again was his last ever james bond movie and i thought really this spolit his last movie in 1971. Overall i give from russia with love 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia With Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most sophisticated Bond movie. Most of the later movies played up on the camp value. Don't get me wrong, I love nothing more than the sometimes cheesy elements that were so prominent later in the Bond series. I mean, Moonraker is one of my favourites. I have to say, though, it's nice when watching From Russia With Love to see the sophistication and class showing through above one-liners and action. This is the most respectable Bond movie. It has a simple plot. Bond's life is the thing at stake here, not the world. Bond's mission is nothing more than an elaborate trap set up by SPECTRE, the criminal organization that would be the focus of most of the 60s movies. You get the introduction of Blofeld, in a very discreet form. Why is it that the image of a villain stroking a cat had so much more effect than actually seeing him? I will now go through my opinions on some of the standard 007 elements that make all the movies so great.BOND- Connery gives the best dramatic performance as Bond here. The humor is toned down, but Bond's confidence is what really sells in this movie. More so than in Dr. No, Connery is believable as a secret agent that can do anything, and never lose his cool.VILLAIN- Red Grant is an interesting villain, because his role is actually that of a henchman. He still remains the most intimidating villain there has been. Robert Shaw is also probably the best actor to ever play a villain in the Bond series. The scene on the train with Bond is an impressive moment for Shaw. It's more than 5 minutes long with nothing but dialogue, and it's the most exciting part of the movie. Shaw knew exactly how to play a villain well. He made him more intelligent than he was scary, thus making him scarier. Red Grant was also the only villain that I kind of wished would beat 007 in the end.FIGHT SCENE- It was made in 1963, and the fight scene between Bond and Grant has not been topped in any of the 18 movies since. It's fast and agressive. These guys fight dirty, and that's what makes it so much fun to watch. Peter Hunt has to be credited as the innovator of movie action. His editing style created the technique that is now almost a requirement of any action movie.FINAL ACTION SEQUENCE- It's Bond's life at stake here, not the fate of the world. That brings the climax to a level that's easier to relate to as a viewer. What I really like about the final action sequence of From Russia With Love is that it's totally different from what the Bond formula became. Almost all the other movies take place in one huge location. You get lots of explosions and the set is destroyed. In From Russia With Love it all takes place outdoors. There's more realism to it. And how can you not enjoy a chase scene with helicopters and boats?Final Comments. The theme song is one of my favourites. The only gadget used, the attache case, is cooler than any remote control, invisible, or underwater car. Tatiana is one of the best female characters the series has had. Rosa Klebb is maybe the most sadistic henchman/woman, and she's sadistic while looking like a middle aged librarian from Omaha. And Terence Young did the best job ever as a Director in the Bond series. One and only flaw in the whole movie is the terrible rear projection shot, which is the last shot of the movie. Even in 1963 that would have looked poor. But who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The apex of the Bond series...so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is rightly considered the apex of the Bond series. The plot was grounded in Cold War reality, Connery was in his prime, the Bond girl though perhaps a step down from Dr. No, was nevertheless in the top tier, and the action especially the fight on the train seemed grounded in the realm of plausability. I agree that the helicopter sequence was no doubt inspired by Hitchcock's North by Northwest. From this point onward the series seems to rely more on stunts and gadgets than an engaging story. But this one rates a 9/10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Connery in one of the best bond-movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery is playing bond for the second time in this exciting and action-filled masterpiece. It's one of the more realistic bond-movies and you get a feeling for the cold war conflict between the Western world and the Soviet union. I like the fact that in this film 007 is an agent and not some kind of action hero who kills 100:s of villains in order to save the world from some capitalistic maniac (I don't like the later bond-movies that much). But don't worry, Bond it's still the same "old chap" with cleaver comments, the spark in the eye and some gagets as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Bonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSI first saw From Russia with Love when I was 14, and like many other people I thought it was boring and slow, certainly compared with other Bond films that I had seen. Watching it again recently, however, I completely changed my mind, so much so that I now regard FRWL as the greatest film in the franchise, and the standard against which all the Bonds should be measured.Ironically, the main reason the film is so good is because it is so different from most Bond films. The plot, which I believe follows Ian Fleming's novel closely, involves real espionage and gripping tension, as SPECTRE try to trap and kill Bond by luring him to Istanbul to collect a valuable Russian encoding device. This set-up is probably the most plausible of any Bond film, and the tension mounts deliciously as OO7, knowing he is probably walking into a trap, collects the machine and begins his journey home on the Orient Express, where he is forced into brutal hand-to-hand combat with SPECTRE assassin Red Grant. The build-up to this fight is probably the most suspenseful section of any film in the series.As well as a tight plot, the film boasts a superb cast. In his second appearance as Bond, Sean Connery is totally at ease in the role, turning in an even more impressive performance than he did in Dr No. Once again, Connery portrays Bond as a human being, someone who can be scared as well as ruthless but has the gift of finding ways out of seemingly hopeless situations. Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw, who play the villains Rosa Klebb and Red Grant, establish themselves firmly as two of the most memorable and formidable enemies Bond ever encounters, and Pedro Armendariz provides sterling support as Bond's ally Kerim Bey, in a performance made all the more poignant by the fact that he was terminally ill during filming. Daniela Bianchi is a perfectly acceptable Bond girl, and Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell return as M and Moneypenny respectively. Also, Desmond Llywellyn makes his first appearance as Q, a part he would continue to play for the next 36 years. In keeping with the realistic tone of the film, the only gadget Q gives Bond is a briefcase containing several useful devices, which OO7 naturally makes good use of. One other thing FRWL proves is that a Bond film does not need loads of fancy gadgets to be good.Technically, the film is superb. Terence Young directs with aplomb, the locations are very atmospheric and well-shot, and Peter Hunt's remarkable editing helps to make the brutal train fight the most realistic and remarkable in the whole Bond series. The film, which was only of course the second Bond movie, also introduces now familiar features like the pre-credit sequence (one of the best), and the theme song, here performed by Matt Monero. We are also introduced for the first time to Bond's arch-enemy Blofeld, though here we don't get to see his face.In summary, FRWL is a gripping, stylish film which does not let gadgets and one-liners get in the way of telling a good story, and telling it well. Sadly, most subsequent Bond films have tried to ape the blueprint of Goldfinger rather than FRWL, taking OO7 further and further into the realms of fantasy. FRWL proves conclusively that Bond works just as well, indeed better, if he is taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is my favourite Bond movie. This movie has great locations, good acting, action and suspense. However, FRWL's best feature is the story. Unlike modern "by the numbers" Bond films, FRWL doesn't have the meglomaniac villans, ridiculous gadgets and over the top action to cover holes in the plot. While the modern Bond films are still very entertaining, I think they just fall short of the mark set by FRWL when it comes to the story.Of course, FRWL also features Sean Connery, easily the best James Bond.IMHO, this is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives.

		<shortDescription>The first cold-war Bond adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Russia With Love" (1963) was the second James Bond movie starring Sean Connery as British special agent James Bond after "Dr. No" (1962), directed again by Terence Young. While "Dr. No" led James Bond to the mysterious shores of Jamaican islands, this adventure brought 007 to Istanbul, giving the spectators a first insight into the Turkish culture and locations before this country became a big tourist hit.It was also the first sign of a cold-war plot in a Bond movie. While Dr. No was a typical independent super villain trying to rule the world with secret weapons and weird philosophies, "From Russia With Love" took a much more realistic approach. The international villain's organization SMERSH with former Soviet officers wants to take revenge for the death of their member Dr. No. It is Bond's turn to get a secret Russian encoding machine and to make beautiful looking Tatiana falling in love with during their trip through Istanbul and Turkey, the Orient Express, England and Venice.German actress Lotte Lenya, the former wife of author Bertold Brecht, plays the lesbian, dominant Rosa Klebb, and Robert Shaw the sadistic henchman Grant. The second Bond girl after Ursula Andress in "Dr. No" was played by beautiful Daniela Bianchi. It was also the first appearance by Desmond Llewelyn as Q, giving a secret suitcase including portable gun, hidden gold coins and a knife to Bond.The whole movie is lush, colorful and fast-pacing, showing new production standards in the European cinema of the early sixties. There are brilliant highlights such as the settings of Istanbul, an escape through a subterranean labyrinth with thousands of rats, a cat fight and raid at a gypsy's camp and a motor boat chase. The most outstanding scene is the breathtaking fight between Bond and Grant in a narrow cabin of the Orient Express at night with never-seen camera angles and rapid-cut martial arts action before 007 strangles the killer with his own weapon, a watch with a disposable steel wire.The sound track was composed by young John Barry for the first time after his has written the famous James Bond Theme for "Dr. No" which is still credited to the first movie's composer Monty Norman due to contract reasons. Barry gives this movie the real elegant taste, with his seducing instrumental theme, a vocal version sung by Matt Monro during the final credits, the rousing "007" theme and lots of wonderful, exotic musical moments that are giving the real "Bond touch" to "From Russia With Love".All in all, the whole movie is battered with good ideas, entertainment, thrills and technical experiments and set the standard for all following Bond productions. It's also one of my favorite Bond movies and one of the best action films of the sixties!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always wondered why the gun-barrel sequence in the early Sean Connery Bond films starred Bob Simmonds rather than Connery himself; Connery filmed his first one for Thunderball. Anyway, after watching more recent Connery and Moore films I have to say that the gun-barrel sequence looks very dated and the opening music discordant. Also, some of the scenes in the film are edited carelessly.The Bond theme is prodigiously overused in this early adventure (maybe the producers wanted to leave their mark). Scenes where Bond is arriving at the hotel and just walking around are accompanied by the theme.The action scenes in this film are quite brutal- note Red Grant's strangling of "Bond" at the commencement, the implied death of the 00 agent in Zagreb and Grant's own death on the train. This differentiates the film from its successors. Nevertheless, the film has a credible and tight plot. From Russia With Love and Goldfinger represent Connery at his best. Thunderball was an overly ambitious, long, drawn-out, formulaic movie with Sean Connery just going through the motions. You Only Live Twice and Diamonds are Forever lacked the tight plot of From Russia With Love.From Russia With Love feels like a classic movie when you watch it. Which you must.</fullReview>

Sounds simple,but SPECTRE is trying to play the British into getting the machine for them. This is the Bond movie that relies less on in your face action and more on spy stuff. Bond has to use his wits if he wishes to escape Turkey the decoding device alive. He gets help from Kerim Bey, a wealthy man who does spy stuff for kicks. He also must get the help from Tatiana who thinks she is working for Russia, but is actually working for SPECTRE. Great villians abound in this flick too, as there is Rosa Kleb (who is the inspiration for the female villian in Austin Powers) and Robert Shaw who I never recognized but then reliazed it was him as a SPECTRE super soldier. The scenes on the train are great and unlike Dr. No this one has a really good finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most deadly serious in the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bond was a true spy in this movie, for the first and last time. More business and less fun-and-games, the way Ian Fleming envisioned his creation. Unfortunately, after this movie, the series became increasingly more farcical and gadget ridden.Not only did you believe that Sean Connery's Bond was a cold-blooded killer rather than a comic book superhero; but his enemies in this movie were believable villains that had to be taken seriously. And the most believable and deadly foe Bond has ever faced in all the series is Robert Shaw's Red Grant. There were no gimmicks or campiness about Red Grant, he was just a psychopathic killer with tremendous physical skills. In all the movies, you never really sensed that 007 was in any real danger....except when he was in that train compartment with Red Grant. Again, no gimmicks, just 2 cold-blooded killers facing off, with Bond on his knees &amp; Grant pointing a silenced gun ("....not until you crawl over here and kiss my foot"). And the next minute, the most realistic &amp; brutal fight sequence in all the Bond movies. James Bond slowly descended into camp and special effects after this movie, with the possible exceptions of OHMSS and License To Kill.It was fun seeing the great Lotte Lenya playing such a nasty character!</fullReview>

This however, stands up as a fine film in its own right. It has a good plot, and interesting supporting characters, something which is usually missing from a bond film, (though not at any great loss to their enjoyability.)Connery's follow-up performance to his almost effortless one in Dr.No is even better, strong, cold, businesslike, and yet still so susceptible to the emotions he feels towards both Tanya and Kerim. Probably the best performance as Bond in any of the 18 films so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering that FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is a 1963 movie and BOND movies a genre in itself, this DVD deserves the perfect 5.In DR. NO, the personage of James Bond was the motor of the movie. One year later, Terence Young, the director, was ready to present some interesting variants of the situations he created in DR. NO.So, the first twenty minutes of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE are a real pleasure for the film lover who sleeps in each one of us. Each scene is a subtile remake of the same scenes Terence Young shot one year before for DR. NO.Then, the movie is divided into three sections of approximately 30 minutes : ISTANBUL - THE TRAIN SCENES - THE FINAL CHASE. And it becomes obvious that the character of James Bond isn't the main object of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE as if all had already been said about him in DR. NO.The villains are the real stars of this movie ; sadistic, cruel, they aren't only appearances whose destiny is only to be shot by 007. Their motivations are explained, they play with BOND who's unable to understand he's manipulated since the beginning of his mission.Terence Young invites us to see what's behind the facts and shows us, in the first scene of the movie as well as in the last image of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, that cinema is the subject of his work.THE James Bond DVD you have to own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>007 is sent on a mission to recover the missing Lektor machine from a defecting Russian agent. The Lektor is an encryption machine that will give the British access to many Russian codes. However they don't know that the whole mission is a set-up by SPECTRE who plan to lure Bond to his death in revenge for his killing their best agent Dr No.As a child of the Moore era I have grown more with a Bond who is slightly tongue in cheek and surrounded by sexy girls with dirty names and lots of gadgets and action scenes. However this is the second Bond film where they were still to create all these elements as a formula. As a result this is a much better film than many of the Bonds. The plot is not to take over the world in an elaborate fashion but only to trap Bond and kill him. There are only a few action scenes and most of the film is driven by plot rather than stunts. This is refreshing as Bond is more of a person when he is in a plot rather than an action scene. There are weaknesses of course ? for example the sting operation is to kill bond but they seem to make it very hard for themselves (even keeping him alive at one point!?). But to be honest the depth of plot is a nice thing in a Bond movie.Connery is the definitive Bond ? some wit but mostly he's a gentleman spy without all the smut and innuendo Moore brought. The support cast are all good despite being the template for several Austin Powers characters, Bianchi is less sexy than many Bond girls but a much better character in fairness. The biggest surprise is a young Robert Shaw as a Russian agent ? he's actually pretty good. An amusing note in the film's credits is Blofeld with a ? instead of an actor's name.Overall this has a solid plot rather intrigues rather than leaping from one stunt to the next. The wit is there but it isn't overly camp or tongue in cheek. As a result this film, although more spy thriller than Bond movie, is one of the better Bond films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia with Love has been seen by many as the best Bond film and I can see why. When you analyse it, it's easy to see why; it ticks all the right boxes.Any film that closely follows an excellent book is bound to be a winner, and the book of the film is excellent; I was so engrossed I couldn't put it down. And once you start watching From Russia with Love, you feel the same.The plot of the film is complex, but told in a straightforward manner so that it's easy to follow. And the film features some of the most memorable characters in the series; Rosa Klebb and Red Grant are villains that stick in the memory, and Tatiana Romanova is one of the more believable Bond girls. The standout scene is undoubtedly the fight on the Orient Express; there's no exciting background music - the producers could have used the 007 theme ? however, they chose not to. This was a good move, because it would have lessened the impact.The title theme song, sung by Matt Monro, is one of the more romantic themes; while it could be argued that the best Bond themes were the more up-tempo songs, the theme song is as good as the rest.Overall, From Russia with Love is not only one of the best, if not the best, Bond film, but an excellent film in its own right and one that gets better on repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Russia With Love" is the second film in the EON series of James Bond. This film follows Bond attempting to obtain a decoding machine through an elaborate scheme involving a seductive Russian agent, a silent blond brute, and a fiesty Russian colonel-- timely cold war era spy thriller. Sean Connery in his second outing as Bond is at his most confident and sophisticated; providing the right cocktail of gritty action and subtle one- liners (and beating women, another timely element in the early films). Robert Shaw as the silent blond brute is the best acted henchmen in entire series (a subtle, psychotic, and brutal heavy) Lotte Lenya as the fiesty Russian colonel is truly chilling and menacing. The Bond girl was sexy (not the best but served well enough for the plot). Much like the previous film, Dr. No, the film is paced extremely well, with twice the scale--establishing the quintessential Bond formula (pre-title sequences, opening credits, introducing the villains, M's briefing at MI6, arriving at the airport, meeting the ally, etc.). On many levels, it is the perfect Bond film with the perfect amount of sophistication (a subtly executed plot, gritty action, real espionage) and escapism (gadgets, women, one-liners). The best of all time? That is still debatable. The timely elements such as Bond beating women and the whitewashed portrayals of ethnic Europeans can be slightly bothersome and some of the dubbing is a little out of sync. In spite of those minor inconveniences however, From Russia with Love is a natural successor to "Dr. No" and a must-see for audiences who want to enjoy the early films in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Finest Connery Bond Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love was the second official Bond film, starring Sean Connery and was released in 1963. The film features the criminal organisation SPECTRE and its leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, for the first time in a Bond film. The plot revolves around a Lector Decoding Machine, which has been promised to the British Secret Service if James Bond can go and bring it back to the UK, with the help of a Russian Cipher operative. SPECTRE is, of course, behind the whole thing, for revenge on Bond for killing Dr. No in the previous film.The cast is excellent for an early Bond film. Connery gives perhaps his most confident and assured performance as Bond. Newcomer Daniela Bianchi plays the Russian clerk who is supplying the machine and I have always thought she was very beautiful and perfectly cast. Seasoned actress Lotte Lenya plays head of SMERSH and agent for SPECTRE Rosa Klebbe and she portrays this part very effectively. There is an underlying hint of lesbianism in her character, which somehow managed to slip past the then very tight censors. British actor Robert Shaw, later to appear in Spielberg's Jaws in 1975, plays the main villain Donald "Red Grant" and I thought that he was one of the best early Bond villains. His character always carried an air of menace and his scenes are all excellent. Pedro Armendariz played Bond's ally in Turkey, Kerim Bey and his character carries great warmth and humour and I thought he had great chemistry with Sean Connery in their scenes together. The actor shot himself soon after this film was made, due to the fact that he had terminal cancer and didn't want to endure painful treatment for it. There are not a lot of action scenes in this film, but it does have some notable set-pieces, particularly the raid on the gypsy camp, the fight between Grant and Bond and the boat chase near to the end of the film. These are few, but they more than compensate for the lack of other, big action scenes.I have always enjoyed the film and I regard it as one of Connery's best and one of the best Bond films of the 1960s. It is not ruined by silly gadgets, the plot is involving and the film reeks class and quality. I much prefer this film to most of the silly Bond films from the 1970s, particularly most of the Roger Moore ones. Thank God that the Bond films from the 1980s were a bit more grounded and these are some of my favourites, with the exception of the childish A View To A Kill. That is the second worst of the Moore Bond films, though Moonraker eclipses it. Thank God for Timothy Dalton and the films that followed.I completely recommend From Russia With Love to any serious Bond fan, though modern audiences may find it a bit talky and slow. It is still a landmark Bond film, though and it always will be. It should be watched at least once by anyone interested in Bond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest of all the Bonds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Dr. No in 1962, EON Productions decided to adapt "From Russia with Love" as the 2nd Bond movie. Ian Fleming's 5th Bond novel had been held in such high regard, that even President John F. Kennedy listed it as one of his favorite books. The film proves to be a very down to earth, gritty spy thriller, a huge difference from its predecessor and follow up. Sean Connery gives his finest performance as 007. Everything he does in this movie is absolutely perfect, Robert Shaw also proves to be a very memorable villain, and the train fight in the cabin is one of the best fight scenes in film. The decision to stick close to Fleming's novel paid off in the end, as From Russia With Love is in its own league. Other films in the series (OHMSS, TSWLM, FYEO, TLD, GE, CR) try and replicate the intrigue this film has, and while they certainly did to an extant, they never really quite match the success of From Russia With Love, making it a very unique Bond movie. It's my personal favorite Bond flick, and one of if not my favorite film of all time. I give it a solid 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Let His Death Be A Particularly Unpleasant And Humiliating One"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When MI6 learns that a Soviet decoding machine known as the Lektor is up for grabs, James Bond is sent to Istanbul to steal it. He makes contact with a beautiful Russian woman known as Tatiana Ramanova who has fallen in love with him and wishes to defect. She is also willing to aid 007 in his theft of the Lektor in return for sanctuary in Britain. However, both are being used as unwitting pawns in an insidious scheme masterminded by SPECTRE. The evil crime syndicate has organised the ploy in order to bring about the death of 007 in revenge for his killing of fellow SPECTRE operative Dr.No. Once Bond has met his demise at the hands of hired assassin Red Grant, SPECTRE plans to humiliate the British further by taking the Lektor and selling it back to the Russians...Having not been at all enthralled by the first Bond adventure, Dr.No, it is my belief that From Russia With Love should really have been the outing to kick off the brilliant franchise. In my opinion this movie is far superior and dare I say it, personally found Dr.No overtly dull. Although in terms of plot, FRWL is a direct follow-on from Dr.No(but that doesn't mean that the first movie is required viewing). It must also be said that this movie is probably the only Bond film which is completely faithful to Ian Fleming's novels. The OTT gadgets and surreal plots which would be staples of the later films are wholly absent here and believe me, this isn't as bad as it sounds. FRWL is nothing but a straightforward espionage thriller with superb action sequences and terrific performances. We have a rousing shootout in a gypsy camp as well as Bond downing a SPECTRE helicopter with a Sniper rifle, with explosive results!(no pun intended). The fiery destruction of a fleet of SPECTRE speedboats also looked amazing. Still I think the best action scene in the movie is the chaotic fight between Bond and SPECTRE assassin Red Grant in the confines of cramped train compartment. One of the most awesome fistfights ever committed to film, the tight close-ups and medium shots of the violent struggle as well as the abrupt cuts convey spectacularly the claustrophobic, as well as brutal tone of the entire sequence.Again Sean Connery brings an impressive air of professionalism to the role of Bond and thus his performance is all the more excellent for it. Personally, I think that Robert Shaw steals the show as hired assassin Red Grant, the conversation between his character and Bond just prior to the aforementioned fight is a truly sublime scene. John Ford stock company veteran Pedro Armendariz also had a great turn as Bond's ally Kerim Bey, as did Lottie Lenya as the sinister Rosa Klebb. Lionel Bart's instrumental title piece was pretty fine, although it's one of the series' lesser compositions. However it is accompanied by a vibrant and gorgeous title sequence, where the credits are projected onto the body of a belly dancer.As I said, FRWL is a huge improvement on Dr.No. As the decade progressed, the Bond movies would just get better and better. A rollicking effort from beginning to end. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia With Love (1963): Dir: Terence Young / Cast: Sean Connery, Daniela Bianchi, Robert Shaw, Lotte Lenya, Pedro Armendariz: Second exciting 007 film with sarcasm pointed straight at enemy forces. Plot regards James Bond's quest to retrieve a top secret Russian decoding machine in the hands of SPECTRE, out for world domination. Terence Young returns as director after having began the popular franchise with the effective and entertaining Dr. No. Sean Connery returns as Bond who remains cunning in the face of danger and lustful dames positioned for diversion. Daniela Bianchi plays a Russian double agent whom becomes romantically attached to Bond. Robert Shaw appears as a killer who is first seen following Bond but along the way leaves bodies behind. Bond will eventually trick him since defeating him by physical force isn't the best option. Finally there is the switchblade shoes worn by villainess Lotte Lenya. She calls much of the shots and has a deadly weapon at her disposal. Her final scene and ultimate defeat has been referenced many times particularly in parodies. Pedro Armendariz plays a British intelligent agent assisting Bond with the mission until a fatal encounter with Shaw. Decent followup becomes pointless entertainment without statement or fact but at least it's good action fare of great technicality made with care, love and plenty of sarcasm. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet consulate clerk but SPECTRE plans to avenge Bond's killing of Dr. No.Terence Young's follow up to Dr. No is probably one of the best Bonds - certainly in terms of espionage and scope. The opening features Bond being killed only for the viewer to find it was a SPECTRE training exercise and simply an expendable agent with a Bond mask. It's not as colourful as it's predecessor Dr. No but Bond makes his way through some locales including London, Italy, Turkey Yugoslavia and it also features the Orient Express.Robert Shaw as Donald "Red" Grant, a SPECTRE assassin is outstanding and it's great to see the verbal as well as physically duelling between Shaw and Sean Connery's James Bond. The attaché case scene is priceless and the train fight packs a punch. Bernard Lee's M returns along with Lois Maxwell's Miss Moneypenny. Also Eunice Gayson Sylvia Trench briefly appears. Notable are Pedro Armendáriz, Walter Gotell and Desmond Llewelyn as Q. Lotte Lenya is particularly memorable as dagger shoed Rosa Klebb who enlists Soviet Embassy clerk Tatiana Romanova, (Daniela Bianchi) Bond's love interest.Okay I admit From Russia with Love isn't perfect, it lacks a great opening theme song (despite Matt Monro's vocals at the end) and the back projections date it, but whose complaining.With trains, hench-persons, gadgets in retrospect elements of this film have probably been recycled most throughout the series. It is one of the most darkest in tone and spy-like entries with it's sinister characters, double agents and political overtones. You really feel that Bond may not make it to the end credits. That said, it's not without its humour.If garrote watches and spy briefcases containing an AR-7 .22 calibre survival rifle (plus ammunition), 50 Gold Sovereigns, tear gas and a throwing knife don't entice you, I'm not sure what else will. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An espionage masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love improves over its predecessor by having a better story, villain, locations and girl. In this movie we're introduced to SPECTRE, an organization that was only briefly mentioned in the previous film. Rosa Klebb is number 3 member of SPECTRE and the main antagonist in the film. Rosa Klebb is a bitter old Russian woman who is played by Lotte Lenya. She has a memorable henchman, Red Grant, played by Robert Shaw and he is a physical match to Bond. Daniela Bianchi plays Tatiana Romanova, a naive Russian woman, who has no idea who's she's working for. She is a memorable, classic Bond girl. Sean Connery's acting is somehow even better in this film. The only problem this movie has to me is that it's slow-paced. But it's almost never boring or dull. I give this classic cold war thriller a 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Cold War Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Russia With Love" is somewhat of an oddity in the Bond series, yet is very popular within the fan base. Rather than the more Action-oriented style of most of the other Bond films, "FRWL" features a good small-scaled spy story, which follows its source novel closely. The storytelling is kinda slow, focusing mainly on the plot and not on the Action. Adding to that, Bond acts more like a real spy in the movie, not as a much like a detective as in Dr. No or a Super Man character as he does in some later efforts. Because of this, "Russia" might seem to lack intensity and be moving at a snails pace for fans of mainly later Bond entries or new Action movies in general. The differences to its predecessor, Dr. No, are quite significant. While "FRWL" lacks the charming vibe of Dr. No, it is all around a much better and more thrilling movie, also benefitting from what is clearly a far bigger budget. The locations aren't as exotic, though, but it is still nicely filmed and makes good use of Istanbul, the main location in the movie. The music is solid overall and far surpasses Monty Norman's performance in the aforementioned Dr. No. The decision to hire long-serving Bond composer John Barry proved to be a good one. Even then, I find "Russia" to be dry sometimes, which is common among older movies where music usually was used more sparingly. Also, in certain parts of the movie I find it sounding extremely dated.The quality of the scenes in the first half of "From Russia With Love" is overall not of much variation. But there are certain sections that are a little weaker. As an example, the gypsy scenes (apart from the, by this movie's standards, big Action scene) seem somewhat out of place in a Bond movie and drag a little. The second half however is really good and thrilling overall, containing most of the Action scenes. The highlight of the movie is the whole section on the Orient Express, culminating in a terrific showdown between Bond and Grant. Now, on a more negative note, the movie is obviously a product of its time, and as such looks and feels old. Unfortunately isn't up to par when it comes to the technical details. There are quite a few minor errors, such as obvious backdrops, fast forwarding and dubbing.Sean Connery gives a fine performance in the lead role, more akin to Fleming's James Bond from the books rather than the more common cinematic Bond that was introduced fully in Goldfinger. His acting is especially convincing in certain parts of the train sequence.The supporting cast was very good as well.Daniela Bianchi looks good and acts well as Tatjana Romanova. She is visibly dubbed, yes, but the voice-actor luckily sounded very convincing.Robert Shaw and Lotta Lenya are excellent in their respective roles as the two villains Donovan "Red" Grant and Rosa Klebb. Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz also did very well, this being his last ever performance before committing suicide later in 1963.Recurring characters already appeared in Dr. No, such as M (Bernard Lee), Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and Felix Leiter. Peter Burton also made his sole appearance as Mayor Boothroyd, more famously known as quartermaster Q, but was replaced before filming of "From Russia With Love" by Desmond Llewelyn, who would reprise the role in every official Bond film until his death in 1999, save Roger Moore's debut, Live And Let Die, from 1973. As always, the scenes with these characters are a joy to watch and instantly make you feel that you're watching Bond, even though the usual irritated (and for Bond's part teasing) relationship between Bond and Q wasn't established until the following Bond movie, Goldfinger.All in all, solid but unusual Bond film.</fullReview>

Even though he is the best man in MI6 he is just that well known. I mean isn't that brilliant or what? A classical espionage trap.

		<fullReview>After Dr:No 1962 this film came from Russia with love 1963 this is one instant classic film and Connery's second best as James Bond.When Sean Connery appeared in Dr no there was no doubt that this man would do wonders i mean i am hooked on this guy i love 007 films but Cean Connery rocks those Daniel Craig new films are nowhere near this gold film.Anyway with all that flaws that you may spot here if you have a special edition DVD or blue ray of this the special features and commentary are not to be missed seriously this is film making at its best the makers were not even sure how things would turn out the project was getting over budget and a lot of scenes were shot in either hurry or took even months to get out of the mess they looked up to editor peter hunt who later himself became a director in future even directed a bond film OHMSS 1969.There is a lot to enjoy here few things like the mask wow when i saw this film few years back i was like this even beats mission impossible films and hell yes it does even though this came decades before them second is the atmosphere in every scene even in fight sequence between bond and the bad guy.Who can forget the beautiful locations of Turkey,&amp; Russia plus points goes to that amazing train,now if anyone still hates this film they have no taste at all.The Cast:Sean Connery,Daniella Bianchi,Pedro Armendariz he died during production of this film great actor,Lotte Lenya just creeps me out as a evil villain working for Blofeld of Spectre,Robert Shaw wow he totally owned bond in many scenes the strongest bad guy ever to appear in any film what a body now rest of the cast did well too but Eunice Gayson returns as sexy Sylvia but her roles too short she was the sexiest lady in Dr No kissing 007 every mans fantasy and i am a young guy these actors were excellent unlike what we have today.I wont go in detail about whether this film deserved Oscar or not but i can Garantee you that the story of this film is the best written ever thanks to Ian Flemming and even bigger hats off to director Terrence Young.This is the bond film where all those gadgets start to appear Q makes a debut in this one Desmond Llewelyn is marvelous in his role.The Plot:James Bond is sent to retrieve Lektor a decoding machine before Spectre an evil organization finds it first he travels through turkey to Russia but deep down the shadows he is getting hunted down by evil bonds only hope is Tatiana who is also working for Spectre but falls in love with bond.This is a very simple story so no need to make things complicated it is not rocket science for people who are complaining about the slow pace and dialogs i suggest just watch this with patience it will grow on you same thing happened with me its like a magic.I really want to talk about this more but IMDb wont allow it so i am going to make short from here guys just leave the flaws and everything just enjoy it for what it is this came in 1963 and it rocks.Few things like extreme violence is passable no need to worry if you are a heart patient hey one more thing i like to add is the music and title song by Matt Monroe.The gun barrel is epic i love it,Blofeld does appear here but he is too hidden does not show his face .the latest bond film is called Spectre which is due to release this year in 2015 i cant wait hope they pay some homage to this.Overall From Russia With Love 1963 is a unforgettable experience this film is a master piece my rating is 10/10:Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Rushing With Greater Budget (much greater)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FOLLOWING THE GREAT success and international acceptance of 007 James Bond on the screen in DR. NO, the producers almost immediately followed up with this film, FROM Russia WITH LOVE. Although the choice of Sean Connery's being cast as Bond was one that was truly inspired and it rendered acceptably succeeding him by any actor nigh well impossible, Sir Sean was not the first to portray the Super Spy.IT WAS IN 1954, October 21st to be exact, that an adaptation of CASINO ROYALE was presented as an hour live installment of the CBS TV anthology series, CLIMAX (presented by the Chrysler Corporation). In the teleplay, Barry Nelson portrayed James Bond of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)! Peter Lorre co-starred as Le Chiffre.IT WAS THE feature films, of course, that put the James Bond 007 franchise into the collective consciousness of the movie going public of the entire world.AS FOR THIS particular installment of the suave super spy story, it is perhaps rated at the very pinnacle of the series. Interrupting the chronicling of Bond's amorous adventures in order to set him into motion on a new caper, we find that S.P.E.C.T.R.E is making another power grab and putting the blame on the Soviets. They even have a defecting Russian female officer giving bogus orders to Russian Tatiana (Daniela Bianchi); thus rendering her into an unknowing SPECTRE accomplice. (She also manages to redeem herself, being the new Bond Girl.) GREAT LOCATION SHOOTING in and around Istanbul, Turkey, Venice, Italy, Scotland, England and Pinewood Studios. Such extensive and varies locales made for a most realistic and sense stimulating cinematic experience. The action that took place on the Railroad Train from Istanbul to Paris (the Orient Express?)was a fine contrast to the previous action in urban surroundings. The inclusion of the boat chases and helicopter pursuits provided us with a sort of litany of travel modes for a great variety of action.PERHAPS THE MOST important facet of FROM Russia WITH LOVE is its casting of Robert Shaw as SPECTRE killing machine and homicidal maniac, Grant. The picture's opening featuring Grant (Shaw again) demonstrating his prowess with various deadly instruments is perhaps as fine a "grabber" scene as there is in the movies; rating high on our charts as the opening speech in PATTON and the undertaker's appeal to Vito Corleone in THE GODFATHER.SOMEONE HAD REMARKED some years ago that Robert Shaw made a truly believable and definitely quite dangerous. We must heartily concur in this assertion. The blonde Grant is silently menacing for over three quarters of the picture without benefit of dialog. It was as if he had to employ silent film skills and acting style; which he did very commendably.HIS LATE IN the story finding of his voice proved that his talents were indeed multi-faceted.THIS FILM WAS followed by GOLDFINGER.</fullReview>

Miss Gayson was born on St. Patrick's Day, 1928, which means she's going on 87, according to my reckoning. Even if James changes his stripes and suddenly becomes interested in "cougars" for Eon Production Company's upcoming Bond 24, tying up loose ends with Sylvia may stretch credulity a bit. As far as I can recall, it's pretty rare for Agent 007 to hook up with the same woman on subsequent assignments. Since it has happened once already with Sylvia, I suppose anything's possible. Maybe Eon will get tired of sending its close-knit production crew to "exotic" locations such as France and Jamaica year after year after year, and they will decide to wrap up their Bond series with a "PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY" closing. Perhaps S.P.E.C.T.R.E. operatives will find James' master painting in the attic of a Piccadilly flat, and burn it. On the minus side, he'll instantly reflect his true age--about 90-something. On the plus side, Sylvia will still be waiting for him--looking like a spring chicken, to boot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr No isn't as good as you think it is, but this is close to a masterpiece. For the first time, we see the dazzling heights James Bond would reach occasionally, and this is a riveting, razor sharp cold war thriller with heaps of escapism, suspense and soul. Take that Jason Bourne! This follows a plot by SPECTRE to get revenge on Bond following the events of Dr No and the resulting plot is rather complicated, but basically follows Bond's attempts to survive and get away with a coding device.The main problem with the film is its slow pace, although this adds to it in certain ways. It can occasionally feel a little boring, so this may not appeal so much to some viewers who are used to more action. Aside from that, the film is a perfect lesson in how to make a thriller and the electrifying moments, great performances and suspense never stop coming.Sean Connery will always be the best actor to play Bond, and he fills the role with charisma and energy. The other actors in the film do a good job as well, and the villains, especially the Bond henchman defining henchman Red Grant, ooze menace. The direction is smart and unlike many other Bond movies there's a genuine feel of suspense. What sets FRWL apart is the plot, which is far more interesting than that of any other Bond film. It doesn't involve as many OTT action scenes and instead there's a far greater sense of mystery and tension. Although the Bond formula developed by Goldfinger is still great, this story structure was more interesting although it was better to use it only once.The action sequences aren't massively frequent but this makes them more effective. The train fight scene is utterly brilliant, and the final chase involving the helicopter and the boats is also brilliantly tense. Despite the realism and emphasis on tension there is still a feeling of escapism. The film only gets better as it goes along, and despite its pacing problems remains one of the best British thrillers of all time.Overall, a great Bond movie and the one where it started to get really good, before it got great with Goldfinger. This is my 3rd favourite Bond film and proudly sits high above the silliness of the Roger Moore era, the over seriousness of the Dalton era and Die Another Day. A bulls-eye!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is widely regarded as one of the very best if not the best Bond film and I can see why. I'd seen it once before but I'd forgotten just how good it was. I bloody loved it. Almost everything worked perfectly. The storyline was brilliant and the pacing was extremely fast, though the train sequence drags a bit from time to time. Probably my favourite aspect of the film was Pedro Armendáriz's wonderful, charismatic performance as Kerim Bey, which was all the more impressive considering that he was dying of cancer at the time (which may have been caused by exposure to radiation during the making of the infamously bad John Wayne film "The Conqueror"). He committed suicide before the film was released. On a happier note, it marks the first of Desmond Llewelyn's 17 appearances as Q, though the character was devoid of most of his later personality traits and quirks in his first outing. In spite of the minor pacing issues, I'll give this a perfect score. Wonderful stuff. They don't make them like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most realistic and arguably the best of Connery's Bonds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very much the atypical Bond film, more of a conventional Cold War thriller than the high-blown spectacle we would later come to know and love. You can see Fleming's hand in much of it, the use of the Lektor machine based on the WW2 Enigma decoder which was still not common knowledge to the public when the book was published but was to Ian Fleming through his wartime intelligence experiences. The spy techniques we see here are authentic, the KGB having men whose sole job is to watch the airport for interesting strangers, using the Bulgarians for their dirty work, Bond's recognition code, tunneling under the enemies embassy and staging a false emergency in order to raid their cypher room, the false flag operation of recruiting an agent who thinks they're working for one side when in fact they're working for someone else entirely. We're not too reliant on gadgets yet either, Bond has some cool gear that saves his life in a pinch but for the most part he gets by on his wits and his innate toughness, his vicious no holds barred fight to the death with the brutal Red Grant in the confines of the railway carriage perhaps the most adult action scene in all of Bond. He's very fallible here, falling for Spectre's scheme hook, line and sinker, only his ingenuity exploiting Grant's greed saving the day.His Turkish contact is one of the most memorable of all the Bond assistants, a man you could really buy as someone British intelligence would hire to be their man in Istanbul, his death affecting Bond who nevertheless keeps his professional detachment when telling his son of his death (made all the more poignant when you consider the actor playing him knew he was dying of cancer at the time). A few bad points, I find the heroine a bit insipid, good looking but a little too bland. BUT I guess she was selected by Spectre because she was like that, you could believe she would fall for Bond and betray her country for him. Rosa Kleb, the inspiration for the great Frau Farbisinau in Austin powers is the stereotypical evil lesbian of the early 1960s, you can see some of the nastier aspects of Fleming's attitudes to women seeping through, not least Bond's playful slapping of the heroine's backside and much less playful rough treatment of her when things get tense (he's quite ruthless with his girlfriend at the opening riverside scene too). But these are small points and all told it truly is an excellent film all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'You are trapped Mr. Bond. You cannot escape. You cannot escape.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any time a villain says "Mr. Bond you cannot escape", we know we are going to witness a clever escape, as in the last chase scene, on the water, in "From Russia with Love." This is the second in the series of 007 movies starring Sean Connery as James Bond. To me it seems a bit more refined than the first one, and 007 gets his briefcase of gadgets. One of them is a tear gas cannister that goes off if you don't know the trick way to open the briefcase, and I spent much of the movie wondering when we would see it used. It does seem to save his life!The story is fairly straightforward, SPECTRE wants a cipher machine, about the size of a typewriter, and called LEKTOR. Their technique is to send a beautiful Russian girl to get Bond to fall for, and she will give him incorrect and misleading information. As Bond is being prepped he is given a photo of the girl, as he is about to leave the office he surrenders the photo to Moneypenny, and he writes on the photo, "With love." Then after a short pause writes above that, "From Russia." The movie is filmed mostly in Istanbul and at the Pinewood studios in London, but also has some nice Venice scenes. It starts with James Bond apparently getting killed in a SPECTRE training center exercise but the Bond mask was pulled off to reveal that it wasn't him. That fight was recreated near the end of the movie, on a train, with a quite different result. The pretty Russian girl was Italian Daniela Bianchi as Tatiana Romanova, who went by Tanya. She was only 21 and in fact was runner-up in the Miss World pageant. However, like was done in "Dr. No" with Ursula Andress, Bianchi's lines were over-dubbed by another actress because her English was to strongly accented. The dubbing is done so expertly that one would never know unless told.This is part of a 3 DVD set the Sean Connery 007 Collection Volume 1 released recently and with restored picture and sound, and it indeed does look and sound great. I selected the DTS sound instead of the original mono sound and it was very realistic.Good James Bond movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond Month #2: Now THIS is more like it!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is more like it. From Russia with Love is an unbelievably great follow up to a weak opening film. What we have here is a great action/spy/espionage thriller that came at just the right time in both the Bond series and in real-world history.Unlike Dr. No, this is one of the more taut and well thought out Bond stories. As part of a SPECTER plot, a Russian female cypher-clerk pretends to defect to the U.S. with a device called a lektor, which MI6 and the CIA desperately need. As part of the plan, she will only defect to Bond, and SPECTER will try to create a national incident over the affair.Sean Connery is even better in this movie, and shows Bond as both caring for his allies and not easily fooled by his adversaries. We even get Bond's first great ally with Kerim Bey (played wonderfully by Pedro Amandarez) who is both funny and resourceful. And we have one of the best villains in the Bond canon, SMERSH agent Red Grant (played by the great Robert Shaw) He is a brute, trained by the best both physically and mentally. When he and Bond has the fight on the Orient Express, it is super-brutal, and very tense as we truly hope Bond pulls through over this guy. The other super-good villain is Rosa Klebb (played by Lotte Lenye) She is intimidating and mean, and carries that over into her commanding presence in all her scenes.I'll have to say the weak link in the cast is Daniela Bianchi as Tanya. Like I said in Dr. No, a lot of the Bond girls are models just stuck in there to look beautiful and fawn over James. Sadly, that is Tanya's purpose in this film. Granted, she does keep the plot moving, but other than that she whines and fawns, not doing much after her service at the beginning is fulfilled.This film has much better pacing and a better flow than most movies in this series. I have to give credit to Director Terrence Young and editor Peter Hunt for turning an overly complicated book into a more understandable movie. Bpoth give it a stylistic edge and a seemingly more refined look and feel than Dr. No, which seemed more dirty and extremely low budget. We also get composer John Barry's first score as the mainstay composer of the Bond films, and as usual, its very good. Surprisingly we don't have a very memorable song in here, but I guess it would have detracted from the film's main purpose.This movie is a standard for all spy films after-wards. It proved to Hollywood that a second film can often be better than the first. In fact, the main reason why this film came second was because it was one of President John F. Kennedy's favorite books.From Russia with Love again established the popularity of James Bond all over the world. It has great acting, good story, and good direction, everything a Bond fan could want, but it all got even better with the next film, Goldfinger, which I will review next in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery returns as James Bond "007" is this equally entertaining adventure as Bond becomes the willing target of assassination as both his government and SPECTRE are trying to locate a Soviet encryption device that would tip the balance of power between the East &amp; West, which SPECTRE would take full advantage of, since they also plan revenge on Bond, for the defeat of their agent Dr. No in the first film. Also gives the first glimpse of arch-rival and SPECTRE head Ernst Stavros Blofield, though only from behind.Robert Shaw portrays a trained assassin whose mission is to kill Bond, and they have a memorable fight in a train compartment. Like "Dr. No", this holds up well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the 2nd Bond film,, what's different about this Bond film from many of it's later successor's is that it is of a slower pace, Bond isn't saving the world right off the bat,, this one is more about him learning the ropes , especially in Instanbul where he partners up with someone who shows him the ropes. he seduces a young sexy Russian girl to get his hands on a Russian decoding machine,, what makes thing get interesting is that SPECTRE is back and they are trying to get their hands on it as well,, this movie pays more attention to the spy work that is involved,, less action,, more seductive romance,, still have the great cars, and hot women, overall a very good entry into the series , just a little slower paced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bond" hits its stride on step number two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bond is back and better than ever in "From Russia with Love." OK, so that's not exactly saying much seeing as the film is only Bond's second outing, but "From Russia with Love" is a considerable improvement on all fronts from "Dr. No." This sequel takes more time to develop its characters, utilizes greater levels of suspense, places Bond on a bigger stage and much more.What's all the more impressive in this major step toward forging Ian Fleming's James Bond character's film legacy is the way it recognizes its own iconography and winning formula. Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman understood just what made their first film special: the music, the women, the larger-than-life bad guys ? even the fact that Bond gets tailed from the airport as he did in the first film. Repeating and boosting those winning factors would make it hard for anyone who didn't know the release order of the "Bond" films to know that "From Russia with Love" was only the second film. It feels less like a franchise finding its legs and more like one that's carefully honed its craft."From Russia with Love" has much more of an espionage flavor than "Dr. No." MI6 sends Bond to Istanbul in hopes of getting its hands on a Lektor decoding device from the Soviets, but we know this is part of the plan of the shadowy SPECTRE organization to get its hands on the decoder while also paying Bond back for the demise of its colleague, Dr. No. The mysterious cat-petting No. 1 along with ex-KGB agent No. 3 (Lotte Lenya) and chess champion No. 5 (Vladek Sheybal) put their scheme into action, which involves recruiting the beautiful Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) to seduce Bond and feed him false information. Bond and MI6 know the likelihood that they could be walking into a trap, so he's armed with a handy suitcase gadget and sent to meet MI6 associate Kerim Bey (Pedro Amendariz) in Istanbul.All the supporting characters have more meat to them and present either a comparable physical/mental challenge or possess a similar intellect to Bond. Bianchi as a Bond girl is equally stunning compared to Ursula Andress, but she's not some helpless shell collector forced into the middle of the fray, she's playing him false?though admittedly her motives lack anything sinister because she thinks she's working for her country and she's like putty in Bond's arms. Amendariz plays the helper character, the one with the resources who risks his life to help Bond. He has wits about him and some skill and motivation unlike the boatman in "Dr. No." Then there's Bond's first physical challenge in the brick wall that is SPECTRE agent Grant (Robert Shaw). No. 3, Rosa Klebb, is a peculiar addition, but as an evil female character who is not a femme fatale, offers a nice change of stereotype.Suspense is much more wieldy in "FRWL," and director Terence Young has found a really good handle on how to keep things interesting. The script moves quickly, which helps as well, with shorter scenes all ending in something memorable whether a death or a fight or a reveal that something's amiss. The action scenes are excellent in terms of variety and intensity, from more intense fist fights on a train to a boat chase to an obvious homage to Alfred Hitchcock's "North by Northwest." If they were going to steal from any filmmaker, it should be Hitchcock."FRWL" as one of nearly 25 "Bond" films is very good, but as a correction to "Dr. No," it's brilliant. It's really the first great "Bond" movie and would serve as a better first in the series to anyone needing an introduction to the franchise (who wants to save the really good stuff for later).~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>They sure don't make Bond films like this anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many Bond movies that sometimes it gets hard to remember which one is which. I thought that is was the one where the Russian general throws the computer from the top of Metanoia in Greece, so when the Orient Express (and I did not realise that it was the Orient Express until later on in the film) arrives in Zagreb, the main question that was going through my mind was 'how do they get to Metanoia in fifteen minutes of film'. As it turns out, this is not the film that I was thinking of, especially since Bond actually manages to escape with the decoding device.Here we first hear Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE (though we never see him, and he isn't even credited in the film, with simply a ? indentifying the character) and he is out for revenge against Bond for succeeding against Dr No. In fact this film seems to follow directly on from Dr No, to the point that I suspect that the woman we see Bond with at the beginning of the film is the same woman from the beginning of Dr No.Anyway, Blofeld has a plan to turn the cold war into a hot war by setting the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries against each other, and once the dust has settled, he will step in and finish of the survivor, thus making him ruler of the world. The trap is to convince the British to come to Istanbul and steal a decoding device, and then have one of his assassins take it on the way back to England.This film is much more of a spy, intrigue film that was Dr No, which seemed to play out like a detective novel. In this one we have intrigue, assassins, and a mission that must be completed, as well as Bond attempted to escape across the border to a friendly country. Bond is not really doing any detective work in this film, but rather he is hatching a plan to get his hands on a Russian computer so that the British can use it for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the first and one of the absolute best Bond films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the immense success of Dr. No, the question stood if EON were to make a sequel. Of course, they were! Sean Connery reprises his role as James Bond and Terence Young returned to direct having previously directed Dr. No! With those two together, what could possibly go wrong? This time the producers drew inspiration from Ian Fleming's Bond novel entitled "From Russia With Love" and used it as the basis for the film. The film would stay with the same charm and stylish feel that the audience witnessed in Dr. No, making it a straight up cold, spy thriller of the best sort!The movie became (like it's predecessor) an instant hit, and proved to be an even bigger! It's many fans' favorite Bond movie, it's Connery's favorite of those he did, and it's my favorite! The movie takes out with MI6 receiving a letter from a Russian cypher clerk from a Russian embassy in Istanbul. The letter says that she will hand over a so called "Lektor" (a decoding machine) to MI6 on one condition: that James Bond were to escort her and the Lektor all the way to Britain, personally. Bond agrees to her demands, and heads to Istanbul to meet Kerim Bey and team up with him. In reality it is SPECTRE (the villainous terrorist organization mentioned in Dr. No) that has devised a plan to take the Lektor for themselves, kill Bond in retaliation for their operative Dr. No, and thereby humiliate MI6. The story evolves into an expertly told spy thriller about loyalty, romantics, violence, action and above all: realism. As I said, it's all told in such a fascinating and intriguing way, that you'll never EVER get bored! This is one of the only Bond movies that is in fact realistic, and portrays Bond as a spy! Sean Connery reprises his role as MI6 agent James Bond, and again he does a marvelous job! I think, Connery delivers his finest performance in this film. He delivers everything the script and the director wants him too. Can't really give him more credit than that! Daniela Bianchi is our new Bond girl, and she is my favorite! She has much more to do and work with than Ursulla Andress in Dr. No, and she gets more screen time! Her performance is so real, innocent and sometimes kinky, that it makes her character even more realistic and human, which makes you like and care for her! Plus, her chemistry with Connery is superb! She is one of the only Bond girls that is really, really important to the plot, and is arguably the most important! A friggin' fantastic Bond girl! Lotte Lenya is our villain in the creepy and sadistic Rosa Klebb. I like her and her character very much! Her character is weighed much on the characters creepiness, and Lenya does a remarkable job with it! Pedro Armendáriz is Bond's ally, Kerim Bey. I love the chemistry he shares with Connery! His character is also very important to the story, and he is given many good quotes. I'm gonna go ahead and call him the best ally Bond has ever had in the entire series! Robert Shaw is our first indestructible henchman in the series as a whole. In my opinion, he is also the very best! He plays the sadistic, murderous, psychopathic, sociopathic, calculating and villainous Donald "Red" Grant. His character sat the standards for many coming henchmen, with his height and blond hair. This character has it all. He gets a spectacular intro which is the best for any Bond henchman ever! Trust me, you'll know when it's there. His performance is so realistic and creepy, that it blows all those simple-minded and blond-haired other henchmen away. He is mostly seen in the distance observing Bond or offing some of Bond's allies, and I love that! It's much more realistic and fits the story much better. But when he does meet Bond and talk with him it's worth the wait! The dialog is so interesting and intriguing as we slowly learns who SPECTRE is and how they operates! One of my favorite scenes in the entire series! And he delivers my favorite line from a Bond villain ever which is "My orders are to kill you and deliver the Lector... How I do it's my business." Plus, it can only help when Grant and Bond shares the best and most realistic fight in the entire series! Shaw as Grant is my favorite henchman ever! Vladek Sheybal and Walter Gotell also creates creepy and memorable Bond henchmen. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell reprises their roles as M and Moneypenny, respectively. Desmond Llewelyn is awesome as Q for the first time! Last, but certainly not least, we get the first on-screen appearance from none other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld! The sight of him stroking that white cat of his but never see his face is so haunting! Blofeld is a villain without comparison! He is THE villain! He's the head of SPECTRE! Nough' said! His scenes in this movie are my absolute favorites of all the scenes the character has! No other villain will ever be as memorable as him! When you mix all these wonderful ingredients up, what you get is: a fantastic film, a wonderful cast, memorable performances, realism, violence, humor and a damn good James Bond movie, arguably the best of the entire series! Terence Young returns with the same energy and stylish direction and takes it all up one notch. In my opinion, this movie is better than Dr. No, purely because I like the story more, and it's much more intense! But as an introduction to the Bond universe, no movie could work better than Dr. No! However, From Russia With Love is still a better movie in general, and many fans' favorites (including mine) of all the Bond films! This movie is absolutely friggin' awesome!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkable Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A chess genius by the name of "Kronsteen" (played by Vladek Sheybal), is also the #5 ranked member of the secret criminal organization known as SPECTRE. He has come up with a foolproof plan which includes: (1) stealing a top secret Russian decoding machine called a "Lektor". (2) Increasing tension between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to the point of a possible war and (3) Killing "James Bond" (Sean Connery) in retaliation for the death of one of their operatives named "Dr. No". Kronsteen convinces #1 ("Ernst Blofeld") of his plan and #3 "Rosa Klebb" (Lotte Lenya) is ordered to assist him. Thinking that Colonel Klebb is still a member of SMERSH (the Russian secret service), the beautiful Russian intelligence analyst "Tatiana Romanova" (Daniela Bianchi) is pressed into luring James Bond to Istanbul so that he can acquire the Lektor from the Russian consulate. Once this is accomplished a ruthless assassin named "Grant" (Robert Shaw) is ordered to take the Lektor on behalf of SPECTRE and kill both James Bond and Tatiana Romanova. Obviously the plot is very intricate and there are twists and turns throughout the movie, but for the sake of brevity I thought it best to end here. Overall, this is a remarkable movie which has nice cinematography, splendid acting, well-written scripts and good direction (Terence Young). Sean Connery is once again excellent as Agent 007. Pedro Armendiaz, who plays "Kerim Bey" (the head of Turkish intelligence), also performs admirably as does Robert Shaw. Likewise, Daniela Bianchi (a former Miss Rome and 1960 Miss World runner up) is a ravishing addition to this film as well. In short, it has the scenery, talent, script and direction that you need to make a good film and it is used to the utmost. A good James Bond film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia with a Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels aren't supposed to surpass originals, but director Terence Young's "From Russia With Love" is one of the very best with action galore, exotic settings, scheming criminals, stealthy spies, and James Bond romancing a woman and shooting their way through the Baltic. Sean Connery plays himself in the opening, pre-credit sequence where killer Red Grant strangles him. This was a neat trick, but "You Only Live Twice" was better. SPECTRE plots to trigger a world war between NATO and the Kremlin. They recruit a beautiful Russian agent, and she sends James Bond a message that not only does she wish to defect but also she has a special Lektor decoding machine. Neither the British nor the Americans have a Lektor. The British suspect it's a trap for 007 and Bond accepts the assignment and flies off to Istanbul where the defection is scheduled to occur. Sean Connery doesn't give the polished performance that he gave later in "Goldfinger," but he is less bossy than he was "Dr. No." Robert Shaw is appropriately menacing as Red Grant with his trick wristwatch. Daniela Bianchi is delectable as Tatiana Romanova; she is the lady who promises Bond a super-secret decoding machine. The scene where Tatiana and Bond meet is chaste but sizzling. Tatiana complains that her mouth is not big enough, and Bond retorts that it is big enough for him. Amusing dialogue, unforgettable predicaments, including the close-quarters combat in the train compartment between Bond and Grant. The opening credits sequence with a dancer's body undulating with the credits is inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond gets even better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I enjoyed Bond's first movie outing, it wasn't quite a resounding 'Yes' for Dr. No as far as I was concerned, the film not having aged all that well and the lack of budget evident in the set designs and costumes. From Russia With Love is a much more satisfying effort overall, with Connery honing his performance as Bond, far more exotic locations, better villains, and hotter women.The plot sees 007 helping sexy Russian defector Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) to escape to the West, on the condition that she brings a top-secret de-coding machine called the Lector along for the ride; both parties, however, are unaware that they are being used as puppets by international crime organisation SPECTRE.This being only the second film in the series, not all of the recognised Bond elements are in place?there are surprisingly few explosive action set-pieces, Bond lacks a gadget laden car, and the villain's lair doesn't go up in a ball of flames?but there's still plenty to please avid fans of the world's greatest secret agent.Between the iconic opening credits and the attack by surviving baddie Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) in the film's closing moments, we get iconic villain Blofeld making his screen debut, Robert Shaw as psychotic killer Donald Grant, Hammer babe Martine Beswick participating in a gypsy cat-fight, a fun training camp scene with henchmen aplenty, and a great Hitchcockian moment that sees Bond pursued by a helicopter.Top of my list, however, has to be the bevy of curvaceous babes, some of the sexiest women that the series has to offer: killer Grant's bodacious blonde masseuse (Jan Williams?wowzer!), Kerim Bey's gorgeous girlfriend (Nadja Regin?hubba hubba!), and, of course, ravishing Russian agent Romanova (va va voom!).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guaranteed Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My dad always says this is the best Bond film and he's a good judge. What he would have appreciated most was the relative lack of gimmickry which became a merchandiser's paradise as the series progressed, plus he always said that Robert Shaw made the best Bond villain.Right on both counts. Some staples are there of course, the idea of a recurring "Bond girl" for one, this time in the person of the lovely Daniella Biancchi, although, until she accounts for Kleb near the end, she doesn't have to do much other than simper a lot and swoon around our hero. There is of course at least one of Q's contraptions on show which miraculously as ever comes to James' rescue in his to-the-death fight with Shaw's killing-machine Red Grant while our hero has already developed the practice of signing off every scene where he's just killed a man or three with a quick quip.So far, so very good. My main qualm with the film is the outdated treatment of women, particularly the gratuitous and mildly salacious cat-fight between the two gypsy beauties which eventually sees them presented to Bond as a thank you for saving the gypsy chief's life and I've already mentioned the rather supine role of Bracchi's Olga character. To counter that though, there is the welcome appearance of Lotte Lenya as the overtly lesbian, malevolent Klebb, with a particularly sharp line in footwear.Connery is "egshellent" of course, debonair, athletic and above all charismatic. Shaw does indeed make a fine adversary and they have first of Bond's great fights in a confined space, this time a train compartment, the better for looking like a natural fight and not making James seem like some superhuman.There are plenty of other engaging characters in the film and the plot is simple to follow and doesn't yet involve a megalomaniac would-be world dictator, which again, of course, would come later. John Barry's music, especially for the action sequences, is routinely superb, even if the title song sound a tad dated by today's standards.I'm definitely a Connery man in the Bond stakes and everything that made his Bond the best was pretty much present and correct here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of Connery era Bond films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of "Dr. No" plans to film a second Bond movie were instantly made. Since the first film was based on the sixth book in the Ian Fleming series, the filmmakers decided not to follow movies in same order and could choose any book they wanted to film. They chose the fifth book after President John F. Kennedy had said it was one of his favorite books. Terence Young returned to direct the movie and Sean Connery returned to reprise his role as James Bond. This is also the last Bond movie Ian Fleming got to see before his death. The British Secret Service receives a word from young Soviet clerk Tatiana Romanova, who is willing to help British to get a highly advanced decoding machine Lektor for themselves, if they send James Bond to meet her in Istanbul. The British suspects it's a trap set by the Russians but can't resist a chance to obtain Lektor. What they don't know is that it's not Russians who are pulling the strings but the international criminal organization SPECTRE who not only want Lektor for themselves but to kill James Bond as well."From Russia with Love" is not only a vast improvement of already good "Dr. No", it's also the best of Sean Connery's Bond films and, in my opinion, one of the very best Bond films ever. This has all a great Bond film needs: great actors, memorable villains, beautiful girls, suspenseful plot and great action. The action is already considerably more imaginative here than in "Dr. No" while still not going as over the top as in many later films. The helicopter and boat chase are both still impressive, especially since you know no computer effects were used at the time.Connery is at his best shape and brings even more edginess to his character. Also memorable is Daniela Bianchi as Tatiana Romanova, beautiful and seductive woman whose true loyalties the viewer, and Bond, is not sure until the very end. This is also the first movie with Desmond Llewelyn as Q, a part he would play in nearly every Bond movie till his death during the Pierce Brosnan era.Worth mentioning are the many villains of this film. The leader of SPECTRE makes his first appearance, though we do not see his face or hear his name. We only see his hands stroking a white Persian cat, creating an air of mystery around him. The villains we do see are the lecherous Rosa Klebb, played by Lotte Lenya, who uses poisoned spike in her shoe, a cold calculating chess master Kronsteen, played by Vladek Sheybal, and the lethal assassin Red Grant, played by Robert Shaw, with whom Bond has one of his most intensive and brutal fight scenes ever.All in all "From Russia with Love" represents Bond film at its best. In fact only very few later films in the series reach the same level. Full points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>007 Hits His Stride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Super spy James Bond first appeared on the big screen in 1962 with "Dr. No". But Agent 007 truly hit his stride in this 1963 follow-up. "From Russia With Love" established many Bond movie traditions.Old-schoolers will always regard Sean Connery as the best James Bond. "Russia" allows Connery to build upon his character from the first film. His Bond is suave yet rugged, with a wonderful dash of black humour. His penchant for death-defying escapes is matched only by his prowess with the opposite sex.In "From Russia With Love", 007 encounters some classic espionage villains while in pursuit of a Soviet decoding machine. Most memorable is a young Robert Shaw as Red Grant, a blonde assassin. A fight aboard a moving train, between Bond and Grant, is probably the film's highlight, a classic movie dust-up. There is also a nasty female foe for James, played by Lotte Lenya, whose shoe-tip hides a razor sharp blade with Bond's name on it.Another fine aspect of this second entry is the music, by John Barry. The classic 007 guitar theme is always just around the corner, usually cuing another tight spot for our hero. And even the opening credits - not only of this film but of virtually every Bond picture to date - are a colourful high point.His name is "Bond, James Bond".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best from the Bond series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want a good example of what the James Bond films were like before they became a formula-driven franchise then you can't do any better than checking out From Russia With Love. At this early stage the series hadn't become obsessed with gadgetry or absurd villains. They were still essentially Cold War spy films. This entry is a good example of this in that it keeps proceedings reasonably within the realms of reality. This is still a relative statement of course as the Bond films always contained some outright fanciful moments right from the outset. But From Russia With Love limits these elements to a few minor details rather than basing the plot around them.Sean Connery is at the peak of his powers in the role here. He definitely convinces as 007. He has the right mixture of charm and brutality that the character so clearly must possess. There's very much a cool feel to the film overall as well. It has the requisite exotic locations that all the series have and the glamorous women too but it's kept within the bounds of possibility. When the action scenes do happen they are never silly like some of the borderline stupidity that crept into some later entries. Moreover, the most famous action moment in the film ? the fight between Connery and Robert Shaw in the train ? has an intimacy to it that would never occur to the filmmakers who made some of the subsequent films in the series, where the idea of 'big must be better' seems to have been a tiresome motto.You could probably consider From Russia With Love as a great spy film in its own right as opposed to just another entry in the Bond series. It combines 60's glamour and the Cold War thriller very well. It remains certainly one of the best of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where its predecessor, Dr No, re-created the action cinema genre for all time, From Russia With Love did the same for the modern espionage thriller.This is an impeccable film - nearly every frame dripping with style and class. The cold war atmosphere it generates, that tense and intricate sensory vibe, is almost palpable.Those who criticise it as "slow" are missing the point. Care, thought and time was taken to pace the story and develop characters, to build up a specific ambiance and inject dramatic tension. You can't rush these things when you are painstakingly defining a genre.Some people think this the best Bond movie. If we're talking best straightforward espionage Bond movie with a literary authenticity supporting it, then yes, it is. A smartly crafted slice of Fleming-originated fantasy spy-work, garnished with a suitably thrilling infusion of high adventure.The performances are immaculately cool, the set-pieces skillfully executed, the score divine, the cinematography glowing and the direction both elegant and sharp. A film best appreciated by the connoisseur of all things Bond and not just the casual plebeian bystander who thinks it all began and ended with plasticine dreck like GoldenEye.From Russia With Love IS a true encapsulation of the best of Bond cinema. I can't praise it enough - and that will never be praise enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>007's Early Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. No's release in 1962 showed that a series of films based on Ian Fleming's James Bond novels was possible. However there was a new question: how long could it survive? To follow-up Dr. No producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman choose to film one of the best Bond novels, and a recently announced favorite book of US President John F. Kennedy, From Russia With Love. The film they made was, like the novel it was based, destined to become one of the best, if not the best, James Bond films.The key to the success of the film is Sean Connery as James Bond. If Dr. No introduced Connery as Bond, then this is the film that really established him as Bond. Connery is very much the embodiment of Bond: suave, knowledgeable about everything from wines to fine dining, seductive yet more then capable of becoming a killer for Queen and country in an instant. All this is well suited to the film as ranges across all of that including two very famous scenes: the scene with Bond and Tatiana in the former's hotel bedroom and the fight between Bond and Grant towards the end of the film. The overall performance of Connery in the film is not only an improvement on the all ready good Bond seen in Dr. No but one of the best performances of any actor as Bond.Then there's the two villains of the film. On a more intellectual side is Rosa Klebb played by Lotte Lenya who, despite a limited amount of screen time, gives an effective if not at times creepy performance. On the physical side is Robert Shaw as her henchman Donald Grant. Calling Grant a henchman is an understatement of the highest order for Grant is the villain of the film for much of its length. From the opening sequence to his stalking of Bond across Istanbul and the Orient Express, grant physicality and menace reigns supreme. This is only heightened when Bond and Grant finally meet face to face in the lead up to one of the best fight sequences in film history which gives Shaw a chance to show off some real acting talent. Together, Lenya and Shaw present two of the film series best villains.The only letdown of the main cast members is Daniela Bianchi as Tatiana Romanova. This was Bianchi's first major film role and it shows. Bianchi performance is for the most part wooden and uninspired, something that shows up heavily in her scene with the much more experienced Lenya early on. Her and Connery do have some good chemistry though which makes the famous scene between them in Bond's hotel bedroom all the more effective. For the most part though, Bianchi's performance is a letdown.The supporting cast is, like most of the main cast, splendid. Pedro Armendariz as Kerim Bey is a particular high note of the film and he is a highlight of any scene that he appears in. Other highlights of the supporting cast include Walter Gotell as Morzeny, Vladek Sheybal as SPECTRE planner Kronsteen, Eunice Gayson in her second (and final) appearance as Sylvia Trench,Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and Bernard Lee as M. A notable edition to the cast was Desmond Llewelyn as Major Boothroyd aka Q, making the first of seventeen appearances as the soon to be famous character. The result is one of the best Bond film casts ever assembled.The production values of the film are also splendid. Production designed Ken Adams was unavailable for the film so Syd Cain took his place and the result is for the film's benefit as this film is based more in reality then Dr. No or Adams or other films. On occasion the film does venture off in the grand and larger then life such as the chess tournament set early in the film or the SPECTRE island training ground and Cain proves more then up to the challenge. Peter Hunt's editing keeps the film moving at a pace which suits not only the fine direction of Terrance Young but the atmospheric cinematography of Ted Moore. All of these elements come together to create classic sequences such as the fight on the Orient Express and the various action sequences that lead up to the ending of the film. The result is superb all around.From Russia With Love is notable also for the being the first Bond film to feature a score by John Barry. Barry, who had worked on the James Bond Theme for Dr. No, creates a score that is everything the score to Dr. No wasn't: highly atmospheric, individual and far from repetitive. Barry not only uses the Bond Theme but also supplements in with a new theme, the 007 Theme, which makes it debut during the battle at the gypsy camp sequence. Barry's score is highly effective in any scene it is heard in.The script by Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood is just as much a star of the film as its actors or production values. On one level it is a highly faithful adaptation of Fleming's original novel, yet downplays some of the Cold War elements and adds a bit to the film's ending as well. It is also a good example of story construction as well from an opening where the viewer thinks they know what's happening to the build up of suspense right up until the last scenes. It's a script full of interesting character's, action sequences and yet faithful to its source material at the same time. A rare combination indeed.From Russia With Love itself is a rare combination of fine actors, production values, direction, music and script. It's a film full of suspense that plays on the expectations of viewers, excites them and surpasses them. From Russia With Love proved Bond as a film series by creating one of the best, if not the best, films in that series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond returns for his second assignment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia with Love continues the 007 series from Dr. No. This time Bond must travel to... you guessed it, Russia. We learn that a criminal organization known as SPECTRE is plotting to thwart the British and Russian governments in hopes to create war and profit. What exactly is this devious plot you ask? Well, watch the movie and find out. For Bond's seconding outing, From Russia with Love for the most part holds up with Dr. No. The pacing lags a bit here and there during the middle of the movie but is really nothing worth complaining over since the rest of it holds up. This is a worthy sequel to the James Bond series and is followed by'Goldfinger'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Successor to Dr. No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is one of the few Bond films that remains as close as possible to the espionage game as it was played during the Cold War. That was the Bond era before the Blofelds, the Strombergs and the Draxes decided that playing tin god was not enough. They had to become God by taking over the world. In FRWL, SPECTRE decides to pit British Intelligence against Soviet Intelligence and profit from the fall out. Did I hear you say that's familiar? Well, the prize in this film is not the ruler ship of good old Mother Earth but a Leptor Machine-a KGB encryption/decoding device similar to the WWII German Enigma Machine. Blofeld (whose face we still cannot see) assigns one of their members, KGB Colonel Rosa Klebb (chillingly played by Lotte Lenya) to head the operation. Klebb recruits naive Cipher Girl Tatiana Romanova to steal the machine. Romaonva in line with her instructions enlists the help of British Intelligence on the ground that she wants to defect because she fell in love with the picture of James Bond. Her gift for the defection is the Leptor Machine. Of course, the poor girl believes that she is working for KGB (believing the mission to be a fake defection), not knowing that she has unwittingly become the pawn of SPECTRE and that their choice for picking Bond was to have the added bonus of avenging their member Dr. No who was killed by Bond. SPECTRE would then have achieved two goals-selling the Leptor to the highest bidding country and killing Bond.It was a perfect plan, except that it had one fatal flaw. They picked the wrong fall guy-James Bond 007! In Sean Connery's second outing as the suave sophisticated secret agent, his acting had greatly improved. The harshness and impatience he had exhibited in Dr. No was gone. In FRWL, he was more relaxed showing that he had grown comfortable into the role of the world's most famous spy.In his quest, he was aided by Kerim Bay, a Turkish chieftain working for British Intelligence. Part of the film's success rested on the jocular Bay played with disarming appeal by Pedro Armenderiz who nearly stole the show from Connery. His performance outshone all the actors that have played Felix Leither. Impressive, considering that FRWL was his only Bond appearance. Aremenderiz soon after the filming of the movie tragically committed suicide because he was ravaged by cancer. I felt inexplicably sad when I read it up on IMDb. He was one of those endearing Bond characters that will remain in my memory.Another outstanding performance was given by Lotte Lenya. She proved to us that an elderly, frail looking woman could be as dangerous and worthy an adversary as any Bond could encounter. In fact, it is note worthy that after Bond's lethal combat with Rosa Klebb, the shaken Bond slumps in a seat and leans emotionally to Romanova for support.( Sorry about that spoiler but we all know that Bond would survive).Then Romanova?.aaaah?.Daniela Bianchi. The former Miss World or Universe may have ordinary thespian skills but there is nothing ordinary about her drop dead gorgeous looks. She can easily pass as one of the most beautiful girls ever to grace the Bond movies. Probably realizing that she will never be Meryl Streep, she eventually gave up acting to marry a wealthy shipping magnate. Don't blame him for falling for her. The lucky bastard! FRWL may not be as action packed as the subsequent Bond movies, and it sometimes drags, but it is still one entertaining ride. It also has the distinction of introducing one of the most lovable and enduring Bond characters, Q(then called Major Boothroyd) endearingly played by Desmond Lellwyn.The line of extra powerful, seemingly indestructible, blond henchmen that were to plague Bond's movies found their origin in FRWL in the form of KGB assassin, Donald Grant.(Robert Shaw).As one of the most realistic Bond movies, From Russia With Love is a film worthy of a Bond fan's love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The success of Dr No green-lit a sequel. The second Band movie was a fairly faithful adaptation of From Russia With Love, a tale in which Bond's prowess as a ladies' man is brought to bear on an attractive young defector who wishes to bring a decoding machine to the West. Only her defection is itself part of a plan by the Russian equivalent of MI5...There is a lot going on in FRWL, and most of it is rather better spying-type stuff than we saw in later movies. The locations (Istanbul, Venice, and points between) are gritty rather than exotic. There is spectacle, but it is relatively small scale. There are a couple of splendid villains in Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb and Robert Shaw's impassively hard Grant, and a thunderingly vicious fight between him and Bond, brilliantly staged in the claustrophobic confines of a train sleeper compartment - you don't have to go big to be effective.And Connery has settled into Bond's skin as if born to it. One of the very best of the Bond series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Penultimate Bond Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the plot, James Bond (Connery) travels to Istanbul to intercept an arranged defection of a supposed Russian agent (Bianchi) smuggling a strategically important intelligence machinery (a Lektor decoder) out of enemy possession. While the plan is of course a ruse, MI5 aren't sure of the ulterior motive, prompting some unexpected encounters with deadly assassins.I'll go out on a limb at this point and say that I think this is the best Bond film. Yes, it's dated. Yes, the last 20 minutes pale by comparison with the preceding 90. Yes, it's formulaic and often clichéd. Two nouns explain: Robert Shaw. His impressive CV will cite performances in "A Man For All Seasons" or "Young Winston" as being (critically) among his best, but spare a thought for his 'Red Grant' turn in this film. Cold, calculating and chillingly sadistic, he lurks in the background for much of the picture, and yet his presence resonates throughout, a constant threat to Bond and his allies, a villain of substance for the audiences.Supporting cast including Armendariz as the Turkish ally and Lenya as the evil mastermind add confident and professional depth to the characterisations, and help carry the film in Shaw's absence. Connery is far more relaxed than in "Dr No", managing a well balanced pitch hovering between intensity and humour as the scene demands. The locations are impressive, the gadgetry comic-book brilliance, and the deadly train fight between Shaw and Connery must be one of the most intense, well-choreographed and suspenseful action sequences of its ilk. It's one of those scenes you rewind and watch again to fully comprehend the impact.While arguably every Bond film has its merits and liabilities, "From Russia With Love" is perhaps one of the few that could stand independently of the character and still be regarded as a classic motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond caught in a spider's web of lust deceit and murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia with Love is one of those Bond movies that works on all levels and keeps up the pace like a finely tuned racing motor. From the Death of James bond in the opening scenes to the ending scenes where Bond is once again triumphant. Connery delivers a top notch performance as Bond he actually tops his DR.NO performance here. The Story like all Bonds is simple. A Russian woman contacts British intelligence telling them she has her hands on a new Russian decoding machine the Lektor. MI6 wants this machine but the woman offers her one condition she wants James Bond to collect it because she has fallen in love with him and wants to defect with Bond. From there the movie races into a quick pace with incredible people and incredible scenes. The Best are the ones with Robert Shaw as Red Grant The man sent to kill Bond on behalf of SPECTRE. The movie has SPECTRE trying to catch Bond in a scandal and having him commit suicide(Murdered) to undermine MI6's credibility. The plot almost works but this is James Bond and he beats the bad guys with a great amount of luck,skill, and toughness. From Russia With Love is a movie to be on anyone's must see list because once you've seen it. You will want to see it again and again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond seems more himself second time around...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second movie in the James Bond spy series, after his debut in "Dr.No". If you haven't seen that first movie, it might pay to view that first, as some plot strands carry over from that movie.By "Bond seems more himself second time around" I mean that he seems a bit more like the suave spy we think of, when we hear the name "Bond. James Bond". In "Dr.No" Connery seemed more of a white collar civil servant than poster boy.The setting:Istanbul, Turkey. You do get some depictions of gypsies...not sure how accurate it is...seems pretty bogus, if 'colourful'.The plot:The ludicrously named SPECTRE (you really must see the first movie in the series to see why I think this...this is obviously where the parody of the US sitcom "Get Smart" comes from!) have a diabolical plan to steal a Russian decoding machine, with the unwitting help of British spy James Bond. Once they acquire this device, they plan on killing him, in a horrible kind of way, as revenge for his killing Dr.No.Movie conventions: Pre-title sequence: Yes. It does have that tunnel graphic of Bond shooting at you (as the first movie had), but then goes into what would become standard franchise fare...some scenes before the title comes up...oh...just found out recently that this "tunnel" is actually meant to be the barrel of a gun...not that this new info makes any more sense than the tunnel idea!Title theme: No. Two movies in, and still no sign of the signature James Bond theme by a guest artist. You do get instrumental music in this movie, which might be of the song tied to this movie. However, you do have hear the 'title' song played, in passing, in the movie. You get the 'proper' version of it during the end credits...the pieces are starting to fall into place.Silly female character names: No! Must have forgotten about that element! Q: Yes. Turns out this is short for "Q Branch". The head of this branch makes his first appearance in a Bond movie here. They are the 'gadget' division...when you think of all those incredible devices Bond uses to get himself out of a pickle, it came from "Q".Bond's wine knowledge: This is the movie where the significance of this cliché comes into play. In the debut, it was pretty much a throwaway reference, but in this movie, it's point becomes apparent...these movies have class consciousness at their core...Bond's knowledge of wines etc are meant to illustrate his breeding and class. You can't fake class, it seems. And something of importance is shown to ride on this knowledge.Sexism: Maybe. Not sure, but when Bond is with Sophia in this movie, I wasn't sure if he made an oral sex joke here ("How about that lunch?"), the first time we meet him. Bond also makes a joke about a character's "technique" with women, which might not be pc. We also see James slap a woman around...in the first movie he was a party to someone else doing just that...which could make one suppose that Bond is NOT sexist on this count...being a woman is no defence to violence that Bond would inflict on any recalcitrant male!End teaser: Yes. This is the first time in the series that the next movie in the franchise is mentioned in the end credits.Some things to watch out for:* What did Bond have in mind when he told of himself and "M" having an "interesting experience" in Tokyo? Some sort of exotic caper with women, it seems. Scene - Bond on tape, being heard at table with Q etc.* Bond being thwacked on the head by a blind on a train. Keep rolling! Similar scene in the first movie when he was with Honey...she bangs her head against him, and he later near trips. This is all 'one take, please' territory! Bond's adversary in this movie, Donald Grant, looks rather like Joe Bugner at times in this movie.The first time I saw this movie on TV, a month or so ago, I thought it was better than the debut, and was inclined to give it 7/10. Since the movie was repeated last night, I thought I'd watch it again, in order to note some things about the development of the franchise (and I might have misplaced my original notes). With these Bond movies, I don't think they bear repeating in a short span of time...more inclined to give it 3/5 as a result of seeing it again so quickly after my first view.Score: one time 7/10...more than once, in quick succession...6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bond canon begins to firm up even more with the second movie. We have the first appearance of Desmond Llewellyn as Q, a post he would hold for 16 movies. We also begin the tradition of lush John Barry scores, with this song winning some awards and selling well. Connery gets a bit suaver, which he needed to do, while still retaining the brutality of the character, something the later movies (post Connery) seemed to forget until Daniel Craig took the role. Robert Shaw is great as a baddie, and Lotte Lenya is a hoot as some kind of Russian officer of questionable sexual orientation who almost does Bond in (indeed, she did in the book!) Istanbul provides a suitably exotic background for the action, and Pedro Armendarez turns in a great performance as one of my favorite Bond sidekicks. The train fight is justly lauded for its intensity. A lot of people think this is the best Bond movie, but my personal favorite is You Only Live Twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong contender for the best Bond film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Dr. No, the Bond producers quickly plan a sequel. The question of which of Fleming's novels they would adapt next was decided on From Russia with Love, after when President Kennedy listed the novel among his top ten favourite novels of all time, in a list published in Life Magazine.After his 007 debut in Dr. No, which put him on the map, Connery returns for his second outing. He seems to be more comfortable in the role the second time, something that seems common amongst the other actors in their second film. His enthusiasm shines through, before getting tired of the silly gadgets and over-the-top plots.While most of the later films in the series have over-the-top plots and don't bother to escape the formula established by Goldfinger, the storyline to this film is extremely realistic and low-key. No megalomaniac villain seeking world domination, no butler henchmen with bowler hats or giants with metal teeth. Simply put, 007 is sent to pick up a deciphering machine whilst falling into a trap set up by SPECTRE. Furthermore, the film faithfully adapts one of Fleming's best stories whilst changing the villains of the story from SMERSH to SPECTRE and changing the ending plus adding on the boat chase and the helicopter attack at the end. Lastly, the film doesn't get bogged down by the formula as it didn't get established until Goldfinger, the next film.From Russia with Love is noteworthy for it's suspense. No other film in the series manages to create so much suspense out of it's plot. Take the 15 minutes or so leading up to the train fight, not many other scenes in the series has bettered the acting and the writing here. Lastly, the train fight itself is raw and violent and is still unsurpassed today. Later films like The Spy Who Loved Me have tried to replicate the fight here but have only paled in comparison.Simply put, From Russia with Love is one of the best Bond films ever and is a great adaptation of a great book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dynamic Sean Connery is back as the super spy James Bond 007 in what is definitely one of the best in the entire series by fans and critics alike. For me, this is the real kickoff for the series and it totally delivers the goods. It has a certain sense of epic grandeur and international intrigue while still a maintaining that fun and lively tone. The evil SPECTRE organization plans to steal a cryptographic device from the Russians and sell it back to them. Knowing that British Secret Service would like to get their hands on it as well, they decide to lure them in as revenge for killing their operative Dr. No, the villainous title character of the previous film. They realize of course that MI6 would be well aware that it's a trap and would accept it as challenge, ultimately they send an unwitting cypher clerk Tatiana Romanova to help a British secret agent steal the device away from trouble and once it is out, have a specially trained assassin kill the agent and take it for their own evil scheme. What they seem to have overlooked is that secret agent James Bond is a most formidable opponent and is not to be underestimated by any means. I think one thing I should say is about this movie is that it goes above and beyond what the first film did, high adventure and spectacular action but with plenty of espionage and mystery. There's less of Bond going around and asking questions and actually going out and doing stuff. The plot itself has a lot going on and requires a watchful eye.The action sequences in the movie are astounding as well and I do mean that with great sincerity, the first major scene takes place at a gypsy camp with all fistfights and gun play our hearts desire, there's a scene where Bond has to avoid being killed by a helicopter, a boat chase and much more. But even the action doesn't overshadow the more subtle side, there's always a great deal of suspense and a lot of realism that isn't always seen in the later films. Even though this is the second film in the series, it really feels like it could be the first one, it takes the gun barrel sequence introduced in the first film and gives it a new formula that carries on throughout the series, from inside the gun we see Bond walking past, he quickly shoots at the killer and blood pours down the screen, after that we get a pre-title action scene with what appears to be Bond playing cat and mouse with an assassin. The gadgets in the film is another element that would become a trademark of the series but to be quite honest I think I should talk a little bit about them here. Bond's little toys are provided by Desmond Llewelyn's character Q and surprisingly enough they are totally believable and sound exactly like something that could exist in real life. This time Bond gets a briefcase with a special knife that can be pulled out, a canister of tear gas that can be activated by trying to open the briefcase in a certain way, and even the villains have some notable gadgets, but I'll let you see for yourself.Besides blabbering about the action and gadgets, I think it's time I talk about the characters. Sean Connery returns as our hero and still has all the intensity, confidence and charm displayed in the first film. His love interest is the absolutely gorgeous Tatiana Romanova played Daniella Bianchi, she is a cypher clerk working for the Soviet Union and is forced to assist Bond in finding the decoder device, unfortunately she is completely unaware that she is a pawn in SPECTRE's deadly game of chess. The chemistry between Bond and Tatiana works very well and is actually pretty romantic, of course their growing relationship is constantly tested by the dangers they face. Bond's ally is Turkish agent Ali Kerim Bey, a totally likable and cool character who helps MI6 get information and makes false papers for Bond and Tatiana so that they can travel out of Russia. Then of course there are the villains, we get our first glimpse of the mysterious and currently unnamed Number One, the founder of SPECTRE with the purpose of taking over the world. Then there's Kronsteen, a Chess grandmaster who plans the operation whose arrogance doesn't fly to well with Number One. Rosa Klebb is a former Soviet colonel assigned with seeing that operation goes according to plan and personally assigns Tatiana to meet with 007, I swear this lady really creeps me out. The real scene stealer of the baddies is Red Grant, a formidable foe played by Robert Shaw. This guy is a beast, he follows Bond everywhere and even helps carry out his mission, in a way making him a pawn of SPECTRE. When he and Bond finally meet face to face aboard the Orient Express, we get some of the best interaction between hero and villain. To be honest, this movie is amazing and it still holds up well even today. It's aged very gracefully and never goes into cheesy territory, it's plausible but completely exciting and is one of the coolest films of the sixties, watch it and see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Bond film of all time !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1964 this was the second in a long line of James Bond films, and in many people's eyes including my own it was the very best by far, and it still puts all the others in the shade.Excellent cast, excellent story, excellent acting, excellent directing and excellent photography.Connery was on top form and firing on all cylinders, but he had his work cut in the acting stakes to stay ahead (and only just) of Robert Shaw who was superb as the psychotic SMERSH (or is it SPECTRE?) assassin Grant. Lotte Lenya was also outstanding as the other SMERSH/SPECTRE operative Rosa Klebb, and this gave Lenya's already long film career a further boost.In my opinion what separates this film from all the others was the lack of a plethora of gimmicks and special effects that were to become, unfortunately, the trademark of later Bond films. A special mention should be made of the penultimate scene in which the escaping Bond is chased by the enemy gunboats, and the subsequent battle that takes place. It is an outstanding, gripping and genuinely dangerous scene and played for real and the SMERSH/SPECTRE actors/crews really earn their pay! These days it would sadly be done by computers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Dr. No and with the publicity granted the novel by President Kennedy listing it as one of his top 10 favourites, From Russia With Love was put into production in 1962. Sean Connery reprises the role of 007 and Terrance Young would again handle directorial duties.The plot involves an attempt by S.P.E.C.T.R.E, the criminal organisation Bond's previous adversary Dr. No was affiliated with, to steal a Russian decoding machine by playing the East and the West against each other. A beautiful Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova, played by the lovely Daniela Bianchi, is unwittingly used by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in order to lure Bond into the trap of having him steal the devise so that they can steal it from him.From Russia With Love is first and foremost a spy thriller. Almost none of the clichés that riddle later instalments, and indeed the previous one, are to be found here. The villain does not reside in some extravagant lair and there is no easily-escapable-death-trap into which Bond is placed. Instead, for the most part, we have villains who are human rather than cartoony and sets which while impressive are not overly grand. Blofeld makes his first appearance here, although you never see his face, and it is rather hard not to have a little chuckle at the cat stroking mastermind with the hindsight of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers but you can hardly blame From Russia With Love for being spoofed later down the line. The plot is reasonably complex and is not just an excuse to move from one action scene to another. In fact, upon re-watching the early Bond films recently I was surprised to see how little action there is. Cleary the series started out as a somewhat reasonable attempt at being serious, even though there are quips and laughs to be found, and From Russia With Love is the best example of this. The action that is delivered includes a well executed gun battle at a gypsy camp and a North By Northwest inspired helicopter attack.Much of the film takes place in Istanbul and is set at night or within buildings, which makes a stark contrast to the bright and breezy Jamaica setting of Dr. No. The third act, however, sees Bond and Tania travelling on the Orient Express whilst being stalked by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent Red Grant, played to perfection by Robert Shaw. He is a hulking monster of a man and when he and Bond come to blows it is one of the few times in the series you genuinely feel 007 could be in danger. Grant is a great henchman and is one of the more memorable Bond baddies, even without having a somewhat silly characteristic such as metal teeth or throwing a bowler hat to make him stick in the audiences mind. As previously mentioned, he and Bond have a great fight aboard the Orient Express and it is easily one of the best fight scenes in cinema history. Watching this scene is a refreshing reminder that Bond was indeed brutal a long time before Daniel Craig put on the tuxedo. The entire build up to the fight is a master class in creating tension and showcases acting, directing and editing at its finest. This is not just "good for a Bond film", it's good, no scratch that, GREAT, for any film. Much of this has to do with the inspired and somewhat groundbreaking editing techniques employed by Peter Hunt and it is no coincidence that Hunt's turn as directing Bond, with On Her Majesty's Secret Service, also has some of the best and most brutal punch ups of the series.Having a great supporting cast is essential to a film of this nature. With much of the dialogue consisting of exposition you need actors who can pull it off without boring the audience and From Russia With Love is no exception. From Pedro Armendáriz, who plays Bond's contact Kerim Bey in Istanbul, to Rosa Klebb, the slimy SMERSH defector who is brilliantly played by Lotte Lenya the film is full of wonderful performances. Daniela Bianchi also does a great job in her role and although saddled with some of the usual 'silly woman' dialogue the Bond films have in abundance, she manages to stand out from the crowd as one of the more memorable Bond girls. This film also marks the first appearance of Desmond Llwellyn as Major Boothroyd AKA 'Q', replacing Peter Burton from Dr. No.The opening titles are really the only bone I have to pick with the movie. Surprisingly, considering the high calibre of the rest of the film, I really don't like From Russia With Love's titles at all. The idea of projecting the credits onto the bodies of belly dancers may have sounded good in the board room but it just looks rather cheap on the screen.I cannot recommend this film highly enough, to anybody from thriller fans to the connoisseur of classic cinema, From Russia With Love is about as good as it gets in all categories. As entertaining as they are I urge you to forget about the jet packs, invisible cars, spaceships, piranhas, ski chases and underwater lairs of later instalments and treat yourself to a solid spy adventure which proves that Bond doesn't need gadgets and gimmicks to be the best screen spy in the world, he just is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Russia With Love" is the film to showcase when talking about the greatness of cinematic 007. Lean, exciting, full of splendid atmosphere, tight suspense, and non-distracting humor, it's almost too good a story for the high-adventure but often-formulaic James Bond series.Bond (Sean Connery) is called upon not to save the world but capture a Soviet cipher machine with the help of lovestruck Soviet agent Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi). Neither knows they are mere pawns in an elaborate trap set not by the Soviets but the evil international organization SPECTRE.Connery as Bond gets to fight his two most splendid adversaries (Robert Shaw as the psycho killer Grant and Lotte Lenya as deadly-kicking Rosa Klebb), befriend his best ally (Pedro Armendáriz as Turkish section chief Kerim Bey), and explore with the ravishing Bianchi Bond's most intriguing romance of the Connery era. It's not love, but it's not disinterested sex, either. Bond knows nothing is as simple as it looks here, approaching Tatiana with a delicate mixture of suspicion and charm that keeps the wheels turning."I think my mouth is much too big," Tatiana says."No, it's the right size...for me, that is," Bond replies.Even potential mistakes work to its advantage. The plot is more convoluted than it needs to be in order for the filmmakers to eliminate the original novel making the U.S.S.R. the bad guy, which would have hurt its international distribution. But the addition of SPECTRE turns out to be a brilliant coup for how it keeps everyone guessing. When Grant starts killing Bulgarian operatives early on, it seems an oversight given how it potentially endangers SPECTRE's own plans by putting more heat on Bond before the trap is sprung. But it lends Grant added menace and mystery, especially when we see him working in Bond's interests later, readjusting the scales.The film is much celebrated for its train-fight sequence between Connery and Shaw. As good as the fight itself is, the build-up is even better. Seeing Grant before Bond does, we sweat the sudden opening of every compartment door and window shade. Then, when they meet, and Grant plays at being Bond's ally, he needles us with his repetition of the overly British salutation "old man". Director Terence Young wasn't always the best at blocking action sequences (see the gypsy camp sequence) but he knew like no other Bond director how to set the table and roil the blood."The first one won't kill you," Grant gloats. "Not the second. Not even the third."The double-barreled finale (helicopter attack followed by boat chase) might seem a bit like overegging the pudding, though the first sequence holds up well despite one shot that shows two Bonds (Connery and a stunt double?) in the same frame. It's the first time you felt the Eon Productions team pushing to maximize the impact of a Bond film, yet it never feels labored, thanks especially to Connery.Connery was settling into his role nicely here, displaying his trademark grin and beginning to showcase the humor that came to the fore best in his next two films. At the same time, the dangerous Bond who shot an unarmed man in "Dr. No" is still in evidence, especially when he distrustfully slaps Tatiana. It's a bracing combination that makes for a complex, compelling performance.Everything about "From Russia With Love" clicks; it's only a question of how well. It's the one Bond film worth recommending to any film lover, and an adventure worth reliving over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one does feel like a frustrated adolescent's dream: the igniting force of the narrative is a single photo, and the subsequent travelogue is spiced up with local colour and with a boyish sense of adventure. There is a quirkiness in the film that hasn't been repeated since (the peculiar voyeurism with which the film witnesses the fight between the two gypsy women, being one example) and its depiction of sex-and-violence does have a perversive brushwork applied upon (rarely has a movie been so fondly memorable for men being strangled and women being slapped). The hero starts off his journey as a cosmopolitan dandy and transforms in the process into a lethal weapon outdoing any obstacle in his way. Vicious, sadistic, quirky fun. Possibly the best Bond film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia with Love -- A Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Terence Young's "From Russia with Love," in my opinion, has to be the best Bond film of the entire series (though "Goldfinger" comes very close to taking that spot). Once again, Sean Connery is fantastic as James Bond, though perhaps even more so since he has (by this point) become more comfortable in that role. The plot, which combines the perfect plan to kill James Bond with an effort to steal the lector coding device and sell it back to the Russians, is well constructed. The Bond girls are more dazzling than ever, especially Tatiana Romanova (played by Daniela Bianchi). Tatiana makes for an interesting Bond girl because, for reasons that I will not go into, James Bond cannot bring himself to trust her even though he is very attracted to her. That tension between sexual attraction and mistrust creates an interesting dynamic and makes Tatiana much more complex than, let's say, Honey Ryder. James Bond is also introduced to some ingenious gadgets, like an unusual suitcase, which are never spoken of again until they suddenly make their appearance towards the end of the film.Yet beside these wonderful elements, Terence Young masterfully conjures up the glamorous world of espionage (never mind that such a world does not exist for real spies). In "From Russia with Love," this glamorous world is situated in Istanbul, Turkey during the early 1960s where Sean Connery's James Bond checks for listening devices in his hotel room, picks up a secret message from a fellow spy in a museum, spies on Russian agents while beneath Constantine the Great's (305-337 AD) aqueducts, visits a gypsy camp, and makes love to Tatiana Romanova. Then we are taken on a wonderful train ride throughout Europe where James Bond is destined to come face to face with his arch nemesis, an assassin who goes about his work like a master. The train has been an effective plot device ever since Alfred Hitchcock directed "The Lady Vanishes." In "From Russia with Love," Terence Young once again demonstrates how effectively the train sequence can be inveigled into the plot to build up suspense until the climactic confrontation between the arch-villain Grant and James Bond. Will Tatiana betray James Bond? Will James Bond and Tatiana escape the Russians with the lector? When will James Bond discover that an assassin was being sent to kill him? What will James Bond do once he finds out? These are the kinds of questions that build up the level of suspense during the train sequence of this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best-ever Bond films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After getting off to a solid, albeit somewhat shaky start with "Dr. No," the series really hits its stride with this second sterling entry. This time ace super agent James Bond (the one and only Sean Connery in peak rugged form) has to stop the evil SPECTRE organization from getting their hands on a Soviet Lektor decoding machine. Director Terence Young, working from a smart and tricky script by Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood, relates the absorbing and intricate story at a steady pace and maintains a generally serious and gritty tone that's punctuated with inspired moments of fine dry humor. Connery effortlessly carries the picture with his magnetic screen presence and smooth charisma, the delicious Daniela Bianchi makes for a very fetching and appealing love interest as the sweet and unsuspecting Tatiana Romanova, Lotte Lenya as the ruthless Rosa Klebb and Robert Shaw as vicious fearsome killer Red Grant both impress as splendidly nasty villains, Pedro Armendariz is a jolly treat as Bond's cheery Turkish rival Al Kerim Bey, plus there are nifty appearances by series regulars Robert Shaw as Bond's no-nonsense superior M, Lois Maxwell as lovestruck secretary Miss Moneypenny, and Desmond Llewelyn as crafty gadget master Q. Eunice Gayson also returns as the sultry Sylvia Trench. Martine Beswicke and Alizu Gur have a terrifically fierce catfight scene as a couple of fiery gypsy girls. Although this film starts out a touch slow, it definitely picks up steam as it unfolds and gets cracking in the taut, gripping and suspenseful last third. Stirring highlights include the ferocious rough'n'tumble fight between Bond and Grant on board a train, Bond facing off with a helicopter, and a thrilling climactic boat chase. Bond's steamy seduction of Tatiana in a hotel room is likewise memorable. John Barry's swinging and spirited score hits the groovy spot. Ted Moore's sumptuous cinematography gives the movie a handsome glossy look. Nice melodic lounge-style theme song, too. But it's the film's admirably tough-minded sensibility (Bond hits Tatiana at one point!) and refreshing lack of flashy gimmicks which make it one of the stand-out entries in the series. Essential viewing for 007 fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love From Russia with love. Something about it just makes me want to forget about Dr. No, which I didn't love. I thought Dr. No was good, but there wasn't enough excitement. From Russia with Love is a lot different. This time I understood the plot, There was a lot of action sequences, and it was more interesting. You get a bit more dialogue from James Bond himself too. From Russia with love, to me, makes up for Dr. No. I know I sound a little stupid if I say I wanted more excitement from a James Bond film or anything. It's like saying that Transformers 2 was a fantastic movie and you only watched it for Megan Fox and the special effects. Transformers 2 wasn't that good anyways. I am not that way with From Russia with love. I pay attention and I loved it. Not only is it high on entertainment, it is high on romance, because the main Bond girl in Dr. No(Ursella Andress) was in it for half an hour. There wasn't much love in the air. Bond only wanted her for sex. Bond is a bit different in this film, he may actually love Tatiana Romanova. I think that Ursella Andress was hotter, but Tatiana Romanova gets more screen time. From Russia with love isn't my favorite Bond film, but it's one of the best. From Russia with love: ****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Bond Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was much younger I was a James Bond fanatic. This was partially due to my dad, who was also an avid fan of the espionage thrillers. It was also partially due to the fact that ITV used to pack their schedules with what now feels like about twenty Bond films a day. It was for this reason that I was thrilled to hear that my local Cineworld was screening 'From Russia With Love'. I've got good memories of that film. Happily sitting there watching it with my dad on an old jumpy video, the picture grainy from overuse of the tape. Good times. But sometimes going back to revisit childhood memories can really tarnish those cherished moments of your life. Sometimes they can act as confirmations of ones growing maturity that you don't get as excited about massive explosions and brutal fist fights like you used to. You start noticing little flaws and nitpick away until, instead of a cherished memory, you're left with this deflated feeling of disappointment. You begin to doubt that the thing you had once loved so much was even any good in the first place.That was how I started to feel after about fifteen minutes of watching 'From Russia With Love'. After the novelty of seeing the 1963 classic up on a big screen with what was a genuinely good remastered print had worn off, I am ashamed to say that I got a bit bored. It never occurred to me how slow the opening to this film actually is. This isn't helped by the fact that the opening is filled to the brim with clunky exposition and wishy-washy character introductions that make the film feel overly fragmented. Definite deflation was occurring as I sat in the cinema that was populated by me, my girlfriend, and some old guy who stayed so frighteningly still that I became worried that he might be dead (Just to clarify, it turned out he wasn't.) But the flaws of the opening sequences are soon forgiven when the film starts to really kick into gear. It's like the start of the film is simply putting together all of these cogs so that it can become an impressively intricate machine later on. When all the elements of the plot are introduced and things start actually happening, you get pulled in and simply enjoy yourself. And that is what this film is about. It doesn't try to bring in any lofty themes or impress the viewer with any kind of directorial genius. It is pure unadulterated fun, which is something that films like this don't get enough credit for, and is a feat which newer more serious Bond films have been trying to avoid.Adding to the enjoyment are some classic set-pieces that stick in your mind. Whilst watching this film, I could feel all of the synapses in my brain firing away as they fondly recalled little lines here and there, remembered little great moments. There is a reason why some regard 'From Russia With Love' as one of the best Bond films ever made, and that reason is that it managed to create so many iconic scenes. From a suspenseful train sequence to a bizarre poisonous shoe finale, there are just so many ideas that feel right and never seem contrived or ridiculous.That's not to say that I think 'From Russia With Love' is a complete masterpiece. There are still problems I have with it. For instance, it's difficult to understand how, even in the 1960s, the rampant misogyny of James Bond could have ever been deemed as acceptable behaviour. Bonds treatment of women in the film is actually quite offensive in this politically correct generation we live in and ages the film terribly. A lot of people claim that Bond can get away with it because of his supposedly irrevocable charm, which is true of some of the Bond films but not this one. In 'From Russia With Love' he just comes across as an outright sleaze ball. It is funny at times but can also feel excruciatingly perverse.However, it is difficult to get away from how well paced Bonds second outing is, especially when compared with later outings in the series (That's right Roger Moore, I'm looking at you.) This is not the hyperactive shooty-shooty-bang-bang Bond of later generations. There is a more realistic and thoughtfully put together plot that runs through 'From Russia With Love'. The use of the cold war as a background only underscores the notion that it has one foot set firmly in the reality of espionage. An attempt to steal a machine that decodes spy signals is a far more grounded notion than the usual evil genius attempts to take over the world concept.So there's my thoughts on the film. Did I feel that one of my childhood memories had been ruined by re-watching 'From Russia With Love'? Not at all. It is still a very good film that stands up well today and there are some cracking plot twists that create genuine tension and atmosphere in parts of the film. There are some elements that badly age the film but that's to be expected. After all, each new incarnation of Bond is a product of his time. And this product certainly beats the hell out of Roger Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the phenomenal success of Dr No it was decided that the next Flemming novel to be adapted will be From Russia with love. FRWL was the first Bond movie to have a singer sing the title song(in the case of FRWL Matt Munro sings it). With this review I think I'll do something that I haven't done with my previous Bond movie reviews and try to make comparisons with the novel against. Firstly I love the novel FRWL and it is my favourite Bond novel mainly because it tries to break away from the tried and tested formula, the bond novel dealt with SMERSH trying to lure Bond into a trap and planning to kill him. In the book a lot of thought is given to the SMERSH's plan whilst in the movie it cuts right to the action(which is not necessarily a bad thing for me). Bond is sent to bring a woman to England who has specifically asked for him. His superiors sense a trap but give her the benefit of doubt because they are interested in the decoding machine she possesses. Unfortunately their first hunch was correct, she was coerced into SMERSH's plan to lure Bond and let SMERSH kill him. SMERSH's many attempts to kill him fail with some terrific action sequences. FRWL is has two wonderful megavillians, the first is Rosa Klebb and Red Grant. With the other Bond novels it is very easy for me to decide which is better, the novel or the movie but with FRWL I find it very hard because each has some redeeming features that the other doesn't have. The movie was far more thrilling because of the action but on the other hand the book goes into great detail about SMERSH's plan which the movie doesn't have. Maybe I should just say that they are as equally good as the other and end the debate I have with myself.</fullReview>

However, I was slightly disappointed by this as I did not like it as much as the first James Bond, "Dr No." I preferred "Dr. No" because the main woman was much better than in this, I found the plot line more interesting and it also went much quicker in ways of fighting, scheming and the storyline itself. I found this very much slower, which I did not enjoy all that much. Things I did like about this film are: yet again, SEAN CONNERY as James Bond, the woman villains (I did not like the personalities of these characters, but it is interesting to see proper woman villains), Spectre (mentioned above) and the locations (also mentioned above).I recommend this film to people who like slower fighting scenes and a slower (while still exciting enough) plot and to people who think that a location in a film is very important. Enjoy "From Russia With Love"! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second bond film (Of Many Of course) and this is really where the series begins to take form. They have the gun barrel scene we all have come to love and the famous start and catchphrases that made Bond Bond.The first movie had Bond go to Jamaica to try and find a missing colleague, in that film the action was much slower pace compared to this movie and the action is done with more style.As for storyline in this one, we see Bond and this time he is going to Russia to try and stop SPECTRE from taking a machine that will reveal Russian secrets and plays Russia against America while doing this. We also have the Bond girl, who is unwillingly working for SPECTRE thinking she is working for SMERSH. There is a lot of deceit going on as Bond has to take on evil again in this great sequel to DR. NO Another thing about Dr. No was that Bond had not really found its form yet. And would definitely be a forgotten film without the sequels. In this film we can see just how good Bonds character is, with the storyline serving up more action and more thrills then the first movie.Overall, I don't think it is the best bond like many people say but it is up there. I rate it 76%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Paved the Way of The Bond Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the best of the James Bond series. Before the mindless drivel that ruined the series in later Bond films (the tongue-in-cheek humor, the crazy gadgets and the same tiresome plots), this early entry to the 007 legacy represents itself as a standard fare thriller without the caricatured cat-and-mouse chases. I can't say that I've read every James Bond novel Ian Fleming ever wrote, but I will say that the best of the Bond series are the ones that sticks to the parameters of the novel. "From Russia With Love" gives us the most accurate portrayal of 007 James Bond, a secret agent heavily involved in Cold War predicament, before Bond was used as a campy box office action hero whose purpose is just to entertain the audience.There was a bit of humor involved, but it is still light compared to how Roger Moore took over the helm as 007 when the action exceeded the storyline that made Sean Connery's 007 famous to begin with. By setting the story during the Cold War is a provocative principal in placing our hero in danger, and Robert Shaw's ruthless Red Grant is the main attraction for this cause. From the streets of Istanbul,Turkey to the train of the Orient Express, Grant follows Bond and during Bond's mission, we feel a sense of alienation within our hero. All alone in a foreign land where nobody knows him, except for Kerim Bay (Pedro Armendariz) who serves as his ally and another person destined to kill him. "From Russia With Love" has a more humanistic approach to the Bond character, especially since we are convinced that this agent's life is in danger. In troubled times we're to think that Bond wouldn't come out of it alive. But as his laid-back attitude continues to increase in later films, Bond is portrayed as a superhero. This sense of isolation is effective in this type of espionage thrillers. The dangerous situations are non-stop from the opening titles, his fights in the streets of Istanbul, his fight for dear life on the Orient Express to Bond dodging a helicopter attack.The series had its share of hits and misses. It became a liability when Connery grew out of the series and Roger Moore doctored the series into a cat-and-mouse thrill ride. The James Bond saga is entirely supposed to be 100% serious. It's for the viewers to enjoy. It's just not designed to be taken as a character fighting evil for thrills. He's a real character facing real situations and "From Russia With Love" succeeds there by making the audience believe that Bond's life is in danger. And Bond is on his own, relying on sharp wit and skills to escape his dangers. This second installment to the 007 series may be the most accurate to the other adaptations to Fleming's other stories and at the same time provides spine-tingling entertainment to satisfy any action lover out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Russia with Love" really grows on you. I didn't like it the first time I saw it, only tolerated it on my second viewing, but since have enjoyed it thoroughly on all subsequent viewings. Although I'm a bigger fan of "Dr. No" I think than many others, "From Russia with Love" is a better overall effort, mostly thanks to the sharp and witty script. This movie is funny, charming, sexy, thrilling, and fairly well-plotted, although I don't particularly care for the way it was wrapped up.Sean Connery is a great Bond, that's not even in question, but it's so striking how especially good he is in these first two films. There's a real enthusiasm here and it feels like more than just professionalism. Likewise, Terrence Young directs the film very well, as he did with several other Bond features. The film moves at a fast pace and is never remotely boring.I think what's impressive and different about "From Russia with Love" is that it features Bond as a spy rather than an action hero. Sure, the action here is spectacular but it's not the main focus of the film, and although Bond is not a realistic character as far as espionage fiction goes, I find the more humble and simple entries in the series to often be better."From Russia with Love" is the first Bond film scored by John Barry. No further comment is necessary, as Barry's Bond scores are consistently brilliant and are simply legendary, and it goes without saying that this is a major improvement over the "Dr. No" score by Monty Norman."From Russia with Love" is certainly one of the better Bond entries, and one that is a more focused and complete entry than most of these films. It has some problems, sure, but it's still one of the better entries even if it began the tradition of veering away from Fleming's Bond.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is a shining example that a Bond movie can stick close to a Bond book and be very good, or in this case, the very best. There are a few differences of course (the biggest being the introduction of SPECTRE in the movie) but they are quite similar. Moore fans won't like this one, with a quite serious Bond falling (unknowingly) into the Russians' scheme to eliminate Her Majesty's most beloved agent using a Lektor machine as bait. Kerim, Rosa Klebb, Kronsteen, Red Grant, and Tatiana Romanova are some of the best characters in the series, all played to perfection, or close to it (since Tatiana is a brunette in the book), by the actors who portray them. The scenes between Connery and Shaw are absolutely spectacular. Also take note of the scene with Kronsteen and Klebb speaking with Blofeld, the helicopter attack and the boat chase. I will not give any movie a 10, just as I will not give a 1 but this one comes close. Well written, well-acted, well-directed. The best of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>everything you've come to expect from a Bond film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure I agree with those who think 'From Russia With Love' is the best James Bond film, but it certainly is the prototype. 'Dr. No' got things off to an exciting, low-budget start, and it seems clear that the creators of the second 007 flick felt secure enough that they were establishing a franchise to reinforce (and in some cases, introduce) most of the series' trademarks: Q and his gadgets, the pre-title sequence, Bond's flirtation with Moneypenny, a helicopter attack, etc. The movie in fact is so energetic and works so much into its almost two-hour running time, some of its clumsiness can be easily forgiven and even provides a measure of charm. The plot actually is a bit underwhelming compared to later ones in the series. No nuclear blackmail or end-of-the-world scenarios here- 007 is merely out to locate and steal a decoding device from the Russians. But it's enough of an excuse to hang quite a number of exciting sequences on, including one of the most convincing fight scenes ever filmed, period. The 'Bond Girl' for this second installment is Daniela Bianchi and I would say she is the second most gorgeous actress to embody this recurring plot requirement, right behind Jill St. John from 'Diamonds Are Forever.' It says something about her physical attributes that it is not TOO noticeable another actress dubs in her dialogue. The Mexican actor Pedro Armendariz has a key role (and a lot of screen time) as Ali Kerim Bey, British Intelligence station chief in Istanbul. His is an embarrassingly amateurish performance and one wonders why he was given such a large role; another distraction but not a fatal one. Robert Shaw, on the other hand, is dead-perfect as the deadly assassin Red Grant, wonderfully menacing and very believable. In fact, these last two actors are a good example of the dichotomy apparent in 'From Russia with Love'. And it's not just good and bad actors; terrific scenes are followed by incredibly awkward ones (when SPECTRE officer Rosa Klebb gives Tatiana (Bianchi) her instructions, the scene is as clumsy as Klebb's attempts to grope her during the proceedings). A prolonged episode at a gypsy camp serves no purpose and when the camp is attacked by an armed gang, it reminds one more of a scene from 'The Alamo' than a James Bond vehicle. And John Barry's trademark music score is overused, to say the least, blaring off the screen as Bond walks quietly through a hotel room and at other inappropriate times. But this is all nitpicking, right? For every moment where you roll your eyes, there's another that will have you glued to the screen. The catacombs below the embassies are a nice touch, and there's the aforementioned punch-out between Bond and Grant, which I hereby nominate for All-time Best Fight Scene Onboard A Moving Train. Lotte Lenya is a memorably one-of-a-kind Bond villain, a short, thoroughly repulsive woman with a taste for dangerous footwear. There's another great action sequence with Bond and Tatiana making an escape by boat and blowing up four others in pursuit. Then at the very end, another tradition is established, that of gleefully silly 007 epilogues, with this perhaps the most supremely silly of them all- a shot of James Bond's hand waving bye-bye, as though he were rehearsing for a hand-puppet performance. As I said, 'From Russia With Love' may not be the best Bond, but it is without a doubt the most complete package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like its predecessor, this is a watchable Bond film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Dr. No", the first of the many James Bond flicks that have been made over the decades, it didn't take too long for the second one to come. "From Russia with Love", the follow-up to the "Dr. No", came the year after. Last week, after watching the first film for the second time (though it was the first time in many years), I watched this one for the first time. Like "Dr. No", seeing this follow-up was far from being my greatest movie-watching experience, but fortunately, both films left me reasonably impressed, enough for both of them to get a 7/10 in my book.James Bond, Agent 007, is sent to Istanbul, Turkey to search for Lektor, a Russian decoding machine, for the British Secret Service to gain access to Russian codes. However, this is actually a set-up from S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), who intend to avenge their Dr. No by using this machine as a plot to lure Bond into a trap and kill him! So, during the British secret agent's mission, he faces more than one enemy, including Red Grant, as well as Rosa Klebb, a former KGB agent who now works for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and can cleverly kill unsuspecting people with the poisoned tip of her shoe! Basically, watching this second Bond movie was a lot like watching the first. Although, it does have a more intense opening, with a man out in the dark we THINK is Bond at first. When I saw this, it made me think that maybe "From Russia with Love" would be somewhat superior to its predecessor, with more consistent suspense. Eventually, however, I was proved wrong, it turned out to be pretty much like "Dr. No" for me, not all consistent, with some forgettable moments, but with some good and memorable action scenes as well, including certain scenes on the train, as well as the boat chase. Of course, we can always expect attractive female characters in these movies, which many of us guys can see a highlight, and in this particular one, there is Tatiana Romanova, played by Daniela Bianchi.Unsurprisingly, this film has some dated elements, including the very noticeable back projection at the end. However, while "From Russia with Love" may not hold up as well today as certain other movies from the era, or before, I'm sure it has held up better than many other movies from decades ago. These early James Bond flicks certainly haven't been forgotten. I pointed out in my comment on "Dr. No" that it's not for people who need non-stop action in order to be entertained, but is probably worth watching for those who can enjoy slower spy thrillers with a reasonable amount of action. Well, if you ask me, that's the same case with this follow-up. I'm sure both films would easily bore more viewers today than they did back when they were first released in the early '60s, but fortunately, they can still entertain many people as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The All-Time Bond Greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays whenever a Bond film is trotted out on British television, the viewers' usual response is 'oh god, not him again!'. It was very different in 1976, the year 'From Russia With Love' got its I.T.V. premiere. 'Dr.No' debuted the year before to an audience of nearly twenty million. 'Bond' on television in those days was an event akin to a Royal Wedding or the finale of 'Britain's Got Talent'. Everyone watched. B.B.C.-1 made no effort to complete - they ran John Huston's 'Moby Dick', starring Gregory Peck, for the umpteenth time.I had not seen the Connery Bonds before - my first taste of 'Bond' on the big screen was 'Live &amp; Let Die' starring Roger Moore. 'Love' begins with a nervous-looking Bond stalked through a garden at night, firing his Walther PPK at thin air. A blond man strangles him with a wire hidden in a wrist-watch. Lights snap on. Agents of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. ( the Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge &amp; Extortion ) appear. The killing has been carefully timed. The dead 'Bond' is only a double. Psychopathic Red Grant ( Robert Shaw ) is specially selected for an important mission; seething at the loss of their agent Dr.No, the organisation wants both to kill Bond and discredit the British Secret Service into the bargain.They use a beautiful young woman, Tatiana Romanova, by making it appear that she wishes to defect, bringing along a Russian cypher machine - the Lektor. She will only go if the agent sent to bring her back to London is James Bond.It is obviously a trap, but the chance of getting a Lektor is too good to pass up, so off Bond flies to Istanbul, taking with him a gadget-laden briefcase supplied by Q ( Desmond Llewelyn's first appearance in the role ). This is a different Q to the stuffy, starchy character the world came to know and love.The film itself is quite different to its predecessor. Very Hitchockian, particularly the helicopter chase ( obviously inspired by the crop dusting plane scene in 'North By Northwest' ). Terence Young once again handles the directorial chores superbly, and gets first-rate support from editor Peter Hunt.As Bond, Connery is cool, elegant, sophisticated and slightly arrogant, you can see why even now his is still regarded as the definitive portrayal. The supporting cast are marvellous too, particularly Daniela Bianchi as 'Tatiana', Pedro Armendariz as 'Kerim Bey', Vladek Sheybal as 'Kronsteen', and Lotte Lenya as 'Rosa Klebb'. S.P.E.C.T.R.E. boss 'Ernst Blofeld' makes his debut, but is glimpsed rather than seen. The scene-stealer though is Robert Shaw as 'Red Grant'. He looks as though he really could kill Bond. His fight with 007 aboard the Orient Express is still for my money the most impressively choreographed action sequence in the whole series.Having arranged Monty Norman's 'James Bond Theme' for 'Dr.No', John Barry was promoted to composer, and turned in the first of several memorable scores. The title theme was by 'Oliver!' composer Lionel Bart, and sung by Matt Monro.Richard Maibaum's script is by and large faithful to Ian Fleming's book, with the addition of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and a number of outdoor action scenes, including the speedboat finale. The structure is impressive; the first part has the villains setting up the trap, the next sees Bond walking into it ( to obtain both the Lektor and the girl ), and in the last he fights to stay alive as the jaws begin to close shut.When 'Love' opened in 1963, the world welcomed it with open arms, and Bond's future on the silver screen was assured.One year ago, 'Love' secured the honour of becoming the first Eon Bond to be shown on the B.B.C. and how good it was to be able to watch one without all those annoying ad breaks, not to mention cuts. Alas I.T.V. continues to rape and pillage the 007 legacy; most recently, the films were used as 'fillers' on Saturday afternoons, a time usually reserved for children's movies and sports coverage. Bond deserves better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the second Bond film released. In my humble opinion, it is the best Bond film.In this adventure, Bond is sent to recover a Lektor decoding device from defecting Tatiana Romanova who works at the Soviet Counselate in Istanbul. Bond knows that it is a trap, but does not realize SPECTRE rather than SMERSH (the Soviet counter-espionage agency) is behind it. Blofeld's agent Kronsteen (a brilliant chess player) devised the plan and the recently defected Col. Klebb runs the operation. She selected Red Grant to kill 007 and retrieve the Lektor. Along the way, Bond is assisted by Kerim Bey (a Turk working for the British).The cast in this film is excellent. Connery, Daniela Bianchi, Pedro Armendariz, and Robert Shaw make this film a good one. Shaw is particularly menacing as Grant. The interplay between him and Connery on the train is very memorable and probably the best Bond/villain encounter in the whole Bond series. The other great part about this movie is that the story draws the viewer in. Bond is a little more human (in that he makes mistakes) than in the other films. It also didn't seem to rely on all the gadgets that the later Bond films sometimes employ (although he does have a pretty neat briefcase with sniper rifle).The other thing that makes this movie good is that it follows the novel. Granted, there was some deviation (there usually is), but the producers kept pretty close to Fleming's book. In addition, Sean Connery may not have been the first choice to play Bond, but his portrayal of Bond is certainly iconic. This film is a show case of not only Connery, but also the James Bond persona in total.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Espionage Thriller and an excellent 'Sequel' to Dr. No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the third James Bond film sent the benchmark for what was to follow, From Russia With Love was actually a proper sequel to Dr. No and an excellent thriller in its own right with very memorable characters and another great turn from Sean Connery as 007.This time round, the terrorist group S.P.E.C.T.R.E. have hatched a plan devised by Kronsteen, a World champion Chess player in which to plot James Bond and MI6 into obtaining a Lektor decoding machine from the Russians with the aid of a beautiful Cipher clerk. She is apparently infatuated with 007 after seeing a file photograph of him.Unknown to Bond, the Russian S.M.E.R.S.H. colonel Rosa Klebb has defected to S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and is controlling Tatiana's every move to ensure Bond meets his doom in the shape of a psychopathic assassin known as Donald Grant in order to humiliate the British Secret Service and have personal revenge for the death of a S.P.E.C.T.R.E. operative. Will Bond survive? Its a great story.The cast is even better second time round. Sean Connery looks exactly the same way he did in Dr. No and every bit as better in performance, the whole direction and pace looks and feels the same (down to excellent direction from Terence Young and editing from Peter Hunt) even though it is a completely different plot, its a sequel that lives up to its purpose in taking us further into James Bond's world.Lotte Lenya is brilliant as Rosa Klebb, hard as nail and chilling at the same time she is domineering in every scene she is in. Finally, Robert Shaw is the real scene stealer here as Grant, the assassin who confronts Bond on the Orient Express. Their confrontation is the real highlight of this film. Despite the excellent speed boat and helicopter chases towards the climax, its Bond and Grants fight to the death on the Train carriage that you will always remember...special mention must also go to Pedro Almendro (i think I've spelt his name wrong)! who played the great Kerim Bey, a memorable 007 ally who is charismatic from the moment we are first introduced to him.Daniella Blanchi is very beautiful, but a little wooden. Whats with the silly motions shes making with her hand while on the speedboat with Bond? Thats just daft. Probably to create a beguiling innocence or something.An absolute brilliant James Bond film and excellent sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great spy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dr.No" was a strong film and Albert R.Broccoli and Harry Saltzman could feel confident that they succeeded.In 1963 they decided to film possibly the strongest Ian Fleming novel "From Russia With Love".The plot is simple --- S.P.E.C.T.R.E plans to trap and kill Bond to avenge the death of Dr.No. This has to be one of the best spy films ever made.From the nasty opening sequence where a 'double' for 007 is strangled by Red Grant on Spectre island -- there is a feeling of menace and uncertainty that permeates this plot. What is great about it is that the villains seem to have the upper hand for most of this film and Bond is in jeopardy.Rosa Klebb as played by Lotte Lenya is a seriously frightening lady with poisoned knife in her shoe and a knuckle duster in her pocket.Red Grant stalks Bond in the early part of the film and Robert Shaw's icy stare is chilling -- he saves Bond's life at one moment in a very nonchalant way and barely says a word to any other character. Daniela Bianchi is beautiful as Tatiana Romanova and there is a very strong and romantic attachment between her and Bond.Pedro Armendariz is excellent as Kerim Bey, Bond's allie in Turkey-- Connery and he do wonders in showing an affection between the two( I like it when he tries to warn Bond off Tatiana -- "You're not using this...." and he places that line beautifully which finishes ".... and then go home!" -- knowing how much danger Bond is really in.The great thing about this film is that Sean Connery as James Bond brilliantly conveys that he is out of his depth -- he is not so assured and slightly off balance -- for most of the story he is not in control of the situation.. The meeting on the Orient Express of Bond and Grant leads with great subtlety to the most intense encounter in any Bond film.Grant poses as Nash, one of Bond's contacts.The big surprise initially is Robert Shaw being a polite and affable British agent 'on the go since breakfast'.They go for a meal -- Tatiana is there . Grant drugs her drink -- Bond pretends not to see. They go back to their compartment and then FINALLY Bond takes control -- the scenes following are the best acted and most exciting in any Bond film . Robert Shaw is no less than magnificent -- you totally believe that he is a spy -- 'we sweated your recognition code' conveys the world of the secret agents and how they live their lives. Sean Connery is just as strong in gently goading him into making the wrong move at the right time and there is a classic interchange between them -- Bond mutters something about 'red wine with fish ' and Grant replies 'you may know the right wines but you're the one on his knees' -- classic!.The fight that ensues is superbly filmed and edited -- I don't think that this sequence has been topped. Richard Maibaum's screenplay follows Ian Fleming's novel very closely and Terence Young's direction is so strong that as slick and brilliant as the other films are in the series -- I don't think it has been bettered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Bond flick ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's just about a perfect Bond flick - I'm not certain which is better, From Russia With Love or Goldfinger. The whole plot is a lot smarter, more complex and yet more restrained than its predecessor, Dr. No, which I'm not terribly fond of. Connery is at his wisecracking deadliest, Daniela Bianchi is gorgeous, and Robert Shaw provides a perfect parallel to Bond as the main henchman. The character of Kerim Bey is perhaps the best Bond ally the series has seen - so much more interesting than the various incarnations of the tiresome Felix Leiter. Also, who can forget Lotte Lenya's immortal turn as the disturbing killer Rosa Klebb? The plot follows Bond's attempt to recover the Soviet Lektor decoding device from Romanova, who is posing as a double agent to lure Bond into a trap. Romanova is unaware that she is not in fact working for her Russian bosses, but is actually being used by SPECTRE, which is playing the Brits and Russians off of each other. Once Bond has the device, and Romanova, SPECTRE moves in to take it from him. Bad move on their part.In my opinion, FRWL and Goldfinger represent everything the series can be at its best. The series started declining into self-parody with the uneven and cheesy Thunderball, and has only seen a few decent efforts since - The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only, Goldeneye and the outstanding Casino Royale. This is one Bond movie you'll want to add to your collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This particular Bond flick will always be my favourite.I don't think I need to elaborate too much on this film, as others have done, but suffice it to say this one captures the most Cold War feel of the series than any other of the films, and does it amazingly well before the films became a bit more fantastic in plots and situations. Great villains and action sequences - it's all there. And the fight scene between Connery and Shaw still holds up as one of the most intense, exciting punch-ups in any of the Bond films. If that one scene didn't hugely influence the fight scenes in the "Bourne" series (amongst others), I'll eat my hat.To me, this is THE Bond classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will "Love" this Bond film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only one year after Dr. No brought James Bond to the silver screen, producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman unleashed its follow-up, From Russia With Love. From Russia With Love stands as the James Bond series at its finest, still among the strongest of all Bond films, and a much closer realization for what would become the "Bond Style" than Dr. No (although the true prototype for a Bond film, Goldfinger was still one film away). Action, romance, sly comedic moments, suspense, From Russia With Love has it all.As the film unfolds, the British Secret Service has been contacted by a Russian cipher clerk, Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), with an offer that she is willing to defect to the West and provide them with a Lektor decoding machine, which will allow the British to decode secret Russian transmissions, if they meet one criteria: the individual who comes to Istanbul to collect her and the decoder must be James Bond (Sean Connery). Immediately, Bond and his superior, M (Bernard Lee), suspect a trap, and it is indeed one, with the orchestrator being the worldwide criminal organization SPECTRE. Two SPECTRE agents, Colonel Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal), assisted by SPECTRE henchmen Red Grant (Robert Shaw,) have created a plan to allow Bond and Tatiana to escape with the decoder, but eventually deliver it to SPECTRE and not the British. However, Bond and his Istanbul associate, Kerim Bay (Pedro Armendariz), have some plans of their own, and are determined to allow the decoder to make it all the way back to England.From Russia With Love was one of Ian Fleming's more popular Bond novels, reportedly a favorite of President Kennedy, so it is somewhat unsurprising that it was translated into one of the better loved Bond films. The film has a plot that would not be considered especially complicated, but it isn't the most straightforward of stories either, involving a lot of false moves and surprises around the corner. It also puts the audience in the driver's position to some degree, showing us almost every move the film makes and giving us the enjoyment of seeing Bond make his way through it and deduce all the villains actions throughout the film. From Russia With Love was close to end of the era where Fleming's novels were adapted somewhat closely, and From Russia With Love holds up as a reasonably involved story.However, as any modern viewer of a James Bond film knows, a good Bond film is all about three things: the action set-pieces, the villain and the girl. From Russia With Love has some memorable moments throughout, including a fight at a gypsy camp where Bond and Bay hide out and a long involved sequence on a train as Bond and Tatiana attempt to escape Istanbul with SPECTRE agent Grant on their tail. Bond hadn't quite pushed to the edge of higher-octane action, but the mix of old fashioned fisticuffs and chases work well, making From Russia With Love a film that has its outrageous sides at times but still with most of its feet planted on the ground.From Russia With Love was the first Bond film to introduce what would become a series staple, and that was the ruthless, murderous henchman. Here it is Red Grant, played well by Robert Shaw, with the appropriate degree of both malice and sophistication when necessary. He is a ruthless individual and a worthy adversary for Bond. Daniela Bianchi is a good female foil for Bond, although her character is a bit on the silly side at times, and many modern viewers will probably find her someone anachronistic compared to modern female characters. She is a bit too flighty at moments, but still pulls off the role well.Connery is once again in top form as Bond, and here he shows off his portrayal of the character's almost unbreakable cool demeanor, such as when he seems to leisurely walk through a shootout in the gypsy camp sequence while all hell breaks loose. Bond's character is much more the suave persona that will become a staple, but is still able to show his tough side when necessary. Another very memorable element of From Russia With Love is Pedro Armendariz as Kerim Bay. He was the first of Bond's "colorful" associates and is still among the best. He makes Kerim Bay a light, enjoyable character who exudes charm and warmth on the screen during all his scenes.From Russia With Love still stands as Bond at the top of his game, and represents the series at the beginning of its creative peak. If you like Bond, it's worth the time to check this entry out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Bond Film Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably. It has the best Bond performer (Sean Connery); the most serious and believable story (the fight for a decoding machine and not for world domination or its destruction); great villains (Lotte Lenya and "Red" Grant); a more than acceptable Bond girl (Daniela Bianchi); an interesting Bond sidekick (Pedro Armend?riz); original and simple pieces of equipment (a suitcase with tricks, shoes with poisoned steel blades); a fine musical score (title song by Matt Monro); excellent and real locations; tension, intrigue and well handled fights (the one between Bond and Grant in a train dorm is outstanding); and so on.Besides all that Bond films depended a lot in the actor that played 007 simply because he is the center of his movies and every thing moves around him. That understood, Sean Connery's Bond was never matched yet. Lazenby lacked charm and class; Moore played a sort of Flint or Matt Helm kind of secret agent, always in a good mood as if he knew all the time the script was there to proctect him. Dalton looked like a normal and well intentioned guy and the point here is that Bond is actually a paid killer, cold and with no scruples at all. And Brosnan lacks Connery's elegant cynicism and sarcasm a trademark in the British agent(he's second in my list though).If you also consider this is the 60's we are talking about here, "From Russia with Love" is probably Bond's best product ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love (FRWL) was only the second movie in the James Bond franchise, which at the time was still finding its feet. Sean Connery returns to the role he first portrayed in Dr. No, and this time is up against SPECTRE, a mysterious organisation with an even more mysterious leader. FRWL is everything that's good about spy movies. It may not be as fast paced or have as much action as later Bond films, but it makes up for that with a clever plot, interesting characters and a heavy dose of cold war espionage and intrigue. The film is largely set in Istanbul, where Bond is sent to meet Russian agent Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), who claims she will give the British a Lector decoding machine if 007 helps her defect. This film is much slower than the later Bond films, but this works in the film's favour, as it gives time to develop the plot in much more depth than is usual in Bond. The first half of the movie is dedicated to 'the game with the Russians', which creates another layer in the film and more enemies for Bond, who this time has more on his plate then just a super-villain bent on world domination. The villains themselves are some of the most interesting in the franchise. Lotte Lenya is excellent as Spectre #3, Rosa Klebb, and Robert Shaw as 'Red' Grant gives Bond a run for his money. Another character of note is Bond's ally, Ali Kerim Bay, played to perfection by Pedro Armendariz in his last film role. Daniela Bianchi, however, is a little wooden as a Russian agent who is incapable of saying almost anything except 'oh, James'. FRWL is excellently filmed, and all of the locations, particularly Istanbul, are stunning and used to maximum effect. The action scenes are also well done, and although there isn't as many as may be expected in a Bond film, when they do occur they are exciting. FRWL is also very well paced, building up suspense rather than simply resorting to mindless action. All in all, this movie is a fun ride that does everything it sets out to do, that is to entertain. It's not the deepest movie ever made but its one of the most enjoyable.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia with Love 1963</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery starred in his second Bond film and it was superb. This film has humor, seriousness and above all action packed drama.This includes arguably the most realistic and frightening of all Bond villains to date - Donald 'red' Grant excellently played by the late Robert Shaw who passed away from a premature heart attack in 1973. Also included is Blofeld who is really intimidating and scary, because the audience cannot see his face. Blofeld was played by Anthony Dawson who played Professor Dent in Dr No in 1962. He would go on to play Blofeld again in the fourth James Bond film, Thunderball (1965).Rosa Klebb who was a member of SMERSH was fantastically played by Lotte Lenya. Klebb secretly defected to SPECTRE and joined the organisation. Klebb is shot at the end of the film by 'Tanya' Romanova after she tries to kill Bond with her poisonous shoe spike. Bond's reaction when she got killed? Simple "She's had her kicks!" No Bond film would be complete with a helping hand. Yes I'm talking about Kerim Bey who was excellently played by Pedro Armandariz. Kerim is the most memorable Bond ally to date. Sadly Pedro barely managed to finish the film before he was hospitalised. He had a gun smuggled into the hospital where he was staying and killed himself with it just weeks after he completed the film. He was suffering with cancer at the time and his son Pedro Armaderiz Jr played President Lopez in the James Bond thriller Licence To Kill in 1989.The gypsy scene was superbly written. Bond and Kerim visit a gypsy camp were they are welcomed. Two girls who are in love with the same man fight it out until one kills the other. However a huge fight brews and the fight ends. Insiders from Turkey nearly destroy the whole camp but Bond and Kerim put up a brave fight and save the camp from total devastation.This film also marks the first appearance for Desmond Llwelyn who played Q right up to The World is Not Enough (1999).An excellent Bond film for your collection!

This is a tightly penned story, following the book almost exactly, with no extra padding thrown in to expand the running time of the film. Connery looks much more at ease in the part, and all the other elements that we've come accustomed to fall into place here including the opening credits and the introduction of Q. Daniela Bianchi is somewhat bland as Tatiana, the second "Bond Girl" but she does have an air of innocence about her that gives her character some dimension. The locales used are some of the best in the entire Bond series. A great thriller that just happens to be a James Bond movie. Take note there's no Roger Moore silliness here.

		<shortDescription>The 2nd best Bond movie after Goldfinger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is the 2nd James Bond movie after Dr. No. It's a gritty Cold War thriller. Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to Istanbul to recover an encryption device. He's met there by a Russian agent Tatiana Romanova (Daniella Bianchi) who is to hand over the device to him. The Russians send an assassin after Bond, Donald "Red" Grant played by the impeccable Robert Shaw who is terrific. Grant's boss in SPECTRE is Rosa Klebb, one of the frumpiest women ever (Lotte Lenya.) Bond and Tatiana try to smuggle the device back to the West on the Orient Express.All the actors in the film do a great job. Connery is still the classic Bond and the film has all the familiar Bond characters: Bernard Lee as M; Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny.Terrence Young's direction is tight. Much of the movie takes place on the Orient Express. The game of cat and mouse between Bond and the assassin Grant is masterfully done. The final fight between Bond and the assassin is a humdinger and equal in suspense to the confrontation between Bond and Odd Job in Goldfinger.This is a movie without the gimmicks of the later Bond films. It's just a solid spy film but does it ever deliver. If Goldfinger is the best Bond movie, From Russia With Love comes in a close second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>#2 in the Bond chronology is a violent little thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love (1963) is the second Bond film in the franchise. Chosen as the second film to be made primarily because the novel on which the film is based was a personal favorite of President Kennedy, and, with a budget nearly three times the size of Dr. No, director Terence Young dives head first into a stylish and complex thriller; this one about SPECTRE's ambitions to avenge the death of Dr. No by murdering James Bond (Sean Connery). SPECTRE wants to steal a decoding device from the Russian Embassy in Turkey. But why bother to invest the man power when they can easily use Britain's most celebrated agent as a pawn to get the decoder for them. SPECTRE's ulterior motive, killing Bond, is fleshed out in the pre-credit sequence where an agent pretending to be Bond is stalked and strangled by psychotic killing machine, Red Grant (Robert Shaw).SPECTRE furthers their ambitions by accessing ruthless ex-KGB agent, Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), who, in turn, hires Soviet defector, Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) to romance Bond on the side. In the meantime, Bond teams up with devious special agent, Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendariz) to hunt down and eliminate several SPECTRE assassins.Director Young populates this Bond thriller with girls, guns and gadgets ? a lethal combination that helps to build excitement at every plot twist. From its thrilling pre-title sequence, to the impeccable staging of the raid on a gypsy camp, right on through the climatic boat race, and final showdown between Bond and Klebb, the latter sporting a poisonous foot fetish that is to die for, From Russia With Love delivers an action packed bit of stylish nonsense that is worthy of the moniker, "Bond?James Bond." Only a note of personal tragedy soured the general release of this film; the sudden and untimely death of Pedro Armendariz, who became ill during shooting and died shortly before the film's premiere.The MGM/UA DVD once again is imbued with the hallmarks of a stunning menu and loaded extras. But the transfer of the film itself leaves something to be desired. Although colors can be generally pleasing, quite often they become muddy and slightly faded. There is a considerable amount of film grain and age related artifacts for an image that is not very smooth. Some edge enhancement and aliasing also occurs and is quite distracting. The matte process shots in the film are more obvious than ever, suffering from considerably more wear and tear than the rest of the footage. The audio is mono ? strange, since on a previous laser disc edition, Matt Monroe's title track was presented in full stereo. Extras include two extensive documentaries, audio commentaries, some promotional junket materials and the film's theatrical trailer - good stuff but with a disappointing print of the film leaving one to ponder the question ? "who cares?"</fullReview>

Many believe he gave his best performance in goldfinger (which may i add is what i believe an average bond flick)but that was too witty this one was perfect. Brilliant bond girl and Donald(red)Grant is a superb Villain proving to be just as tuff as Bond. The fight on the train is an great bond moment one of the best. Great story but Rosa Kelbb being shot was quite poor and kronsteen wasn't used as much as i would have expected but still the best bond film yet!

		<shortDescription>Overall, the Best of the Bonds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Russia with Love" is, arguably the best of the Bonds. What clearly sets it apart from the rest is the story line. The plot is not only coherent and clever, it makes sense and involves the viewer without going over the top like many of the later ones did (i.e. "Thunderball"). I won't go into the plot specifics. If you're a Bond fan, you know what it's about.If not, just sit down and watch the movie and you will get sucked into very quickly.What also raises this one above the rest is the casting. Lotte Lenya is sensational as the former Russian agent turned SPECTRE "employee". And of course there's Robert Shaw, virtually speechless and the BIG SPECTRE agent sent out to kill Bond. There's also an abundant amount of SEX in the film, though it's early 60's subtle. But check out the VERY erotic scene where Bond (draped only in a bath towel) finds Tatiana Romanov on the bed. They begin to make out while the camera reveals they are being photographed. Though the scene ends there, the implication is very erotically charged. Very daring for the early 60's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that is overlooked too many times (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When asked to name the best James Bond film, any random person on the street would probably say "Goldfinger", regardless if they've actually seen the movie or of it's quality. This is because "Goldfinger" has a reputation that rivals the Bond series as a whole. But when it comes to thrills, fantastic pacing, an electric atmosphere, and an almost airtight plot, look no further than the second film, "From Russia With Love".For years, I never looked at the film with the respect that it deserves or acknowledged the intelligence of the script. But now, in my recent Bond-a-thon, I can say that FRWL is the best film in the canon. What makes this the movie so good? There are so many things to choose from, so I might as well get the minor negatives out of the way: the Cold War aspect of the plot dates it slightly (but what Bond film doesn't show signs of when it was made?) and there are some small complaints with voice dubbing and odd looking editing. That's it. Everything else is absolutely brilliant.One reason I never saw the greatness of the film is that I didn't realize the simple, but effective, realistic, and intricately woven plot. SPECTRE (lead by Ernst Stavro Blofeld, making his first appearance) have decided that they want revenge for the death of Dr. No, who was killed by Secret Agent James Bond, 007 (this makes FRWL one of the few Bond films with any continuity to the previous one). To do this, they will use Tatiana Romanova (Daniella Bianchi) as bait to lure Bond out in search of the LEKTOR decoding device, when assassin Donald "Red" Grant will kill them both and expose a lurid sex scandal that would embarrass MI6.That way all this plays out is slow enough so we don't get lost, but quickly enough so we don't lose focus of what's going on, and we should give credit to director Terrence Young and editor Peter Hunt, who, despite many setbacks during production, manged to put together a storyline that flows perfectly while making sense, when it could've ended up as a disaster. The film is almost a straight retelling of the classic Ian Fleming novel, with few changes, like the main organization was SMERSH, which was out-dated at the time. It still gets a mention or two though in the movie.A great credit to the movie is it's cast, who, for anyone reading the book, is almost an exact match to what Fleming put on paper all those years ago. Pedro Armendariz, who was deathly ill during shooting, gives in a lovable and three-dimensional turn as Ali Kerim Bey, who the audience learns to trust as an ally and as Bond's friend. Robert Shaw becomes a classic villain in Red Grant, playing the role in a cool sense of self reassurance, coldness, and pure evil. He's a complete psycho and the audience feels nothing but dread anytime he's on screen. The fight between him and Bond on the Orient Express is one of the greatest in movie history, outdoing later attempts like Bond vs. Alec Trevelyan in "GoldenEye" and Bond vs. Oddjob in the next film.One can't do a review of this movie without mentioning Rosa Klebb, played by Lotte Lenya. She's a throughly despicable presence, and Lenya finds the right balance of sadism and menace that makes her instantly memorable. Bianchi also holds her own against everyone around her, and being absolutely gorgeous doesn't hurt either. Other minor characters like Kronsteen, Morzeny, Vavra, and Krilencu might seem out of place in other films but are perfect here.Sir Sean Connery gives in a tremendous performance, creasing out any wrinkles that he might have showed in "Dr. No". He's completely believable as an agent of Her Majesty's Secret Service and, at least in FRWL, shows the definite qualities of a Bond portrayal. So in terms of acting, it's probably the best in a Bond movie. "From Russia With Love" also has a few firsts for the series: the introduction of Desmond Llewelyn as Q, the first gadget (a great trick attaché case), the first full theme song, and the first pre-title scene, which is rather short and forgettable, but fun anyway.Combined with lush scenery that is photographed and explored deeply and the first of many magnificent John Barry scores, "From Russia With Love" still stands up today as a classic example of pushing against the odds to create a thrilling piece of entertainment that is serious and is one of the best to watch multiple times. While other movies in the Bond series might have one or two flaws that prevent them from becoming much better than they are, FRWL contains almost no such faults and is my favourite film of them all. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the book, and seen the movie. Both are excellent. This film is generally loyal to the book, with except in the book the Russians are the bad guys as opposed to SPECTRE manipulating everyone. Lotte Lenya is simply magnificent in her villainess role, and Vladek Sheybal is memorable in his brief scenes. The best actor in this whole film is Robert Shaw as Red Grant. Shaw manages to project more evil and ruthlessness in Grant's character than many future Bond villains put together, and he does it without uttering a single word for most of the film. Talk about Silent Killers!this is truly a SPY epic, unlike later bond films which are more sci-fi and action hero than espionage. The gadgets are simple yet sufficient, and do not dominate the action as with later adventures. Incidentally, this film marks the introduction of Desmond llewelyn as Major Boothroyd or Q, a role he will play for 36 years until 1999.Back to connery. his chemistry both with Daniela Bianchi and Pedro Armendariz are simply amazing. It is sad that Armendariz was dying of cancer as this film was being made and chose to end his life a short time later. Sean's Bond and Pedro's Kerim Bey really work well together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia with Love is my favorite James Bond movie. I like a lot of them and most people consider Goldfinger to be the best, but From Russia with Love is a more fun film in my opinion. The plot concerns James Bond being lead into a trap by SPECTRE by going to Turkey to retrieve a decoding machine. When he gets it, he is pursued by a ruthless sidekick, while Bond also falls for a woman (Surprise, surprise).Dr. No wasn't very action-packed nor suspenseful, but was still good. From Russia with Love is a great movie and is much better than any other Bond movie that I have seen. Very underrated on the IMDb. Sean Connery was always my favorite Bond, and will always be remembered by me for doing this film and Goldfinger as a runner-up.10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Yet Realistic, a Bond Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If DR. NO provided the framework for what would become the 'James Bond' series, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE would introduce the style, with a pre-title action sequence, worldwide settings, intense, occasionally 'over-the-top' action sequences, carnivorous (if G-rated) sexuality between bedsheets, nifty gadgets by Q (as portrayed by Desmond Llewelyn, in his first 'Bond' appearance), and a 007 who would be even more sophisticated than in the first film. Brilliant director Terence Young, as stylish and worldly as Ian Fleming's secret agent, left an indelible stamp with FRWL that has influenced every subsequent 'Bond' film, and, to many fans, this production IS the best 007 film, ever.When, during the production of DR. NO, it was revealed that "From Russia With Love" was one of President John F. Kennedy's favorite novels, producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman quickly decided it would be the follow-up film, and brought in Johanna Harwood and Richard Maibaum to produce a script. Utilizing SPECTRE as the villains, rather than the dated Soviet spy network, SMERSH (and thus introducing mastermind Ernst Blofeld, unseen but ever-present), the story became an elaborate tale of the worldwide terrorist network discrediting both the British and Soviet intelligence networks, thus gaining dominance.For the roles of the villains, Young used consummate British actor/playwright Robert Shaw (ten years before his best-known film, THE STING), as assassin Red Grant, and the legendary German star, Lotte Lenya, wife of German dramatist Kurt Weill, as frog-like ex-KGB agent Rosa Klebb. Coercing a beautiful Soviet army officer (Italian beauty pageant winner Daniela Bianchi) into pretending to 'love' 007, and offering the British a secret Lector (coding device) if Bond will come to Istanbul to retrieve it, Klebb, showing a lesbian lust for the girl, plans to shoot film of their tryst, then execute the pair, keeping the Lector for SPECTRE, and releasing the film to create an international scandal.Director John Ford offered veteran star Pedro Armendáriz' services to director Young, and the popular actor was cast as Bond's Turkish contact, Kerim Bey...but halfway through the filming, it was discovered that Armendáriz was dying of cancer, and his scenes had to be quickly finished. Shortly afterwards, he committed suicide, rather than face lengthy, expensive cancer treatment. His scenes with Connery are film highlights.With one sequence set onboard the famous 'Orient Express' (a location Connery would appear in again, in 1974's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS), which would culminate in the famous Grant/Bond brawl to the death, another action scene, of Bond attacked by a helicopter (in homage to NORTH BY NORTHWEST), and a climactic high-speed boat chase, FRWL successfully balanced both a suspenseful plot and terrific action. Connery, complete with a new hairpiece and trimmed eyebrows, under Young's careful tutelage, became the epitome of 'cool' as 007, the last of the 'rough edges' evident in DR. NO smoothed out. He was superb in the role, giving what many feel was his best performance as 007.FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE was a HUGE hit, and paved the way for the biggest 'Bond' of all, GOLDFINGER, and the beginning of the 007 craze...</fullReview>

Other highlights include Robert Shaw's psychotic hit-man Donovan Grant, Lotte Lenya's lesbian Russian turned SPECTRE agent Rosa Klebb and the Orient Express which is superbly used as a set-piece for action as Grant gives himself away to Bond by ordering red wine with fish.Trivia buffs will revel in the fact that SPECTRE chief Ernst Blofeld was played by Anthony Dawson (Professor Dent in Dr No) but we never see the face and the suitably sinister voice was provided by British actor Eric Pholmann. The actor who was selected to play Captain Nash (Bond's contact at Zagreb station whom Donovan Grant murders and assumes his identity) was played by Production Manager Bill Hill because the actor selected to play him never turned up for shooting.</fullReview>

Sean, almost unrecognizable as a young man, displays the Earthy masculinity balanced with cruel violence and tenderness that made his characterization of Bond so memorable and Sean himself a star. Robert Shaw proves to be a memorable villain.The big action scenes include a shoot out at a Gypsy camp, the abduction of the Lector by Sean, Sean being chased by a helicopter (North By Northwest!), Sean being chased on a boat and a memorable fight scene between Sean and Robert on the train. The original book was actually kind of boring, despite the more interesting look into the minds of Bond and Grant and a different physical description of Daniela's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only after one year, MGM launched a sequel to Dr. No. It was 1963 and the cold war was as its peak, JFK was shoot and over 200.000 people witnessed Martin Luther King in DC...and all 007 fans were satisfied since they saw a new Bond movie. Again, with no doubt the best actor in Bond series, Sean Connery. And again cool under the pressure. Though this time (sadly) more seriously and cynical, but hey, From Russia with love was a movie with serious plot and one with the toughest villain ever. Robert Shaw a.k.a. Red Grant almost steals the show acting as psychotic who kills for the pure pleasure of act. Luckily for 007, he was too greedy. On the other hand, 007 has as always capable friends. Kerim Bay (kudos to Pedro Armendariz) as loyal friend with a "witty-bond" sense of humor and "007 love" in this one, Tatiana Romanova (only 21-year old Daniela Bianchi) . Although not too brilliant in acting, she had a special something which qualifies her as one of the most beautiful and exciting Bond woman. And finally the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn portraying Q.So, what makes this one "one of the best 007 movies"? Superb opening scenes, a story, without unbelievable action scenes (so much present in modern bond movies), interesting (Istanbul/former Yugoslavia) and beautiful (Venice) locations and before mentioned skillful actors, plus a great script and dialogs. But from time to time slow paced story (Gypsy camp), what stops me to rate this one the same as its ancestor...9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>genuine Fleming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one and only Bond-movie that truly sticks to the spirit Ian Fleming created in his Bond-novels. Its predecessor 'Dr. No' just was to low-budgetted to reflect Fleming's ideas well. The Bond-movies afterwards left Fleming's consistent plots, realizing that a quick follow-up of spectacular gimmicks on sex and violence brings in more cash.Seen from this point of view, 'From Russia with Love' is the Bond-movie par excellence. It's story is good and consistent. Beautiful female lead Daniela Bianchi is allowed to carry her character Tatjana Romanova through the entire movie, developing it credibly. Bianchi plays a woman of flesh and blood here, a pretty rare occurrence in later Bond movies. She even reveals a flash of blatant nudity, which is very unusual in any Bond-movie ever. And back in 1963 rightout revolutionary. Male leads Sean Connery and Robert Grant do equally well. But it's no doubt veteran actress Lotte Lenya who lifts 'From Russia with Love' above the average Bond-level. Acting out deflected SMERSH-chief Rosa Klebb, her performance is absolutely glittering - the very best I have seen in any Bond-movie.More charm is added by using the somewhat mysterious interior of the world-famous Istanbul-mosque. And also by using the 'Oriënt Express', known in Europe as a legendarily romantic railroad-track between Istanbul and Paris. 'From Russia with Love' is my favorite Bond-movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second of the Bond films, 'From Russia with Love' is the best of the series. The basic outline is that the criminal organization going by the acronym SPECTRE,introduced by Dr. No in the first film, is playing the Russians and the British off each other in a complex extortion scheme. The story is solid, the bad guys are interesting, (especially the killer Donald Grant played by a bleached blonde Robert Shaw), and it's the most realistic - sorry gadget fans, nothing much more than a trick briefcase.

		<shortDescription>One For Chess Geeks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a strong amateur chess player and lover of good films, after I read the Fleming novel when I was 14 in 1960), I naturally was intrigued by the opening sequence of this 1963, second outing for JB 007.Fleming opens chapter 7 of his book as follows: "The two faces of the double clock in the shiny, domed case looked out across the chess-board like the eyes of some huge sea monster that had peered over the edge of the table to watch the game.The two faces of the chess clock showed different times." But there's not much 0-0 in 007 -- or much chess in most chess fiction, for that matter.The book only tells us that grandmaster Kronsteen, a secret agent of the deadly SMERSH, won this game after introducing "a brilliant twist into the Meran Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined to be debated all over Russia for weeks to come." The reality is that the filmed position is based on A "King's Gambit" opening played by grandmasters Spassky (White) and Bronstein (Black) and was played in the 1960 USSR championship.I can give you the moves if you like as the game only lasted 23 moves and as in the film, was won by White.The difference to the piece position in the film being superficial to its actuality and with the SMERSH agent "Kronsteen" (Vladek Sheybal, inspired casting) playing White.In FRWL the opening scene takes place at the Venice International Tournament where Kronsteen ignores a courier's sealed message ordering him to stop play on the spot.He knows he risks his life if he fails to obey, but how many players can abandon a sure win? Connery was really getting into his stride in his second outing as 007 and I personally don't think for sheer physical presence his version has been bettered.I liked the Matt Monroe song which I found tuneful and easy to remember.Having seen the rare "We Were Strangers (1948)" where Pedro Armandiarez played the ruthless Cuban secret policeman, I was astonished to see him again as the Turkish head of station who helps Bond; as it did not register on my radar until I read a user review below.I remember thinking when I was 17 (1963) how sexy the gypsy scene was with the two women fighting it out for James.The Aston Martin DB5 comes into its own in this film and must have contributed to many sales to the affluent class where no advertising campaign had to be financed by the David Brown Organisation!FRWL reinforced the embryonic mould of its genus, tentativly sketched by Dr.No and no, I was not bored with this film.I rated it as a trailblazer of its day at 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Formula Begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as 'Dr. No' did an excellent job of introducing the James Bond character to the silver screen, 'From Russia With Love' does an equally admirable job of introducing the "Bond Formula". I've said it before, "You either like James Bond films, or you don't". For those of us that are fans of the character and the movies, FRWL will always be a lynch pin of the franchise.EXTREMELY MILD SPOILERS HEREIN'From Russia With Love' introduces many trademarks of the franchise: The pre-title sequence, credits projected onto shadowy images of women, the gadgets, the chases, and 'Q'. Desmond Llewelyn, you are missed. This is also the introduction of the Blofeld character.The Plot: SPECTRE plans to steal a soviet 'Lektor' decoding machine by duping the British and Russian secret service into working against each other; and to kill James Bond as revenge for Dr. No.Sean Connery once again shows why he is the best Bond ever by playing the part with a cold ruthlessness (the way Ian Fleming wrote the character, by the way) that no other actor has yet matched. Connery's Bond is not above slapping a woman he believes to be lying to him, or killing an unarmed man. He also exudes a suaveness that only Brosnan has yet to approach. Note the straightening of the tie after the climactic fight ;)Daniela Bianchi continues the tradition of the beautiful 'Bond Girl' set by Ursula Andress. Her scenes aboard the train car are particularly appetizing.Fun Facts: FRWL features the return of Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench; the only 'Bond Girl' to appear in more than one film. (Character, not actress, that is)For being made in 1963, it features some strong sexual overtones. Lesbianism is hinted at in the scene featuring Tatiana and Rosa Klebb, and the fact that Bond enjoys 2 women simultaneously is all but spelled out.The 3 'Bond Girls' in the movie are: Zora (Martine Beswick), Vida (Aliza Gur), and Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi).While in 'M's office 007 is shown a picture of Tatiana for the first time, he writes on the picture: "From Russia With Love".Like 'Dr. No' the worst thing about the film is Peter Hunt's HORRENDOUS editing job. He called it "crash cutting", I call it amateurish crap. Aside from that, though, one of the Best 007's.The new DVD edition features a fantastic "making-of" documentary, a must see for any James Bond fan.My film rating 8/10. My BOND film rating 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't think this film is from Russia, but I love it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second outing of 007 has a smarter, more involved plot than Dr. No. It also seems to hold a bigger budget with bigger action sequences. My favorite would have to be the scene in which Bond is being chased by a helicopter. Some of the close calls in that scene are amazing, even to this day.I think the neatest thing about this movie is that it really opens with the villains. They explain their plan (basically revenge on Bond for the death of Dr. No), and the rest of the movie is watching Bond getting involved and trying to get out of it. Not a lot of modern action films follow this route...so for me it's a welcome change of pace.One of the things that I love about Bond films is the wacky characters. This movie has Bond being stalked by a thug/assassin named Red Grant who can take a brass knuckle punch to the stomach and not flinch. He's ordered by an ex-KGB woman Rosa Klebb who has poisoned tipped shoes. The both of them take orders from the leader of SPECTRE, a man (whose face we never see) who seems to spend his time petting his white cat, and watching Siamese fighting fish duke it out. Gotta love that!If you think that sounds weird, you also get to see two Gypsy women attempt to catfight each other to death. I'll leave it up to you to find out that part.Sean Connery is back in the role he was born to play, Bond! He's followed by the lovely leading lady Daniela Bianchi as Tatiana Romanov. Also, the film features the first appearance by a staple Bond character, Q, who loads Bond up with all his infamous gadgets. No matter how dated it is, I find that compact sniper rifle really, really cool. This is one Bond film you shouldn't miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time Bond goes to Istanbul to retrieve a cypher machine from a double agent Tatiana Romanov, who has been sent to misinform British Secret Service. Good story, cast, fight sequences and photography, but the movie drags a little in several places: in the book, the gypsy sequence is only one scene, but in the film it's a ten or fifteen minute vignette which slows the pacing. The boat chase towards the end is drawn out and also wan't in the book at all, and the precredits sequence was another needless set piece. For some reason, the producers of this series think that every movie has to have a precredits scene that usually has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. But this is still a very good follow up to "Dr No" - and kind of similar to the much later Bond movie "The Living Daylights", with another miss informing Russian double agent. The fight sequence between Sean Connery and Robert Shaw is probably one of the best sequences in the Bond series, it actually improves the original scene in the book. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of Bond.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said for the best entry of a series that now boasts over twenty feature films? As far as Bond flicks go, this one offers the most finely-tuned mixture of story, action, villains, and wit. It avoids the silliness that would plague later films, it's the least formulaic, and for his second turn in the role of James Bond, Sean Connery puts forth his definitive portrayal of the character.The plot introduces SPECTRE leader Blofeld as the chief villain (whose face would go unseen for this film as well as for several afterward), who has devised a plan to allow his enemies to obtain a secret Russian decoding device--then steal it from them. A refreshing change from the more common comic book plot, which usually involves a megalomaniac bent on world domination.With a story that is engaging and rewarding to those who pay close attention, and action that is high on tension and low on absurdity, From Russia With Love represents the best that the Bond series has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most subdued and plausible of all the Bond movies, and one of the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is probably the only Bond movie to remain within the realms of plausibility for its entire duration. Even the first one - Doctor No - had some unlikely moments, especially once Bond and Quarrel reached Dr. No's island. Sean Connery gives another assured and charismatic performance, but is outshone by two truly mesmerising villains played - to perfection, might it be added - by Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw. Daniella Bianchi is the Bond girl in this one, and she looks kind of pretty but isn't very expressive as an actress. Bond is sent to Istanbul to get his hands on an electronic device known as a Lektor. He is under the impression that Bianchi, who works at the Russian embassy, is going to steal it for him. However, in reality Bianchi has been assigned by a crime organisation known as SMERSH to lure Bond into a trap, wherein he will turn up expecting to get his hands on the Lektor but will be killed by one of their agents. Bianchi unexpectedly falls in love with Bond and decides she is not going to betray him. However, Bond still wants her to smuggle the Lektor for him, so they still put this part of the plan into effect. Two deadly SMERSH agents, Red Grant (Shaw) and Rosa Klebb (Lenya) are sent to find Bond and his lover and eliminate them. The action is still there as ever in a Bond movie, but is done is a more low-key and plausible manner. The big stunts and gadgets which sometimes mar later entries are kept to a minimum in this one. The fight sequence between Shaw and Connery in a compartment aboard the Orient Express is surprisingly violent and savage; the scene in which Connery is pursued across barren wasteland by a helicopter feels realistic, especially the way Connery's face conveys genuine fear (did you ever see Roger Moore actually look like he was in real danger?) The theme tune, warbled by Matt Munro, is rather forgettable and there's a particularly dated scene at a gypsy site which might have worked in 1963 but now seems very much of its time. However, all things considered, From Russia With Love is one of the best of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine film but different in feel to your average Bond movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is regarded by many Bond fans as one of the best Bond films. The film is much more confident and smoother than the first,Dr No,and is a rare series entry that is an actual spy thriller,with more leanings towards Hitchcock than Saturday matinée serials. Because of this,it lacks some of the spectacle and excitement that one might expect from Bond. The pace is more leisurely and you actually have to concentrate on the plot.Although a bit different in feel then,From Russia With Love is still a fine film. There are several highpoints,probably the most notable being a vicious girlfight,a battle in a gypsy camp,a North By Northwest-like helicopter attack and a superbly brutal and effective fight on a train. Indeed the film really pushed the boundaries of it's certificate for it's time with it's sadism and sexual elements. Nevertheless,humour is still present and correct. The film is perhaps especially strong in it's characterisation,with Connery,though superb,out shone by Lotte Lenya'a horrible Rosa Klebb and Pedro Armanderiz as possibly Bonds's most likable ally. Sadly the climax does not really happen, we are denied a really good final showdown. The atmospheric pre-credit scene and exciting John Barry score,both firsts for the series,are notable but would subsequently be outdone.Not really a typical entry than but a pretty good film all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Realistic and Suspenseful Of The Bond Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers.After the engaging over-the-top antics of Dr. No, EON Productions comes back to earth for the most realistic entry of the James Bond series, combining a superbly suspenseful premise with excellent character interplay, an intriguing background, and several of the most memorable scenes of the Bond epic. SPECTRE gets its introduction as an organization in this film as it has hatched a plan to acquire a valuable decoding machine, the Lektor. To pull off the plan, a Soviet SMERSH defector, Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) recruits a beautiful cipher clerk working at the Soviet embassy in Istanbul (Daniela Bianchi, her voice dubbed) to act as a defector to the West with a Lektor, on the condition that she give the device to James Bond. To aid in the plan, Klebb has recruited a powerful killer, Donald Grant, nicknamed Red, to tail Bond and set in motion events leading to a confrontation on the Orient Express. Robert Shaw tackles the role of Grant and is by far the most menacing Bond henchman of the series - his signature line, "My orders are to kill you and deliver the Lektor, how I do it is my business" is perhaps the best line of the entire series.Bond and Sir Miles Meservy realize it is a trap, but given the chance to get their hands on a Lektor, decide to chance things. As the cat-and-mouse game in the Istanbul region proceeds, we see a special chemistry between Bond and Station T chief Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendariz in one of his final film roles); Kerim has worked with James before, and employs the only young men he knows can be trusted to his dangerous job. Unaware of Red Grant's machinations, Kerim Bey barely escapes an attempt on his life and he and Bond learn of the presence of a notorious Soviet terrorist leader in the Soviet embassy; this leads to a memorable armed assault by the Soviets on a gypsy camp, in which James distinguishes himself to the gypsy tribe's leader and is given the opportunity to settle a nasty dispute between two beautiful young women - leading to the great bemused line, "As if I didn't have enough problems."This in turns leads to the best instance of the chemistry between the two men, as Kerim Bey, despite an arm injury in the gypsy camp battle, passionately desires to settle a lethal score, and James allows him to use a rifle he has smuggled into Turkey. The settlement of this score is almost a complete film ending in the satisfaction it provides the viewer.But there is still more, and eventually Bond finds himself chased by a helicopter (a scene clearly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's famous Cary Grant scene with a flying biplane) and motorboats, and eventually to a final confrontation with a hotel cleaning lady who is someone very familiar.It all proceeds with Sean Connery's superb performance, the first and one of the best of John Barry's wall-of-sound scores (though the film sees fit to reuse some of Monty Norman's cues from Dr. No), the excellent performances of Pedro Armendariz and Robert Shaw, the engaging settings in Turkey, and the overall realism that contrasts well with the engaging over-the-top antics of other Bond films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little let-down after "Dr. No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Russia With Love" and "For Your Eyes Only" have tied for the 007 films that take place in the Cold War and have plots dealing with that conflict. Niether focuses on world domination by SPECTRE, or revenge for the murder of Bond's wife. Both simply focus on one side or the other after an encoder. The difference here is that the entire operation is organized by SPECTRE as revenge on MI6 and 007 in particular.Likes? We have our first real introduction to Q, here called Major Boothroyd, and for the first time played by Desmond Llewelyn. Peter Burton as Boothroyd in "Dr. No" just didn't cut it. Q gives 007 his first gadget; a breif case with exploding tear gas canisters, 50 gold sovreigns, a sniper's rifle, a hidden knife, and secretly stored ammunition. This is the only time Bond will get a gadget that the famous comedy between Q and 007 will not be present. Also, we first see Ernst Stavro Blofeld, or at least his hands. His face is hidden from the camera, and instead we see his white Persian cat, which in this film appears to be only a kitten. While the voice does not compare to Donald Pleasance's performance as Blofeld, it still is effective, although we see the top of Blofeld's head briefly...and he has hair. This film ties in with Dr. No by having several mention the events of that last film and bringing back Bond's first girl, Silvia Trench. The evil Rosa Klebb is the first woman on the bad side that is not young, attractive, and attempts to seduce Bond. She is in many ways like Irma Bunt from "On Her Majesty's Secret Service."However, despite these good points, there are too many thing of this movie that reek to get it anymore than 4 1/2 stars out of 10. First of all, I felt Dr. No suffered from too many Bond girls. This films suffers from not enough. There is only one, and she does only one important thing in the entire movie. Like Honey Rider before her, the part is simply an appendage with nothing to do. The film had several slow and unessecary parts, and at several places could've stopped with a good ending. [SPOILER] It isn't neccesary to kill every major villain whose face is shown. [END OF SPOILER] This film had a song with the title in it, and it was a good song, but it was too short and not played over the opening titles. The traditional silhoeted women have been replaced with a gypsy dancer in yellow lighting.Compared to Dr. No, the film drags and goes on where it could've stopped. The main thing this film serves is to 1, introduce the gadgets and the real Q and 2, establish Blofeld.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean proves his presence and power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia with Love contains all the basic, barebones ingredients for a typical James Bond movie and creates an interesting concoction. After all, you might as well just sit through this and forget the other 19 movies in the series. None of them have the raw energy present here. For Your Eyes Only is the only other that has tried reaching a level of "realism" (that's one word that doesn't go with James Bond) and did decently. Let's face it, without Sean Connery in the lead, we'd be rooting for Robert Shaw the entire way. Sean's presence proves that, while he is not a very formidable actor, he can convey attitude better than most action actors.Overall, an interesting view of the early 60s spy thriller that retains all the needed parts of a good Bond movie: Soviets, novel killing gizmos, and sinister criminal organizations. 3 out of 5 stars. Possibly the best in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh, thrilling and romantic. The exemplary Bond film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not so much adapted from the novel as distilled from it, this is a rich, thrilling action movie, just free of the trappings of its subsequent franchising. With the real-life Cuban missile crisis still a topic of discussion at the audience's breakfast table, the political dimension (a Russian plot) is subverted by consolidating the evil, non-partisan SPECTRE as the antagonist, allowing the film to be a genuine sequel.The casting is as strong as it will ever be in the canon. Connery is totally self-assured as Bond but with plenty of room left to create something fresh. Robert Shaw is a imposing, spine-chilling assassin despite saying nothing for two-thirds of the film. Lotte Lenya and the ill-fated Pedro Armendáriz (as Kerim) are casting coups. And of course Daniela Bianchi as Tantiana is not only in the top rank of Bond beauties but actually holds her own as an actor.The true wonder of the film though is in Terence Young's vision. It's a very real film, with lots of camera-in-motion, partly a by-product of putting location filming at a premium. There are all sorts of gripping vignettes, whether created by necessity or design: I love the wordless, music-less exchange between Red Grant and the British contact Nash at Zagreb; so too the utterly real, chokingly claustrophobic denouement to the set piece boat chase - old school special effects and stunt men going about their business as no computer can.A high if unique watermark of the 007 franchise and substantial, romantic escapism for all of its two hours. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond: Round 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like it's predecessor, "Dr. No", this is a very hard film to enjoy and critique objectively due to it being 15 years older than myself and quite different than the James Bond films that I have already seen. Being the most objective that I can, I thought this was an excellent second installment to the James Bond franchise. Although, I would imagine that most action-film gurus (of today) out there would find this film to be rather boring, and I have to say, I can see why.The story is pretty good, and somewhat complex. Well, maybe not that complex, but if you really want to understand exactly what is going on you have to listen carefully to every character in the film. I found myself rewinding the film and putting on the captions quite often upon my second viewing because I couldn't figure out what was going on.Comparing this film to the previous Bond installment, "Dr. No", I thought this film was good, and enjoyable, but not as good as "Dr. No". I guess I liked that we got to see the main villain in "Dr. No", whereas in this one we never actually saw the main villain, only his hand petting his cat. I guess that's cool an all, I just hope he (Number 1) gets explained in the next Bond installments.The cast was good, nothing much to complain about. Sean Connery returns to the role of James Bond for his second outing, and does a very good job. Daniela Bianchi was a very nice "Bond Girl", quite the looker and a fine actress. Pedro Armendariz also does a very nice job with his role and plays a very likeable character. Lotte Lenya was a nice choice for Rosa Klebb, she did a fine job with her role. Robert Shaw was great as Grant, although, I didn't really find him all that threatening in the film. In all honesty, I thought his character was kind of boring. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell both returned to their previous role and both did excellent jobs with their characters. It was very cool to see Desmond Llewelyn as the now famous character Q, even though his part in the film is VERY small, he gets the job done and makes a fine debut in the Bond series.Even though I thought this film was good and I enjoyed watching it quite a bit, I still wouldn't recommend it to everyone. I would only recommend this to people that either really like Sean Connery and want to see his earlier work or if you are a huge fan of the Bond series. Also, I don't think it's absolutely necessary, but I think I would recommend first watching "Dr. No" before watching this one, especially if you know nothing about the James Bond films (which is pretty doubtful). Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is by far the most plausible of the Bond movies. Unlike all of the recent movies which are simply gadget- and explosion-fests. From Russia with Love is a genuine, believable spy film. The only other one that I think comes close is "For Your Eyes Only", but that movie had none of the tension.  Some fans will find it a little slow. I would say tense and somewhat claustrophobic at times, a lot like it would be in real life. There are plenty of Bond "action movies" that stink despite of the breakneck pace. Actually, the only thing that doesn't ring true *are* the few action sequences - particularly the scene with the "exploding gas drums". Somehow, the 4 drums that were on the boat multiply into 20-30 by the time they blow up. There are some continuity issues in the same scene, too. The helicopter explosion is clearly SFX-challenged by modern standards, as well, but this WAS 1963.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the one to be considered. This is the one squashed between the legendary start and the one considered the best of the best. This is the one between Dr. No &amp; Goldfinger.Still..., I'd consider FRWL one of the best all-time Bond movies. Some hardened fans might nod with approval now..., some might not, but that's neither here nor there. Filled to the brim with mostly unknown but top notch actors (at least in the US) to support Connery's now much more assured performance, it's a prime example of what's now considered 'normal' - accomplished 'serious' actors having a high quality ball and not just a bigger pay-check. The result: At least 3 new definitive Bond movie characters were invented. Robert Shaw as the first classic 'muscle' to the evil brain..., and one of the all-time best, too. Lotte Lenya as the unexpected but indelible image of the 'sick' &amp; menacing paladin. Daniela Bianchi as the one woman to change sides and get the final snogging scene with Bond.... oh, and the one evil signature hand to stroke the cat... and stay from reach of mundane quibbles. A less noticed aspect, is that this is one of the most violent Bond movies. The fight on the train with Robert Shaw is still the definitive full contact fight of the whole series. The helicopter chase is still THE blueprint for all fancy chases, since Hitchcock chased Cary Grant with a plane in North By Northwest.FRWL is raw as well a stylish. It cuts to the chase... and proves the best possible setup for the best classic Bond movie ever: Goldfinger.Schogger13</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may be pretty much devoid of action sequences, which is one of the things I love best about James Bond films, but I still love it anyway. After the dull and boring Dr. No, the series officially got started with this. In this classic, Bond is sent out to recover a device called the Lektor, which SPECTRE (Hey, it rhymes!) is hiding to lure him to his death. The movie is terrific, follows the plot perfectly, and has several good qualities. Desmond Llewelyn only makes a cameo appearance in his Bond debut, but the invention he introduces is one of his best: an attache case that carries a hunting knife, tubes of ammunition, gold coins, a cartridge of tear gas, and an AR7 sniper rifle. Tatiana Romanova is also a great Bond girl, and Robert Shaw did an incredible job portraying the mysterious and deadly Red Grant. Rosa Klebb is also classic (And so is her shoe blade). From Russia With Love is a classic movie, and I guarantee you'll love it. 3 and a half stars out of 5.</fullReview>

Critically analysed, this is in many ways the best of the Bond films. There are some wonderful memorable scenes. The direction by Terence Young is superb, and the fight scenes with Red Grant and the Gypsy girls are superbly choreographed. Tension is high throughout the film, thanks to a carefully thought out screen play. Connery is once again outstanding, and the cast is brilliant, with even minor roles being played wonderfully by a selection of top actors. Overall, although it does maybe lack in action and fun, this is a superb film, and must rank high in the Bond all-time list.

As many have suggested, actually better than the original book which I found a tad on the yawnable side!Cold War stuff....no global megalomaniacs, gold-fanciers or submarine hijackers..just East vs West. Lotte Lenya as Ruskie, Rosa Klebb made one of the great Bond all-time protagonists and the climactic fight with the mega-fit "machine" Grant (Robert Shaw) was one of the best.The gypsy camp sequence was indeed "slow" though necessary and was also subject to much re-editing as can be deduced from the final cut. All up though, a superb addition to the series (dated or not) and a clear cut case for Connery being remembered as the definitive Bond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it just me, or are the Bond movies getting worse? I mean, with every new one that comes out it's all about better gadgets, bigger guns and nicer girls. There's no more spy plot, just schemes to take over the world and cause big explosions. From Russia With Love takes us back to the times of Sean Connery when James Bond was a real spy. SPECTRE want to avenge one of their agent's deaths and get even with England. This only means one thing: James Bond. By anticipating him being selected for their trap of obtaining a decoding machine, they send a russian cryptographer woman to deceive him and 'help' the spy. Bond teams up with Kerim Bey in Turkey and they think that that everything is moving smoothly. But there are three different sides and SPECTRE have only used the girl as bait. Donald Grant is sent to kill them after they get the Lektor, and then the Russians and the British would be blaiming each other. Next to The Living Daylights and Goldeneye, this is probably the best Bond film. Quiet and easy going, with some classic spy tricks, this is a film everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Bond story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia with Love has the best story of any Bond movie. In fact, FRWL is virtually all story with less action then most other Bond films. SPECTRE sets out to steal the Lektor decoding machine from the Russians. They set up Bond to acquire it with the help of a Russian cypher clerk while intending to steal it from him. FRWL has the best pacing of any Bond movie in addition to possibly the best script. The villains are perhaps the strongest of the series with the brilliant Kronstein, the nasty Klebb and the homicidal Red Grant. Grant is one of Bond's top adversaries and Kerim Bey is perhaps the most beloved Bond character. The soundtrack is also superb. FRWL is not for those with short attention spans and lags at times. The story can also be a little difficult to follow in spots. The gypsy camp is a great sequence but is somewhat of a tangent and has been edited out of several TV versions. There is action in the movie but it fits in the story and isn't of the manic kind that would enter in the series with Goldfinger. Connery is in top form and dominates the screen time. If Goldfinger isn't the best Bond, then FRWL is. 7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second 007 picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Russia with Love" is the second James Bond thriller, and it's an excellent action-adventure. With Sean Connery once again as 007, what could go wrong with this picture? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Connery is the best James Bond ever, and this movie is a very exciting ride. "From Russia with Love" has the usual refinements that you would come to expect from a Bond movie: villains, women, gadgets, etc. It's an even better movie than the first 007 picture "Dr. No". The next Bond movie would even top this one ("Goldfinger"), so this series got off to a rousing start. Most people consider "Dr. No", "From Russia with Love", and "Goldfinger" as the best of the James Bond movies. That's true, although I thought some of Connery's later Bond movies were better than "Dr. No" and "From Russia with Love". But there's no doubt in my mind. "From Russia with Love" is still a terrific 007 movie. ***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Fleming`s novel From Russia With Love showed up as #9 on Life magazine`s list of President John F. Kennedy's favorite books, there was no doubt as to what the second Bond movie would be.From Russia With Love is an understandable film for it`s time. As the United States feared the missiles from Cuba pointing the U.S. there was a sign of movies becoming as usual more involved in doing films featuring the Cold War. From Russia With Love is no different it`s plot revolves around the Cold War as Bond has a mission to acquire a valuable Russian decoding machine in Istanbul. Terence Young returns as director to this sequel to Dr. No which in my opinion is the third best in the series next to Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me but this is perhaps the last Bond thriller which I think the producers knew and that`s why this one was packed full and even featured a preview of what would come ahead introducing some gadgets by the lovable Major Boothroyd a/k/a Q played of course by the late Desmond Llewelyn.This film is probably the most realistic and more time conflicted of the Bond films. This film is a must see for all Bond and Non-Bond fans in which this film neatly balances danger, romance, suspense, story and character development, and action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery's personal favorite, and certainly a good one. Rosa Klebb is a great villainess, ranking with Goldfinger as one of the top Bond antagonists. No Bond woman ever wanted Bond as much as Tatiana (unless you count Miss Moneypenny). The fight scene between Bond and Grant is perhaps the best, with the gadgetry that became a symbol of secret agents. Martine Beswick, who also appeared in Thunderball, makes her first appearance here, in Kerim Bey's gypsy catfight. This flick cemented Bond in the public's consciousness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy but Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is an improvement on Dr No, in the fact that more fun is had with this movie, and the feel of it is more Bondian than the predescessor. But am i alone in finding it awfully Dull in places?True, the action scenes are fantastic. There is the boat chase, with Sean Connery looking a little like Tony Curtis doing Cary Grant in Some Like it Hot. then there is Bond being chased by an helicopter looking strangely like Grant himself in North By North West. The gadgets are up to scratch,with the cashier case being one of the finest Bond Gadgets of all time [especially since it was the first but not because of. The case emits deadly talcum powder, bullets and stun gas and a dagger that proves very usefull to Bond later on in the film. As for Q, well the least said about Desmonde Lywellyn's debut the better, because he represents more a Carry On straight man than the good old Q we know.The cast is up to the mark. Sean Connery is hitting his stride as Bond. His performance in FRWL is perhaps the best of his tenure, he is more the Flemming Playboy this time around than the cold Blooded Killer of Dr No. He carries the film [again]. Robert Shaw makes a very eerie henchman. He looks surpirsingly like Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, and his final train battle [one of Cinema's greatest] is an absolute knockout. My personal favourite is Pedro Armandariz as Kerim Bay. He is a warm, bubbly character and what a sad loss he was to future Bond movie's.So overall the Music, Title Song sung by Mat Munroe, the excellent pre-credits sequence where Bond is killed, or is he? Action and Acting, help to make this a more Bondian movie than Doctor No. But the script in places leaves alot to be desired. It is far better to watch an exciting Bond movie than a Dramatic one. Luckily for Bond fans, fun was just around the corner..............................................</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Bond film from Sean Connery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Connery succeeds the great film Dr. No with another exciting action epic with From Russia With Love. The now traditional opening scene consisted of a training exercise that is far superior to that in The Man With The Golden Gun, which also opened with a training exercise. The plot consists of SPECTRE's plan to steal a Russian encryption decoding machine, and while this installment in the Bond series is not quite as good as Goldfinger, the film that follows it, the action and the story are still much higher quality than the belligerent action messes that Pierce Brosnan starred in as the James Bond of the 1990s. The Austin Powers influence is also fairly heavy in From Russia With Love. The hideous henchwoman #3 is clearly the influence of Frau Farbissina, and luckily Mike Myers decided to leave out the ridiculous coke-bottle glasses that #3 wore in From Russia With Love. Also, we can see the origin of Dr. Evil's little death buttons on his desk in this film, as well as a probable source of Mr. Bigglesworth, Dr. Evil's cat, and Dr. Evil's insistence that he will `not tolerate failure.'From a technical perspective, From Russia With Love is one of the best Bond films of them all. There was some excellent editing on sound involving that prehistoric tape recorder, and the entire scene on the train near the end of the film, especially the fight scene, is some of the best stuff in any Bond film before or since. The story is also very interesting, much more so than is common or maybe even required. There is an unusual prevalence of the question of who is on whose side and who can be trusted, and at one point, Bond is almost forced to decide between the decoding device which he has sought after all along and the girl, who he is not entirely sure if he can trust. Despite being much better than most of the other Bond films, there were a lot of mistakes in From Russia With Love, or at least several scenes that didn't seem to have been given the high degree of thought that was given to the film as a whole. For example, when Bond and the girl are on the train, he says that it is almost six o'clock, but then when they arrive at the station, it is clearly several hours later (it is nighttime now), and the clock says that it's about 5:30. Besides that, we all remember the scene earlier where the man vehemently insisted that Russian clocks are always right. Also, it wasn't very creative the way that Robert Shaw's character, one of the villains in the film, was chosen by a quick walk-round and a good punch in the gut. And then, of course, we have that mysterious scene where Bond is somehow able to watch the goings on at a secret conference of the bad guys with the inexplicable use of a periscope from beneath the building. You'd think that someone would notice a periscope sticking up through the floor in the corner of the room. From Russia With Love definitely has its share of faults, but it remains a high quality Bond film. It continues the tradition started by Dr. No of ending in with James and the Bond girl in a boat, it has the usual god-awful theme song (though not quite as bad as some of the others, like The Man With The Golden Gun and Never Say Never Again), and it even employs brief use of the same awkward day-for-night photography that we saw in Dr. No, but it is still one of the best of the Bond series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considerably more palatable than "Dr No".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Significantly an improvement on the fairly mediocre "Dr No", "From Russia With Love" has a believable espionage plot, some effective suspenseful moments and a very evocative mood, partly created by effective use of setting, whether Istanbul, Venice or a train... Indeed, Hitchcock's "North By Northwest" was clearly echoed more than once... the use of the train setting, and the plane's chase of Bond particularly. Connery's performance as Bond is far more assured and interesting this time, making him more likeable, and even slightly vulnerable. This is possible as there's a fine acting job done by Robert Shaw as the villain; a less impersonal, more direct threat than Dr No was, even though he was very little dialogue. The fight, and the preceding dialogue exchanges between Bond and Grant are excellently done indeed. The quotient of ladies is again ample, with the gorgeous Daniela Bianchi even instrumental to the plot of all things! While this film stands on its own terms, it appears that certain elements and components of the ongoing Bond plot - SPECTRE, Q, Blofeld - are continued from "Dr No" and introduced, respectively. This film is very enjoyable, credible and cohesive, and has won me round to the Bond series at this early stage, after the disappointing "Dr No". Splendid, "old man". Rating:- ****/*****</fullReview>

The Bond girl is quite nice. Robert Shaw is excellent, but never has a lot to do until the final act.The direction is nice and the editing frentic as one would expect from Peter Hunt.This Bond film is a favourite alongside Goldfinger and The Living Daylights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Russia With Love", the second James Bond film, sends Bond to Istanbul where he becomes entangled in the machinations of SPECTRE, who are hoping to play the British and the Russians against each other in order to steal a secret decoder device. Further complicating his efforts is a deadly assassin(Played by Robert Shaw, Quint in JAWS) and Spectre's SMESH informant, Rosa Klebb(Who was the inspiration for Frau Furbisshna in the AUSTIN POWERS films), as well as a beautiful defector. The budget is considerably larger than DR.NO, with more intricate sets, action scenes, and special effects, and also a stunning opening title sequence, the first to feature exotic dancing girls. Another notable mention about the film is that it's the first appearence of the late Desmond Lloweyn as Q.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best of Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1963, this is the second film in the 007 series . It is one of the best of the Sean Connery era, with an outstanding story from Ian Fleming's novel, and a terrific screenplay by Johanna Harwood (who also collaborated on "Dr. No"). The story revolves around Bond's attempt at getting a Soviet decoding machine, which is the bait in a trap being set by SPECTRE to kill him. I consider this one of the best of the Bond series. After the success of `Dr. No', producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman doubled the budget and expanded the concept. For the Bond girls they found three former beauty queens, one of whom (Daniela Bianchi, Miss Italy 1960) was first runner up in the Miss Universe pageant. They also introduced Desmond Llewelyn as Major Boothroyd (codename Q) whose gadgets became a staple of Bond films for a quarter century. They filmed in Turkey and gave the film a very exotic (and erotic) ambiance with the inclusion of a racy gypsy belly dancer.The film was destined for success from the outset. Ian Fleming's novel was a best seller, and it was listed among President Kennedy's ten favorite books. `Dr. No' was so well received that a sort of mania was building in expectation of the sequel. When it was released, it was an instant success. It grossed over $75 million worldwide (about $450 million in today's dollars). Broccoli and Saltzman were so confident of the concept that they announced the next sequel, (including the title, `Goldfinger') at the end of this film. The production was not without difficulties, however. Pedro Armendariz learned during the filming that he was terminally ill with cancer. He was deteriorating so quickly that they shot all his scenes first. He was often so weak he couldn't stand. After his scenes were completed and before the film was released, he took his own life, unwilling to wait for the disease to do its worst.This film along with `Goldfinger' represents the best of the series. It was early enough that the concept was still fresh and unadulterated by excessive gimmickry. As the Bond series continued, there was always an obsession with outdoing the previous film. With each film, more aspects were added (stunts, pyrotechnics, gadgets, women, sexual innuendo, etc.), until the stories became trivial and the gimmicks became the point. `From Russia With Love' is the essence of Bond in its purest form, a straight spy story with more intrigue than action.Sean Connery was outstanding in this film. He was energetic and exciting in the role, in complete command of each frame. Daniela Bianchi was also excellent as the duplicitous temptress whose professed love for Bond is always suspect.The DVD offers an interesting behind-the-scenes featurette, with a lot of historical information and retrospective interviews with Connery, Bianchi and others. I've always felt that Connery was the Quintessential Bond, and this was among the best of his Bond performances. I rated this film a 9/10. If you enjoy 007 and you have never seen this film, your experience is incomplete.</fullReview>

It has set the stage for many of the spy movies of the 60s. The fight scene aboard the Orient Express is suspenseful and gripping, just as good as any movie today with all the special effects available. And the women...aaahhhhhhh. Most important, "Russia" has a well-written script, with great dialogue. {Vying for my favorite James Bond movie is Thunderball, which has been redone as Never Say Never.}</fullReview>

Sean Connery will forever be known as the ultimate James Bond. No one will EVER take his place. This movie has all of the cliches of a typical Bond movie - hot women, diabolical villains, super agent gadgets, etc. The one thing that I found fascinating about this movie over all the rest is the atmosphere, which is different than any typical Bond movie. For example, in "Goldfinger", you have Oddjob - a man with a deadly hat, and Pussy Galore, with a name only mother would love to hate. In this movie, there isn't that level of super agent spoof, unless you count the exploding briefcase. Also, Robert Shaw is SUPERB (one of the BEST Bond villains in my book). His piercing eyes alone tell the audience - "Don't mess with me." Shaw would again appear in another Connery film - "Robin and Marian" (1976) as the Sheriff of Nottingham. His greatest success, however, was as Quint in "Jaws" (1975), a role for which he should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Score: 8.5 (out of 10).</fullReview>

I especially enjoyed Robert Shaw as Red Grant, probably the most sinister of all Bond's adversaries. Also, I wonder what happened between this movie and "Goldfinger" that made Q and Bond develop their love-hate relationship. They get along fine here and by the next movie, Q has turned a bit ornery. Oh well. Enjoyable for all Bond fans, and of fans of Cold War/spy thrillers, as this is probably the purest "spy movie" of the Bond series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense Movie and faithful to the original Ian Fleming books.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are steeped in the more recent additions to the series, you may find this to be slow-moving and complicated. It is one of my favorites in the series however, as it is very similar to the pace of the book it was based upon.This is a very tense and dark pure SPY film and it set the trend for a lot of other films for the period of the early to mid-sixties. Most of them probably are not in the same league for sheer enjoyment. Sean Connery turns in a solid performance as Bond for this second in the film series. Lotte Lenya portrays much of the "toad" qualities given her character in the novel aptly. Robert Shaw is very menacing with minimal dialogue as Grant, the main adversary in the film.(Some of the following might be considered potential spoilers:)In 1963 there was still a Cold War going on and you must bear that in mind when viewing this film. SPECTRE wants to get their hands on a LECTOR decoding machine and opts to lure James Bond into getting it for them, while setting him up to be eliminated as revenge for killing Dr. No in the previous film. Daniela Bianchi is a very attractive feast for the eyes as Tatiana (the bait). She is perhaps not the best actress in retrospect, but she is convincing enough for what the script allows. Pedro Armendarez as Kerim Bey is perhaps the best partner for Bond until you get into a few of the later films of the 80's and the present. Most of the action scenes are gritty and tense and the film builds up to them very slowly, but it is refreshing to see Bond using basic survival skills and instinct in this film rather than relying on some of the outragious gadgets in later movies. You get a real sense that his life is in danger here, where in some others perhaps the same cannot be said. The John Barry Soundtrack Leaps out of the speakers at you at key points and adds to the tension.If you are looking for a pure suspense film that is more Hitchcock than real blood and guts, this is the one. It also shows you why the series was getting ready to become a major part of film history within this period.Rating: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic agent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love ("FRWL") is one of the top ten movies in the Bond series. Connery plays a great Bond, of course, but this movie is largely sustained by the supporting cast. The true mark of this movie is that it entertains and maintains suspense despite the absence of over-the-top action sequences required in all modern "action" movies, including Bond movies. This "quiet" Bond flick is filled with great performances, an intriguing plot and substantial villains (i.e., Grant). Although typically overshadowed by the seminal "Goldfinger", released only one year after FRWL, this movie represents a more classic agent-thriller, akin to 50's secret agent films.To get an idea of my preferences in Bond flicks, which is rather eclectic, my "top 5" Bond movies are: (1) On Her Majesty's Secret Service; (2) For Your Eyes Only; (3)The Spy Who Loved Me; (4) Thunderball; and (5) The Living Daylights. I would probably place FRWL as #6 or #7 along with Goldfinger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best bond film of them all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, so it doesn't have a lot of the neat gadgets and devices that have become a signature of the 007 franchise, and it may be a little slow moving than many Bond fans are used to, and it's a bit dated because of the Cold War setting, but this is a classic spy tale and in my opinion the best of the Bond films. Sean Connery is cool and suave as 007. Robert Shaw is absolutely brilliant as the sinister assassin Red Grant. Lotte Lenya is terrific as the other villain employed by SPECTRE. This film also marks the debut of SPECTRE and Desmond Llewelyn. A must for anyone's Bond collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True classic of the 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tough, charming and absolutely supercool Sean Connery plays the British Secret Service agent 007 with a licence to kill in this 2nd Bond film ever made. It's probably the most "realistic" Bond movie because it's does not contain an evil "main villain" with a pervert mind and a sick attention to blow up the whole world just for fun like in almost every other Bond movie. (If you don't want to consider Ernst Stavro Blofeld - SPECTRE's mastermind hiding behind his white cat as one.) Some might say that "From Russia with love" is the most boring film in the history of James Bond movies. Maybe it's because it misses that really huge bad guy and maybe it's the lack of long action scenes but a real Sean Connery fan (such as myself) can understand it's true value as a wonderful piece of classic Bond history of the 60's. There's no such thing as a boring Bond movie! For example the scene in which helicopter chases 007 is an ass-kicker classic. "From Russia with love" is maybe a bit old-fashioned if you compare it for example to "The World is not enough", but still - great fun and a hell-of-a good and nostalgic entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many Bond fans consider "From Russia with Love" the best film in the series. And no wonder. Maybe it isn't one of the most enjoyable ones (like "Goldfinger"), but it's a truly exciting SPY film, which cannot be said about the latest Bonds. There's even a proper PLOT, a well-constructed one. Plus the most perfectly cast bunch of terrific supporting characters.

		<fullReview>FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE was most probably the film you can pinpoint as the foundation for the most successful franchise ever. However, it doesn't grab the attention as much as others, but is notable for the introduction of many Bond trademarks.Connery is as suave and comfortable in the role as he ever is, and add with that beautiful women, dastardly baddies, and the original Bond director Terence Young, and this movie (despite its production problems) was never going to fail.The plot is somewhat confusing (mostly unnecessarily), but it will hold the attention. I wouldn't rate it as well as Dr No, however, although I know this does not comply with overall public opinion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is an amazing film that set the way from future Bond films. From Russia With Love develops true James Bond trademarks as things that may have seem insignificant in Dr. No show their true colors. However, those not used to classic Connery Bond may be disappointed. The plot is much slower than modern films such as The World Is Not Enough or any of the Moore/Dalton/Brosnan films. But the story keeps some very cool consistencies with the book *but is definitely not the same*, which makes it much more interesting. The only tedious part in the film really is the extremely long Orient Express scene...but nothing can be perfect. I give this Bond film 4 out of 5 stars on the James Bond scale and 5 out of 5 on a normal scale</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Espionage At Its Absolute Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best spy thrillers ever filmed. However, for those looking for the typical James Bond flick, this one is curiously out of step with the others. It comes off as a straight and brutally realistic espionage story and at the same time manages to get more romantic than the other movies. The Hitchcock type plot treatment was only tried in one other Bond film (For Your Eyes Only). It is only here though, that instead of action, the emphasis is on the character of Bond and his interactions with the other characters, all of whom were developed in far greater detail than in any other movie. And everyone involved plays it straight. Connery's portrayal of Bond, as well as this movie as a whole, has a certain rough-edged toughness to it that is missing from the more stylish Connery entries like Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever. That's important to note, because while he gives what are generally regarded as his two best performances in those films (he literally carries DAF), he appears closet to Fleming's Bond here. Credit therefore must go to the director and screenwriter. It makes you wonder what if Terence Young, who directed this film, was available to direct Goldfinger. The series could have taken a total different course: becoming suspenseful thrillers rather than chic action movies. Oh well, it probably wouldn't have lasted as long in doing so. So, while Goldfinger deservedly gets the title as "Best Bond Movie" for the phenomenon it started, From Russia With Love is certainly the most realistic and, therefore, best pure spy picture of the bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia with Love was the 2nd and is still the best Bond film to date, building on the themes and style set up by the first film, Dr. No, but distancing itself considerably from that film's tone of cartoonish escapism which would became the trademark of the series. FRWL is a serious espionage thriller with all the elements of a crowd-pleasing adventure expertly woven together. The elements of gadgetry, humour and vulgarisation of female sexuality are played down at all times, appearing only when relevant to the plot and enhancing the film rather than dominating it. This was the first Bond film to include the now-obligatory pre-credits sequence scene-setter, which would soon become exercises in special-effects driven budget-expenditure. Here it is a simple but very effective cat-and-mouse pursuit through the gardens of a mansion at night, ending on a clever twist which neatly introduces the film's study of professionalism undermined by personal involvment. The plot that emerges concerns the SPECTRE organisation's attempt to manipulate British and Russian powers to bid for a Decoder system which would give the victor a considerable advantage in the Cold War. There is no attempts at world-domination, simply a calculated political scheme which adds considerably to the suspense. Connery fits the role of Bond even better this time around and enjoys the demands on his physicality and wit, before the fatigue was to set in and he resorted to a glib caricature. Surprisingly, the film's female roles are given equal attention by the script, from Daniela Bianchi's manipulated heroin to Lotte Lenya as the truly horrific assassin, Rosa Kleb. The villains are charismatic but believably deadly and never overplayed, with Robert Shaw particularly impressive as the agent sent to execute Bond by impersonating a British agent and gaining his trust.Anyone more familiar with the modern Bond films may mourn the comparative lack of action-sequences, but for those prepared to follow the engaging and unpredictable plot, there are some excellent set-pieces towards the film's end, such as the helicopter attack on bond, the fight in the train carriage (17 films later it still the best-executed of any Bond film) and the climactic boat pursuit as Bond escapes to Venice. What remains most satisfying about this film is the attention that has been paid to the human interest. The love story is complex and convincing, the differences between cultures and ideologies subtly drawn and the psyche of the protagonist explored much further than usual. Every so often the producers decide it's time to give a Bond film a bit more "depth" than usual (see Licence to Kill or The World is not Enough) but they have rarely achieved it without unbalancing the picture or striking a false note. From Russia with Love remains the least typical but most rewarding Bond film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies of the series, From Russia With Love can without a doubt be considered as a classic. Sean Connery provides a sterling portrayal of 007 that only Brosnan has came close to emulating since. The supporting cast is truly outstanding and the film consists of the finest set of actors a Bond film has ever managed to ensemble. Forget the loss of direction the series underwent during the Roger Moore years - there is no dependency on wooden acting and gadgets here. Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw are 007's foes here and formidable villains they make to! Spikes coming out of the formers boots, whilst the latter is content on dispatching Bond by attempting to garrotte him! One of the main plus points that the movie has is characterisation. The characters are good because the story allows them to develop. The action in comparison to latter entries in the series is somewhat subdued. However, the fight between Bond and Red Grant (Robert Shaw) has yet to be bettered. Points of interest: Desmond Llewelyn's first appearance as 'Q'; John Barry's first score for the series and the first glimpse of Ernst Blofeld!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a great Bond film despite its age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Russia With Love" is a fine example of good old-fashioned Bond purism. Because President Kennedy had named Fleming's novel as one of his favourite books of all time, the producers decided to release this as the follow-up to "Dr. No". Although modern (especially younger) audiences may be turned off by the lack of action sequences, "Russia" has a fine plot about a top-secret Soviet encoder, the Lektor, which MI6 are desperate to obtain. However, criminal organisation SPECTRE latches on and decides to use it as a fatal lure for 007... The film features probably the best cast in the series. Lotte Lenya is impressive enemy spy named Rosa Klebb, Daniela Bianchi is memorable as unsuspecting cypher clerk Tatiana Romanova, and Pedro Armendariz shines as 007's immortal ally Kerim Bey. And then there's THAT assassin, Donald "Red" Grant (Robert Shaw). He is a wonderfully effective henchmen in that unlike Jaws or Oddjob, he doesn't use a special weapon (like metal teeth), he's just a hard-as-nails bruiser. His fight with Bond is one of the most enduring fight scenes to appear in a Bond film. FRWL was indeed the last film (barring the forgettable "On Her Majesty's Secret Service") to retain the flavour of Fleming's Bond, and it survives as a shining example of that class nowadays.Note: cameo by Walter Gotell, who would later play KGB chief General Gogol in later Bond films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This picture is in my opinion the best Bondmovie. Not because all the elements for a good Bondmovie are in it. We miss an amount of packed action and some cheek in tongue humor. But this is compensated by the realistic story line and the fine casting. Connery plays - as he always claims - his best role and Bianchi is a witty and sophisticated bondgirl. Shaw and Lenya team up as the best villain combination: shady sharp and brutal finesse. The supporting roles are the finishing touch. Nobody deviates or is misplaced. The romantic scenes, which take place in breathtaking Istanbul and Venice and the action scenes, which take place in the mountains of Yugoslavia and the Adriatic sea - are an example of the right setting. The journey through the Slavonic states by train gives it a real cold war atmosphere. The final confrontation between Bond and Kleb is as good as any spy movie can get. Bond plays the role as Fleming sees him in the book. Hard and sometimes romantic, but always at the edge and with some cynical humor. The Bondmovies have gone downhill after this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is classic Bond!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its no question to see why the majority of Bond fans call this the best entry of the series, i feel as though "The Spy who loved me" and "For your eyes only", (Fleming sure had a thing for long titles) are the best. But my number 1 pick is,without a doubt, RUSSIA!Opening with a perfect pre-credits sequence, here we have a comfortable Connery growing into the role of 007. Taking place during the Cold War years, , Bond is sent to Istanbul to meet an alluring agent named Tatiana, who has access to the precious decoding device, The Lektor and bring it to MI6 headquaters, since Britain and Russia are'nt getting along well, all secretly thanks to the one and only, SPECTRE.The SPECTRE orginization is displayed in this film perfectly, showing the audience how deadly and fearful they are. An example is their top henchman, Red Grant (Robert Shaw) who at first seems only like a silent assassin, but before you know it, there he is chatting to Bond like an old friend, unaware of the bada$$ fight that they will soon put on. Some other well filmed action is in here too, the raid at Istanbul,the flaming boat pursuit,and the helicopter confrontation.The music is some of the best of the series too. In fact, the instrumental title track in the beginning sounds better than the Matt Monro vocal version.Though it's difficult to take FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE seriously since Austin Powers has come along, i.e. Rosa Klebb and Blofeld. This still remains as a timeless classic, not only as a Bond vehicle, but a brilliant spy film.Also to those who think this one is boring and dated must have gone to the bathroom during the female wrestling scene. ****</fullReview>

"From Russia With Love" is the first Bond movie where all the elements are in place (Q didn't appear in Dr. No) and though there are better Bond movies, there's no better place to begin than here, with a lucid plotline, bad guys who don't go over the top, and no deformed henchmen. There's no plan to take over the world in any of these movies, but there are strong plotlines and clear villains."From Russia With Love" also presents a welcome performance from Robert Shaw as Bond's Nemesis. The confrontation between these two fine actors is one of the best in the Bond series. The movie is understated, but good, wholesome, violent fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hypothetical question, "which is the best Bond flick?" is probably posed as often as the hypothetical question, "who is the best Bond?" Both questions are designed not to provide a definitive answer but rather to provide a segue to an extended (and hopefully raucous) debate about merits, demerits, and stylisms. And because I love such debates I'm willing to venture that From Russia with Love is the best Bond flick of them all.This film hangs together better than most Bond films, which is not surprising considering that the screenplay is a fairly accurate reproduction of Fleming's novel. The film revolves around Bond's efforts to acquire the Soviets' Lektor decoding machine--a fairly modest goal when placed in the context of Bond's seemingly usual task of saving the world from total destruction. Certain Bond fans probably dislike From Russia with Love because of this, but I think it is one of the film's strong points. (It may not surprise that I also happen to like the relatively modest plot goals of For Your Eyes Only.) Both the original novel and the film adaptation amply demonstrate that a basic Cold War concept can generate excitement in its own right. Now, I don't expect Bond films to approximate the tone or style of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. Bond films definitely should not be too grim and gritty, but a semi-realistic framework makes for a good place to start. And From Russia with Love demonstrates as much.Not only does this movie have a solid screenplay, but it also benefits from an inspired musical score, great minor characters such as Red Grant and Kerim Bey, and a truly awesome Bond-babe in the form of Daniela Bianchi (INSERT WOLF WHISTLE HERE). Most Bond movies have one or more of these same elements, but, in my view, virtually none bring them together with as much style as does From Russia with Love.Oh, and as to who the best Bond is . . . Sean Connery is it, period. (No extended debate necessary.)</fullReview>

NO, this sees criminal organisation SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, as you always wanted to know) baiting our hero with a decoder called the Lektor (changed from the original name Spektor for obvious reasons) and of course a cute girl (Daniela Bianchi) in order to exact revenge on him for the rude way he despatched their previous employee. All manner of classic scenes follow as Bond travels to Istanbul and the climax aboard to Orient Express is unsurpassed; the scene between 007 and emotionless SPECTRE killer Grant (Robert "Shark Fodder" Shaw) being gripping and tense.Any self respecting Bond fan won't be able to resist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does something this simple work this well? It's a plot as simple as that of Dr. No, but where that one drags a bit, this never lets up! Grant has no physical "gimmick" that later henchmen would have, only a ruthlessness that's incomparable. The film also has some of the most beautiful locations of any Bond film. Finally, it introduces Blofeld which (after Goldfinger) will dominate the series until the end of the Connery era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Bond film (Connery and others)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with many of the prior reviews. This is easily the best Bond film, with "Dr. No" a close second. Why? Because it focuses on Fleming's story (with minor changes such as the use of SPECTRE over the KGB), and avoids the gadget-driven excesses of the later films. Other strengths include a sensible plot, excellent supporting acting (specifically Pedro Armendariz), attractive and realistic locations, good camera work, and some good "action" scenes. Bianchi makes an attractive lure, and she is one of the most appealing women to appear in this series. Most important, Connery delivers his best performance as Bond, playing his scenes as a professional "spy" rather than a stand-up comedian or spy parody. This film is DEFINITELY the class of the series.Rating: a "10."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is TOO good for Bond.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is the only truly good Bond film. Dr No. didn't really work for me, and from Goldfinger onwards, the series deteriorates into vaguely entertaining, special effect centered, innuendo laden, no brain required stuff. For most people, these characteristics are synonymous with Bond. But watch From Russia With Love and you'll see it needn't have been like that. This is a classy film which is brilliantly acted, not like the pantomime farce of the Roger Moore era.There are no comedy henchmen here, only one gadget, and that's a briefcase - hardly stunning, and restrained innuendo in comparison with something like Moonraker ("I think he's attempting re-entry sir").The film does have a nice comic side, but is really carried by the acting of Connery and Robert Shaw as silent, but deadly Red Grant. Shaw doesn't even speak for half the film and is still fantastic and both are brilliant in conveying a sense of unspoken, grudging respect for the other (something the pair repeat in Robin and Marian). You sense that Grant is Bond's real nemesis, forget Blofeld, and I also feel that the film portrays Bond as genuinely vulnerable - he's not a virtually indestructable comic book-esque hero like in later films, but a real person. In fact, although Bond triumphs in the end, Grant has the moral victory.And then there's Rosa Klebb. She's so convincingly scary and evil, that she should have the cat stroking duties as head of SPECTRE.In short, don't view this as a Bond film, because that degrades it. View it as a piece of brilliantly acted action / thriller drama. Because that's what it is. Top notch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A serious cold war action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely the best James Bond film and the ultimate cold war suspense thriller. Since the cold war was the main theme of nearly every action film from 1950 to 1990, its refreshing to see that this one was an original. And it contains very few flaws. To start, its only Bond predecessor, Dr No was a masterpiece as well, but From Russia With Love has a much better plot, action, characters, and locations. And Goldfinger, which came afterwards, was a huge hit, but the series soon tapered off afterwards, with each new film being a tired rehashed blend of the first 3 (Theyre up to 19 already, I think thats a bit much).From Russia with Love features exotic European locales, from London to Istanbul to Zagreb and Trieste (via the elite Orient Express) and finally Venice. And don't forget the very curvy female costar, Daniella Bianchi. Robert Shaw is brilliant as the Iron assassin, Red Grant (who has been exhaustingly duplicated in every Bond film since) whose physical toughness and ragingly homicidal demeanor are still a difficult match for Sean Connery's wit. Lotte Lenya of course immortalizes herself as the dreaded Russian witchlike director, and her contempt for everything but "The State" is fearfully noticable in all her scenes.The only misplaced scene in this movie is the gypsy camp battle scene, where Bond is a Rambolike superhero who is everywhere at once and never gets hit by the barrage of bullets which surround him. This too has appeared in many other Bond films (Thunderball, The Spy who Loved Me, Tommorrow Never Dies) and should surely have been omitted. However, the rest of the film is nearly perfect. If you love action, adventure, tastefully gratuitous sex, anticommunism, and thrilling cities, then see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Bond movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is absolutely the greatest Bond movie ever in many ways: it's very realistic, whole case better said whole action that has Bond to do could have happened in those times. Connery using his typical perfect humour and great appearance of Daniela Bianchi as Tatiana, I think one of the most beautiful bondgirls makes this movie great. One scene I like very much is when M and the others are listening to the tape Bond sent. When coming to a dialogue containing talking about love, M says Miss Moneypenny, would you go outside please. But she is still listening through the intercom and after few moments M is speaking to her I know that you are listening so you can send a message to 007. From Russia... also contains the most ugly villain ever it's Rosa Klebb and her ugliness is multiplied when she puts on her glasses. By the way, first appearence of Blofeld and Desmond Llewelyn as Q makes this movie special too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The absolute best of the series, "Goldfinger" included. This is the model that every director wanting to make a spy thriller should follow. The plot is fantastic, with SPECTRE playing both sides, MI6 and SMERSH against each other. Rosa Klebb is by far one of the most memorable villains (and what I wouldn't give for a poisoned dagger in my shoe!). The fight scene on the Orient Express is the most exciting and best choreographed that I have ever seen, and Shaw's Grant makes a great nemesis for bond (Shaw was great in "Jaws" too!) Overall, I have tried but can find very little wrong with this film, except that a few scenes were cut out (when Bond says, "He was right, you know," to Tatiana at the end, there was a scene earlier when Grant mentioned the tape to Bond on the train and said "Quite a performance!" that was cut out.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without question, this is my favourite Bond movie. It contains none of the gimmicks and far-fetched story-lines that some of the others contain. It`s pure espionage at its best. Bond is tempted to Istanbul by the opportunity to get a Lektor decoder, made available by a beautiful Russian clerk. She thinks she is working for the Soviet Union, but is in fact being tricked into providing it by SPECTRE. An intricate plot develops and we wonder if Bond`s judgement is perhaps influenced (negatively) by the beautiful Russian he is maybe falling for. From the exciting and unique opening, to the final scene this movie gripped me. Kerim Bey makes a very likeable and intelligent sidekick for Bond, and the villains are very strong. Robert Shaw is great as Red Grant. He has a remarkable presence in the movie even though he does not say a word in its first half. Rosa Klebb is eerie, and perhaps the strongest female Bond character in the entire series. Some people consider the fight scenes to be the best in the Bond series, and the action scenes are wonderful. Connery is brilliant, and even non-Bond fans can love this film.</fullReview>

The final fight between Shaw and Connery on the Oriental Express is the best fight scene in it's day. This movie doesn't have a truck load of explosions or gun fights, just good old spy excitement.

Of the Connery/Bond flicks, From Russia with Love has always been my favorite, despite the rather boring gypsy camp sequence. Perhaps it's the presence of Lotte Lenya as Rosa Klebb (what would Kurt Weill have thought!!!) and Robert Shaw as Grant, the Spectre agent. The train car fight scene is certainly one of the series' best. The many self-parodying touches of humor are wonderful, e.g. Klebs' satisfied "he seems fit!" after roundhousing Grant with the brass knuckles.Best line: "I may not know the right wines but you're the one on your knees."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia with Love certainly deserves the rank after Goldfinger and Thunderball as it's One of the Very Best Bond Movies of Connery Era.. Most part of it remained true to the Novel which was very pleasant to watch. Q was introduced in this Movie and Connery really does some of his best work of his Bond ever. Daniela Bianchi who played Tatyana Romanova, the Russian Agent is surely one of the Top 5 Bond Girls. Robert Shaw displays the perfect shades of the cunning character of Red Grant. The Briefcase remains the most memorable gadget ever used in a Bond Movie. It was Equipped with a Throwing Knife, 50 Gold Sovereigns, 20 rounds of Ammunition, an AR7 Sniper's rifle and a canister of tear gas. The plot is perfect and the most enjoyable scene is the Fight between Bond and Red Grant aboard the Luxurious Orient Express. I'd highly recommend this Movie to everyone and any Bond Fan should not miss this one at any cost. The Movie is worth the Price.</fullReview>

Sean Connery is magnificent as James Bond. His screen presence is huge. It is because of his great performances as James Bond which is what enabled him to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars. From Russia With Love is so enjoyable to watch. Its story is believable(by James Bond standards) and the action is great. Daniela Bianchi is a good Bond Girl, and Pedro Armendariz is also great as Bond's aide in Turkey. The best character in the movie (other than Bond of course) is Robert Shaw as Grant. He is the greatest bad guy in Bond history. His physical presence and his intelligence pose problems for Bond. The fight scene between the two on the train is fantastic.If you are a fan of action movies, then I suggest you watch From Russia With Love. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may have been 'The Godfather Part II' that taught film makers that sequels should always be deeper and darker. But it was 'From Russia with Love' that showed people that sequels must surpass the original in terms of quality.SPECTRE is fuming after hearing the news that one of their most trusted agents (Dr. No) was murdered by English 00 Agent James Bond. They hatch a plot whereby Bond will recover the Lektor decoder (a Soviet decryption device) and unwillingly give it to SPECTRE. Bond travels to Istanbul where he seeks the help of Kerim Bey to recover the device.'From Russia with Love' is notable for introducing many elements that would remain throughout the Bond films. A globe-trotting plot, gadgets provided by Q and a welcome variety in set pieces. The majority of the time Bond spends in the company of Kerim Bey, who is one of Bond's greatest allies. The connection between them feels real, even if they spend at most a few days helping each other out.Bond barely used his gun in 'Dr. No'; therefore it is welcome to see him use it so freely in 'From Russia with Love'. Particularly in a scene that takes place at a gypsy camp. We have feelings for Bond, because he is not invincible and on more than one occasion almost meets his demise.The key action scenes have a delightful nail biting edge to them that keeps the audience on their toes; whether the action takes place in a hedge maze or a train, urgency seeps into the film and an always energetic pace means that the film does not grow tired or stay in the same location for too long. A delightfully psychotic Robert Shaw plays the villain Grant. He does not properly encounter Bond until the third act of the film. It must be said that their interaction is well worth the wait; both characters receiving fantastic dialogue that is instantly recognisable and quotable. This is the highlight of 'From Russia with Love'; Grant cackling and watching with twisted glee and anticipation as Bond pieces together SPECTRE's true plan.'From Russia with Love' also provides Bond fans with the best Bond girl of the 20th century. She is far more passive as she rarely participates in the action that unfolds. However, Tatiana (a delicate Daniela Bianchi) is clever enough to deceive Bond for quite some time.'From Russia with Love' falls into the category of Bond films that even non-fans can enjoy. This time the action is more weighty and powerful, the plot genuinely intriguing and Grant makes for an excellent Bond villain and the greatest of the sixties. It is everything a sequel should be with a fast pace, action that thrills and sheer fun.</fullReview>

Even better there is no scene of the villain trying to kill 007 using some unusual device that always gives him time for a fantastic scape. Nothing is perfect the villains for at least two times have James in their clean aim, but instead of shooting at once get close enough to be disarmed.

		<shortDescription>Second Bond film that is arguably the best of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to a film series, there's always a sentiment about how the first film is the best and that every follow up, as great as they can be, never quite reaches the heights of the first that made the series what it was. The Indiana Jones series is a good example, with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK being the best, whereas with the sequels it varies in quality. There are a few exceptions where a follow up film happens to upstage what the first did. MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR is easily a major improvement over the original. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is another of the greats. People still debate on whether THE GODFATHER, PART II is better or less than its predecessor. FROM Russia WITH LOVE is definitely a serious candidate for sequels that improved on what the first film did.It is debatable whether this should be considered a "sequel". What happened in the first film DR. NO is briefly mentioned, but overall the story is very much its own thing with a new set of characters and location for Bond to encounter, much like the original Ian Fleming books. Still, it's hard to ignore that it's a vast improvement. DR. NO was a solid film, but compared to what would come later it still needed some refining. This film having twice the budget as the first film is helpful, as they're now able to do more elaborate action set pieces to shake things up. DR. NO had a very lousy score. There was the iconic James Bond Theme, but while that was created by the original composer Monty Norman, it was guest composer John Barry's arrangement of the theme that made it what it was. Because of how great his arrangement was, he was hired as the next composer and would be with the series up until the late 80s, solidifying what people recognize as the "Bond sound". Him scoring this whole film is just an example of how much better this was. I could do without the actual title song though.There's also a stronger variety of characters. Kerim Bey, played by Pedro Armendáriz, is Bond's ally in Istanbul, Turkey. He's one of my favorite allies that Bond has adventures with in this film because he's so full of life and just seems like the kind of guy you want to hang out with at a bar. Bond girl this time is played by Daniela Bianchi, who plays Tatiana Romanova, a Russian cipher clerk who wants Bond to help her defect to the west, but is actually on orders to set him into a trap. There's a cat and mouse play with Bond and Tatiana, using each other's sex appeal to get the upper hand, and you're never sure how much she means what she says when expressing her feelings for Bond until it comes to the moment of truth.The villains all come in a variety. In the book, they're Russians working for the government, coming up with a plan to assassinate Bond. In the film, they were changed into agents of SPECTRE so that it wouldn't carry political overtones (thus give it more broad appeal worldwide). Because SPECTRE is used to replace the Russians, we get our first appearance of Bond's eventual arch nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld, although his face is kept hidden. He assigns the film's villain Rosa Klebb to execute the plan to kill Bond. She's played by Lotte Lenya, who really brings the cutthroat character to life straight from the book, even down to the lesbian overtones that makes her unique among Bond villains. The best of them all however is Red Grant, played by Robert Shaw. He's the man assigned to watch over Bond so that he makes it to the trap the Russians set up, and then by Klebb's orders, kill him. He's easily among the best henchmen in the series, bringing out the kind of controlled frenzy in his eyes as he watches Bond and tries to savor the moment of killing him.A lot of the same filmmaking crew from DR. NO returned for FROM Russia WITH LOVE and a lot either improve or keep up the great quality they showed the last time. Terence Young proves himself to be very effective when directing suspense and would make use of that in future films like WAIT UNTIL DARK with Audrey Hepburn. Some of the same scriptwriters returned to do the adaptation of the original Fleming book, even polishing it up a bit to give it a much better transition into cinema. Ted Moore, the DP for the first film, is back and once again making great use of the locations and sets to make some very appealing photography.Overall, as I said, a major improvement over the first and the series would only continue to grow from this point on. Connery has grown very comfortable into the role. Is it the best of the series? It might be, depending on what you want out of a James Bond film. If you want intriguing espionage adventure, this is the best to offer. For the longest time it was ranked high at #1 as my favorite in the Bond series. I now favor another film, but I'll get to that soon. 10/10.Fun fact: While FROM Russia WITH LOVE is the second Bond film produced, it is based on the fifth novel which immediately preceded the sixth novel DR. NO, which was the first film produced. Might sounds like a huge flub the filmmakers to not go in chronological order, but since the novels were relatively standalone, it didn't matter that they went a different route at the start of the films. It certainly wouldn't matter when they started to ignore the source material, but that's only a few films away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of James Bonds, it's a requirement that you watch From Russia With Love. So many of the Bonds staples that we enjoy today can be found in this 1963 sequel to Dr. No. There are different kinds of Bond films and From Russia With Love is the kind that Bond films that modern audiences tend to have an issue with. It's slower than modern versions with more focus placed on the sport of espionage than back-to-back action scenesThat's not to say From Russia With Love is without its action, in fact there are a number of great action sequences that are incredible to watch on the big screen even after all these years. Sean Connery is expectedly great as James Bond and the story is one of the series best. It's of no surprise that Bond connoisseurs will regularly refer to From Russia as one of, if not the, best Bond films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly expands what the first sets in stone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia with Love, the second film in the James Bond franchise, improves upon its kickoff predecessor in every way. Sean Connery returns once again as Agent 007 and takes his first big case against SPECTRE, a secret crime organization. Two Russian SPECTRE operatives are assigned to retrieve a decoding device known as the Lektor using Soviet Embassy clerk Tatiana Romanova (Bianchi) to secretly lure Bond into retrieving the device and passing it over to them. For Bond, getting to and protecting such device sparks a long line of deadly brawls and gunfights that once again test his wit with fancy new gadgets at hand. Just a year after Dr. No was made, Connery hasn't lost any of the essential charisma and vigor to perfectly carry on this role as the first James Bond. This time around, he is a given a much more sophisticated story to have fun with, as well as an alluring young lady played marvelously by Bianchi. Having station chief Ali Kerim Bey (Armendariz) as a sidekick for Bond adds the right amount of clever, humorous banter that this franchise needs. The pace isn't as brisk and straightforward as the first film, due to the film's comparable complexity, but when the action hits, it hits hard, especially in the second half when a fight between gypsies and gunmen ensues, SPECTRE agent Grant (Shaw) goes cameo, and when a claustrophobic train-car fight occurs. Kudos to Mr. Young and cameraman Ted Moore for avoiding the choppy editing and constant close-ups that would've robbed these superb scenes of any of their tension. Next to its slight unevenness, my only little problem with the film is Lotte Lenya's exceedingly over-the-top performance as a SPECTRE officer. All in all, Bond's second go-around takes what the first film set and expands it for one of the most engaging experiences in the franchise. From MovieScope with Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2nd of the Bond films, this one does not disappoint. It is the last one that doesn't follow the Bond "forumula" - Bond saving the world from a megalomaniac. This one is simply plotted. SPECTRE sends a hit- man out to kill Bond as revenge for his killing of Dr. No in the first picture.This one builds on the promise of the first - exotic locales, beautiful women, good action with more "staples" that will become the hallmark of series - most importantly, the introduction of Desmond Llewellyn as "Q" and his amazing gadgets.A smart, crisply paced action flick.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Bond (Sean Connery) willingly falls into an assassination ploy involving a naive Russian beauty in order to retrieve a Soviet encryption device that was stolen by SPECTRE.Was there ever a better James Bond than Sean Connery? If you say yes, you are wrong. He had the look, the voice, the whole package. Any other Bond since him owes their job to him.This film also has the unusual distinction of being closely tied in with President John F. Kennedy. Apparently it was pushed into production after Kennedy said he loved the novel, and then it has the dubious honor of being the final film he saw before he was killed. Quite odd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best James Bond Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia with Love is a film that is based on the novel of the same title by Ian Fleming.It features Sean Connery as the MI6 secret agent James Bond in the title role.Pedro Armendáriz,Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw co-stars with Connery.Terrence Young directs this sequel to the first James Bond film,Dr.No.In the movie,James Bond is tasked with stealing a valuable Soviet decoding machine. Though he rightly suspects a SPECTRE trap, Bond still unwittingly plays into the hands of a conspiracy engineered by the unseen, cat-stroking villain Ernst Blofeld; his "Number Two," chess grand-master Kronsteen; and his "Number Three," lesbian powerhouse Rosa Klebb. Wrapped up in the mystery is Tatiana Romanova of Soviet intelligence,whom Bond assists in her defection while they fight the romantic feelings that they feel for each other.During his stay in Turkey, Bond gets considerable help from local station head Kerim Bey, who also proves a welcome foil for some lascivious male bonding aimed at objectifying any woman in the vicinity.By combining solid story lines; tightly-paced action sequences that includes fight sequence with Bond and Grant going at it in the confined space of two train compartments and a death-defying chase between Bond and a helicopter; memorable villains; and Sean Connery's performance,this is one of the best James Bond movies ever released on screen. In addition to that,it is among the most tightly-plotted of all the Bond films, and, as a result, is one of the shortest.Also,it exudes style with great musical score and famous "007" theme from John Barry. This film that combines intrigue, romance, and action into an immensely entertaining film that even for audiences will surely enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was young I thought this 007 outing was the weakest of the 6 Sean Connery's and didn't enjoy it as much as the other films; not having seen it for over 30 years I was very interested to see if I still think the same. Well, I enjoyed it and found it up to the standard I expected but probably still the weakest although at this distance it seems a much closer call now. I need to see the others, asap.Sexy secret agent James Bond is ordered to respond and meet a sexy blonde female Russian agent played by Danielle Bianchi in order to receive a deciphering machine from her. Except she thinks she's proudly working on behalf of SMERSH/Mother Russia when her ruthless employer is really SPECTRE which is playing the British off against the Russians. Supremely silly stuff follows, notwithstanding just how close it was to the even more nonsensical real shenanigans perpetrated in the Cold War by the Betters of both sides determined to find ways to fritter away the money extracted from their respective working classes. We're left to guess the benefits this machine would bring to Britain, although we can see it definitely looks like an ordinary typewriter. Favorite bits: Bond's convoluted journey to see Bianchi in Istanbul; the rather nice gypsy belly dancing which is rudely interrupted by an armed gang in search of bloody chaos; the claustrophobic fight in the dark train compartment between Bond and Robert Shaw; the speedy helicopter scenes. Throughout the film it's always clear it's from a bygone era: no mobile phones or computers obviously but also a continuous portrayal of (younger) women as suppliant sex objects that can grate a little ? but it's a fine line Connery usually managed to walk with some humour.It was slick and fun - I was surprised how much I enjoyed it and how much I'm looking forward to re-visiting the other films too.</fullReview>

The action and fight scenes are entertaining (grenades and helicopters don't mix well, apparently). Daniela Bianchi is a sexy Bond Girl, though her role is basically just plot device/eye candy, as opposed to some of the other women who have had bigger roles in the story and action of their respective Bond films. And those gypsy girls...well, I wouldn't have minded if the entire movie would have been about them.&nbsp;Anyway, good villains, gritty fights, the introduction of many of the trademarks of the series, and Connery in his groove, all make this a Bond film that any fan will enjoy.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely "Dr. No" was nice, but it was the second movie "From Russia With Love" that really laid the foundation for the immensely popular series. Produced with more than twice the budget, it still had to use back projection instead of shooting on location in Venice. But we get the excellent "Marienbad" opening scene in which Bond seems to be killed, many beautiful women (and two of them engaged in a cat-fight), titles hovering on a belly-dancer, a spectacular fight on a train which must have been difficult to shoot in such a narrow space (although Roger Moore vs Richard Kiel in "The Spy Who Loved Me" wasn't bad either) and a poisoned knife in a shoe. The movie stayed closer to the novel than almost all others, the most important change seemed necessary for political reasons: the villain now was the mysterious "Number One" of the Spectre organization instead of a Russian general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ah, the old game: give a wolf a taste and then leave him hungry"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film number two in my exploration of James Bond films, Terence Young's 'From Russia with Love,' proved to be a real winner. At the moment, I'm having trouble ranking it against 'Dr. No (1962),' since both films ? despite having the director, two writers and the main star in common ? have quite a different tone about them. The first film in the series had the feeling of a British murder mystery about it, and really only strayed into classic "James Bond territory" once 007 had found his way to Crab Key and met with the eponymous Dr. Julius No. On the other hand, with 'From Russia with Love' ? based on Ian Fleming's fifth Bond novel, published in 1957 ? the filmmakers have well-and-truly captured the spirit that would later become synonymous with the entire series. After his memorable debut, Sean Connery returns as MI6 agent James Bond, who classily divides his time between saving the world and wooing beautiful women.In this film, the evil terrorist organisation SPECTRE ? headed by the faceless super-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (played by Anthony Dawson; voiced by Eric Pohlmann) ? hatches a cunning scheme to trick British Intelligence into stealing the Lektor cryptographic device from the Soviets. There are, of course, a selection of memorable henchmen: Chess grandmaster Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal), ex-SMERSH colonel Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and ominous assassin Donald "Red" Grant (Robert Shaw). The latter is probably my favourite henchman to date; for much of the first half, he remains a silent and enigmatic figure in the shadows, his motives unclear and his methods infallible. When he enters James Bond's confidence by posing as a British agent, we are somewhat surprised to discover that he speaks with a proper British accent, and really does seem a decent gentleman into whom one can place their trust. Grant and Bond's violent tussle in the poorly-lit train carriage is probably the most dramatic and intense scene in the film.After the previous success of Honey Ryder, the filmmakers evidently understood the strong commercial appeal of having attractive women on screen as often as possible. There are a few extremely contrived scenes ? in particular the quarrel between the two Gypsy girls ? that you know were merely placed there for that very reason. However, Tatiana Romanova, the beautiful Soviet Embassy clerk (played by Daniela Bianchi; voiced by Barbara Jefford) proved an apt replacement for the Jamaican beauties of 'Dr. No.' Additionally, 'From Russia with Love' sports a very memorable opening credits sequence, featuring shimmering, refracted titles that distort as the colourful dancing bodies pass over them. Notably, the film was also the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q, the head of MI6's gadgetry department, and here he presents Bond with a briefcase that would later become very useful.A thought that came to mind while I was watching 'From Russia with Love' was about the stunt-men who made all the action possible. Despite their tireless, and often life-threatening, efforts, these courageous performers often receive little appreciation, despite the outstanding results of their hard work being on screen for all to see. During the helicopter sequence, it occurred to me ? though it was difficult to tell for sure ? that the man being precariously swooped by the aircraft was not Sean Connery at all, but more likely to be somebody like Bob Simmons, his stunt double (who can also be glimpsed in the opening gun barrel sequence). These are, after all, men who are quite willing to set themselves alight on a fire-surrounded speedboat when the director calls for it. Sean Connery was, of course, the star who helped bring James Bond to life, but countless others ensured that his films would remain fondly-remembered more than four decades later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Bond movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best Bond movie of them all. If you only see one Bond movie make it this one.Connery is at his best and the gadgets have yet to take over. The fight on the Orient Express train is a standout and never bettered in the series.The film boasts one of the best casts of the series. Robert Shaw was never more menacing than his portrayal here of assassin Red Grant. Lotte Lenya is arguably the best ever Bond villains - "she's had her kicks" Connery is Bond to those of us of a certain age and this was the first Bond film I ever saw as a child. Suffice to say this film is so good it made a huge impression on me and some 40+ years later still delivers the goods. Whenever the Bond producers wanted to change direction with the series when things went way over the top e.g. MOONRAKER they always wanted to try and recreate the atmosphere created in FRWL. Hence the slightly harder edge to FOR YOUR EYES ONLY which followed MOONRAKER. Even CASINO ROYALE (2006) owes a considerable debt to FRWL in its more 'realistic' portrayal of Bond.Try to see this on the big screen if you can. If this is not possible then I strongly recommend you to view the 2006 remastered DVD. The picture has never looked better and the sound is awesome! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An early James Bond film starring Sean Connery as the British secret agent. Sent to Turkey to pick up a Russian coding machine, Bond finds danger and romance with beautiful Soviet diplomatic employee, Tatiana Romanova(played by Daniela Bianchi). Robert Shaw plays Soviet agent and killer Red Grant, who is out to stop Bond and the Soviet coding machine from ever reaching England.This film closely follows the novel as it was written by author Ian Fleming. Fleming had been a naval commander during the Second World War, and after it began writing stories that featured British secret agent James Bond.A well-shot film; the backdrops of Turkey and of Venice are simply stunning. The train ride from Turkey to Trieste, and the boat trip to Venice show 1960's Europe at its most beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Fleming - with just a few basic changes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe that anyone did NOT love this film. And yet, there are those that have trashed it. Apparently, there are some people who don't like Bond because this is the most pure James Bond movie of all time. Having had the good fortune of reading the originals, I can attest to the fact that FRWL is the closest to the original source with a close second being the one George Lazenby outing, "On Her Majesty's Secret Service." The adventure is more pure spy novel than most of the films in this series, and has so many of the elements that make Bobd great thrilling entertainment, It even has a sexy cat fight with bounteous beauties to recommend it. And the last film of Mexican film legend Pedro Armandariz as the wily Ali Karim Bey is just one of the marvelous pluses that make it a stupendous film. Robert Shaw, with his tough fight scene to the death, and the great Lotte Lenya (perhaps more famous as a song lyric in a Bobby Darin song then her insidious Rosa Klebb) make it a great thrill ride. It's only a shame that Jack Lord did not get greedy and put himself out of the film franchise as CIA Bond buddy Felix Leiter.The addition of a helicopter sequence that has now become famous was a clear homage to Master Of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock whom Ian Fleming wanted to direct a Bond film. That was never to be and would have been a fascinating film experience to be sure.The only real gadget Bond uses here is a briefcase with loads of surprises and a rifle that is reassembled with its telescopic site and a different Q (Peter Burton for the one and only time) than the wonderful Mr. Desmond Llewelyn.And for the best eye candy of all, Daniella Bianchi fits the bill so well. It is understandable how anyone could fall in love with her as the title clearly infers.From Russia With Love is the supreme entertainment that should more than satisfy any fan of James Bond 007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the best, but almost...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It boasts so much élan that this second James Bond film should be the best? but somehow isn't quite. A tall, muscular Sean Connery is at his most dourly authoritative, Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya are heavyweight villains, Daniela Bianchi is a beautiful and vulnerable heroine, and the 'Hitchcockian' plot - based on Ian Fleming's best novel ? is appropriately Byzantine.Yet it's probably the most dated of the Bond series. With its Balkan intrigue, gypsy-girl fights and Orient Express setting this is the one Bond film that might have been made in the 50s ? except its violence and sexual charge could only belong to the permissive 60s.The vicious fight between Connery and Shaw in the cramped train compartment is a tour de force of editing (Peter Hunt) and still one of the best fight-sequences in the entire series (and in cinema). The first encounter between a near-naked Connery and Bianchi in Bond's hotel-room has a cool but electric daring, with a hint of kinkiness when we find Lenya filming them via a two-way mirror.It's certainly director Terence Young's best film. Ted Moore's Technicolor photography is as anonymously superb as always, making almost every camera set-up count in establishing the Istanbul location. Look how creatively Young, Moore (and Hunt) use light and space in staging the rendezvous in the St Sophia mosque, for example.John Barry took over as composer here and the music is so much more wittier, really making the action more three-dimensional, from the damp, sinister piano chords that warn of SPECTRE, to the mocking trumpet that underscores Shaw on the train stalking Connery on the station platform.Unlike later Bonds, From Russia with Love is a real film; the makers aren't yet spoofing themselves. Even the small parts here ? SPECTRE's reptilian planner Kronsteen, Bulgarian hit-man Crilencu, gypsy-chief Vavra - are played with real conviction.Apart from 007's exploding attaché-case (the first of Q's gadgets), it's the only Connery-Bond to be uninterested in technology. Perhaps that's what stops it being the definitive one.Never mind; the producers got the balance perfect in Goldfinger the following year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Bond film of all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best Bond film, IMHO, because it is the most believable. The plot isn't about stopping someone from taking over the world; it is a spy mission to collect a cipher machine. There are no incredible gadgets, just items available off the shelve at the time, though the attaché case was customized. The movie moves along a great pace, with the dynamic range increased by NOT having action scene after action scene. It has, IMHO, the greatest one-on-one fight scene in movie history. All the music is by John Barry and introduces the "007" theme, which IMHO is as good as the "James Bond" theme introduced in "Dr. No" and debated over how much is John Barry's and how much is Monty Norman's. (The "007" theme is played at the fight at the gypsy camp and during the patrol boat chase.)BTW, I was 11 when I saw it at a Saturday afternoon matinée with "A Shot in the Dark". The great irony to me is that both films were the 2nd in their respective series, I had never even heard of James Bond or the Pink Panther, and both are my favorite films of their respective series. Without a doubt, the best 35 cents I ever spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, but still entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There may be SPOILERS in this here briefcase!The second film in the Bond franchise is probably the most reliant on the source - the book by Ian Flemming - and as a result makes a great Cold War movie. Here we see James Bond finally doing his job properly, a small cry from the "stupid policeman" of the first film, "Doctor No." Unfortunately, out of all the films, this one is perhaps the most dated in the series.The reasons for this are not actually very clear, because the beauty of the film is that it still entertains even now. One of these reasons is that it IS a Cold War movie, and so a new generation may be confused with the storyline of double-crossing and espionage. Secondly the action scenes are few and far between, and in today's world this new generation needs something more than dialogue to have an entertaining night at the movies. Thirdly we can begin to see the somewhat sexist attitudes to women in this period beginning to show.However, as a Bond film it works magnificently. Sean Connery is once again great as the hero of the free world, a cool character who can become angry at the flick of a knife. His main nemesis, Donald "Red" Grant, is played well by Robert Shaw, and these two men give it their all in the fantastic fight on the Orient Express.It is in this fight that the first proper Q gadget is put to good use, and here we should also make a mention that this is Desmond Llewllyn's first brief but vital appearance as Major Boothroyd a.k.a Q. The case is a "nasty little Christmas present" which I believe no businessman should be without.Other villains in the film are kept really to a minimum. Lotte Lenya is very good as Rosa Klebb, a repulsive traitor with lesbian tendencies - although why she herself comes fatefully to get the Lektor machine at the end of the film rather than get one of her lackies to get it instead is beyond me. Still, it was in the book, and this film does stay remarkably true to the novel.The object of Bond's - and Klebb's - affections in this movie is Tatiana Romanov, the character played well by Daniela Bianchi. she is both very attractive and devoted to her cause, and the nature of her character makes Bond's brief abuse of her rather shocking. But then again, it is a sign of how dated this film is becoming.Still, if you don't mind the obvious rip-off of "North by Northwest", or the fact that SPECTRE have to rely on using their feet to get anyway - the knife-flick shoe - then this is a good, entertaining film to just lose yourself in.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This second movie in the Bond series has drawn almost universal praise. I can see why. The story is well told, the characters are well established, In addition, we are given a nice villain with a knife in her shoe and a beautiful blonde Bond girl. What I like about From Russia with Love is the plain Jane appeal of the story. There are some nice stunts, but it is relatively down to earth; even compared to Dr. No. Another great point is how the filmmakers keep the development of the SPECTRE plot line. Connery too keeps up his trademark panache as Bond. Though this time Bond and his exploits seem biased more to the serious side; which works fine in this particular story.The strengths about From Russia with Love also hold its weaknesses. The film lacks the grand scale of later installments. Also though the villain is quite threatening, she isn't the larger than life threat Bond usually tracks down, merely a henchman for the bigger game of Blowfeld.One final observation. While From Russia with Love is highly rated from numerous corners, many of theses same people frown on two other similar Bond movies. Both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Living Daylights have similar serious approaches to the Bond character and for some reason, those two movies aren't good enough. I find these two installments to be much better entertainment and overall, better made than From Russia with Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest in its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is more than just a great Bond movie, it also is a great movie on its own. It's well constructed and has a solid, fast paced story, with some great memorable action sequences and characters in it.This movie is quite different from other Bond movies in many regards. First and foremost reason of course for this, is that this movie is the second Bond movie ever made. The creators obviously tried to surpass the success of "Dr. No" and make this movie an even bigger and spectacular one. They certainly succeeded in this but it also means that this movie is at times lacking in its special 'Bond' kind of feeling. Sure it has Q, M, Moneypenny and gadgets but its not as fun to watch, mainly because the movie obviously tries to take itself as serious as possible. However none of this matters, since it makes this movie a really good genre movie and quite frankly one of the best ever created. Also keep in mind that back in the early '60's there wasn't really an 'action-movie genre' yet. That probably is also the reason why this movie feels quite different from other movies genre- and also later Bond movies in particular.Overall the older Bond movies are of better and higher quality than all of the later ones, of course with some exceptions left out here and there. My theory is that it is because the early movies still take themselves serious, while all of the most other later Bond movies go over-the-top with its action mainly. Basically the Bond character himself also fits better in a '60's atmosphere, also obviously due to the way how he handles women. Nothing wrong with Bond movies these days, after all I enjoy (most) of them highly and they serve as good mindless entertainment, especially the Roger Moore Bond-films but honestly, they can't beat the oldies.Unlike many other Bond movies, the story plays a significant part in the movie. At first its slow without any action but thanks to its fast and spot on pace the movie still is exciting to watch. Surprisingly the movie at the end still turns into a spectacular one, when lots of action occurs on screen. The boat and the later following helicopter chase sequences are one of the best and most memorable Bond action sequences ever. They are surprisingly big and spectacular. But also the confrontation sequences between Grant and Bond are memorable and spectacular, even when no action occurs. Kudos to Sean Connery and Robert Shaw's acting for that.What makes this Bond movie also a highly memorable one are its characters. The villain always is an important element of a Bond movie. This movie its main villain is Ernst Stavro Blofeld of SPECTRE but as we are used of him, he doesn't get to do any action. Real 'action' villains of this movie are the hit-man Grant (Robert Shaw) and Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), a former Russian she-man colonel now working for SPRECTRE, who has lesbian tendencies and pointy shoes. Both of them are portrayed by some very solid actors, which helps to make them both very memorable Bond villains. Especially Shaw is wonderful. In the first halve of the movie he doesn't say a word but from the moment he meets up with Bond and starts to speak his character becomes a different one and Shaw's acting ability and versatility becomes obvious. Also look out for Walter Gotell, who plays a small part as a villain in this movie but later went on playing the Russian general Gogol, who appeared in numerous Bond movies over the years. But not just the villains are great. Pedro Armendáriz plays a real good and likable 'criminal' character, in his final role. Daniela Bianchi is a good Bond girl. Nothing too spectacular, she just mainly serves her purpose well. It also of course helps the movie that it has Bond regulars Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), Q (Desmond Llewelyn) and M (Bernard Lee) in it, who would all later re-appear in more than a dozen more Bond films.This is simply one of those movies in which everything just adds up and works well. The pace is incredibly good and makes the movie even tense and spectacular to watch when no action occurs. The acting and characters are great and the movie is big in spectacular in its action. Everything in this movie fits and it helps to make this one of the best and most memorable Bond movies but also one of the best and earliest action genre movies ever made.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

This one's a lot better than the first movie in the series thanks in no small part to a measured performance from Robert Shaw as an enemy agent, and Connery showing a lot more confidence in the role than before. Unfortunately the plot's still as flat as a pancake and the direction's somewhat bland, while the characters spend way too much time sitting around and talking for the plot to gain much momentum.

		<fullReview>The scenario is quite different from the book, however this could be understood. What i really don't like about the movie is that the Turks and the gypsies are not played by people who can speak Turkish. They have just made some actors memorize Turkish dialogs. It would be much better if they spoke English, or Turkish speaking actors were used. Most of the Turkish dialogs take place in a gypsy camp, so at least the gypsies could have spoken English. Also, the gunfighting scenes seem very unrealistic. People may think that i am expecting too much from a movie made in 1963, but there are many great movies taken with lots of care in 60's, so calling this one a good movie would be disrespectful to all those good ones. Still, I don't regret watching this , but just because it is a Bond movie. Also, I think that Sean Connery hasn't done his best in acting, which makes me think even he didn't like the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Istanbul is a rough town. Bond stays on the move.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second James Bond film and starts setting the template for the future 007 flicks that follow . Bond(Sean Connery)is assigned to pilfer a secret encryption machine and weaves in and out of a trap set by the evil organization SPECTRE. He also encounters a ruthless assassin(Robert Shaw); a soviet spy turned defector(Daniela Bianchi); meyhem on the Orient Express and later a kick/chair fight with a sinister villainess(Lotte Lenya). Plenty of gadgets, great scenery, suspense and action to go around. This is only a glimpse of things to come. Also in the cast are:Pedro Armendariz, Walter Gotell and Eunice Gayson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But oh... you haunted me so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not safe to say what this refers to exactly, maybe Romanova, maybe Grant, maybe something else...? Probably all of these. This is the BAFTA-winning film "From Russia with Love", Sean Connery's second movie as James Bond. My favorite parts were the scene early on with the amateurish fake Bond and the final scene with Lotte Lenya's character. She and Robert Shaw make for one of the more memorable (and most different) villain pairs in Bond history. This movie also has a truly great theme song, which scored a Golden Globe nomination and it's even better when we actually hear Matt Monro's singing and not just the melody at the beginning of the movie. One of the core issues in here is once again the Cold War and the filmmakers made a good choice by not making this too much against the Soviets, but actually letting the real villains in here come from another organization (SPECTRE). Also, a short "Dr. No" reference is included.You will find many of the features that made Bond so famous in this movie. The political references, the fight good vs evil, the Bond Girls, Q, M, Blofeld and Moneypenny and a couple more. Leiter is missing this time though. However, I was wondering why this movie was called "From Russia with Love" as most of the action takes place in Turkey (just like one of Craig's recent movies), some of it also in Zagreb and Venice, but none of it in Russia. The card Bond signed for Moneypenny may have been enough. Anyway, this film is all about a priceless decoding machine and Bond's attempt to secure it for his government. Stunning women and sinister villain pave his way. And yet, even if I liked the scenes I mentioned earlier and Bond's showdown with Grant in the train was pretty memorable and tense, this film lacked some of the epic moments other Connery Bond movies had, especially "Goldfinger". Maybe this actually made this one of the more realistic Bond movies, but it also took away some of the fun I felt. Bund over the top is not a problem at all for me, actually a welcome inclusion.The film runs for slightly under 2 hours and is over 50 years old now. The director is Terence Young and this is number 2 of 3 Bond movies he directed. I personally found Romanova one of the less memorable Bond girls, but Lenya sure makes up for that. What an evil woman indeed. Bianchi's character was very young and still pretty naive and it said a lot that she was drugged before the crucial train fight sequence, so she would not get in the way of the men. Still, she got her moment in the end with the Rosa Klebb fighting scene. Also thumbs up for the filmmakers for not being scared of depicting Klebb as a lesbian character. A bit of a brave move in the early 1960s. All in all, this film is a success and a must see for fans of spy thriller movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia with Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm a Goldfinger guy, From Russia with Love proclaimed as the best Bond doesn't bother me if you feel that way as many fans do. I think it has all the necessary requirements essential to the success of a joyful Bond experience. Lovely Bond girl (Daniela Bianchi), check. Magnificent Bond villains (Robert Shaw as the fearsome blond heavy; Lotte Lenya as butch Russian Colonel of SMERCH and defector to S.P.E.C.T.R.E; Vladek Sheybal's supremely confident chess master; the never seen but heard #1 of the S.P.E.C.T.R.E organization, with the white cat and signet ring), check. Great charismatic Bond ally (Pedro Armendariz), check. Fun repertoire with Miss Moneypenny and the throwing of the hat which lands on the hatrack. The gadgets (a suitcase that explodes, holds a rifle handle with a gun, a dagger, and gold coins), and action sequences (a helicopter tries to get at Bond, the gypsy camp has an infiltration of S.P.E.C.T.R.E spies, several key scenes in Istanbul including a bombing on the Russian embassy which allows Bond to secure a Lektor decoder (the McGuffen of the film)), check. Bond quips are on display, there's a fun "sharing of information" as Shaw's Grant gloats as Bond appears cornered and vulnerable for death on board the train, and the key fight between Grant and Bond is money in the bank. There's even a slick sniper shot where Armendariz, wounded arm, uses Bond's shoulder to shoot an adversary climbing out the billboard window of an apartment (through the mouth of the model on the billboard!). Bianchi's seduction and total devotion to James after their lovemaking is hilarious; this coda to Bond's sexual abilities is a lark. There's even a clever use of petrol in a boat that helps Bond get out of a trap as other boats with S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agents appear to have him at their mercy. Lenya gets one last chance to take out Bond, but, alas, her supposed ally (Bianchi) prefers James to her mother country. The plot by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. to use a Lektor decoder to pit the English against the Russians just to get it for themselves seems perfect, but James Bond is the equalizer. Then there's Connery once again as Bond, as charismatic and hunky as ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond Really Hits His Stride in This Brisk, Captivating International Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery is already in full command of his role at the onset of Bond's second adventure, which sets this film off on a roaring pace from the word go. Much more straight-laced and serious than the previous episode (and a far cry from the camp that would characterize the late Connery / Moore era), it still finds time to crack an indulgent smile or flash a knowing wink when appropriate. A rock solid suspense/action/adventure genre-bender, From Russia With Love eases from gripping moments of tension to smart bits of detective work with almost no effort at all... a careful balance that this series isn't usually able to manage so efficiently. As a direct follow-up to the events of Dr. No, it's also an impressive step up in almost every category - enriching and expanding upon many of that film's good ideas while cleanly slicing away most of the bad ones. Loaded with a perfect lead, an exotic romance, a healthy supporting cast and a strong, dangerous villain, my only complaint is that it could have benefited from a faster timeline aboard the Orient Express. One of the character's best showings, it stands the test of time incredibly well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where From Russia With Love Stands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Returning for a sequel a year after Dr. No, Sean Connery is Bond in this very thrilling 2nd film. From Russia With love is another favorite of many including myself. It is surely a classic Bond film which, in 1963 made Bond a famous character and from the release of this Bond film, much more 007 films would come. Again it was a brilliant adventure with the very intriguing train scene. From Russia with love stands 5th on my list where I have ranked the 007 films from worst to best. Watching it for the first time I really didn't find it so special. Around 4 years later I watched the film again and really enjoyed it. It really can prove that Sean Connery is probably the best Bond actor, though, my favorite is Timothy Dalton.From Russia with love is favored a bit more than my liking for Dr. No</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>007's Second Mission is One of the Highest Quality in the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having watched the 007 series straight through from the beginning (DR. NO) to the? well, not the end?the latest, I've noticed a lot of patterns in the franchise. For example, I see FROM Russia WITH LOVE as the last real spy film in the series for almost four decades. Seeing as how this was only the second movie in a series that has now survived fifty years, it obviously wasn't a trend that continued long at all. FROM Russia WITH LOVE was the last Bond movie for many years that felt like actual espionage in action. Code phrases, secret meetings, assassins, and basic gadgets no more complicated than a briefcase with secret compartments. The series wouldn't return to this serious edge until the Dalton films in the late '80s and then the Craig movies in the '00s. There is little to no campiness in the movie and it handles itself almost totally seriously, which I find more engaging in a good Bond movie. The movie begins soon after the events of DR. NO. SPECTRE wants 007's blood for disrupting their Jamaica operation and killing their operative, Dr. No. The head of their organization puts his top people into forming a revenge plan. James Bond is to be lured to Turkey under the guise of a Russian operative's defection. Bond is to meet with the woman, Tatiana Romanova, and bring her to England with promises of a Russian Lektor decoder. Meanwhile, SPECTRE will be guiding Bond into their trap on the Orient Express where they plan to murder 007 and escape with the Lektor themselves.The second movie has been touted by many as one of the best in the 007 franchise. I disagree, but it's not for lack of trying. As I mentioned above, I really enjoy this movie for being a solid espionage thriller with real suspense without resorting to craziness to keep the audience's attention. It's very low key and grounded, and I love it for that. My problem is that the movie is a bit of a drag for most of the running time. From the moment that Bond arrives in Turkey until he finally arrives at the Orient Express, the movie crawls a little too slowly for me. The entire sequence when the mission takes a detour for Bond's mission contact in Turkey (Pedro Armendáriz in his final role) brings him to a gypsy camp for? something that wasn't made quite clear enough to me. It feels unnecessary to the story with the exception of giving the Russians' assassin another chance at killing 007. Bond doesn't even meet with Tatiana until a good portion of the movie has passed and, by then, you just want to get to the part when SPECTRE springs their trap. Once the movie finally hits the Orient Express, it's everything I want the movie to be. Suspenseful and topped with a brutal fight when Bond finally confronts the man who has been stalking from the very moment he arrived in Turkey, the assassin Red Grant.Speaking of Grant, the man is one of the most imposing villains Bond has faced in the history of the franchise. His threatening presence is made all the more frightening at the fact that we don't hear him speak until more than an hour and a half into the film and, even then, it's as the SPECTRE plan comes to a head. He is played to perfection by Robert Shaw and I can understand why so many lists include Grant as one of the best Bond villains ever. FROM Russia WITH LOVE is a film of many Bond firsts. In addition to the first great villain, the film also boasts the first pre-title sequence in the series in which James Bond is assassinated? sort of. It was a great way to grab the audiences attention and it set the standard for every movie that followed. FROM Russia WITH LOVE also introduces Desmond Llewelyn as Q for the first time. The character, named Major Boothroyd, actually appeared in DR. NO but had been played by Peter Burton. Llewelyn, a 007 movie staple, would go on to play Q until he passed the reins to John Cleese in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH in 1999. This movie was director Terrence Young's final venture into the world of 007 and he set the standard for great quality in Bond's missions. FROM Russia WITH LOVE is one of the stronger films in the 007 canon and, even if it didn't live up to the hype when I finally watched it, it stands as one of the best quality films in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that solidified James Bond's place in cinematic history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. No introduced Bond to the world of cinema (unless you count the Climax Mystery Theater production of Casino Royale) but From Russia with Love proved that the character had staying power, while being the rare sequel that was superior to the original. Many of the elements that became classic set pieces in the films started here: the equipment briefing from Q (Desmond Llewelyn's debut), the dangerous assassin henchman (Robert Shaw's Red Grant), Bloefeld (seen in limited glimpses of his hands, but not his face), and amazing vehicle stunts (the Dr. No car chase notwithstanding...). The film ups the intrigue, with a more complicated plot, while continuing the trend of beautiful women and exotic locations.The film opens with one of the most memorable teasers, as it appears that the film with have a very short running time. We see Red Grant quickly dispatch Bond, only to discover that he is a double and this is a SPECTRE training exercise. This serves to introduce Grant as a truly deadly threat, while giving a glimpse at how resourceful SPECTRE really is. We see SPECTRE assemble a team of specialists: Kronstein (Vladek Shebal) the chess master and planner, Rosa Klebb(Lotta Lenya) the KGB officer/traitor and field commander, Red Grant (Robert Shaw) the previously seen assassin, and Tatiana (Daniella Bianchi) the Russian cypher clerk who is a pawn in SPECTRE's game of revenge.We meet back up with our hero, interrupting another tryst with Sylvia Trench, a feature that ends here. Bond is briefed on his mission, though he suspects a trap, and we are introduced to Desmond Llewelyn as Q, complete with an attaché case that provides just about everything a superspy could need, apart from a cocktail shaker. Bond is dispatched to Istanbul, a favorite setting for spies and intrigue. He soon meets the best ally character ever seen in the film (or books), Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendariaz). From there, Bond and SPECTRE begin to cross paths.The film wonderfully mixes action pieces with character moments, shifting from loud and exciting to quiet and intriguing. It has one of the most memorable casts of characters (and actors) and has nary a wasted moment. It features numerous memorable scenes, from our introduction to Bloefeld (mostly heard, barely glimpsed), the spying from the canals under Istanbul, the gypsy camp, the fight on the train, to the daring escape, and closing fight. There is something here for everyone. There is action, romance, tension, masterful character performances, a cat and mouse game, double bluffs, and pulse pounding chases. Few of the subsequent films would have such a near-perfect balance.Although the film seems somewhat dated now, it is probably the best introduction to the series and the film that will likely make a fan out of the viewer. There are few lapses in logic, or things played too comedically. It's rather chauvinistic, but that's Bond. If I have one quibble, it's the unresolved plot device of SPECTRE Island. We are introduced to the training center for SPECTRE agents, yet we never return to it again (in part due to the lawsuits and rights issues surrounding Thunderball and SPECTRE). Did SPECTRE abandon the base? Was it force to sell it off after suffering repeated setbacks at the hands of Bond? Did they turn it into a timeshare resort? Was it sold to finance the volcano base and rocket? It's ironic that FRWL is the film that really established bond, despite the previous effort, as it was the book that launched the film series. Fleming's novels weren't big sellers in the US until FRWL appeared on a list of President Kennedy's favorite books. Sales of it and other Bond novels skyrocketed and a series was launched. It's funny to think that Fleming had actually written it to kill off Bond (though he left the door open, by making Bond's fate open to interpretation). Had he left it at that, we might never have had this series or seen Sean Connery as a leading man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia with Love (1963): Gender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery's second outing as James Bond, 007 sees him attempt to help a female Russian cypher clerk defect in return for a Lektor coding machine. As with other Bond films of the era the film is subject to debates surrounding gender and the representation of women. The film is very male dominated in that most of the central figures are male. The film supports the idea that women are passive sex objects with the opening credits sequence. This is demonstrated with lingering shots of a belly dancer's legs and stomach. This implies that the titles are designed to satisfy the male audience the film is ultimately aimed at. This is further reinforced later on in the film during a scene at a gypsy camp. Furthermore the idea gender representation is further reinforced by Bond's first meeting with obligatory Bond girl Tatiana Romanova. This scene sees Bond enter his room to find her lay in his bed further alluding to the idea that women are there for the satisfaction of men. However a medium shot of Bond's naked upper body subverts this by demonstrating a female gaze as well as a male gaze. Along with this it is true that many of the male figures have major roles but this is view is opposed with the character of Colonel Rosa Klebb. Therefore subverting the traditional view of woman championed by Feminists like Mulvey. That being that she is the main villain and has a high rank in not only the Russian army but also as Number 3 in SPECTRE. However the fact the role of the villain is associated with men is implied by the masculinity of Klebb a woman the complete opposite of Romanova. Romanova is the classic example of what a woman was expected to look like and is referred to by Bond as one of the most beautiful girls he's ever seen. The films two primary female characters are complete juxtapositions in that Romanova is attractive and yet really passive, she just lets herself be hit by Bond later in the film whilst he's trying to get information from her. However villain Klebb is a stronger woman but has sacrificed her looks and femininity. A way of interpreting this could be that women can try to better their lives or remain passive and stay beautiful. Whilst Romanova is portrayed as falling madly in Love with Bond and told to obey him, the character, to the audience feels as though she is just being almost pulled through the film. This is further highlighted by how she is manipulated into unknowingly deceiving Bond. The film's main focus is on its central character of Bond and the traditional film hero is often male. The male characters are either or both physically and mentally strong an example being the iconic fight onboard the Orient Express.Although the film contains the traditional representations of gender it's still one of the best films of the series and a great Cold War Thriller. After From Russia with Love the Bond series started to mark a shift in its representation of Gender with stronger female characters in the films that followed and over fifty years has coincided with numerous waves of feminism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know in my heart that this is overrated and yet I can never explain why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been slightly negative towards the Bond films of the 60s and as a Bond fan this is heresy, yet I can never explain why. Maybe this means that I'm wrong, that they are in fact the best ones and that they are just not for me. I can't say it's because they're old and slow, I like a lot of films from the same era and I am a big fan of the books. This raises another question, why then do I not enjoy the Connery films that much when these are the films that are the closest to the books? To be honest the Bond franchise' stories were at their best when they were taken directly from the novels. The more they change them generally the more stupid they become. From Russia With Love is interesting, it is almost a direct translation of what Fleming wrote and the story is a good one. The characters are interesting, the film is thrilling, the villains are creepy. The plot is overcomplicated, but for good reason, the film company didn't want to use Soviet villains so they added the SPECTRE terrorist organisation in instead. This does complicate things but I understand why it was done. I think the problem lies in the time period it was made. Because of the 60s Bond has become too soft. The Bond of the books was a hard, unforgiving danger-loving, sexist man who loved to drink, fight and gamble. The Bond of the films is essentially the same but watered down a lot until he is virtually unrecognisable. It is only recently in Casino Royale when I think they finally got it right. Connery plays this "soft Bond" and I am not too keen on his portrayal, but it was the 60s and they probably weren't allowed to do anything worse than they did with regards to violence etc. I do like this film, Connery is good, the setting is interesting and the plot it done well. It is enjoyable to watch but I just feel that it doesn't quite do the book justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Bond action film never sets foot in Russia...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The location photography for FROM Russia WITH LOVE is full of splendid shots of Istanbul, Turkey, Italy and Scotland, but never gets near the territory mentioned in the title. Nevertheless, this is a gripping cold war spy story with Bond once again fighting SPECTRE's villains and encountering beautiful girls along the way.SEAN CONNERY's second turn as Bond is a good one, although I prefer him in his non-Bond roles which came later on. LOTTE LENYA as Rosa Klebb is "a disgusting woman," as DANIELA BIANCHI (a Russian spy) so aptly says. But it's ROBERT SHAW who commands the most attention as the film's chief villain. His fight with Connery aboard the Orient Express is one for the books. Shaw says barely a word for most of his performance, but that evil glint in his eyes says it all. PEDRO ARMENDARIZ is his usual competent self as a man abetting Connery against SPECTRE.The combination of action, thrills, eye-filling scenic photography and John Barry's score helps considerably to make this one of the best of the Bond series. My top preference is still DR. NO.Summing up: Smooth, sophisticated and lots of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's started already. Many have, over the years, declared Connery as their "favorite Bond," because of a lack of gadgets and a presence of better plots and story. From Russia with Love belies that declaration, however, as this gives us our first genuine introduction to "Q," (Desmond Llewelyn) although we don't really get to know him (get to see the Bond version of Muppet Labs) until Goldfinger.The plot is solid, so I won't say it was contrived to make use of Bond's new gadgets, but I will say it's convenient that he works in every little nuance of each feature of that wonderful briefcase. Actually, I won't be too hard on FRwL, as it IS only the second Bond film, and the small amount of gadgetry used is nice.The question posed surrounds the determination which villains are THE villains? Our choices this time involve the Soviets, the Bulgars, the Gypsies, and SPECTRE. While we know SPECTRE is involved from the very beginning, it's fun trying to guess who ELSE is involved, and how Tania will act when it's all said and done.Does she really love James, or is she very good at what she does? This installment is where most of the base Austin Powers elements come from. The villains are numbered (#1, #2, #3, etc.), the kitty is introduced, Frau's counterpart is brought to the fore, and we see those diabolical buttons which control everyone's fate, and so on.Connery's Bond attempts to demonstrate early in the franchise that Bond does possess ingenuity, and the gadgets are just tools for a professional.All in all, this one is a lot of fun, and we are beginning to see the Bond most Baby Boomers remember fondly from childhood, but it won't be until Goldfinger that we get the over-done title song and near-nude dancers in the intro. Probably the best, but not my very favorite.It rates a 9.49/10 from...the fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FRWL is the best of the Bonds films. The gadgets had not yet made their presence felt into the stories, and by incorporating the Soviets into the plot, it is grounded in real world international relations, despite SPECTRE's presence. It even had an influence on international chess tournaments- the giant chessboard seen in the early scenes was an invention of the movie makers.Anyway, this wasn't the first movie to have a pre-credit sequence, but it introduced it to the Bond series. Unlike most later Bond films where the pre-credit sequence could stand alone as a short subject, this is an actual prologue. And what a prologue! It has you wondering just what's going on. I also like Kerim Bey. He's a surperb ally and has a good sense hospitality, as demonstrated by taking his coffee the same was Bond does on their first meeting.Watch it.

In this movie, the Bond girl, Daniela Bianchi, was such a beautiful lady. Not much to say about the effects and sounding... Everything is just so... 54 years ago.

		<shortDescription>A pity about the dire-logue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is my second-favourite Bond film (Goldfinger still takes 1st place). It was only Bond's second outing so the director, writers &amp; crew were still trying to tell a story with a beginning, middle and end. Later efforts just became a series of spectacular set-pieces linked together.This is a genuine spy story centring on a plot to steal a de-coding machine from the Russians, but there is an added twist in that, for the first hour, the audience knows more than 007. We know that it isn't the Russians who are pulling the strings but Spectre and Bond is just being used.So, what's the let-down? It's the inter-play between the two main characters. Having Daniela Bianchi's Italian accent dubbed into a Russian accent provided by a British actress probably doesn't help but the scenes between Connery and Bianchi are just flat. During their first encounter in Bond's hotel room, when Bond says, "You're one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen" - people have shown more passion deciding what dip to have with their burger and fries!Think of the scenes between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in North By Northwest or, more recently, between Daniel Craig and Eva Green in Casino Royale to see what might have been. More than in most other Bond films the girl is not just there for decoration. The whole plot revolves around Tatiana Romanova and her phony "defection" and so much more could have been done with that. Sharper dialogue and a little more depth to Tatiana's character would have made all the difference.So, not the best film but still streets ahead of later Bonds.</fullReview>

Grant was the first super strong co-bad guy followed by, Oddjob (Goldfinger 1964), The man who gets eaten by Piranah's (You Only Live Twice 1967), The man who Tracy throws into the spikes on the wall (OMHSS 1969), Jaws (The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker 1977 &amp; 1979), Eric Kriegler (For Your Eyes Only 1981), Gobinda (Octopussy 1983), Necros (The Living Daylights 1987) and Stamper (Tomorrow Never Dies 1997).As I said with OMHSS Rosa Klebb looks too much like Irma Bunt.Blofeld didn't really do much in this film but he was still good when he did something.One more question I need answering so can someone email me or some thing with the answer please.1. Is the guy that Grant kills in the museum played by Sean Connery?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Bond films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Definitely one of Connery's finest, and one of the best in the series altogether. The effectiveness of Sean Connery's second outing FROM Russia WITH LOVE cannot be judged by how neat or how innovative it is as an action movie. FROM Russia WITH LOVE has since been dated as an action picture, but as a pure thriller, still effective after the Cold War has been said and done, this is possibly one of the very best 007 movies, and arguably a great influence on its genre. The second 007 film ("Dr. No" being the first). "From Russia with Love" is one of the best Bond films, but in this era, it's pretty hard to see why. Like I said, these Boond films are either still praised, or forgotten. I for one praise it as a classic, and I know many others still do. I'm sure those people (young and old) who saw this on the cinema, will remember it like it was yesterday. This film has contributed a lot, not just with future Bond entries, but also with other spy adventure/thriller movies. Who would forget the famous knife on the shoe, Blofeld and his two agents, the other famous Q gadgets and so much more. "From Russia of Love" is well-considered a classic for those reasons and other more.Sean Connery gives his very exceptional performance as Bond, and the villains, gadgets, moments are as memorable to Hollywood as it is today. A genre treasure and comes close to perfection. Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia With Love- James Bond At His Best ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A musical score and song generally can make or break a film. Such is the case for From Russia With Love. This 1963 film has a haunting theme which can never be forgotten.Sean Connery, always fabulous as the sexy James Bond, is at it again. He is just masterful in the role of the darling British Agent up to his neck in intrigue and usual suspense.Acting kudos must go to veteran actress Lotte Lenya, widow of legend Kurt Weill, for her performance as a major player in the evil organization of Spectre. As Rosa Klebb, Ms. Lenya was the embodiment of evil. She'd sell her soul to the highest paying devil. As wicked and ugly as they come, who can ever forget her knife in the shoe final scene climax. She takes a bullet to the chest and collapses against that wall in true Hollywood fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hot off "Dr. No", Sean Connery returns as James Bond. This time, the evil organization SPECTRE is trying to infiltrate both the US and USSR in order to take over the world. So, 007 goes about trying to investigate. In the process, he meets a hot* Russian agent named Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi).*Well of course she's hot. When is 007 not in the presence of some hot babe? Anyway, Tatiana's boss Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) is secretly working for SPECTRE, and wants to use 007 as a means to take over the world. You can probably guess what sorts of things happen, by which I mean there's a lot of sex. "From Russia with Love" may have been the coolest James Bond movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting plot elements, but not good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is called one of the best bond films by man fans, but personally I can't see why. Sean Connery, like in the first and third Bond film, is still quite good and one of the high points. Robert Shaw is truly menacing as Grant, but I'd like to have seen more of who he really is. The Bond girl here, Tatiana, is played well by Daniela Bianchi. She adds some interesting elements to the plot. This film is arguablly the most espionage out of any Bond film, but there are still several good action sequences. The two that come to mind the most are also in the list of best Bond action sequences. The first is the scene when the Helicopter chases Bond because it adds paranoia and fear that any minute he might get killed. The second is when Bond is being chased by the boats and he manages to destroy them quite ingeniously. Even though the fight between Grant and Bond on the train was good, it wasn't that exciting because it was rather short. The script is solid, but a bit faulty because there is too much mystery around the villians. Also Bond doesn't deliver any lines in this movie that stand- out, unlike Dr. No, Goldfinger, Goldeneye, etc. The direction by Terence Young is guiding enough to be very good, he pulls the cast together extremly well and if you watch the making of documentary on the special edition DVD, you'll see how he did it and why he did such a good job. The locations is another problem, Istanbul isn't exoctic enough for a Bond film. It's too crowded and doesn't seem to be beautiful enough. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSAn interesting stage in the development of the Bond franchise. With more ambition and humour, bits of this film work and others don't, though generally it's a worthwhile entry into the canon.The first SPECTRE scene is one of almost unbridled exposition, with a hint of parody creeping through. Rosa Klebb is a very daft creation, while there's an early post-modern moment as Matt Munro's sublime theme song plays on a radio.Desmond Llewelyn makes his debut as Major Boothroyd (Q), a telling sign of how silly the series was to become, given that here he plays the part completely straight. Connery seems a tad smugger than last time, yet despite the odd signs of laziness it's still a considered performance.Sexism makes its first real appearance in the series, from the belly dancer titles to the cleavages and Klebb's stereotyped lesbianism. Also a shock to see Bond slapping a woman. Best of all though is a wrestling match between two scantily clad gypsy women, which is entirely superfluous to the plot.The dynamic of this one is the polar opposite of Dr. No: here the first half meanders, while the conclusion sees the pace tighten. This comes largely from the plot being more set piece led than before. What exactly is the whole point of the gypsy camp sequence anyway? Despite lasting for nearly ten minutes the film's structure would be unaffected by its removal. The whole film is a lot of effort for such a meagre premise (the transport to the West of a cipher machine) though again this is more espionage thriller than daffy action movie and so it's suitably rewarding.The best scenes involve the nice direction of James being filmed making love and his clash with Red Grant. The film-twisting conceit of Grant's plan ("I get a kick out of watching the great James Bond find out what a bloody fool he's been making of himself.") is a brilliant touch and hugely advances the picture's standing. Thankfully these key scenes are delivered with gusto, and lack the sense of the ridiculous that these "villain talks before hero unexpectedly gets the upperhand" scenes usually incur.As usual for a Connery Bond it contains - filmed backdrops and dubbing notwithstanding - impressive production values that went astray for the sloppier Lazenby/Moore entries. Though being well put together cannot fully compensate for a paucity of plot, as is the case here.As a carefully mounted love letter to Hitchcock From Russia with Love is one of the better 007 movies, if not the best the series had to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond as He Was Intended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite bond movie. It is a movie of intellect and suspense. It is a true spy movie. While there is some tongue-in-cheek stuff, it really has a balanced plot, good villains, sex, and a satisfying unfolding of events. Bond is put in a place where he knows he must trust someone but doesn't know who. He gets himself caught in a Cold War drama where the good guys aren't always obvious. He is being watched by his adversaries and must play a cool game of cat and mouse. The early Bond films gave us a human character and while Connery made the role his own, the gimmickry is less and the spying and counter-spying are more. I remember that this film was a challenge to my young mind. The efforts to find the secret mechanism work. Connery is able to enhance his suavity to the nth degree before becoming a bit of a caricature. When "Goldfinger" arrived (a wonderful movie) a bit of innocence had been left aside. I really like the James Bond in "Dr. No" and "From Russia with Love." From here he starts to transform into a sort of smug superhero--fun but a little hard to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond's second outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bond's mission against Dr. No may have been a success but SPECTRE is still a threat and they want their revenge. They aren't going to just attack him though; they wish to use him to acquire a Soviet encryption machine. To this end recent SPECTRE recruit Rosa Klebb arranges for Tatiana; a worker at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul to contact British Intelligence and claim that she wishes to defect with the encryption machine? but only if Bond will help her. She does not know that Klebb is no longer a Soviet agent and believes that she is taking part in a mission to provide false information. In Turkey Bond meets up with the consul Karim Bey who helps him get the machine out of the Soviet Consulate and arranges for Bond and Tatiana to escape by train? of course this won't be easy as both Soviet agents and SPECTRE are keen to get their hands on the machine.This second outing for Bond is even better than the first, Sean Connery is great in the role and the beautiful Daniela Bianchi, who played Tatiana, is one of the best Bond Girls. A good bond film needs good villains and this has a couple of great ones in the form of the thoroughly horrible Rosa Klebb; played by Lotte Lenya and the suave but psychotic Grant, played by Robert Shaw. There may not be a SPECTRE lair to blow up in this one but there are gunfights, hand to hand fighting and an explosive scene where SPECTRE agents aboard speedboats try to capture Bond. This film also introduces Blofelt; head of SPECTRE? although we only hear his voice and see his famous white cat? it will be some time before he is seen. We also see Q for the first time; the gadget he gives Bond is far more believable than some things provided in later films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unquestionably the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sean Connery started flying around in jetpacks and mini-planes, before Roger Moore went into space and dressed up like a clown, before Pierce Brosnan got into his invisible car and well before Daniel Craig embarked on his vendetta leaving a trail of bodies in his wake, we had a simple, straight forward and realistic Bond film which is still undeniably the best in the entire series history. It is the Bond film which every Bond film tries to emulate, but almost none have succeeded. Perhaps the reason for this film's success is its gripping and intriguing plot, which though intricate, is easy to comprehend-the brainchild of Bond's creator Ian Flemming, which first appeared in literary form in 1957. The film adaptation certainly does the novel justice and then some more. SPECTRE, the mysterious criminal organization bent on world domination, has conceived of an elaborate plan by means of which they not only hope to extort money from the Soviets, but also severely embarrass, humiliate and ultimately destroy British secret service agent, James Bond, in retaliation for his murder of their agent, Dr. No (in the previous film). Having already been briefly acquainted with the plot against 007 in the beginning, the viewer knows that when the suave and sophisticated agent is sent to Istanbul, seemingly to rescue a defecting Russian agent who claims to have fallen in love with him and is bringing along a Lektor decoding machine (the ultimate price the Secret Service has been after for years) with her as her 'dowry', something is not quite right. There is an exciting fight sequence in a gypsy camp, a nighttime assassination in an Istanbul street, and the major highlight of the film, a train ride across Europe in the Orient Express. Also noteworthy is Robert Shaw's role as Donovan Grant, the SPECTRE assassin whose mission is to kill Bond, who maintains a subtle and ominous presence throughout the film. Though Grant is only really a henchman in the larger scheme of the villains plan, it is his confrontation with Bond which proves to be the climax of the film. Perhaps one of the endearing qualities of this film, apart from its realism and its chilling and tense Cold War atmosphere, is the fact that is in no way a formulaic Bond film (of course, back then, the classic Bond formula had not yet been developed). From Russia with Love contains more twists and surprises than any other Bond film, most of which have largely stuck to the formula, with minor variations here and there. Also, while Connery's Bond is quite tough as nails and a dangerous professional spy, hes still quite human and vulnerable and not a superhero by any stretch of the imagination. This film is ultimately the Bond film against which all other Bond films are ranked and proves that all the CGI, excessively gritty violence, implausible stunts and world domination plots in the world cant top an intellectual work of genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First, The Best, The Worst, My Everything.. !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll tell you, this movie got : The First : _The first teaser/a pre-credits sequence in the start of a Bond movie._The first job John Barry took in Bond music._The first appearance of true Bond gadget (the trick attaché case)._The first appearance of "Q" played by Desmond Llewelyn._The first appearance of Ernst Stavro Blofeld._ And ..I almost forgot, the first appearance of Ernst Stavro Blofeld's cat also ! _The first Bond movie to end with the declaration "James Bond will return in?"The Best :_One of the best theme songs ever made. Its music can be pleasantly hunting. From Russia With love, from many aspects, is better and more memorable than its movie._Hands down, the best cat fight ever filmed. Just WAW! This is awesome. I mean it got nothing to do with the story, but who cares ?!, that's the sweetness of Bond movies. I bet it was too hot for its time, and I know that it's still too hot for today (I think fiery sexy is the word). It taught me something about the gypsy girls whereas you can love them, but you mustn't LOVE them ! So sexy, and so fierce as well. Finally, this scene cinematically is one accurate definition of the word "wild"!_One of the best, and most winningly outrageous, opening credits ever. Ohhh that must've rocked hard those days. I even preferred it over Maurice Binder colorful bunkum of idiot thin shadows afterwards ! In fact these credits mark the first and only time Bond's credits were more of a dance than a dark cut-out photos of playboy magazine !_One of the smartest, funniest, and most stylish sidekicks Bond ever had. Really Kerim Bey, as a character or as a performance by Pedro Armendariz, was highly clever, if not the best._One of the best anticlimaxes ever (the appearance of Rosa Klebb at the hotel). At 1963 these tricks weren't so fashionable. It was rare and totally unpredictable. The Worst :_The worst role played by (Robert Shaw). True he was a perfect evil match for Connery, but I hated seeing him as a killer robot. However, what the heck.. give the man a break (he needed one anyway!)._One of the worst Bond girls ever : Daniela Bianchi. OH MY GOD. She's neither that sexy nor beautiful. And she's SILLY? Super SILLY !_Although I'm not a fan of belly dancing, but as a viewer I must say : the belly dancing at the gypsy village was a complete trash of a performance. The girl looked like she's having an enormous pain out of colitis or something. This wasn't a welcoming of Bond inasmuch as torturing him ! Without a shred of doubt, this is the worst belly dance I've ever seen in my life !_One of the cheesiest weapons in the history of cinema (the shoe's knife of Rosa Klebb near the end !!) like that was too hard to avoid (!??).Extra :_Maybe the most used soundtrack ever. This movie's music score has been played in countless Arabic movies during the 1960s and the 1970s in mostly action and thriller flicks, especially the bit of the cat fight._Perhaps the last Bond movie as espionage one. Being the most close to a film more than a movie. After that it's big, mindless, live cartoon action and nothing more. Hence, you won't find this kind of scripts at next Bond movies much, or you just won't find it !So, is it fun ? YEAH. But nearly not by the standards of Bond you know !P.S: Yes, there was a phase where Bond girls were voluptuous.. Hmmm.. Those were the days my friend !</fullReview>

This movie takes a while to get going and first half hour I found the movie really slow, I just could not get into it. There were some decent actions here and there in throughout this movie, I really enjoyed those scenes in the movie. There were some decent effect in this movie, with that helicopter car chase scenes was good for it's time. I did find some parts of the movie a bit dull, after some actions, the movie calm down again and I found middle part of movie even more slower then first half hour. I did enjoyed the fight scenes in train, A lot more better then fight in the first movie, it wasn't over to fast. I really enjoyed the last 15 minutes of the movie, those scenes were really good and great way to end the movie. 5/10PS: I got hour into Goldfinger (1964) (As it was late 00:45am) So far , I think it's the best yet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I really appreciated about this film is the continuity. In DR. NO, Bond was about to score with a beautiful lady and here he once again is interrupted with the same lady! That was a nice touch.As for the rest of the film, it was terrific and nearly as perfect as DR. NO. In fact, they are both so good it's hard to determine which is the better film. DR. NO is closer to the Fleming novel but FROM Russia WITH LOVE had some terrific characters. Robert Shaw was amazing as the robot-like assassin (though very different from the sociopath in the book). Colonel Klebb was also one of the scariest and most malevolent ladies ever to appear in a Bond film. Together, they were a great team out to destroy Bond and both the Russian and British intelligence agencies.In addition to these baddies, the film had some lovely support from Italian Daniela Bianchi (playing a Russian) and Pedro Armendáriz (playing a Turk). Another supporting player really was the lovely scenery and locales for the film. Seeing Istanbul and the Orient Express was lovely and set a great mood for the film.Finally, I must point out that with the exception of a tear gas cannister and an interesting folding gun, the film lacked the wacky gadgets of the later Bond films. As for me, this was a huge plus--making this and DR. NO both tops for their realism and lack of reliance on special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second only to Goldfinger!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I'm not a massive fan of James Bond films. I do, however, tend to enjoy the ones starring Sean Connery; and while it doesn't touch the masterpiece 'Goldfinger', From Russia With Love is definitely one of Bond's better adventures. It's also one of the few films that has managed to keep a solid reputation after it's release. While many of Bond's adventures are strictly cult flicks, or just not very well liked; this one is often cited as great film by critics from all corners, and there's a reason for that. This is the Bond film that set the staples of the series, including the theme music and many of the regular characters. The story is typical of the sixties and fires James Bond straight into the thick of the Cold War. We follow the maverick secret agent as he attempts to foil a plot by the evil corporation S.P.E.C.T.R.E. to steal a Lektor (Russian decoding device). As James Bond walks straight into their trap, he must thwart both their agents and the Russians, as the East faces the West a la the Cold War.My main problem with this plot is that it's not on a big enough scale. The only thing at stake is a decoding device which, while still not a bad prize, makes the film feel like a big song and dance for a very small payoff. Still, the plot is handled with great skill and while the film doesn't feature any stunts that rival some of the more recent Bond offerings; the ones that do feature definitely work and succeed in getting the adrenaline flowing. The film is definitely a lot better as we get past the hour mark. The first hour features rather a lot of talking and not much action; and while I don't really have a problem with this, most people tune into Bond flicks for smart wit and action sequences. The second hour makes up for the slow first, as we are treated to a climax that takes place on rail, road and water. Sean Connery is, without a doubt, the best man to ever play James Bond. His persona and mannerism fits the character brilliantly and, in my opinion, was never properly replaced. On the whole, this isn't as great as Goldfinger; but it is a very good film. From Russia With Love is one of the few that will appeal to Bond and Non-Bond fans alike!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the early Bonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of DR. NO, a film which I personally didn't care for very much, the Bond series becomes a familiar hybrid of hi-tech gadgetry, high-speed chases, explosions, exotic locations, some very impressive stunts and action mixed in with a traditional romance, some cheesy one-liners, and a complex spy plot involving numerous factions. Yep, I enjoyed this film a lot, from the good cast to the well-shot locations and complex characters. This is what a real Bond film should be like.Here, Sean Connery looks and sounds more assured as Bond; indeed he's positively glowing in the role, and handles his action and lines with an easy smoothness. Connery is supported well by a love interest in the shape of Italian Bianchi; a hulking, memorable menace in the shape of the ever-excellent Robert Shaw; and a whole plethora of unusual and eccentric memorable supporting characters. These include Lotte Lenya as the lesbian Rosa Klebb, one of the most nasty little women you'll see (that poisoned shoe spike is a natty little weapon), and Pedro Armendariz who is excellent Kerim Bay, a friend of Bond's. Being filmed in the UK, a number of familiar British faces fill out the cast, including future Hammer starlet Martine Beswick as a virtually unrecognisable fighting gypsy girl. Desmond Llewellyn makes his first appearance as 'Q', handing out a supremely cool and lethal suitcase to 007.Action highlights include a shoot-out at a gypsy camp and a long, but highly tense, train ride in which Bond is stalked by the psychotic killer Shaw. This culminates in a fine one-on-one battle between the pair in a train carriage of all places, which was so good that it was revisited in LIVE AND LET DIE. To top things off, there's an explosive speedboat chase at the film's finale. One thing I liked a lot was the inclusion of more comedy than in the previous adventure, which Bond's one-liners being consistently amusing and lots of little odd touches (like Bond realising that Shaw is an impostor when he orders red wine with fish, of all things). In all, FROM Russia WITH LOVE is an intelligent adventure film for lovers of action and thrillers alike, with a great cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sorry but i do not watch a James Bond movie to keep my interest alive by mostly watching beautiful exotic locations and a beautiful cinematography. The DVD back cover description of the movie says it brings James Bond to face a spectacular boat chase, a violent attack by an helicopter and a mortal fight aboard a train. Well, all of this happens in the last 25 minutes of a 2 hour movie. James Bond spend 45 minutes of the movie hanging around with Pedro Armendáriz, shooting one bullet there , and mostly only talking. We do not see enough of James Bond alone showing his skills as a secret agent, he is not enough the central character in his mission and there is not enough adventures,not facing enough danger and it is too calm. It sometimes feels like a romantic and love story. Goldfinger is remarkably more entertaining than "From Russia with love". Importantly, Sean Connery doesn't have in this movie the humour, the one line punch that Roger Moore constantly had to lighten the mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one is a classic Bond film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually a pretty smart second installment in the "007" franchise and when I mean smart I mean the general plot of it all. The villains plan and the direction of how James Bond goes up against the villains and how the villains try to take down Bond was executed pretty well. It would have been pretty cool though if they showed the hit- man named Grant and Bond playing a bit of a cat and mouse game to wipe each other out. This film introduces the organization that calls themselves SPECTRE which has certain amount control over the economic system but wants to become more of a supreme world power by satisfying their customers and fulfilling their missions around the globe. Mainly by hiring people with special set of skills to join them, one being a master chess player. James Bond or 007 played again by Sean Connery is the charismatic lead and the ladies man and will be playing this role for quite some time all the way to "Diamonds are Forever". Anyways the only man for the job as always and always. Despite this being about a super spy and the film coming out during the 60's, this one wasn't all that cheesy and Bond's gadgetry is pretty tame in this one as well. But it still carries that trademark essence of a 007 movie. This is one of the favorites by Bond fans for many reasons. I personally appreciate it for what it accomplished when it first came out in the 60's.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Silly, but Still Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this second installment in the franchise, James Bond receives his first gadget: a black, rectangular briefcase filled with all sorts of neat stuff, none of which seems to be especially fantastic, as would often be the case in some of the later films. Where the movie does diverge radically from reality is in the fact that the Soviet Union knows what he looks like. In fact, when the movie starts, we see some guy running around in a James Bond mask at a Russian training camp where they practice killing James Bond. Whereas in "Dr. No," Bond was at pains to keep from being photographed, in this movie, MI6 gets information that a female Soviet agent, Tatiana, having seen his photograph, has fallen in love with him and wants to defect, bringing with her a Lektor cryptographic device. In real life, once a spy's identity and face is known, he is reduced to having a desk job from then on, but not so in the Bond franchise. And this is just the beginning. As future Bond movies were made, he began to acquire superstar fame, so that all the world had heard of him. Apparently, the producers of the movies figured that since everyone in the audience would already know who James Bond was, then the same would have to be true for the characters in the movie.In the novel, it was the Russian agency SMERSH that Bond had to contend with, but here it is actually SPECTRE, a terrorist organization first introduced in the movie "Dr. No." Because these films were made while the Cold War was still going strong, when Russians were still thought to be utterly evil, it might seem strange that the movie would pull its punches in this way and make a terrorist organization be Bond's nemesis instead. But that is capitalism for you. By not offending the Russians, the movies could be shown behind the iron curtain, thereby increasing the profitability of the franchise.SPECTRE's chief strategist is chess champion Kronsteen, who comes up with the plan to get possession the Lektor after Bond steals it from Russia with the help of Tatiana. The plan works pretty well, up to a point, but Bond ultimately foils it. Now, it should not be surprising that a spy of Bond's caliber might triumph. After all, even a world chess champion will lose a game occasionally. The thing to do would be to get Kronsteen started on plan B. But no, we find out that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure, the penalty for which is death. And so, Kronsteen is murdered. This begs the question, Who would work for these people? A Russian chess champion would be able to live pretty well by simply playing chess. What would he have to gain by joining up with an organization so unforgiving of failure? Of course, the point is to convey to the audience just how ruthless SPECTRE is. But there is a difference between being ruthless and being downright ridiculous.Despite these flaws, this is still one of the best Bond movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . as the only folks dumber in one of these spy "thrillers" than the "good guys" are the "bad guys," presumably because they do two-a-day workouts, therefore suffering TWICE as many skull fractures, cerebral hemorrhages, and cortex disturbances. Whenever it's time for the "geniuses" at SPECTRE to corral James Bond, they turn out to be woefully understaffed. Maybe this has something to do with their practice of killing off many new recruits in "training drills" to see how quickly a senior SPECTRE agent can liquidate a new blood nearly blinded by the thick rubber "James Bond" mask he has been forced to wear for his senseless execution. SPECTRE is an organization run by fastidious cat fanciers, and it's a puzzlement why ANY British bulldogs fall prey to it. SPECTRE only shines at board games. It might make a few second-graders fearful of being bumped off in a local Chutes &amp; Ladders tourney, but the notion that SPRECTRE could frighten anyone over age 10 is ridiculous. The slow pace of FROM RUSS!A WITH LOVE allows viewers too much time to think about whether SPECTRE should be renamed SPINCTER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good things coming out of Russia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From the Soviet Union with Love" just doesn't have the same ring to it, does it? This 1963 Bond film, pushed out a mere twelve months later when people went bonkers for the franchise's opening film Dr. No, veers the series into Cold War territory for the first time whilst maintaining a lot of what made the first film so effective. That is to say, the fictitious criminal organisation made up of super-villains capable of filling in as Bond's latest nemesis is still around in the form of SPECTRE; while tensions between the East and the West circa. 1963 are kneaded into proceedings without bossing things too much. There is a great dynamic therein as this quasi-escapist franchise finds its feet so early on without wanting to alienate its audience too much ? to do this, one would need to veer the film too deeply into furrowed territory that toyed with a fear of nuclear war and this, it would seem, was not where things were deemed necessary to go so early on.This second instalment is arguably better than its predecessor, a more unapologetic film; a meaner film, a leaner and more complicated narrative involving set ups; double crosses and preordained traps on top of an affecting tale of the complexities of one woman's changing morals thrown in for good measure. The film carries with it more of a brutal tone ? the body count is higher, characters of whom we have genuinely come to quite like are mercilessly killed off and the whole thing carries with it more of a sadistic tone. Take, for instance, the core villain pairing; who at once waltz around their offices thwacking the sides of chairs with riding crops and take time out to enjoy moments of absolute triumph over the enemy by abusing the situation and inducing power-exchanges not limited to the requesting of the recipient's begging of their life and adoration of the dominant's shoe.Where the previous film refused to show Joseph Wiseman's villain until much later on, From Russia With Love plays its hand in the opening scene when it depicts Robert Shaw's hulking thug "Red" Grant engaging in an early instance of one of those aforementioned games of sadism, pain and death. He is skulking around the gardens of a manor house in the dead of night. Whom he's stalking is James Bond, at least somebody who resembles James Bond ? an individual whose rubber mask may create the illusion of the series' famous hero but doesn't necessarily have to reflect said man's skill in combat. Armed with a fibre wire to Bond's pistol, Grant is able to negate the surroundings and wipe the dummy out before the lights come on and the training exercise ends, thus emphasising his own skills in combat. Grant strikes us as more of a physical match for Bond, where No may very well have been the intellectual match but was not the physical threat to Bond once his empire had collapsed around him.Where Grant is the muscle, a certain Rosa Klebb (Lenya) is the sociopathic mind charged with organising base level operations on orders of those at the top of SPECTRE. In a film that takes its time to both preordain and depict fights between scantily clad gypsy women so that they may try to conquer the other for the 'honour' of being with a certain man, Klebb is a welcome antidote to questionable gender politics as she swaggers around her scenes and generally bosses people around. Take, for example, the instance when she first inspects whether Grant is up to the task of fulfilling a specific role: Grant's oiling down at the bereft of a young woman in a bikini terminates the second this other female enters the fray and barks orders thus a certain engendered order is established.SPECTRE launch a plot that involves garnering revenge for the already deceased Dr. No, something that involves Klebb mischievously garnering access to an electronic device of some value that's already in possession of the Soviets. Furthermore, the plot involves a faux-defection by that of a young Russian girl named Tatiana Romanova (Bianchi), who has specifically asked for Bond to transport her to safety ? device in tow. What most parties are unaware of, however, is how SPECTRE have designs on making a profit out of the whole escapade in eliminating Bond for themselves on top of selling the machine back to Soviet Russia. Bond (Connery), meanwhile, is enjoying leave with a girlfriend whom he met during Dr. No when he gets the call to report in. On a sunny day in the park with champagne and a hamper, the tearing of one away from where one lives and those whom one loves for business (business that will eventually see one deployed to a grottier and more inherently dangerous locale like Turkey) is apparent as early as this in the Bond franchise. More modern entries would be champing at the bit to get Bond away and gone to somewhere more exotic so that the adventure may begin."Adventure" is still the buzz word, but being 1963 and at a time when the franchise was what it was, the adventure is structured and more interesting than usual. In Istanbul, feverent conflict between the native Capitalist allies and the Communist Bulgarians threatens to boil over without ever quite doing so, but SPECTRE exploit this and there is a genuinely engaging dynamic to each of the parties being omnipresent for each of their respective reasons. There is still a down trodden feel to things, like the world of espionage and such is unglamorous and quite dangerous; where the women are not meek, good looking allies but people out to exploit you - where creativity and care is required if you're the writer of this content if you're to create a believable universe wherein realistic things can happen but not to a too complicated-a extent. This entry is very much enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two unbelievable scenes from the most believable Bond film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the Bond films FRWL has the most credible premise, to steal a code making machine and return it to British Intelligence, no lasers, no spaceships, just a typewriter that every spy wants, however at the start we see Bond being stalked around a garden at night by Robert Shaw as a Spectre assassin, Bond is killed and the scene is then lit up by floodlights revealing a group of people who had been observing this hunt, we then see Bond's face seemingly being ripped off to reveal the face of a stranger, it wasn't Bond after all, it was a man with a mask on that made him look identical to Bond.Now forgive me if i'm wrong but the quality of the mask was perfect to the point where we, the audience, were convinced it was Bond that was being hunted (which isn't surprising because it was Connery playing the part), which means that Spectre have in their possession a genius mask maker, who could theoretically make a mask of anyone's face thus making them identical to the masks subject, so it's hard to imagine that Spectre would be bothered about retrieving a code machine when they could impersonate anyone they wished, the mask maker is the the espionage equivalent of the Golden Goose.We are also shown Bond being taken on a trip through the sewers by a Turkish agent who wants to show him a device that his men had installed in the Russian Embassy under the pretence of maintenance work, the device is a huge brass periscope taken from a submarine which allows the user to observe who is attending meetings at the Embassy, we even get to see what they can see, however we do not get to hear what is being discussed at the meeting because for some reason the Turkish secret service forgot to bug the room with a listening device which would of made the periscope redundant.....d'oh !!! These are probably two of the best examples of a director asking the audience to suspend their disbelief for the sake of a dramatic touch i've ever seen in film making and the irony is they are embedded in the most believable of the Bond films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well plotted Bond with cheap thrills overriding obvious logic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Bond is lured to Istanbul to capture a secret Russian coding device - but little does he know that is it is actually a trap.In the 1960's they went gaga for all this. Watching a Bond movie was an event in people's lives and the next day they would spend hours recounting every cheap thrill, every bedded women and every fight to the death in the office or the playground. Looking at it now, you say "very well made and structured - but hard to take seriously." Bond is - as usual - both very smart (according to the back story) and very stupid at the same time. Missing obvious clues and relying on luck to stay alive. In short, the polar opposite of what any real agent would do.Connery is an ex milkman from Edinburgh. He looks every woman's dream with his glue on hair and hairy barrel chest, but he is clearly a man that has never driven past a university no matter got a double first. He fights in a strange way too - always going for the chin and never working the downstairs first. All powerless - in real life - slappy arm punching.You have to admire the 1960's women's hairstyles and glasses. Puts about ten years on any woman. Did they have something against hair that moved in those days? Russian agent --Tatiana Romanova (played by the soon to disappear Daniela Bianchi) is quite good, but hardly an ideal match for our superhero and her "sexy" underwear looks like something your mother would wear when your father was out of town. (Was getting laid in those day something to write home about. Bond is secretly filmed having sex - but to achieve what? He is not married and I am sure his penis is regulation size!)The rule here is to keep it simple and convenient. It is really a big chase movie with nothing really happening that needs reporting on. People are trying to kill Bond? Well hold the front page! Robert Shaw plays one of the failed would-be's and do you know what: I think he would have made a good Bond himself. You could imagine him winning fights with his physique and powerful legs - unlike Connery who clearly can't fight for real.Credit the script and the director for creating a template that a million have followed, the hero ad-libbing his way out of danger, for example.However the whole thing has the look of a faded colour supplement. At the time of publishing all the latest glamour, all the latest gadgets and all the latest styles - now they all look a bit crummy, dated and plain crap. The series also helped push down people's throat the idea that smoking was really clever and sophisticated. The worst message of them all and worth knocking a whole point off for...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another dark outing for Connery, FRWL sees Bond lured by SPECTRE into their territory as revenge for his interference with Dr. No, and Bond is misled by Donald Grant. Bond realises what is happening just in time, and in a brilliant fight sequence, kills Grant, played strongly by Robert Shaw. In the end Bond stops SPECTRE'S plans again, but knows they will return.Probably one of the best scripts for a Bond film, full of twists and surprises, but unfortunately the film is not as good as it should have been. The Bond girls are instantly forgettable, the theme song is awful, and there are few good set pieces. What lifts it though is Rosa Klebb's good performance, helped by a couple of shoe gadgets, and the pre-title sequence, which would continue in all following Bond movies. The introduction of Q, rather than Boothroyd sparks the beginning of Bond's use of gadgets and another good relationship in the films. Simply not memorable enough, but points for being gritty and realistic. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of disaster for the Bond movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whereas "Dr. No" was generally fun in its tone and enjoyable, "From Russia with Love" is at times either too serious or too goofy. The plot is more realistic and convoluted, but the characters are more cartoonish, and Bond acts like some kind of playboy instead of spy. Unlike Honey Ryder from "Dr. No," this Bond girl is gorgeous, but also shallow and wooden. In addition, the setting is terribly boring and uninteresting. Actor Robert Shaw gives a nice performance as a villain, but Connery is terrible. When Bond kills Robert Shaw's character, for example, he goes on with a big grin, constantly calling Shaw an old man, as if he is relishing the fact that he killed him. This isn't professional. When Bond kills in "Dr. No" he rightfully takes it as part of the job and puts it behind him. This movie also introduces the annoying Q, although he wasn't annoying by this one. "From Russia with Love" is Bond's first step in the wrong direction, and, unfortunately, for the most part, Bond would continue that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistically Speaking, the Best James Bond film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only Bond film that I think is worth the perfect '10' score on IMDb. It may not be the most iconic (that title goes to Goldfinger), but it is the Bond film with the most realistic plot, the most realistic settings, the most realistic villains, the most realistic gadgets, and the most realistic portrayal of the Bond character by Sean Connery. It also boasts the first Bond 'Pre-credits' sequence.In many respects, the difference between Dr No and From Russia with Love is simply the budget. Dr No wasn't taken all that seriously, but following it's huge success, the producers were given more money and it does show on the screen throughout the film. SPECTRE, who are mourning the loss of their agent Dr No, come up with a plan that would enable them to lay their hands on a Russian Decoding device, the 'Lektor'. Master Planner Kronsteen (played by the creepy Vladek Shaybal), Russian defector Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and the infamous Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Anthony Dawson as the body, Eric Pohlman as the voice), want to use James Bond to steal the decoding device, before killing him and selling it back to the Russians, making money, avenging Dr No and discrediting MI6 all at the same time. . Bond is naturally sent after the Lektor by MI6, who know that he is walking into a trap set by Klebb and Bond girl Tatiana, but must know if they can get the Lektor. Along the way, as always, Bond makes a friend in ally Ali Kerim Bay, who helps him steal the lektor and remove it from Turkey. Bond is also helped by SPECTRE henchman 'Grant' (Robert Shaw) so he can get the Lektor later on. The plan is foolproof - except, and Klebb later says "they were dealing with Bond"The location of Istanbul is superb. In terms of beauty, it's a stunning location with some fabulous action pieces (the attack on Kerim's HQ, the Russian embassy scene just to name two), but is also benefits from the realism of the Cold War setting - Istanbul was a key gateway between the Capitalist west, and the communist east. The action scenes are very well filmed, and entirely believable in execution. You could genuinely believe that this could be real, unlike Dr No where the villain was more cartoonish than grounded.This also benefits from very strong casting in terms of Bond allies and villains. Pedro Armendáriz is instantly likable as Kerim Bay, who you know is loyal and brave (and has many sons!). He set another standard as a Bond ally - one who was as committed and as fearless as Bond himself, and not just a second to Bond. In the same way, Lotte Lenya as Klebb was a masterclass as a villain because you just hate her for what you know she is - a traitor. That said, the man who shines here is Robert Shaw as 'Grant', who even now is the best villain that Bond has to face. A cold, fearless psychopath, Grant stops at nothing to get what he wants, and only Shaw could have acted this role without it becoming catoonish in its way. The fight between him and Bond is the best fight in any Bond film. No, there is no cartoonish super-villain. And no, there are no amazing gadgets with the exception of the briefcase. But whatever this film lacks in now typical Bond-esque villains, Bond sets and over-reaching plots, it gains considerably with grounded realism, a very tight plot, some genuinely brilliant acting and action set pieces. It also introduces us to the idea of a realistic criminal organisation in the form of SPECTRE (more-so that Dr No, where it's not necessarily believable), and to super-villain Blofeld.The best James Bond film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb James Bond movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved From Russia With Love. If I had one minor problem with the film, it would be that I did find the film slow in places. But I cannot deny it is a tightly plotted and well acted James Bond thriller with superb action to boot. The film looks amazing, with wonderful cinematography and stunning locations, and the action is constantly fast paced and the stunts jaw dropping. The music score from John Barry is one of the more memorable scores in any Bond movie, with its brilliant main theme my favourite. We were also treated to the song From Russia With Love over the end credits, beautifully sung by the underrated Matt Munro. Sean Connery is in my eyes the definitive James Bond, handsome yet charismatic. As much as I did like Roger Moore and Daniel Craig(in general), Connery just has that extra something. Robert Shaw comes close to stealing the show, and Lotte Lenya as Rosa Klebb especially is unforgettable. All in all, superb is the only word I have to say about From Russia with Love. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Sean Connery is typically smooth and suave as James Bond--arguably the best actor to ever fill this role--here thwarting evil, powerful SPECTRE agents including striking Russian Robert Shaw, who really cuts a menacing figure. Good supporting cast includes Lotte Lenya and Pedro Armendariz, however both the cinematography and the editing are disappointing. Not much suspense, and with a blaring backing score that seems highly obtrusive. Satisfying for Bond addicts. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Straight Espionage Story, Not The Usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another example of an early James Bond film that, for many years, I thought was "super," but now it plays too slowly. In other words, if you are used to seeing today's movies, this film will drag in a lot of spots. It's hard to imagine a James Bond movie putting you to sleep but I almost guarantee you much of today's audiences would do that here. It also looks dated by now, some 45 years after being released. Some films age well; this one doesn't. Yet, for James Bond purists, this movie will always rank high and I can understand that.That's because I, too, will always consider this the best of the non-hokey Bonds, a solid Cold War action-suspense film in which Robert Shaw ("Red Grant") makes for a chilling villain. Who will ever forget Rosa Klebb as the villain, "Lotte Lenya," the woman with the lethal footwear? Daniela Bianchi is beautiful as "Tatiana." Russian women had always been portrayed a fat, ugly and manly--looking until this female character came along. Now we see tons of Russian beauties, on film and in real life.Overall, there aren't enough action scenes, which sounds strange since Bond movies often suffer from the opposite. Of the few in here, one is a ripoff from "North By Northwest," too - it's not even an original scene! Thankfully, Goldfinger, the next Bond film, turned things totally around with wonderful creativity and fun.Still, if you like a good straightforward espionage story, this will do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old school Bond was often best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was made before I was born. I grew up in the Roger Moore era when Bond was full of gadgets, stunts and corny jokes, therefore the more serious nature and technological limitations of this 1963 Bond should have made me feel bored. Not one bit, compared with some of Moore's OTT films, From Russia With Love's more basic story is vastly better as it's closer to the novel and Bond has to rely on his wits to survive.I'll give some brief details about the plot before explaining why FRWL deserves its full ten stars. SPECTRE want to kill Bond for killing Dr No and also want to steal a codebreaking machine, again a relatively simple plot compared with some megalomaniac who wants to start a nuclear war, but true to Ian Fleming's idea of a Bond story.For me one feature stands out, Robert Shaw's sinister portrayal of the psychopathic contract killer, Red Grant, a musclebound sadist who delights in killing and torture. His sinister, drawling way of talking adds to the role, particularly ending every sentence with " old man". Having tortured a Bulgarian agent to death, he then dispenses of Bond's friend Karim Bey and his contact in Zagreb, assuming the dead man's identity before joining the Orient Express. Bond becomes suspicious of Grant and the killer reveals his true identity in Bond's compartment, and states that he will kill Bond slowly and enjoy it.Bond stalls for time by asking for a cigarette, for which he will pay for with gold sovereigns in his briefcase. Grant falls for this trick and is overcome by gas when he opens the case. An extremely brutal fight breaks out, and Grant tries to strangle Bond with his garrot, before Bond manages to stab him with a concealed knife( again basic but effective) and then garrots Grant, contemptuously stating, " you won't be needing this again, old man". I'm not surprised on Youtube the fight is still rated as the best Bond fight ever.The rest of the film stands out, but without Red Grant, FRWL wouldn't be such a masterpiece. I've seen it 15 times now and never tire of this classic early Bond.</fullReview>

Isn't that what James Bond is about? Sexist movement leaders can talk all they want about how sexist Bond is, but why, oh why would anyone take it seriously? It's one of most classic sexist traditions! I'm not a sexist, and no, I don't think it's good to be thinking about women as sex objects; I'm just saying that James Bond is known for its sexist views, and it has permeated into our culture. I hate to see all these sexist revolt leaders talking about Bond, when Eminem is sitting there singing about how women are objects. Are these people blind? Bond is losing its charm after all the repression its been receiving over the years, and I think the newer Bond films may show a little bit of the wearing down...

		<fullReview>From Russia With Love is kind of boring, although has some excellent characters and some excellent action sequences. Tatiana is one of the best Bond girls, the scene (maybe spoiling) with Bond using a camera to tape record her speaking is great example of her talents as probably the funniest Bond girl ye. I can't think of any other Bond girl that made me laugh more, well except maybe Tiffani Case (Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Goodnight (Man With The Golden Gun (1974), or depending how you look at Onnatopp (GoldenEye(1995)is kinda funny too, although you do laugh at her for different reasons. Red Grant (excellent portrayed by Robert Shaw) and Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) are 2 excellent villains, I wish I could credit the voice of Blofeld in this one, because in my opinion the 2 films without a visible Blofeld, this one has to be the best. The other in Thunderball (1965) is ok in comparison. Another point for Red Grant is the excellent fight between him and Bond. Its evident that train fight have become part of the Bond legacy, in others like Live And Let Die (1973)(Bond vs. Tee-Hee), The Spy Who Loved (1977) (Bond vs. Jaws), Octopussy (1983) and GoldenEye (1995) by technically can be credited because they had excellent action sequences not exactly fights. And like a lot of Bond films its not that bad and worth rent or owning, The only ones questionable are YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967) and MOONRAKER (1979).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From America with Apologies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really gonna make this a quick review, because for the life of me, James Bond Part II, or From Russia with Love was so forgettable, so boring, that I practically cannot remember over 20% of what I just finished watching.What did men ? yeah, I'm assuming this really didn't appeal to many women ? expect out of a spy "adventure" movie in the 1960s? Leaving out today's high octane standards, it doesn't even hold up to other action-packed, character-driven or even "fun" movies I've seen prior to the year 1963.So, they were good with settling with a smirking Sean Connery who barely, and absolutely unrealistically, lifts a finger to knock over bad guys? When he finds them, that is, because the wait is on once the movie begins.And speaking of the start of the movie, it's enormously unfair of a die-hard Austin Powers fan to have seen Mike Myers's movies many times and then watch the opening to From Russia with Love. One cannot help when they see the #3 character opposite the partially seen #1 character and not laugh when envisioning Frau Farbissina and Dr. Evil.'Course, that's not the movie's fault. Hell, Mike Myers wasn't even one before From Russia with Love hit American cinemas.From what I can recall, the eeeevil SPECTRE (well, so-called, because very little evidence proves they're anything but entrepreneurs) sets up both the Russians and the English to retrieve a very special box. As seen with the first two James Bond movies, Bond stumbles into the truth ? yeah, he might as well be the pre-Austin and a few minor fights for the good guys prevail.To each 1960's guy their own, but this movie was flat, unmemorable, over killed the Bond-theme even when completely unnecessary and crawled at a snail's pace without the slightest of intrigue. Fine, I wasn't born in this era so "how would I know?" Well, I don't.And thank God for that.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the "odd one out": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Russia with Love (1963) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Second film in the series has James Bond (Sean Connery) allowing himself to get suckered into an assassination plot on himself by a beautiful blond (Daniela Bianchi) working for the Russians. Bonds allows himself into the game so that he can try and locate a Soviet encryption device. It seems opinions on the first two films and which one is better can lead to a hot debate but for my money this is the better of the two. The story is quite simple as our bad guys want Bond dead and will stop at nothing to make sure it happens. While the locations here aren't as good as the ones in DR. NO, the terrific supporting cast makes this film impossible not to fall for and the final hour makes for some great nail-biting. It goes without saying but Connery is once again at the top of his game and there's not a thing he does here that we don't believe. The role and performances have become legendary over the years and it's easy to see why as there's really not a cooler or tougher secret agent out there. Bianchi isn't quite as memorable as the previous Bond girl, which might be do the locations and lack of a bikini, but she still manages to be very entertaining. I would say that she gives the better performance of the two ladies as the screenplay allows her to be a little deeper. Robert Shaw is terrific as the robot-like assassin. The stern walk and menacing glare are perfectly done and you can't help but love this villain. Lotte Lenya turns in one of the greatest female-villain performances in the history of film. She really becomes this Russian agent and you just love to hate every single gut in her body. Pedro Armendariz, Bernard Lee and another fine turn by Lois Maxwell round out the supporting players. As with the previous film, I think this one starts off a tad bit slow but by the hour mark we're in for some great action and some wonderful suspense. The train sequence where Shaw has a gun on Bond is priceless and will certainly have all of your nails gone before it's over with. The final chase on the boats contains some great moments as well. All in all, this is a very memorable action film that shows what a good screenplay and some great actors can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectre At The Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't as a rule 'do' James Bond though I did see most of the Sean Connery titles on television where this one, the second in the franchise, surfaced again last night on the BBC. What it has going for it is a lack of OTT special effects and a reasonably credible plot. There's also a nice touch in the opening pre-credit sequence in which Bond is stalked and successfully garotted by Robert Shaw. This has to be a gag, of course, because otherwise you have a Bond film without a Bond and it turns out that Bond was in fact, a stooge wearing a Bond mask and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. were merely 'training' Shaw to kill the real thing. Shaw was, of course, a fine actor - as well as a novelist - and the film also offers 'classy' support in the shape of Lotte Lenya as Rosa Kleb sporting a nice line in orthopedic footwear. Daniela Bianchi is the girl this time around and is no better or worse than any of the others. All in all a pleasant diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Belgium with disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second installment of the James Bond-series is a weak one. It has a few interesting action scenes that still look good after almost more than 40 years, but this film makes the same mistake as "Dr. No"; the very first James Bond-movie. Both films are short of action and a good script. All of the bad characters presented in this film are very unexciting and that goes for the acting as well. The good characters on the other hand are far more interesting. Sean Connery plays James Bond for the second time and he does it with the same flawless mix of style and coolness as he did before. The same goes for Lois Maxwell who's the ultimate Miss Moneypenny of the entire James Bond-franchise. She plays it with such sweetness that it's become impossible not to love her.In this film, we get a first glimpse of Bond's archenemy Blofeld; he'll return more than once in some of the next Bond-films. This is also the first time that we get to see Bond's 'gadget-provider' Q played by the late Desmond Llewelyn. It's a nice and fresh change to have him in this and many other James Bond-films to come. Amongst the better scenes in "From Russia with love", are the ones which introduce Q's thrilling and little yet dangerous devices perfectly hidden in the most normal-looking and every-day objects such as ballpoints, spectacles, watches, suitcases and even cars.Just like in the first and practically every other Bond-movie ever made, this film also introduces the kind of indestructible baddie sent out to kill James Bond. Here, his name is Red Grant and it's Robert Shaw who gets to play this character; ten years from this film's release we will see the same Robert Shaw in Spielberg's thrilling and ground-breaking fish-film "Jaws". The fighting scene in the small train compartment between Bond and Grant is great and probably the best part of the whole film.The idea of creating a character such as James Bond may be very original, but not everything about these movies is. One of the film's last action scenes in which James Bond is chased and nearly killed by an airplane is a direct copy of Hitchcock's masterpiece "North by northwest" which was released only a few years before. Seeing it a second time in a James Bond-movie is nothing but an excessive déj?-vu. As for the other action scenes; they're nice and that's all there's to say about them. The ending is not such a big surprise as it was meant to be and therefore another disappointing scene.All in all, "From Russia with love" isn't a bad movie, but could've been a lot better if there were more and more original action scenes. It contains too many flaws and too many lengthy sequences that make you forget about the few interesting moments this film truly has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Russia with love is probably one of the only so-so Bond films in the series, besides On her Majesty's Secret Service. I say it time and again; maybe I am biased because I didn't grow up in the 60's however Goldfinger is very good and it was made a year later. This film's pacing is even worse than Dr. No however there are some fairly memorable moments in it such as the fight with Red Grant on the train, the helicopter chase, and the Gypsy camp sequence. The plot is still a little lame compared with later Bond's and the Bond Girl is not that interesting of a character. I did not hate this film, but it could have been much better because just look at Goldfinger; it's amazing. At least better Bond's are still to come after this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his second outing, Bond is off to Istanbul to retrieve some sort of decoding device from the Russians. Connery is fine, but Bianchi, although lovely, is no match for Ursula Andress from the first film. It's fun to watch Shaw, dyed blonde, as a tough SPECTRE agent while Lenya makes a pathetic-looking agent. Armendariz, who died before the film was released, is good as a Turkish spy who helps Bond. The first half is very slow moving and uninteresting. The scene with the wrestling gypsy women is rather silly (and the winner is not revealed). Things get better once the action moves to the train bound for Britain. But it's too little, too late. Overall, this is mediocre Bond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia with Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. No was a big hit and a great introduction to the world's most famous secret agent spy, and of course the actor playing him, this follow up was much anticipated, and has since been considered one of the most popular in the series as a thriller in its own right, the Ian Fleming book also got praise from President John F. Kennedy. Basically SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), headed by the mysterious and unseen Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Anthony Dawson), plot a scheme to steal the Russian's Lektor cryptographic decoder machine to create war between the Russians and the British, they also want revenge for the death of Dr. No. Ex- SMERSH operative and "Number 3" agent (and lesbian) Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) recruits Donald "Red" Grant as an assassin (Robert Shaw), and naive cipher clerk Tatiana 'Tanya' Romanova (introducing Daniela Bianchi) as an unwitting pawn. James Bond 007 (Sir Sean Connery) is assigned to find the Lektor, which MI6 and the CIA have been after for years, he travels to Instabul, Russia, to meet station head Ali Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendáriz) who has contacts and information that will help his mission. Spying on the Soviet consulate Kerim Bey recognises rival agent Krilencu (Fred Haggerty), who with his men later tries to kill him, the following night Bond and Kerim Bey kill Krilencu with a sniper rifle, and Bond returning to his hotel finally meets Tanya, both are unaware SPECTRE are filming them. The next day a plan to pass on a floor plan of the Soviet consulate, to steal the Lektor, is intercepted, Bond takes the floor plan and with Kerim Bey they plan the theft, with the device Bond, Tanya and Kerim Bey escape on the Orient Express, but Grant has followed them. On the train Kerim Bey and Soviet security officer Benz (Peter Bayliss) are killed by Grant, making it appear they killed each other, at Zagreb Grant leaves the train, kills agent Nash who was meeting Bond (William Hill), and boards again pretending to be Nash. At dinner Grant drugs Tanya, overcoming Bond he boasts about SPECTRE pitting the Soviets and the British against each other, he mentions Tanya's being unaware or the whole plot, and also about their film that he will use as evidence of a murder- suicide. Bond and Grant eventually fight, with Grant killed by Bond strangling him with his own garrote, Bond and Tanya leave the train and hijack Grant's getaway truck, and Bond escapes an attacking helicopter (in a scene inspired by Hitchcock's North by Northwest). Displeased Blofeld, aka "Number 1", kills "Number 5" agent Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal), warning Klebb she has one last chance, Bond and Tanya escape an attack from Morzeny (Walter Gotell) and his squadron of boats, and in the end Klebb is killed when they reach Venice, trying to steal the Lektor she attempts to kill Bond with her poisoned toe-spike, but is shot dead by Tanya, kissing her while riding a gondola Bond throws away the film of him and her into the water. Also starring Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, Francis De Wolff as Vavra, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, or Major Boothroyd, Lisa Guiraut aka Leila as Gypsy Belly Dancer and George Pastell as Train Conductor. Connery remains suave and cool as the super spy caught in a story of foreign intrigue, Shaw is impressive as the hit-man, I admit I have to really concentrate on the plot involving a war between countries, but the action and thriller element is constant that it doesn't matter, a worthwhile spy adventure. It won the BAFTA for Best British Cinematography. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 4 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for Matt Monro's Golden Globe nominated title song, and Sir Sean Connery was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent And Complex . Perhaps Too Much So !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an early Bond movie that is very intelligent and complex . After being defeated by Bond in DR NO , the criminal organisation SPECTRE devise a plan to bump off Bond while at the same time humiliating the British and Soviet intelligence agencies .The " problem " with this Bond film is that because it is so complex and intelligent it never really feels like a Bond film . Viewed beside DR NO and GOLDFINGER it never feels like it belongs in the same series and while it's certainly better than THUNDERBALL it's never as much fun as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE due to the sensible premise See it's the premise . Bond is never really given much to do , he's to meet a Soviet defector who has got her hands on a decipher machine and they've to meet a British agent on a train . At no point does anything ridiculously spectacular happen and you often think this is a story written by John Le Carre or a sequel to NORTH BY NORTHWEST . Oh don't get me wrong FRWL is much better than most of the Bond movies from the 1970s and 80s , it just never feels like a Bond film despite the appearance of a mad lesbian woman with strange footwear</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find this maybe the least enjoyable of all the Bond films. The script is poor and much of the acting not much better. Probably the worst thing about it is the cinematography, which simply was not good enough for a Bond film. Perhaps a product of its time, this film pales in comparison to many of the Bond films to come, lacking any real energy and focus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is movie is so bad, I'm suprised it didn't end the franchise right then.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mediocre Dr. No was a so-so opening for the Bond series. The second was just awful. Not only do we have to wait an entire half hour before Bond really shows up(no, I'm not joking, it really takes that long for him to appear), but then we have him in some boring, forgettable mission. I can't say much, as like the first Superman movie, I usually stop the film or fall asleep before it's even halfway over. Yes, it's really that bad.BOTTOM LINE: If I were Sean Connery, I'd try to disavow any indications that I was in this horrible piece of garbage. This is the worst Bond movie ever made. How they jumped to perfection in the next film(Goldfinger) is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a yawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't get all the positive comments about this film, except to say that there's a good many Bond fans out there who think that the Connery era could do no wrong. I've struggled to get through this one at least 3 times in my lifetime, and I barely make it. This filming is boring! IMO, this is the weakest Connery Bond film in the series (not counting Never Say Never Again), and it hasn't aged well with time. Obviously, the high action and campiness had yet to be injected into the series, but this one just creeps along with minimal action and suspense. All foreign accents are laughably bad and play like a parody of bad espionage films. Watch it if you're a completist, then move on to any Connery films to follow. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia with Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the great Dr No and loving it (even for a 60's film it was great.)I expected to find the same great quality in this follow up film. But alas it was not to be. This film sucked. The reasons for it lacking I feel are because the film was a rushed production with the same director of No. Terrance had no turnaround time and just kept on shooting after Dr. No was completed. That lack of time on the script and pacing of the film really hurt the project. But I feel that Goldfinger because it had a different director and the script had been worked on all through the process of this film is the stronger movie of the three. I also feel that by getting several directors for the next few films that saved them from sucking like this one. It was not until the 70's that it became common practice for this series to wait several years in between films. Coincidently that is also when the films start to get better in production.This is not to say that Sean Connery is not still at the top of his game in this film. I feel it is just a production folly that allows this film to fail than acting. Robert Shaw rules in this as he has train fight with Bond that would later be similarly repeated in Live and Let Die and The Spy Who Loved Me. This film also introduces Q Bond's lovable semi sidekick and Bond's most evil villain Ernst Bloefield (without his face being shown.) This film also is the only Bond film to completely acknowledge that another film happened being Dr No.See this if you want to complete your Bond Experience.</fullReview>
