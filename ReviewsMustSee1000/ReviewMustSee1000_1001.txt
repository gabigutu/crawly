		<shortDescription>A bit overwhelming but compelling, fair and even-handed compared to many such documentaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where once we used to shop at our local shop and have bread and milk delivered by the local milkman from the local farms, now we shop in a supermarket that is multinational, eat at fast food restaurants that are everywhere and wear clothes made in the third world by those living in sweatshops. This documentary looks at the Corporation as if it was a person (something that US law says it basically is), charting its development, its character and the effects the concept of profit driven corporations has had on the world we live in.First of all let me just say that I am fairly liberal in some regards but not to the degree as many of the audience I saw this with, many of whom could not signposted themselves anti-capitalist students if they'd actually carried signs. I should also own up and say that I currently work for an American corporation; in fact one of those who's logo flashes up in the section on the top 50 criminal companies (although I did work for an environmental charity prior to this so that gives you some idea of my muddled politics!). Having read No Logo, Fast Food Nation, seen Michael Moore films and, hey, actually used my own eyes and brain, it came as no surprise to me that the idea of a business that considers no growth to equal failing and must constantly earn more and more to be a bad thing. Nor was I surprised by the sweatshops or pollution that occurs. Neither would any of this be a surprise to the majority of the already tuned-in audience and wisely the film doesn't just rant at us about how terrible things are; instead it takes a fairly compelling look at the wider problems associated with this model. It is consistently interesting, compelling and, sadly, all a bit depressing.The film's strength is that it never gets personal or preachy. The film allows the CEOs to get a fair chance to present their opinions and it never demonises any of them, the vast majority of them actually come off as very nice guys who seem to genuinely want to be ethical, environmental etc. Not only does this give the film a balanced feel (a refreshing change from Moore's axe-grinding and sermonising) but it also makes the subject more scary ? it would be better if the system could be down to careless, evil men but it isn't; it is the system that is the problem and no one person is to blame. The structure of the film jumps around a lot and I'm not sure it entirely works because it is pretty overwhelming although I suppose it was always going to be hard to frame such a large, complex topic ? just look at the anti-capitalist protests to get an idea of the multi-issue argument.The film is not perfect of course and, looking around the audience after the film, it is evident that this film has mostly played to converted rather than winning new converts in the main. Part of this is how overwhelming it is but also the fact that it does run pretty long as well ? not a problem once you're into it but perhaps a bit of a turnoff for those not seeking it out. Secondly the lack of answers is also a bit of a problem. I guess I preferred the ending to the alternative of being told to eat mung beans and make our own clothes but it is easy to feel that we just have to accept what we are being told is bad. For me personally this wasn't a massive problem because I do hold a position where I have to work to improve the sustainability of a small part of a big corporation so I left rather hopeful and looking forward to work the next day ? but for many viewers I can understand why it feels like a dead end.Overall though, this is a very good film that allows everyone a fairly balanced crack at the whip even if its agenda and politics are obvious from the start. It avoids demonising, simplifying and making it personal and it is stronger and more engaging as a result. It provides no easy answers but it does provide challenges and plenty to think about with all the talking heads making valid points for all sides and perhaps showing that the answers do lie in the middle ? not the extremes of money chasing shareholders or the noisy and brightly dressed street protesters. Regardless of your politics it is worth seeing this film and it deserves to be seen by as wide an audience as lesser documentaries have been (and yes Michael Moore, I'm talking about you).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done But Basically Preaching to the Converted: A Lost Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good documentaries have both a viewpoint and an agenda. They reflect the vision, politics, values and angst of the director(s). "The Corporation" meets those standard criteria and in an overlong movie it's Prosecution Exhibit A for an indictment of a) modern corporations, b) consumerism, c) disdain for the Earth and its bounty, d) globalization, e)sleek marketing and f) dishonest, money-grubbing media, the current Whores of Babylon. There's probably more but I was saturated long before the film ended.In terms of style, directors Jennifer Abbott and Mark Achbar have made a visually engrossing film with excellent interweaving of archival film with sound bites by noted academics as well as business executives. We get Noam Chomsky and Milton Friedman and many lesser lights. Michael Moore appears enough to seem more a director than an interviewee but some of his remarks, particularly at the end, are more insightful than much of what he opines on in his own films.Using story boards to announce different themes, "The Corporation" tells - very quickly and, indeed superficially - the history of the legal entity, what we in the law call the "Juridical Person," the modern huge, business creature. Its early history is quickly sketched, the complexities of the Anglo-American societies that spawned this economic model barely hinted at much less explained.For better or for worse, documentaries best make their argument through striking anecdotes and this movie is no exception. We see corporations engaged in behavior that wreaks havoc on health, deprives poverty-stricken citizens of poor countries of even minimal control of their lives and, of course directs our spending and leisure habits. But some scenes show corporate strategies as just plain silly as with a couple ambulating down an urban street, one telling the other how great a CD he's listening to happens to be. The idea is that passersby will become curious enough to buy the disc. I doubt this happens much but the use of shills goes back hundreds of years (ample evidence of their employment can be gleaned from Elizabethan literature) and it pales as a menace when juxtaposed to the true evils depicted in the documentary.Some very complex issues which few viewers are likely to know anything about are presented as proof that corporations are inherently driven solely by profit motives with no regard for other values. Particularly disturbing is the incarnation of the writings of an independent scholar named Black who claims that IBM was in sympathetic and knowing collusion with Nazi Germany to sell them embryonic computers (not mentioned by name but they were the Hollerith punch card machines) which then made expediting millions to their concentration camp murder feasible. This account has been discredited by most historians but the more serious and unmentioned reality is that the U.S. government knowingly permitted some American corporations to prepare to profit from a postwar world by maintaining ties with subsidiaries in Germany (the Bank for International Settlements is never mentioned: now THAT's a subject for a film)."The Corporation" returns often to the theme that this business entity is a "person" with constitutional rights ( declared a number of times as a sad fact of American law). In fact that's true but what is never explained is that investing corporations with an identity that is juridically recognized means that the entities - AND their assets - are amenable to every form of lawsuit from civil rights violations to environmental law accountability to - you name it. And corporations can be criminally charged and convicted. Yes, obviously they can't be jailed but the entity can be sentenced to remedial action, something that would be impossible if liability was limited to individuals who lack assets sufficient to cure major violations and, in any event, who surely could do nothing from jail or forced retirement.Where could Ralph Nader's crusade for safer cars have gone if General Motors and other corporations were not amenable to suit as legal persons? How much benefit derived for anti-smoking advocates from being able to arraign Big Tobacco in court (even if losses exceeded wins)? Why are women and minorities working for Big Business (or just trying to get in the door) less likely to be targeted for discrimination these days? You'd never know from this film.So we have a very mixed bag here - a well constructed polemic that is too one-sided if educating the audience rather than satisfying the converted was the goal. It was fun to sit in a packed theater in an epicenter of affluence - New York's Pleasantville in Westchester County - and note the righteous reaction of an audience of which I'd bet 95% own stock in major corporations.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we're getting used to antibiotics because of Corporate America's dairies pumping their sick cattle full of the stuff. I knew it intellectually but never realized it so viscerally as I did while watching these cows with their udders painfully distended and the pus coming out of them. Like a little pus with your milk? You're getting it.so it's onto soy milk or organic milk for me, from now on. That is but one of the life-changing experiences I had watching this movie. Of course, I already knew what tentacles Corporate America has around every area of our government including the media, but this movie just punched it up.It should make you angry. If not, your conscience has long been stilled by your big screen TV, your gas-guzzling SUV or your stock options. Probably won't show in most of your towns....too much of a threat to the corporations that are shown up in this show. Monsanto? Won't be buying any of their products anytime soon, and I already boycott Walmark, Penney's and the ubiquitous Barbie Doll. Pretty soon, I'll be eating nothing buy my own garden's products....a good idea, no? See the movie: find out how you're being shilled. You might even decide to take back your government from the corporations writing policy for Cheney and other Congressional prostitutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time in a long time that I've seen a movie audience launch into applause at the end -- and I was as enthusiastic as everyone else.While quite long (2 hours, 45 minutes)this film piles detailed examples on top of interviews on top of documentary film clips. Liberally laced with interviews with folks like Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, it also includes insightful commentary from a (small) handful of liberated corporate executives.The sum total is a compelling story of the evil that can be and is done by and in the name of corporations. I say this as one who has worked in a corporate environment my entire career, and who for a very long time has had difficulty getting past the 'but these are almost all nice people -- I don't know any ogres out to intentionally rape &amp; pillage' perspective.What I'm gradually wakening to is the realization that yes, the corporate structure is very efficient at doing what it's designed to do -- which unfortunately does not include taking social responsibility or the greater good into account. Instead it's ruthlessly focused on the bottom line, come hell (literally) or high water -- or polluted water.I highly recommend this film. I know I'll be going back for a second viewing -- there's that much content, that I know I didn't absorb it all the first time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if there's any film that you roll out of bed to watch this year, please let this be the one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>most people who have an interest in progressive causes will be somewhat familiar with the outline of the film - corporate personhood has essentially led to corporations having an insane amount of control over what we see, eat, drink, breathe and consume in general. corporations have become part of our consciousness at an unshakable and unwashable level. they are ubiquitous, single-minded (profit), subversive parasites that erode our society from within. with this in mind you'd think the film was a marxist commercial out to bring capitalism to its knees. you'd be wrong. the film is remarkably even-handed in its approach. governmental as well as market fixes are proposed by different interviewees. i'm very much into the work of noam chomsky and michael moore (both are interviewed), i've read fast food nation, i'm a big fan of adbusters, i own naomi klein's "no logo" and korten's "when corporations rule the world" so a lot of this stuff wasn't all that new to me, but some of it was and the film is a perfect amalgamation of all this information. archive footage is used extremely well, like a hip-hop artist melding together samples in ways that create an entirely different tapestry of sound. interviews, archival footage, and good old investigative journalism are used to present a solid case about the role corporations have in our global society; as well as how we've gotten to this point and where we may be going. despite the heavy nature and brutal pacing of much of the film, there are a few moments of ironic comedy. i do think the film would have done well with a few momentary pauses early in the film to allow things to soak in. in feature films a director might cut to an exterior for a beat or two to allow a bit of a cushion from one scene to the next, something similar may have aided the pacing of this film. it's actually remarkable that i wished it had taken a little more time considering its 2 hour and 25 minute runtime. i think it's testament to the film's strength. i also want to note that the long runtime and heavy nature of the film never came off as dry or overly-academic. in other words, it's not a boring film to watch - quite the contrary, it's a rather engaging and almost fun film to watch. i say "fun" reluctantly because learning about the ways in which a corporation is bilking America and the world out of our natural resources and hard-earned money isn't fun, but if you're interested in learning then it is an exciting film. a quick side note - the narrator had a perfect voice for the material and she reminded me a lot of the narrator in the "second renaissance" portions of the animatrix. generally i don't give films i've only seen once anything better than a B+, but this film blew me away from start to finish on so many different levels...A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Madness King Corporation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our daily lives have come to be so dominated by corporations that we can easily fail to notice it. Most goods, services, information and entertainment now flow from huge multinationals. But what if this dominant player in our existence is certifiably insane?The Corporation explores this disturbing possibility with mix of wit, opinion and hard facts. It takes us through the visible "personality traits" of these business entities and shows us that, for all intents and purposes, corporations are psychopathic. The film points out that this is not an aberrant state for corporations, but rather an inherent part of their nature. It even portrays high-ranking business executives as people so caught-up in the madness of the corporate world they must act not from their own conscience, but rather from a bottom-line mentality of what is most profitable.Despite its length and the fact that it features some forty different talking heads (ranging from the former CEO of Goodyear to Noam Chomsky), The Corporation keeps you engaged both visually and intellectually. It is by turns informative, amusing and thought provoking. It does not attempt to present remedies (which would be beyond the scope of a single documentary) but rather challenges its audience to view their world from a different perspective and seek out their own solutions. In this way, it reminds me of Michael Moore's excellent documentary Bowling for Columbine.I saw this film at the True/False Film Festival and was fortunate enough to hear a Q&amp;A with co-director Mark Achbar after. Many questions seemed to be "Well, what can we do about it." The website for the film has many links available to explore further and learn about actions that individuals can take. Mr. Achbar said half-joking that he may have to bring a handout to future screenings with a list of websites.Whether you are a longtime activist, or someone who has never thought much about issues of corporate dominance, this film is definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Corporation" is a fun look at how corporations are destroying the world. I had avoiding seeing it at first, because I thought it would be kind of depressing... I was right, but it's depressing AND entertaining. Basically it shows how corporations run most of the known world. The movie starts out with the history of corporations, and how their power grows substantially after World War Two. According to the film, most of the world's governments and job markets are run or at least affected by corporate power. Corporations have the power to poison and despoil the environments and the people around them, and the larger these "corporate citizens" are, the more immune they are from prosecution. Basically, if corporate power remains unchecked, we are all screwed, except for the fat cats at the top. A fun, depressing look at our future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sat down last night to watch "The Corporation" after a long day off working for one, I was thinking I was about to see a documentary that gave me all of the answers. Why are corporations so powerful? Why do we allow them to take so much from us and return so little? Who is the face behind them? These questions were answered, but not in the way I thought they would be. The Corporation is brilliant in that way. As a documentary, the filmmakers take care to use credible information that can be checked, and an edgy style of editing that keeps the viewer enthralled. The film chronicles the history and rise to power of the modern day corporation with surprising honesty. I never felt that corporations were being represented unfairly (often, those who spoke of the most striking aspects of corporations were CEOs and other business leaders.) What moved me most about this film was actually how simple these mega corporations all seem when broken down to their essentials. Quite a feat considering how complex these entities actually are. The filmmakers often use the type of fast-paced editing that commercials use to further execute their point. I had to watch this movie again after I finished it the first time because it was so unbelievable. This is an exemplary film that challenges us to think about the kind of "people" we are allowing to run our lives, and is an example of what all great documentaries should look like. Both a thinking film and one that clearly explains things, I would highly recommend this movie to both future filmmakers/majors and business people alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The corporation as psychopath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This extraordinary documentary is based on the book The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power (2004) by law professor Joel Bakan (see my review at Amazon). Bakan's thesis is that the corporation is a psychopathic entity.In his book he notes that the modern corporation is "singularly self-interested and unable to feel genuine concern for others in any context." (p. 56) He adds that the corporation's sole reason for being is to enhance the profits and power of the corporation. He shows by citing court cases that it is the duty of management to make money and that any compromise with that duty is dereliction of duty.Directors Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott bring these points and a slew of others to cinematic life through interviews, archival footage, and a fine narrative written by Achbar and Harold Crooks. The interviews cover a wide spectrum of opinion, from Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky on the left, to Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman on the right. Friedman is heard to agree with Bakan that the corporation's duty is to its stockholders and that anything that deviates from that duty is irresponsible.What emerges is a view of the corporation as an entity working both for and against human welfare. Designed to turn labor and raw materials efficiently into goods and services and to thereby raise our standard of living, it has been a very effective tool for humans to use. On the other hand, because it is blind to anything but its own welfare, the corporation uses humans and the resources of the planet in ways that can be and often are detrimental to people and the environment. Corporations, to put it bluntly, foul the environment with their wastes and will not clean up unless forced to.An interesting technique that Achbar and Abbott use is to go down the list of behaviors cited in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that identify the psychopathic personality and show how the corporation has all of those behaviors including a criminal disregard for the welfare and feelings of others and a complete absence of guilt. Indeed corporations feel no compunction when they break the law. Their only concern is whether breaking the law is cost-effective. The result is a nearly constant bending and breaking of the law. They pay the fine and then break the law again. The corporation, after all, has no conscience and feels no remorse.Bakan notes that "corporations are designed to externalize their costs." The corporation is "deliberately programmed, indeed legally compelled, to externalize costs without regard for the harm it may cause to people, communities, and the natural environment. Every cost it can unload onto someone else is a benefit to itself, a direct route to profit." (pp. 72-73) We are shown how rivers are polluted, environments destroyed and people placed into something close to servitude by the corporation's insatiable lust to profit.The answer to this, as presented in the film, is to make corporations pay for their pollution. What many people are proposing is the creation of bills or certificates that would allow the barer "the right to pollute." The cost of these bills would reflect the societal and environmental costs of the pollution. This sounds scary, but what it would do is make those who pollute pay for their pollution instead of having the costs be externalized as they are now. Consequently, to protect their bottom line, corporations would pollute less.Another problem with the corporation as emphasized in the film is that the corporate structure is essentially despotic. It is not a democracy or anything close. The owners hire officers to exercise control over everyone who works for the corporation. This is in direct contrast to democratic governments whose officers are elected and who are subject to the checks and balances of a constitutional government with shared powers. It is true that if you are a shareholder of a corporation you may be able to indirectly vote for the CEO. However, such a "democracy" is a democracy of capital in which the electoral power is inequitably distributed. Some people have hundreds of millions of votes. How many does the average shareholder have? Bakan, Achbar and Abbott play fair, and give both sides of the case--although that is not to say that the weight of evidence or sentiment is equally distributed. After all, who's in favor of pollution or the destruction of the environment? The pathological corporation doesn't care about such things, but its officers should. Some do, but feel constrained by their fiduciary duty to their stockholders. Consequently it is our responsibility as the electorate to get our government to make the corporation socially and morally responsible. The way to do that is make the fines for breaking the law large enough to change corporate behavior. Furthermore--and this is essential--make management responsible--criminally if necessary--for the actions of the corporation.This is absolutely one of the most interesting, most compelling, and, yes, entertaining documentaries that I have ever seen. But beware of some graphic footage.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Working on the bottom line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a relatively straightforward start exploring the definition of incorporation, this documentary made some fairly meaty punches on its target material. With the exception of a few sentimental and outdated "the poor people fight back" strands, most of the attacks were well constructed. Beyond simply saying that to a corporation profit is everything, the more difficult case was made: that everything can be turned into a profit. And that includes life, death, and the truth.The depiction of the Corporation as a psychopath was used to link most of the material. The talking heads were usually on the money, including both Michael "9/11" Moore and Noam "Manafacturing Consent" Chomsky.But what the film does well was report specific cases that certainly included a few gems. An attempt to privatize water, IBM servicing Nazi accounting, an attempted coup in the US, Fox burying news and of course Monsanto being Monsanto. You couldn't make those guys up.The attempt to look at alternatives to the worst forms of Capitalism were not so successful. Right wing defenders of profit-at-all-cost use short sentences with single syllable words. The poor want to be rich. We make things you like. We don't care. Much of the left wing however, cannot counter this clarity.And the last frame had the ebullient Mr Moore telling us to get off the sofa and do something. Yeah, like vote for Bush again?</fullReview>

Even if some of the work is perceived as bias, the main message is that Corporations are legal entities that are required by law to regard profits for shareholders above all else.If nothing else, I took away the message of how important it is to consider whose products I am buying, because each time I pull out my wallet I am voting in favor of the company I am purchasing from.If you are really skeptical of the documentary, I suggest you get a hold of the book.

		<shortDescription>a harshly critical documentary not because of a bias, but because of the layers it dissects on its ultimate purpose: making money to make more money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Corporation has been called (arguably I think) a biased film, a left-wing piece that tries to rally the cause to the choir it preaches to, that corporations are simply bad and that there should be just companies run by the people and for the people without any of the restrictions (i.e. the Central American man who fought with many others to gain control of the water from a corporation that demanded that water shouldn't be free). But there's a lot of density to the Corporation- the film I mean, though obviously I mean the actual subject itself- in how it tackles as many fronts possible to engage the intellectually curious person. And, as well, how humanity becomes an issue in the whole process of a company. Noam Chomsky describes how a person who is a CEO or works at a corporation might be the nicest guy imaginable, as a personable human being. But as a worker in a system that is clogged with the most ultimate of pressures- making the most amount of profit that can be attained- it makes that person in the business sense a "monster." How could it not? Acting against better judgment will make contradictions, even if there really isn't a whole lot on certain issues that the corporate executive will not agree with protesters, like the Englishman shown who describes a group that assembled on his lawn, then got to talking.It might be almost too long a film, and yet at the same time not long enough. The number of stories that end up on the reels of film bring out some of the most exacting, precisely infuriating material in a documentary this decade. From the story about the Fox News producers (of all people) who end up being the victims of a plot by a manufacturer of a chemical injected in cows for milk who don't want a story about the dangers of the product (taken all the way to court where's it's ruled finally that the news doesn't have to be truthful), to the stock market trader who speaks frankly about the pricing of gold being more prevalent (albeit not the topic of tragedy, which has no place on Wall Street) than the 9/11 attacks, to the blatantly manipulative efforts of advertising psychologists on children, and of course the environment and the intrinsically horrific connection to natural resources of Earth, it's all a well-oiled machine built for the good of the company itself...until it falters with the shareholders.There's so much that could be analyzed with the film, and while it does towards the end lean towards the preachy (then again, what can really be done when looking at a system that holds in its grip of subsidiaries trillions of dollars), it's main purpose is achieved brilliantly, in a style that seems to skim a line of mockery and in sincerity as a video that corporate businessmen watch about something. Then again, how could it not with the access to footage; a lot of times it reaches lengths of montage that Michael Moore wouldn't try to attempt, bravely. My favorite random bit that gets tossed into the thick of it, when talking about certain rights revered, like the song Happy Birthday being owned by Warner Brothers. Though maybe more staggering is a section where patents are talked about, and how pretty soon human genes can be owned, as well as animals, and just random spaces of land (and what would a movie called the Corporation be without mentioning Disney, this time having created their own town!) It's absorbing all the way, even if you think it'll have something you already know (the collaboration of Nazi companies with American ones, which Michael Moore refers to, is not new news, if not the IBM bit that another interviewee points out). And It's also kind of daring the lengths that the filmmakers take its subject matter: the corporation becomes its own perfunctory organism, on-par if not more powerful than governments, and with so much at stake that no other kind of form of commerce can ever exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One has to be very careful in supporting this film. It will likely brand you as a socialist, or an anarchist, or, if you are a schoolteacher in Florida and support it in your classroom, a criminal. The Florida Lesgislature, in it's infinite wisdom last year mandated that teachers teach "the nature and importance of free enterprise to the United States economy." Some may balk at investing two and a half hours to a documentary, but I assure you that the information contained in this film will keep you on the edge of your seat.Discovering that smarmy corporate lawyers used "activist judges" to give corporations "personhood" out of a law that was designed to protect former slaves was an eye opener. Imagine that, judicial activism that benefits the "free enterprise" system.Discovering that US corporations built the NAZI regime and continued to support it and the Holocaust throughout the war is disgusting.Finding out that US Corporations actually creating an organization with the express purpose of overthrowing FDR and the government is amazing, but true.See world bodies and governments conspire to give rights to drinking water - even to rainwater - to corporations makes me want to puke.Seeing the US military used to support corporate raiding and injustice makes me ashamed that I wore a uniform.Yes, this film will show the exploitation of workers throughout the world by corporations; it will show the rape of the planet by these same entities; and it will show how corporations control the media to keep their dirty secrets.At the end, I was cheering those who protested at the World Trade Summits as heroes, and you will too.Now, don't get me wrong. There was one real corporate hero in the film. Just one.Finally, I wonder, if General Washington and General Eisenhower can be elected President, why can General Motors and General Electric. The Burger Court declared that they are "persons" so they must be electable.Invest you time in this film and you will have an MBA in corporate America and the real danger they pose to our future.</fullReview>

I loved the analytical comparison between corporations and the psychological traits check list of a psychopath, and the 100% overlap the two show.Anyone who has worked in a corporation can attest to the brutal truths expressed in this movie. And what was great to see was that it wasn't about targeting individuals, which would have been very simple to do. I mean news footage is plentiful on folks like Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom etc. They could have taken the sensationalistic route and paraded infamous CEO's across the screen. But they didn't. This was an amazingly thoughtful look at the corporation, and not so much the people who run them, but the institution itself (how it came to be, what its true values are, where its going, etc.).In fact, the movie takes the time to make it clear that the corporation has become a system that people must conform to, even CEOs and board members, and that even the most ethical, benevolent human beings, when placed in this system, are forced to make decisions that they may not feel are in the best interesting of anyone (except, of course, the bottom line, ie. the corporation's interest.) All of which is the direct result of historical events and actions that have culminated in the result we see today.It's a long movie (over 2 hours) but by the end I honestly felt as though I had only been watching it for 15 minutes (that's how fascinating every minute of this movie is.) If you like movies that make you think, present a thorough thesis for the viewer to contemplate and are well produced from beginning to the end, then this movie is a must see.Oh, and on a side note, the female "computer-like" narrator I thought was a great element to the film. It's like the narrator's voice reflects the cold, calculating, (psychopathic?)nature of the corporation, yet simulateously attempting to appear warm, soft and alluring to the viewer (just like corporations.) Don't rent this movie, buy it, that's how good it is! Thumbs way up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As jobs continue to be outsourced from the United States and Canada to third world countries, those doing the dirty work probably don't know or don't care that they are creating a third world for the citizens they are taking jobs away from in these two countries. 'The Corporation' shows the environmental, social and political irresponsibility of profiteering. It also shows how the world may be affected several generations from now. Using misdeeds from the past and potential misdeeds from the future, this documentary shows how government has become powerless and a tool of industry and how the shareholder is the most important thing a company can count on without any conscience whatsoever. A shattering masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was far too one sided to be called a "documentary." Really, it was more like propaganda! A little less "evil corporation" and a few more actual facts -- from BOTH sides -- would have made this a far more informational, effective film. After viewing it, I'm just insulted that the makers think I'm so lacking in intelligence that they can present this to me as a "documentary" with no questions asked. It is very obviously an opinion piece; label it as such! There are obvious appeals to emotion throughout the film; they could have been left out, and it would have raised the quality dramatically. There are several valid points made throughout the film of the problems that arise in corporations; it is disappointing that the makers felt the need to cloud those points with foggy emotional appeals. If they believe corporations to be so evil, present the whole story and I should be able to figure that out for myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The corporation as a psychopath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The corporation itself is a dichotomy, namely because despite what is wrong with these entities (the film proves that they have all of the characteristics of a psychopath), these entities are responsible for the lifestyle that we currently have. To be honest, to remove the economic institutions and return to the era of the cottage industry and the local store owner is going to end up driving up prices and undermine our current lifestyles.That does not necessarily mean that it is good for us to live luxurious lifestyles that we are living in the west, particularly since our lifestyles are supported on the backs of slaves. While they may not be slaves in the literal sense, they are slaves in the economic sense, living on less that two dollars a day and working extra-ordinary hours in horrendous conditions. Despite the fact that many of the senior executives of these corporations (as well as the shareholders, which include any of us who have a pension fund) pretend that we don't know how these goods are being made, or the conditions that the workers are working in, in reality we wish to remain wilfully blind to the reality of what is going on.Granted, I may not own a car, and resist the temptation to buy things that are not needed, I still live a life of luxury, and the fact that I can jump on a plane and fly to Europe and back, is testament to that. There are people that I work with that to them such an adventure is little more than a pipe dream, and I am not even earning big bucks, however relatively speaking, because I have no dependants and no debt, I have a much higher disposable income than many other people that I work with, even those who hold higher positions than I do.There are a few things that come out of this movie that I wish to explore, and one of them is the corporation as the externalising machine. Externalising is the art of making something somebody else's problem, despite the fact that you are the cause of that problem. For example, when a corporation dumps all of its toxic waste into the river, and lets the government and the community deal with it, then it is externalising waste management. It is too expensive to actually deal with it properly, and the laws that prevent it from doing such things are weak, or even non-existent, that the most cost effective way to deal with waste is to externalise it.Labour is another thing that is externalised, and one way to do that is to contract out certain areas so that the corporation can cut back on labour costs and not have to feel responsible for how products are used. In fact, where in the past a corporation was defined by what it made and in turn sold, this is pretty much disappearing as we speak. Nike do not make shoes, they contract that out to some sweatshop in Indonesia which is not even owned by them. Instead, they buy the shoes, and then sell the shoes, either direct to the consumer or through an intermediary. As such Nike is no longer a manufacturer of shoes, they are simply a brand that makes money by being a middle man. However, it is not even that by contracting labour to the sweatshops that the product becomes cheaper. The price of the product actually stays the same, it is just the profit that the corporation makes increases (and even then there is no guarantee that the shareholders will ever see any of that profit. Instead they will keep the profits, which no doubt will result in an increased share price, and even then the shareholder must know when to sell (which is nigh impossible) to maximise their investment.What we need is not to get rid of the corporations, because at heart we need them to be able to maintain our extravagant lifestyles. However, what we do need is a paradigm shift, within ourselves and within our society. We have to begin to learn to be content with less. The Socialists are right when they say that even if we live in a country like Australia, we must still remain vigilant less the freedoms and the laws that we have here are undermined by corporate greed. However, how many of us live in houses with electricity, and how many of us watch television. Can we go without our laptops or our mobile devices, because it is our desire for these things that keep the corporations in control. Granted they make our lives easier, but at what cost? Even if climate change is not a man made phenomena, the pollution that is spewed into the air, and the toxins that are pumped into our water supply are having a significant impact upon the world in which we live, and to be honest with you, it is unsustainable.We may wonder if there has ever been a similar period in history like our own, and my answer is that on one hand there hasn't been one, but in another there has. The period I point to is that of the mid to later Roman Empire, where people were living such luxurious lives that they blinded themselves to the ecological destruction that they were causing. It is not simply that either, because inflation was running rampant, and while the rich were getting richer, the basic necessities of life were unreachable by the masses. Rome ended up collapsing, and with it creating a dark age of epic proportions, and that is something that even now we are also looking at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often shocking and hits home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Bakan, who served as a clerk for Chief Justice Brian Dickson and advocated for human rights against governments, now takes aim at corporations in this documentary. On the way he gets a little help from friends like Naomi Klein and Michael Moore. The stuff exposed in the final product can be shocking and hits home even if the presentation is fairly one-sided. From stuff little-known like businessmen trying to overthrow Franklin Roosevelt and aiding Nazi death camps, to a reminder of Kathy Lee Gifford's sweatshops. It questions the ethics of applying patents on life and rain water. This is a story that needs to be heard, even if it needs to be balanced.I first saw most of the movie as part of a sociology course. We considered the concept of a corporation as a person, and how if it were a person it can fit the definition of a psychopath. While it may sound extreme to apply that label to men running businesses, sadly there is some truth to it. Even if this movie doesn't convince me corporations should be banned, it demonstrates why they should not have absolute power and personhood. The stuff about Bolivia having a revolt shows people being pushed can push back, and raises questions of how we may see more of that which is alarming from a security perspective. All of this is helped by use of metaphors and pop culture and the calm, female voice of the narrator. Everyone shaping a national economy should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Corporation Corporations have been around for as long as I can remember. Building up businesses and bringing in revenue. But I never personally understood the corporation. Why did they need to throw advertisements at me all the time even though I know their product is out there? Where did the product ultimately come from and why couldn't I see the jobs it was supposedly producing? These thoughts never passed through my brain I guess because I wasn't interested in knowing how it functioned as long as I could see the results and reap the benefits. The documentary The Corporation gave great insight into the questions I wanted answers to.The Corporation is a documentary by Mark Achbar, Jennifer Abbott, and Joel Bakan. It was produced in 2004 and has received many awards, one being the Sundance World Cinema-Documentary Audience Award. The makers of the documentary delve deep into the inner workings of the corporation ultimately defining it as a psychopath. It includes many acclaimed writers and corporate insiders to peel away the shiny venier of what we think the corporation is and what it stands for. Mark Achbar has also done other documentaries such as Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media and Two Brides and a Scalpel: Diary of a Lesbian Marriage. Each of his documentaries go into detail about things that are over-generalized by the media and by what people tell us and he pulls them apart to tell us the true story. Jennifer Abbot has also done a documentary called A Cow at My Table which is about western attitudes towards meat production and this goes a long with the animal health issues brought up in this film.Many themes are present throughout the film; a basic understanding of the corporation, its overwhelming flaws, its impact on society as a whole, and what has been and can be done to try and combat this monster. Throughout the film, the fact that the corporation is a liar and a deceiver is ever present.The relation to human society is clear; the corporation does not care. Various cases are brought to attention. For example, a case against the Fox Corporation. Two news reporters researched a story against Monsanto concerning bovine growth hormones and how this can impact human health. The Monsanto Corporation was very very upset about this find and this led Fox to some untimely and unprofessional decisions. Leading us again, to the fact that corporations have no interest in what happens to its consumers as long as they keep consuming. There are cases concerning animal welfare, human interest, the future we have to look forward to if we don't stand up to the big giants around us, and what we can do to prevent our inevitable brain washing.Editing throughout the film was fantastic. The cutaways used gave the viewer a visual reference to what the speaker was saying whether it be sharks, roaches, or social scenes. They also included scenes from older televised materials. The interviewee, however, was in an awkward position, literally staring at you through the screen while being interviewed. This was effective in drawing the viewer in but it was also a little strange to be staring directly at the speaker with nothing but black behind him or her. The film was divided into chapters with each one leading to the next. Human health cases lead to animal health cases lead to cases that delved into each case. The Corporation was shot in a sort of humorous manner but it also included many serious points, each broken up throughout the film with one another. A serious moment in the film was followed by a less serious, more humorous moment. It also included scenes from other documentaries such as Michael Moore's The Big One to emphasize certain stances in the documentary.The score of the documentary includes:"The Love Life of the Octopus" by Yo La Tengo"Riot" by unspoken""Frio", Late Night Lovin" by Third Eye Tribe"Page" by Transmo"The Sand, The Sea, The Stars", "Opal" by Shawn Pinchbeck"Frontline" by Sean D.

For the slower, more serious scenes, slower and more dramatic music was used while for the more up-beat scenes, faster music was used. It kept the viewer in tune with what the directors wanted him or her to feel in that certain scene and it kept the viewer generally interested.All in all, this documentary is very compelling to watch and is full of information not generally produced for the public eye. It picks apart the corporations we thought were there for us and our well being to tell us the exact opposite. It includes interviews that the viewer can depend on as good information. The Corporation is a documentary that should be seen by anyone with questions about big business and what it really means to society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Corporation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Corporation is a documentary film written by University of British Columbia law professor Joel Bakan, and directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott that examines the modern-day corporation, considering its legal status as a class of person and evaluating its behavior towards society and the world at large as a psychiatrist might evaluate an ordinary person. The filmmakers interview leftist figures like Michael Moore, Howard Zinn, Naomi Klein, and Noam Chomsky, and give representatives from companies Burson Marsteller, Disney, Pfizer, and Initiative Media a chance to relay their own points-of-view.In the mid-1800s, corporations began to be recognized as individuals by U.S. courts, granting them unprecedented rights. Applying psychiatric principles and FBI forensic techniques, and through a series of case studies, the film determines that this entity, the corporation, which has an increasing power over the day-to-day existence of nearly every living creature on earth, would be a psychopath. The case studies include a story about how two reporters were fired from Fox News for refusing to soft-pedal a story about the dangers of a Monsanto product given to dairy cows, and another about Bolivian workers who banded together to defend their rights to their own water supply. The pervasiveness of corporate influence on our lives is explored through an examination of efforts to influence behavior, including that of children.An epic in length and breadth, it aims at nothing less than a full-scale portrait of the most dominant institution on the planet Earth in our lifetime--a phenomenon all the more remarkable, if not downright frightening, when you consider that the corporation as we know it has been around for only about 150 years. It used to be that corporations were, by definition, short-lived and finite in agenda. If a town needed a bridge built, a corporation was set up to finance and complete the project; when the bridge was an accomplished fact, the corporation ceased to be. Then came the 19th-century robber barons, and the courts were prevailed upon to define corporations not as get-the-job-done mechanisms but as persons under the 14th Amendment with full civil rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.Finally,this is a satisfyingly dense, thought-provoking rebuttal to some of capitalism's central arguments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential viewing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...for anyone interested in the nature of our current planetary economic malaise, and what we might actually be able to do about it. "The Corporation," which illustrates and expands upon writer Joel Bakan's concurrently-written book, makes strong argument for the complicity of that economic entity known as the corporation and its inherent psychotic nature, and remains as trenchant now as it was nearly a decade ago when first made and exhibited/published, perhaps even more so in the light of the current swell of OWS demonstrations and other manifestations of global stress. It ought to be required viewing in high school classes across the land.Presented in a chapter format, this fascinating (often akin to the hypnotic lure of viewing the aftermath of an automobile accident) documentary details the rise of the modern corporation from its beginnings as a state-sanctified entity intended to fulfill specific public functions, which is to say serve the public good, to its current domination of the global economic engine, i.e. the oligarchical behemoth that President Eisenhower warned us about decades ago. Through the extremely well-edited use of interviews and pointed visuals, the film presents an unnerving canvas of institutionalized rapacity, fecklessness, callousness, perfidy and prevarication, all in the name of the holy grail of maximizing profits; in short, institutionalized psychopathy. It's chilling stuff, quite thought-provoking.A number of the "usual suspects" are a part of this dissection of trans-national corporatocracy: Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Naomi Klein, Michael Moore, and Vandana Shiva; still, a fair representation of corporate interests are represented as well. Beyond that, it's a cast of multitudes, befitting the subject matter, which ranges across a broad swath of corporate malfeasance: pollution, market manipulation, complicity in war crimes, exploitation of workers, sheer greed, the shrugging off of "economic externalities" on the public, and much else. Anyone who's paid even cursory attention to the politico-socio-economic scene over the past decades will be at least passingly familiar with these topics, but "The Corporation" does a nice job of bringing everything together under one roof, so to speak.The deluxe DVD edition, which I found at the library, is chock full of additional interviews, commentary, and the like. It's almost a bit of overkill, but then again, it's hard to ignore as well. Like the saying goes, "hold your friends close, but your enemies closer." Need I also say, highly recommended.</fullReview>

The more involved person will be left with more than enough to chew on in this documentary that asks just the right questions.The narrative starts, perfectly, at the beginning of corporations, and goes through their ascendancy to their place in modern society. The interviewees run the ideological spectrum, although the editing does not. The movie goes through and tries to stay as hands off as possible, and for the most part succeeds. The movie shows the evils of modern capitalism and with some efficiency dismisses any notion that modern capitalism is sustainable or good. Everyone interviewed is nothing short of spectacular, from Chomsky to Friedman, Ray Anderson to Naomi Klein, you always get the best.The Corporation will enrage you, inspire you but most of all it will show you the times in which we live. 10/10 (not for the very young, could be kinda boring for them)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: (DVD) The Corporation (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Corporations are everywhere, providing goods and services that we consume day in day out. We've heard a lot of things about corporations, about their governance, social responsibility, environmental protection or lack thereof, in the news, and it's so part of every day life, can a documentary highlight its evils and stoke the flames in a call to action to make corporations more accountable for their very existence?The Corporation is a very compelling look at corporations, about how they come about in a free market, subscribing to mantras such as "in devastation there is opportunity", the levels of protections they have managed to obtain to protect themselves against various liabilities since they are after all, legal entities with rights, and how through their doing of business, actually have plenty more opportunity costs incurred that goes against the benefit of mankind. Of course first and foremost, their objective is to maximize profits for their stockholders (Economics 101), and it becomes a tussle between stockholders, and the wider, more encompassing stakeholders, which include their workers, consumers, customers and the community.I thought it was interesting enough for the film to have profiled the corporation to be akin to that of a psychopath, and provided enough believable evidence to support their claims. It's a very slickly done documentary, with professionally designed animation, effective talking heads dishing out enough soundbites to make you go "Hmm...", and plenty of distinctly different visuals (presentation charts, cartoon clips, news reels etc) to keep you engaged throughout its 145 minutes, which you do not feel at all. It tackles a wide range of topics about the corporation, some arguing for it, most arguing against it. It doesn't set out to explain its stand through shock tactics, but do so with very well-measured delivery and logical arguments with a call to action.But while the filmmakers agree that you cannot expect change overnight, what little things you can do, such as exerting democratic authority over corporations by voting with your dollars, do ultimately go a long way. There are success stories incorporated here, mostly with the help of protests by civil rights groups (is that why they're deemed dangerous here, since they can become catalyst for radical changes?).Words don't do justice to this documentary. You just got to watch it, and let the barrage of arguments sink in. You might agree with most of the arguments, but wonder how the world would inconceivably be a better place without the corporation-created wants and perceived needs to add spice to our mundane lives. Oh, and the digital female voice narrating portions of the documentary, is oh so sexy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superb and dense examination of the rulers of today's world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on codirector Bakan's book, "The Corporation: A Pathological Pursuit of Power", this compelling documentary is a lengthy (145 minute) disquisition on the place of the corporation in the world today, a brief on its history and the disquieting notion that the profit motive of large transnationals has all but usurped the democratic voting processes of governments. Of course it is largely a left-wing work, but it is much more nuanced and wider-ranging than something like Michael Moore's works and contains long interviews with numerous luminaries from the academic, activist and corporate worlds. I wish that the filmmakers had chosen other, more eloquent and less out-of-touch intellectuals on the right than the sole example we see (Milton Friedman) but on the whole it's a stunning, depressing work with mere glimmers of hope near the end. Those that have read Kirkpatrick Sale (Rebels Against the Future) will be at home in this work.The film is structured in a multitude of chapters; at first short, terse, more humorous and wide-ranging, but gradually building to a climax of sorts as it gives more detailed views of "case studies" to support its thesis that a corporation, if it really were a person (and, in the USA, it is in many ways a legal human), would be considered pathological in its total disregard for anything other than the profit motive. One great piece involves the whistleblowers who produced a significant documentary about Monsanto's pushing rBGH into milk production and lying about its harmful effects, only to see the powerful corporation for which they worked (FoxNews) rework the film to placate Monsanto, then fire them....an even more awful example of the negative motives of these transnationals is the story of how California-based Bechtel at one point owned the rights to all water in on of the largest cities in Bolivia -- including rainwater -- and forced people to pay up to a quarter of their pay to have the right to drink (and live).Interviewees, besides Friedman and Moore (much more restrained and thoughtful here than usual) include Chomsky, Zinn, Janet Akre (former FoxNews correspondent), Naomi Klein and several current and ex-CEOs, most notably Ray Anderson the CEO of Interface, the largest commercial carpet manufacturer in the world and one of the few execs who seems to really be looking at the larger, environmental and holistic picture. Other CEOs come off as completely unaware, or uninterested in, anything besides their stockholders, and Friedman makes the cogent (if coldblooded and amoral) statement that corporations only know how to make profit, so why be involved in something they don't understand (like a healthy environmental outlook).Best new documentary I've seen in years, an absolute stunner. The film's website (www.thecorporation.com) is excellent and a great resource.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent documentary about the influence, development and the demise of planet earth under the corporate structure. The film exposes the excesses of corporation and how capitalism has turned into savage capitalism. Lots of business luminaries contribute to the debate on the good and bad of corporations. Although watching this film is a bit depressing, as it exposes how the planet is being plundered and destroyed by a corporate world that is only interested in the bottom line, there is some hope in the fact that most of the people talking in this documentary are business men themselves who like sky divers who have floated for too long thinking themselves as fliers, now realize that they are falling, and although the ground is far away, they see how it is coming faster than previously thought. One thing lacking I believe is a larger expose on how to make the corporate world better as a whole. In the end we are left with the feeling that the corporation rides the turtle (earth) across the river like a scorpion, the very nature of the scorpion will destroy them both. Unless things change very soon we are a doomed planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A balanced look at what is a corporation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since "The Corporation" is out now on DVD, we decided to watch it last night. I thought that the 2.5 hours would be a drag, but the time went very quickly. About halfway through, I regretted that I was not taking notes. It is a bit like a college lecture, but better because they interviewed so many different people from so many walks of life, and used archival footage and old news reports to support the points they were making. It made us think again about the broader picture of society and the corporate influence on politics in a new light. (I read "The Military-Industrial complex" when I was in college in the 60's) I also was reminded of another book I read by the author Scott Peck called "The People of the Lie" in which he points out that the lack of accountability results in the lack of responsibility and the loss of compassion. The facts in the documentary (and there are facts, not just opinions) support that idea. Some reviewers seem to think that the writer of the documentary was calling corporations evil. We were able to watch the extras included on the DVD which included interviews and questions and answers. In one interview the author of the book says specifically that he does not believe they are evil, but "they are amoral and dangerous" in their current structure and purpose as defined by legislation, rules and charters in each state. It is important that government, whose mandate is to oversee the public good, provide protections to the public from entities whose purpose is their own good. If this is not clear the way I am saying it, please check out the DVD.This is an excellent conversation starter- lots of material for thoughtful people to discuss. The extras are as good or better than the documentary so take the time to look at some of those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As if bias is a bad thing??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amusing how a few of the responders mention the word 'bias' and bandy it around as if it should merit application in all cases of review. I would argue that there is a good reason that this film may have 'suffered' from a good deal of bias. "We hold these truths to be self-evident." Yes, I'm certain I've read that somewhere...The logical conclusion to the bias argument is thus, should a documentary about the Holocaust also show no bias against the Nazi's? Should such a production also weigh the 'legitimate' concerns the Nazi's may have faced when dreaming up the Final Solution? "How was the German government to deal with the perceived internal problems posed by their Jewish community? In order to avoid the appearance of bias let's ask the question. Did the Jews really deserve to be gassed? Let's discuss that?" Patent nonsense.While I'm loathe to play the Nazi card, in this case it does merit fair comparison. In news articles and editorials from the 1920's and 1930's it's not hard to find a multitude of business and political leaders trumpeting the virtues of fascism and it's ability to keep labor in check. While most of what I have read had cited Mussolini and his good work in Italy, the point should not be lost.As a final point, the documentary does NOT hold accountable the corporate institution, and any viewer who walked away with that message was simply asleep at the wheel. It most certainly holds the human beings who hide behind the shield of the corporate institution and the 'law' very accountable. In reality, if on an abstract level, there is no such thing for example as IBM. The thing that we refer to as 'IBM' is simply a collective delusion and place holder. This is much in the same way that there is really no 'United States'. Again, this is a mental construct to better deal with our world. Don't believe me? Where was this 'United States' 1000 years ago? Can anyone definitively point out or define its existence? Much in the same way the corporate institution is a construct dreamed up by businessmen and lawyers to avoid responsibility. I'm willing to trade a ton of profitability and innovation for an ounce of accountability.Call it what you will, fascism, Americanism, conservativism, neo-liberalism, corporatism, a rose by any other name...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important, but Long-Winded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going through a time where I was watching only independent films and documentaries when I saw The Corporation. Similar to when I see many documentaries, I went in realizing that this was a group of film makers' opinions and should be treated as such. The biggest reason why people have problems with films like The Corporation or Michael Moore projects is that people treat them as facts that must be believed with unquestionable faith. I watch these films because I'm interested in the film making aspect, as well as being witness to another person's opinion on a subject and then having discussions with other viewers about that film maker's opinion and what our opinions are in return. Films like this encourage open discussion of issues and that is a good thing. There is nothing more fun then having a debate between someone who believes in the opinions of people like Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky and someone who does not.The Corporation provides many different opinions about all aspects of the modern day corporation. It focuses on all aspects of consumer America, from advertising and sponsoring to corporate crimes and their effects on society. The three sections that I feel had the most impact were the sections that compared the corporation formula and compared that to the mental state of a clinical psychopath, the section on Fox News and the decision on how to carry a particular story (was able to make the same point in twenty minutes that Outfoxed made in a full length feature), and the part where you see the different undercover advertising messages. You'd be very hard pressed to find a more complete film about corporate America, but that also causes a major problem with the film.Some people will say that the biggest problem with The Corporation is that it only presents one side of the story. Let's face it though, how many documentaries can you name that show all sides of any subject? The problem The Corporation faces is its length. While for many of us, a near two and a half hour film is no big deal and seems almost common place with today's films, it's hard to sell a two and a half hour documentary about corporate America. The Corporation is extremely interesting and entertaining throughout most of the film, but the flow is not smooth and it can become a bit tedious at times. Not that much could have been done about the length. In shortening the film, you sacrifice some of the impact.Overall, The Corporation brings to light an overall fact that most of us already knew (corporate America is out to make profits at any cost), it does so by showing many smaller, supporting facts that many of us probably did not know. Whether you agree with the overall message (or opinion) is key to creating discussions amongst viewers and get them talking about a subject that people may not have normally discussed. Any film that can generate such discussion is good thing and should be seen by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the true story of the world's most ubiquitous type of psychopath: the corporation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing The Corporation is as edifying as attending a course or lecture on economics and culture, but not only is it cheaper, it's more entertaining.Clocking in at just under 2? hours, the Corporation is a jaw-dropping examination of what corporations are, their history and what drives them ? basically the pursuit of profit above all other considerations. This film demonstrates precisely why that's a problem ? their protected legal status which limits personal liability of those involved in corporations, and the definition of a corporation as a "person". Because of this, a US corporation is protected by the 14th Amendment, which states that "no person can be deprived of life, liberty or property". This Amendment was introduced after the US Civil War to protect freed slaves, but when corporate lawyers exploited a loophole in it to protect their interests, corporations stopped being accountable to the democratic process.The Corporation demonstrates that if a corporation is a person, then its actions are that of a psychopath ? verified by one of the interviewees, the FBI's top consultant on psychopaths. What does it mean for humanity when the dominant organisational structure of our time is like this? I think that it means we have to be suspicious. Trust no-one, check for hidden motives and hidden advertising. Unfortunately I'm backed up by the revelations this film delivers ? about the dangers of bovine growth hormone, the patenting of human genes, the ownership of rainwater and more.The narration by Mikela J. Mikael is deliberately close to that of two films in the Animatrix series of short films set in the Matrix universe. These films tell of the rise of the machines and their eventual overthrow of humanity. This reinforces one of the points made early on in The Corporation ? that corporations have grown beyond the control of any individuals, including those who created them.Kudos to directors Jennifer Abbott and Mark Achbar and writers Joel Bakan and Harold Crooks for this well-made, insightful film that delivers a variety of perspectives. Subjects include Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Michael Moore, Milton Friedman, as well as a "hidden marketer", a commodities trader and a corporate spy. I was impressed by the CEO with a conscience, Ray Anderson.My advice? Grab pen and paper in case you want to take notes. The Corporation is a must-see. ****/***** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this one will wear you out while it wakes you up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the recent hot-button documentaries Fahrenheit 9/11 and the video/DVD-released Outfoxed, this searing recap of national and global corporate conduct is far less partisan, less humorous and farther-reaching in its scope. The Canadian group who wrote and directed this start rather drily with the history of privatization, the early conceptual basis for corporations, and how that artifice evolved into the structure for the multinational behemoths that dwarf governments in their powers and immunities. What began as a tool to encourage investment and exploration a couple of centuries ago, has become a shield for reprehensible conduct in many forms, worldwide. The film mixes newsreel and TV footage with still photos and interview snippets (including Noam Chomsky, Milton Friedman and many figures from business, government and the media), covering a semester's worth of history, economics, sociology and science. Even psychology. In a pithy, if heavy-handed, stretch of explication, they make a case for Corporate Psychopathy by juxtaposing words and deeds of major companies and their execs with the matching clinical criteria from the DSM IV - the handbook for psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. That device likely seems too coy and contrived - but only until you've seen it play out. By definition, a corporation is an amoral entity that exists solely to maximize financial benefit for its owners. Ethical, humanitarian and ecological considerations only count as they support the Prime Objective. Isaac Asimov's famous Laws of Robotics take better care of our species than this.This 2? - hour parade of excesses and abuses in pursuit of profit and power, variably explained and defended by a variety of insiders, will leave you numb, if not furious. Not all offending deeds come from malice. Much has been the result of ignorance - particularly environmental or social damage that wasn't understood or predictable at the time. Prevention of newer problems and correction of older ones (food production and distribution, sweatshops, pollution, etc.) are hampered by lack of accountability, or the overwhelming burden for any person, public-interest group or small governmental entity to oppose the vastly superior resources of the multinationals. Even our own regulatory agencies base their decisions largely on the reported research from the companies they're supposedly monitoring. Corporations grew out of control along with the Industrial Revolution. The film included some shocking revelations about US companies covertly continuing to do business with the Nazis before and during WW II. Monsanto and Fox News take some hard, well-documented hits, along with Bechtel (a particularly appalling transaction in Bolivia), oil companies, advertisers (especially those who scientifically refine the art of manipulating children as consumers) and others. This film is neither a call for revolution nor a sky-is-falling panic. Its goal is to inspire long-term thinking, rather than short-term profit. Ray Anderson, CEO of a major carpet manufacturer, is the closest we get to a 'hero'. When he learned about the environmental damage resulting from their processes, he redirected his company towards a goal of self-sustaining production - 'leave no footprints'. They aren't there yet, but they're moving in the direction that future generations will appreciate, while still faring quite well in all the usual present-day business interests. Others are trying, and should be encouraged by consumers and citizens to spread that type of consciousness. This sobering documentary deserves to be widely seen...and heeded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film goes way beyond the polarized finger pointing of Farenheit 9/11, and delves into the complexity of a entity that we've created but are almost powerless to control. Understanding the history and the characteristics of corporations is necessary to get some control over these runaway trains. The enemy is not the politicians, but the puppet-masters. Even CEOs with good intentions are often powerless at stopping their corporations from doing what they do, make money at any cost. If ever there was a more clear cut example of why we need more government regulation, not less, I've yet to see it. Consider it your civic duty to see this film and ponder the issues that are explored by leading economists, CEOs, activists, journalists and others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Corporation: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an onslaught of movies touting liberal standpoints now. Of course, there's Fahrenheit 9/11, but there's also the upcoming The Hunting of the President, defending Bill Clinton's presidency. And there's a lesser known movie that's out that also has Michael Moore as a talking head called The Corporation, which I saw previously at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It's a smaller topic than others, yet what it says is infinitely more important than what the other films say. It's basically preaching to the converted (much like the others I mentioned did/will do-and what Michael Moore Hates America will do to the other end of the spectrum), but if you're one of the converted, you're in for an emotional two and a half hours.Jennifer Abbott, Mark Achbar and Joel Bakan, based on the latter's book, make a fascinating documentary about the evils of corporations. The beauty of this doc is that although they demonize and ridicule corporations, they never say that they need to be destroyed, because they're necessary. With talking heads like Moore, Noam Chomsky, and others, you can expect the film to be biased, but there are some people for the other side, also. Of course, one finishes up by saying "Okay, enough bulls**t," when speaking his mind. In this movie, the dangers that corporations put upon life of humans, animals, and the environment are shown. And unlike Fahrenheit 9/11, for instance, all of the conclusions and connections are not far-fetched. It does more than persuade you for an argument-it puts you there with a lot of archive footage and makes you feel personally affected by the corporation (which you probably have been).When I saw The Corporation for the first time about three months ago, I was impressed on how well done the documentary was made. There's a voice over that seems to be straight out of Logan's Run, animation, and a lot of harrowing archival footage. It goes off on a few small tangents (such as advertising), but they're all related to the film's general topic of the evils of corporations. It exposes them in a way Moore would like to do to the Bush administration. When you're done with this movie, you'll feel awful walking out, and, like Moore says at the end, you'll want to go out and do something. I will do something. What, I don't know. It may be drinking crappy store brand soda or something, or something more, but this movie makes you want to take a stand against the corporate world. Now if only Moore's "Corporate Cops" idea from Bowling for Columbine was actually created....My rating: 10/10Not Rated (images of violence)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>enjoyable work on the subject. What I found missing was probably what's been investigated in BBC doc "the century of the self". Or should it be the century of the corporation. After all no critical view of the consumerism itself was addressed in the film. It is focused mainly on the origins and some undiniable faults and practices of corporations. The problem is also the successes of the corporation, i.e. how they managed to appeal to our bodies minds and wallets. The century of the self (particularly the 3rd episode if I remember correctly, no info on IMDB I'm affraid!, check BBC site) investigates a bit deeper, without loss of interest. Society is as evil as is the corporation.I saw it in the International Documantery Festival of Thessaloniki in Greece, and I must say the projection size was tiny, nevertheless the films' (or is it video?) pace is gripping in its 145 min splendor.Mr Mark Achbar was quite interesting to talk too, and eager to get word of mouth out.vive le canada:) libre!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Context?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I did not begin at the same starting position as the makers of this film, I had no chance to go along with what they're trying to say.Cricisms of wealthy people are as old as people themselves. Saying that the wealth was obtained dishonestly or that the wealthy person is hurting people makes it easier to justify taking the wealth away.The movie attempts to demonstrate how these companies are hurting people. Its first example is how Nike pays 'slave wages' to those who makes its shoes and clothes. That these wages are far lower than wages in America is inarguable. However, by way of context, I would've liked to have seen what the wages in that country were before Nike arrived. What was the standard of living? I saw no evidence that Nike created the poverty and that people were worse off because of Nike's presence. Is it possible that things have improved since Nike arrived? It would be possible to criticize Nike for its lack of charity, but that burden of charity is not on Nike alone. It is the burden of anyone who believes in the concept of giving to help the people where Nike is. Singling Nike out as harmful because of poor living conditions which they did not create nor have made worse is not fair.I found this method to be consistent throughout the documentary. Milk manufacturers are criticized for using antibiotics and producing milk when more milk was not needed. What is the standard for too much milk? Perhaps charities could be organized to send the excess milk to the places where the Nike plants were located. Also, no context was given which showed how a consistent supply of milk and other foodstuffs affect the population of the United States. Are people in the U.S. living longer? Are they having a higher quality of life? I believe they are.This section on milk showed sick cows. Are all cows in commercial dairies sick? Are cows, in general, sicker in a commercial dairy than they might be on a family farm? Then, assuming that the cows are treated poorly and that the cow's life makes it immoral to support a corporate dairy farm, how many people's lives should be damaged for the sake of those cows? Again, I didn't come in with a preconceived idea that profit-seeking organizations are malicious. So, I found myself playing catch-up throughout the film since the filmmakers appear to assume the viewer started from that position.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part 1 of The Corporation is the build-up. You listen to them talk about the origin of corporations, and notions like sense of community. You're sympathetic, but at times it seems a tad too idealistic, and moralistic, and vague.Then Part 2 starts, and all the threads regarding corporate greed and destructive nature come together, and it's like someone front-kicks you in the solar plexus full-force, because the sudden and total horror of it all makes it hard to breathe. You realize where Part 1 was going with all of its sentiments, and it's a shock. There are a couple of moments when it seems like you can see all of social reality as the true Hell.What really got to me was the patenting of human and other genes by corporations. Did you know about this? In a nutshell, in 1980 an industrial chemist went to patent a microbe he cooked up in a lab, and after a brief fight, the judges, - obviously ignorant of stuff like biology, but authorized and ready to make rulings on biological issues nonetheless, - ultimately allowed this. After that, for more than 3 decades, companies in USA have been busy cutting out bits of the human genome, and getting patents on individual genes. Yup, it's insane, I know. The most they do is cut out the introns (extra bits interspersed with the gene) - and then say: "We own this". Well, imagine that companies would have patented organelles in human body cells when scientists first gained the capability to go that small? Patenting of genes is the same thing! (I'll do a small October 2014 update for you: The only small consolation is that The Corporation was made in 2003, and a decade later, - in 2013, - the US Supreme Court finally ruled that individual genes cannot be patented. The reason: the company Myriad owned patents on certain cancer-related genes, and was therefore the only entity legally allowed to work with those genes in ways like running prophylactic tests. Neat, right?However, the Supreme Court judges still showed considerable ignorance of the issues, - souring the potential victory of common sense in the ruling, - because they added: "cDNA can be patented...cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments." Just so you know: cDNA is simply a type of copy of genetic material. So essentially there is a door-sized loophole in the ruling that potentially renders it pointless. The Myriad stockholders, for example, celebrated upon hearing the verdict.Be informed. This theme might affect you and your family members and friends, should the horror of cancer suddenly become relevant for you... and thanks to our world being poisoned with chemicals, the chances of that are rising fast.) This is just one of the absolutely infuriating examples examined in The Corporation. They also talk about corporate whistle-blowers, Nazi-business collaboration, child labor, and so on. Trust me - you need to know this stuff, because the prevalence of narrow-minded, short-sighted behavioral patterns among mankind's leaders concerns every being on the planet in a profound manner. 100/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shaken and stirred by this amazing film. It goes deep into the problem of 'the corporation'. It is thorough and dispassionate, has interviews from both sides of the debate - philosophers, activists, protesters on one hand with CEO's and Government people on the other and the best of the lot - the devious middlemen i.e industry insiders, whistle-blowers, corporate investigators etc.Corporate evil is here to stay and is destined to suck the world dry. In my personal view there is no two ways about it, though the film ends with a touch of hope (well just because it has to I guess, because no matter how cruel the narrative is, what do we have except hope?), that is not the kind of hope I see sense/meaning in. Well what to seek meaning in then? I frankly do not know and I need time to ponder upon this maybe but perhaps the least we can do is to be aware at least, to be dangerously aware of the world around us, of the Moloch that we are up against and somehow in our own ways try to battle it through the way we live our lives and pass on those values to future generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different view of Corporations worldwide.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Corporation' Documentary looks at the Corporation as if it was a person and looks at its character and the effects that corporations, that have the main aim of earning profit, have had on this world. The corporation is a system, often with a single main objective, to make profits. This documentary first shows how corporations are created, a group of rugby players were shown working together to win the match, they were all focused towards a common goal. We were shown a eagle which can sight it targets from a great distance in the sky, even being able to spot the creatures underwater while it's in the sky, highlighting that corporations have a clear idea of the world around them and have their targets in their minds. These parts were shown in more of a positive light. However soon after the movie starts focusing on the overwhelming negative effects that corporations can have. It is shown that businesses are obsessed with making profit and growing larger and they will do whatever they can to achieve it, non profitability and lack of growth would be seen as failures by Corporations.The problems that are shown in the movie are creation of the products that harm the environment of the country and spread illnesses and pollution, harmful chemicals are also dumped in the river, which harms the fishes, and those fishes are eaten by the human population, spreading many dangerous illnesses among the people. The corporations completely disregard the damage to the environment mainly because they are not many properly established laws to stop them from harming the environment. The movie also highlights the mistreatment of the employees forcing them to work nonstop for many many hours as if they were a machine, refusing them to let them have a word with their superiors, also not paying them properly to reduce costs.Furthermore in this movie, the owners of the Corporation are depicted as Godfathers as they not only monitor their company but also heavily influences the society the around them by controlling their purchasing behaviors. Despite what is wrong with these entities, these entities are responsible for the lifestyle that we currently have. To be honest, removing the economic institutions and returning to the era of the the local store owner is not the solution as it may end up increasing prices even more and clearly undermine our current lifestyles. That does not necessarily mean that it is good for us to live luxurious lifestyles because we are being controlled like slaves, not in a literal sense but in an economic sense as these corporations influence our minds into buying their products, the fact that we buy more and more is the reason they even exist. Many of the senior executives of these corporations and the investors are shown oblivious to the effects of their corporations, in reality they wish to remain blind to reality. What we need is not to get rid of the corporations, because at heart we need them to be able to maintain our lifestyles. However, what we do need is a change, within our society and within ourselves. We have to start learning to be content with less. Many themes are present throughout this documentary, a basic understanding of the term 'corporation', its overwhelming flaws, its affects on society, and what has been done and what can be done to try and combat this. The film however allows the CEOs to get a fair chance to present their opinions and it never makes all of them come off as evil people, as a matter of fact many of them actually come off as very nice guys who actually want to be ethical when it comes to running businesses. However I am of the opinion that this film is not perfect and one of the main reason is that it focuses too much on the negative aspects at times and it does not focus much on the positive aspects of the corporations like how it advanced our lifestyles and increased technology and even world relations have improved because of this globalization with imports and exports. The film also mostly keeps on sending the same message throughout and kind of overstays its welcome by going on for too long. The film also doesn't provide us with very clear answers about what can actually be done to avoid this destruction. Additionally these problems mainly lie with private corporations &amp; even, all of them do not cause an equal amount of harm, and this film characterizes all corporations around the world in the same way. Overall, this is still an excellent documentary which tell us about the corporations and its affects as it avoids preaching, simplifying and making it personal and as a result it more stronger and engaging. It makes us open our eyes to what is going on around us. It provides no easy answers but it does provide challenges and many things to think about with all the people in the documentary making valid points for all sides and perhaps showing that the answers do lie in them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I base this review on the shareware version, currently available for free on YouTube, under the user machbar. It is between 2 and two and a half hours long. This goes into all the damage corporations do, the fact that they are granted rights as if they were individuals(!) and the general callous nature of them. Sounds one-sided? Well, Michael Moore isn't in this for nothing. It is somewhat like propaganda, but at the same time, I can't come up with any real arguments for the other side. I will say that it would be good to have someone from there come in so we could see just how weak their position is, and how based on personal greed it is. It's not difficult to shred their claims with actual facts, and I suppose the choice to not do so was a fear that there might be people who weren't compelled into action by this. With that said, this is a well-done documentary. It is interesting throughout in spite of the running time, and the personal anecdotes, investigative journalism and editing(if it is a tad manipulative at times) all make a convincing case. There is quite a bit of disturbing content in this, and it is effective not only on account of it being real. I recommend this to everyone, though I fear that it is preaching to the converted more than changing any minds. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spirit Of The 14th Amendment Is Forever Tainted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doctors have the Hippocratic Oath to guide them in their conscientious care of patients ("Thou shall do no harm..."). Soldiers pledge to support their country with their very lives. But what of corporations? Some might say that they have no moral reason to aid humanity. But when the fabric of what a corporation does effects the lives of nearly everyone on the planet, one must step back and look at the larger picture; a picture beyond the boardroom and dollar signs.The 14th Amendment was set up to aid slaves in the post-Civil War era, to ensure that their rights equaled those of the white population. In typical slime-bag fashion, attorneys turned their microscopes onto this legal precedent in order to gain a stronger foothold for corporations. What they did was give individual human rights to corporations, thus allowing them equal protection as people. Now corporations can patent living things (viruses, mice, seeds, etc.) giving them the ability to dictate when, where and how life might evolve on our planet. Scary to think about, but very true.I normally complain about the one-sided nature of documentaries but I have no such complaint against THE CORPORATION. It interviewed almost everyone on both sides of this important issue: How far will we allow corporations to go? It is a chilling insight into the mindset of the corporate world. When money overrides everything (including common sense) the planet, people, plants, animals, are all swept aside in favor of retirement dollars (take a look at your own 401k or 403b contributions and see where that money flows). The only omission I found was a representative from Monsanto, the corporation who's patented seeds have caused severe consternation across U.S. farms. It would've been nice to see their take on the subject. Perhaps the directors of this documentary tried but were denied access to them.The fact that this documentary has achieved an almost cult-like following is apropos An environmental nerve has been struck as of late, not surprising considering global warming statistics, smog control problems, drinking water treatments, and the privatization of nearly everything we hold dear (from the air we breath to the water falling from the sky). On its website, thecorporation.com, there is information for teachers in the form of lesson plans, discussions by the general population, and links to important sites that help people act with a more worldly conscience.The only downside to The Corporation is that it is nearly two-and-a-half hours long, making it a bit of a snoozer in portions. But considering the original filming consisted of over 300 hours, I guess the production team did okay.</fullReview>

The Corporation is a documentary that's firmly rooted in a specific point of view.I don't think the film tries to hide its agenda against corporations. And it gives plenty of voice time to both Noam Chomsky and Michael Moore, so it's not hiding its filmmaker's allegiances. I think that the film also does a little bit of hand waving in order to present a more seemingly compelling argument, such as just noting Noam as an MIT professor, without noting that he's a professor of linguistics.On the other hand, the film is full of information that is compelling and interesting. It cuts together a well edited series of images to illustrate and further develop its argument. I really do appreciate its sleek presentation and even voice0overs and that it allows the people that are involved in the corporation to say their own peace. I also like that it doesn't damn the people (except for a few bad apples), but rather looks at the entity of the corporation, as it is today, in a negative light.And it's not all doom and gloom, although it does portray hope as a faint little glint of light. It brings in examples of companies going right and tries to show solutions that we, as people, have been trying in order to combat the damage that our corporations are doing to us and to our world. All the same, the film's primary goal is to act as a polemic against the idea that corporations are necessarily harmless and good and I think it does an adequate job of showing the potential hazards of those entities.I think my problem with the film, in the end, is just a little one. If the film didn't play the hand-waving tricks and the little bits where it also chooses only to present the information it wants, then I'd probably buy the whole thing more. But because I can see the documentary's manipulation, I find myself more guarded against it and less open to the underlying argument, which I still bought in the end, but with reservation.It's an interesting film and one that I would recommend that others watch, simply for the amount of information packed into it. But watch it with eyes open and aware of its tricks too. Having made documentary films, I'm a little disappointed that The Corporation wasn't more transparent. Still, I like the style, the presentation, and that, despite it's clearly one-sided view, it still allows a little bit of hope to exist for the corporation's redemption. Good. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a grade 9 student and our business class had to watch this movie for our ethics unit. I have to admit, it's an eye opener to the world of corporations. It took us longer to watch than we thought, and this movie was jam-packed with issues that not many of us, especially not students, take the trouble in discussing. Exploiting child labor was a touchy topic , and in our case, extremely disturbing because many of us are of the same age as these workers. This movie was very original, as it compared the characteristics of a corporation to that of a psychopath.I feel this movie has affected my way of thinking, in terms of large corporations. I'll always think twice about trusting in ads and those catchy commercials on television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent documentary accurately depicts, through factual reportage, the nature of a corporation, often a destructive force when it comes to the human consciousness, that is, when in contact with human consciousness, often toxic, when placed under considered scrutiny and in historical perspective.In my view, a corporation is not an "entity," nor a "person," despite judges in courts who have ruled it that, judges, perhaps bought and paid for by corporations reaching for control of and over civilization in the United States. A person has consciousness, compassion, and morality. A corporation does not. What it does have: "strategy." What the corporation is: a system, often with a singular objective, to make profits. It is the embodiment of greed.It is a strange phenomenon projected by human behavior. It was isolated, analyzed and described in Truman Capote's 1966 seminal work, In Cold Blood, a "non-fiction novel" first serialized in The New Yorker in 1965. This behavioral revelation is about the formation of an overriding singular force that is either tyrannically destructive or in a few cases, constructive, when two or more humans are present in a scenario. In Capote's book, two petty thieves create a singular, malevolent force that destroys an innocent family. By themselves, neither of the two thieves could or would have been capable of the murder.The positive or negative nature of the corporate force is created from the combination of top management, sometimes boards, if the board is in close control of the corporation. In most cases, since the objective of most corporations is profitability, the bottom line becomes the most powerful arbiter of the corporate behavioral history. In too many cases, the results are destructive to human health and welfare.Top management typically walks in a chain-lock-step, especially when members receive the obscene amount of compensation published in today's business journals. As a result, whistle blowers who report malfeasance, crime or destructively bad management are disposed of, and in the case of existing within a modest municipality controlled by the corporation, also black-listed.Malefactors are usually promoted and rewarded, often in spite of the corporation itself, as it begins to decline and eventually go out of business and close its doors, moving hundreds or thousands of employees and subcontractors who had grown dependent, out into the street to search of new employment.The greatest danger today (at this writing) is the takeover of governments by corporations who buy entire political parties, government institutions and more or less cause great human suffering and destruction of human well being and in too many cases, life itself. Untrammeled, the corporate system or force, has the potential to destroy all human life on Earth. This documentary clearly shows this possibility. It is the most insidious specter today, soon to come out of China in vast dimensions, presently inconceivable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic look at horrific realities of corporatism... my only fear is that it will not find an audience outside of those already to the left.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Corporation tries to explain to a mainstream audience what left-wing sociologists and philosophers and anti-consumerist publications have been saying to those already politically inclined - why are corporations so powerful, and why are they so dangerous? This long documentary generally cuts out the jargon and vocabulary that makes political media sometimes so difficult for an apathetic perspective, but at the same time isn't patronising or overly preachy. Instead of having the moral depth of an afterschool special, it presents a number of anti-corporatist figures (Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Naomi Klein are among the most notable) who try and explain the destructive and cruel nature of corporations.The most clever idea of the film is to compare corporations and their anti-human actions to a human being, to develop on the notion of Corporate Personhood - the fact that a corporation is legally recognised as a person. With this in mind, businesses are analysed like a human being would be, and here we come to a disturbing conclusion - corporations, with their disregard for other human beings, have similar patterns of functioning to that of a psychopath.As excellent as this documentary is, however, my concern is that those who will watch it and enjoy it and talk about it will be those who already are to the left and are interested in politics. This is true with me - I'm an anarchist, and if I wasn't into activism I wouldn't have heard of it. So here's to hoping the power of word can give this film the breakthrough it deserves, because it's a much better alternative perspective than the sort of half-baked, wishy-washy sentiments expressed by Michael Moore in 'Capitalism: A Love Story'.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hard-Hitting Look at the Modern Corporation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What this film is, in a nutshell, is a look at corporations from the most critical standpoint: how do corporations hurt people and the environment? A large section of the film actually compares corporations (which are legal persons) to sociopaths (such as serial killers).Now, I'm a progressive liberal... a socialist, if you will. So, believe me, I sympathize with the idea that corporations cause a lot of harm. Pretty much everything in the documentary is true, and we should learn valuable lessons from it. Our businesses need reform, as do our economic policies. I won't get into that here (this is a review, not a forum for politics).Yet, I felt like the film did a disservice. It generalized, putting all corporations in the same basket as the worst offenders (all corporations may have bad traits inherently, but some are worse than others). And it had some questionable scenes that left the viewer with a skewed view of how history works. Did corporations help Nazis? Of course. But they also helped the good guys. It's true that a moral agent shouldn't help the bad guys, but a business is a business -- it's not that they necessarily were promoting murder and war (though sometimes you have to wonder about certain businesses). Citizens in enemy lands need goods and services, too.I was also disturbed by the inclusion of Michael Moore. Moore is a good guy, but he's a bad spokesman. He makes a lot of errors and gives "the left" a bad name because even when he's right, he doesn't know when to quit. He tells the story of Coca-Cola and Fanta, a "Nazi beverage". The story he tells is false. Coca-Cola may do bad things, but they did not go around the law to sell cola to Germans. Fanta was invented in Germany by a German man, not by the Coca-Cola corporation or by anyone in the Nazi party. So that story is just a cheap smear.Overall, the film is really good. It tells a solid history, makes a lot of ethical points and has some great guest speakers (Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein). My only concern would be not to take everything you hear at face value: always double-check the facts with books or other sources. The speakers are working from memory, and memories can fail us. Or perhaps some of them (like Moore) are just plain wrong. If this film was edited to tone down the hyperbole and focused on the facts, it would be a ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and appealing documentary with flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read a lot of reviews about _The Corporation_ that painted it as a balanced perspective on the institution, I was looking forward to this, but I have to say that I came away from the movie a little disappointed. The movie is slick, to be sure, with cool narration, nice graphics, and smooth editing. But I just couldn't get past the movie's biases.To be sure, corporations are behind a lot of problems in the world, most of which stem from the lack of accountability that's part and parcel with public ownership. I, for one, am rather in favor of abolition of corporate personhood (and more strict standards for corporate charters). The problem with this movie is that it often goes too far and blames capitalism itself for these issues, when corporations are entities that are dependent on government for their very existence, and they differ fundamentally from privately-held businesses, individual consumers, and other actors in markets.The movie does interview people from all over the political spectrum, but the most screen time clearly goes to lefties, such as Noam Chomsky (whose academic field - linguistics - is left unstated presumably to give his opinions on this subject more clout), Michael Moore, and Howard Zinn, along with catastrophists like Jeremy Rifkin. Milton Friedman, on the other hand, only gets a few sentences total (in spite of presumably being more qualified to talk on the subject). Some of the interviews even seemed out of place in this movie. A commodities trader goes on at some length about how 9/11 and Operation Desert Storm were seen as opportunities, but the commodities market is not directly relevant to corporations, and I'm betting that if they'd asked stock traders instead, they would have gotten a very different account. Rising oil prices might benefit commodities traders, but most corporations suffer (which is probably part of why the war was fought to begin with).But ultimately, the worst thing about the movie is that its tone seems to blame capitalism itself for the problems while emphasizing the hypothesis that democratic control over corporations would improve things. Personally, I doubt this. The biggest problem with corporations as I see it is the lack of individual accountability, and putting things to voters to decide has the potential to create a huge mess, since voters are cannot bear full accountability for corporate actions either. Majorities and pluralities can be just as tyrannical as any king.Having said all this, the movie did raise a lot of good points about the history of corporations and the various issues they introduce to the planet. The presentation was also nice, with its narrator, Mikela Mikael, sounding very much like the voice of a computer from an old sci-fi movie, and with a futuristic-slash-vaguely-ominous look to go along with it. My attention didn't stray from the screen for the entire 3 hours, so I suppose the movie largely succeeded, both as entertainment and as food for thought. Also, I must admit that I got off on hearing a pompous Harvard professor say "usurption" (check a dictionary if you don't understand). I only wish they'd exercised more critical thought and shown a somewhat less biased viewpoint overall.10/10 for style, 5/10 for substance, 7/10 overall</fullReview>

It's ultra-dramatic, some comedy, but mostly allows the sheer terrible facts take your emotions for a swing. The funny thing is that the doc is all about how terrible corporations are, and how life is drastically affected by them... but make no hints as to any course of action. So when you're all riled up after watching it you... don't really know what to do about it. Still, absolutely recommended as a "need to see".Special Features: Some deleted scenes (the movie is freaking long as-is), a few interviews which are interesting (especially the Janeane Garofalo one).Similar Movie: Michael Moore's stuff, though this isn't aiming at being funny. I guess that makes it more like Super Size Me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth is greater than fiction - on this occasion, it's also far more disturbing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Abbott and Mark Achbar's "The Corporation" (2004) is a quiet, unsettling ? often disturbing - look at the demonstrative effect that corporate America is having on the health and welfare of average people. Since its 18th century judicial ruling, that defined business entities as 'legally a person' the model of corporate American business has become the divining and dominant political, economic and social force of the world.What is chilling about that definition is the way the film uses the court's clinical and psychological definition to expose corporate America as a destructive psychopath without a conscience. The screenplay by Joel Bacan and Harold Crooks really goes after those in the know ? layering and weaving a series of intricate case studies together, and drawing out the pitfalls of looming disaster for the future of our society. Narrator, Mikela J. Mikael lends a somber tone to a film experience that is a genuine eye opener, and so much more the tour de force documentary than other like minded fair of recent years.The DVD from Zeitgeist Entertainment has a very primitive quality that is thoroughly in keeping with the theatrical presentation. Video quality varies greatly in this guerrilla styled assault on the big bosses. Colors can be rich and bold at times, greatly de-saturated at other times. There is a considerable amount of film grain, grit and lack of detail throughout the image. Flesh tones are either pasty or flat. Still, this is in keeping with the production's original intent. Bottom line: this isn't a film you would purchase for fidelity. The audio is 5.1. Strident in spots, nicely balanced in others. "The Corporation" is presented as either a single disc or 2-disc special edition. The latter includes a series of extras, including insightful commentaries and documentaries that are well worth the few extra dollars that separate one purchase from the other. Bottom line is, "The Corporation" will likely upset your world view on capitalism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Corporation is quite a skillfully made documentary, but if you've any of read the books of the main authorities interviewed for the film - Naomi Klein, Noam chomsky and Michael moore, then a lot of the depressing subject matter of this documentary will already be pretty familiar to you.For example, most people already know that corporations are destroying the environment, exploiting third world workers and controlling too much of our culture, for example.Even though 'The Corporation' is rather long, i felt it ended up spreading itself too thinly - not surprising since the subject is so vast and complex. I think it might have been better to concentrate on more constructive aspects, such as what legal avenues could be available to us to reduce corporate power.The film is a good primer and wake up call for people who are still oblivious to the out-of-control nature of corporate power, but doesn't add anything novel to what's already out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this documentary. I found it interesting and informative, but I was coming into it with an existing anti-capitalist belief. I sat my girlfriend and my friends down and made them watch it, but they said that it was too long, and a little dry. I think, trying to look at it from a balanced perspective, that these are fair enough comments. If the people behind this documentary were seeking to change the world, or at least some people's perceptions of corporations, they should have made it about an hour longer. (I'm not sure, but I think it was nearly 2 and a half hours long). Although I find him far too simplistic, Michael Moore seems to me to be far more effective at changing people's beliefs, because of his high-paced, "punchy" style.However, if you're interested in corporations, or an anti-capitalist, I think you'll appreciate the way in which both sides of the debate are presented and analysed, even if they do ultimately come down very strongly on one side. I would also encourage anyone to watch it, in the hope that it might open at least a few people's eyes to the realities of the capitalist system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Primer in Corporate Greed and Democracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, despite it's length (approaches 2.5 hours) is an excellent primer for those of us who don't know quite enough about the corporation and how it operates in the United States. I wanted to resist the left-leaning political slant. Although I am a liberal I sort of look askance at far-lefties... it's probably their outfits and attitude more than their politics. Which is exactly the redeeming character of this film. It is not a harangue by the groovy folks who inhabit the far left. It's a very well-articulated, well-documented account of how the corporation arose in America (its ties to the Civil War, industrialization, and protection under the 14th amendment...) It then explores the character of this 'person' known as the Corporation. It's not a very nice person, as you would guess. But the malevolence and irresponsibility of the person is so detailed and multi-faceted that it merits an examination from multiple angles. The film provides it. Further, it is well-edited, the music and narration are compelling, and the interviews are somewhat-gripping. Standouts are an Indian activist who expresses the film's greatest hope (I can't recall her name...) and a CEO of a carpet company that had what he describes as an epiphany. His company is aiming for what it is termed 'sustainability' by 2020. The film is suitable for instructional use. It looks at health issues rather completely so I intend to use it in the college health classes I teach. It also offers amazing perspectives on marketing to children (nagging studies!), private communities such as Celebration, FL (a Disney thing), and the darkest moment of the film -- the story of how IBM developed and sold the punch-cards and machines used in Nazi death camps. One great thing about the film is that it doesn't point fingers at the bad guys. It lets them hang themselves. The viewer can decide for himself if he agrees. Go see this film. But be prepared to get a little lost in the sheer scale of it. You'll want to rent it and grab a notebook and keep the remote handy so you can pause and rewind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The crux of the Corporation is that corporations are amoral and therefore usually immoral. Unfortunately, this film is not so much a documentary as propaganda. The reporting is unbalanced. There is creepy, bad guy theme music for corporations. The whole thing comes off as a well meaning but amateur college production. Like Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11 (but worse) the Corporation is therefore doomed to attract an audience of only people who already agree and to otherwise fall on deaf ears. (Moore is featured in this film, also Noam Chomsky.)That said, I did learn a few things. The Corporation introduced me to Ray Anderson, the CEO reconfiguring his corporation for sustainable development. It drew my attention to the human rights issues surrounding the privatization of water rights. It made me reconsider, yet again, which brands of products I as a consumer (don't) want to buy. I considered whether business should ever market to children. And it amused me by psychoanalyzing the corporation (which the United States has granted the legal rights of an actual person) and diagnosing the corporation logically as a psychopath.</fullReview>

There have been reviews expressing how bias this film was, but I will have to say that I don't agree.I think it was a fair argument, because many of the interviewees were people who operated inside the companies, so you knew that what you were hearing was actually coming from the insiders instead of radical protesters or people with a grudge.I enjoyed watching the heads of companies themselves admit to things you and I would never allow. The most intriguing part was the bit about how DNA is now allowed to be patented, but I won't spoil anything for you.I recommend this film to anyone who is willing to watch a documentary. There are no action scenes or car chases, so you'll need a mature mind to truly understand this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth a look, but too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well-intentioned and fascinating film. The corporate world stands - justly- accused of creating a demand for goods that we do not need, which are helping to destroy the atmosphere, but which allow the corporations to make lots of money. It would seem that the bottom line is all that matters and that institutional America - especially the Supreme Court in their decision to treat corporations as people (contrary to the framers' of the 14th Amendment's wishes) - has permitted the real people of the United States to be hoodwinked into buying (literally) into the deal. The film succeeds in its objective but there is one glaring problem - the film is just too long. I was fascinated by most of the film but, devoted opponent of the capitalist system as I am, I began to think that the point had been made about 45 minutes before the film ended. The makers of the film are clearly committed to what they were doing and kudos for them for that. However, the film does need to be shorter and tauter for its message to resonate. Michael Moore is, as always, brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all too necessary eye-opener with ideas the majority needs to hear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Corporation comes from a particular perspective. It's obviously left wing, consults like minded prominent thinkers while still giving a podium to opposing views and is heavily edited to emphasize obvious flaws with corporate culture. None of this is a bad thing. It is a documentary where the message is streamlined from, presumably, hours of interviews, miles of historical footage and a very obvious intent. If the concurrently exposed anecdotal cases and interviews are something you've seen before, or memory suggests it might be familiar in subtler ways that too isn't such a bad thing. The power it has, and it wields it purposefully, is to wrap these things under a single title and suggest a desperate need for awareness.On a scale to measure the importance of the topic, the origins and effects of corporate entities on us and our world, even the most jaded viewer would have to agree that for their possibility alone the questions should at least be heard. For those who find a sick feeling in the knowledge that the strongest negative suggestions seem all too plausible it is a solid effort at rounding up a vital and extremely broad subject. There is too much time spent on certain anecdotal cases while others seem not to be presented to conclusion but it remains a powerful mix. For such a long sitting it seems the organization of examples and the intertwined interviews and historical references could have been pared down but it would be extremely difficult to choose what to leave out. As film goes there are more uplifting things to see. As documentaries go there are more uplifting things to see. But as a relatively small amount of time spent there can't be many more important things to present to the majority who don't give these questions a moments thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a very well done documentary. It provided a lot of in-depth information I was not aware of. It primarily seeks to point out the wrong doings of large corporations. It neglects to mention that a corporation can also be as small as just one person. In such a corporation a single person fills several positions.I do not feel this documentary provides an unbiased view of corporations. It attacks mostly large multi-billion dollar corporations. Which in actuality large corporations are a small minority in the number of registered corporations.There are over 4,848,888 corporations in the United States. They pointed out only a few dozen of evil doers. The evil doers make up only a small part of all corporations doing business in the US.The vast majority of corporations are owned and operated by ethical moral entrepreneurs.A corporation is simply a reflection of it's customer. A corporation can't survive unless they make sales. If customers continue to buy it's products, they will remain in business.My personal opinion is the majority of Americans are capitalists in nature. They'll sacrifice the lives of kids in third world countries for cheap stuff.</fullReview>

The content is wholesome, invaluable information which, through neutral debate, turns The Corporation, this nadir of co-sufficiency, inside out. Michael Moore was a decoy and this is the front line. He makes it into the final cut like a cracker joke at Christmas. Noam Chomsky, like a cross between Woody Allen and 9/11, confirms the worst and reinforces the muted urgency of this call to arms. If the information this film contains is spread with the gusto its importance deserves, then roll on mass protest on an unprecedented scale. The Bolivian Water War is our benchmark as a race.

		<shortDescription>A brilliant documentary documenting...corporations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so it's been out in Canada for the longest time, ever since the Toronto International Film Festival in 2003, but I hadn't bothered watching the movie, due to commitments to watching many other movies.So when I finally caught it a few weeks ago at the local Princess Cinema in Waterloo, Ontario, I was surprised. Surprised mainly by the fact that I hadn't watched it sooner. Or that I hadn't had the audacity to watch it by myself when I had the chance to. Anyways, it's a 2 hour and 45 minute long documentary about the Corporation, an entity which acts like an individual and certainly has all the rights that an individual has, but is free from all our constraints: our emotions, our feelings, our multi-dimensional faces. Presented in the typical documentary style with archival references throughout, it is a startling tale of how corporations have infiltrated our society and have been able to emerge from its original simple and people-serving role to its now transnational and people-enslaving position. Using the World Health Organization's criteria for establishing if one is a psychopath, the documentary carefully examines these criteria, and then slowly, but assuredly proves that the corporation meets all these criteria.It is a harrowing experience, seeing images that you never thought you would see (SPOILER SPOILER corporations sitting right beside nations within the United Nations and them being allowed to speak END SPOILER END SPOILER) but in the end, it really makes you want to go out and boycott some company. The latter half gets a little disorganised and kind of confusing with its direction, but it ends up nicely with an interview with Michael Moore. It is an obvious attempt to manipulate the audience into doing something about these situations, but nevertheless, it is a powerful and still very affecting little pack on the back. Even if you're not some crazy left-wing radical, go do yourself a favour. Go watch the Corporation. It's eye-opening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant flick! Based on its title alone, the film might seem like it may be a bit of a snore fest, but in fact it is wonderfully entertaining. Even for those of us who think we know it all -- or our mind's are already made up about "corporate America" -- this film has many surprises. I was fully expecting to be nonplused by this film -- been there seen that - but it is so well structured and delightfully dense with tidbits of information and twists in perspective (e.g. a Corporate CEO describing how what he does should be illegal -- and he can't believe it's not) that it completely won me over. It incorporates an intellectual heft missing from say a Michael Moore film, but, like Moore, the filmaker recognises the importance of telling a good storey, being entertaining and keeping his/her audience involved and enthralled.

		<fullReview>I read a few of the negative comments and many are saying that the movie is propaganda and only serves to make Corporations look evil. Look at the facts people. Every Eco-system on the planet is in decline. Humans are the only creatures on this earth that are destroying it day after day. We, Humans are the cause of the ozone, poor air, pollution of water, loss of habitat. This is all being driven by the economic engine which wants you and I to consume. Yes, that is what a Corporation wants you to do! CONSUME. After all, you are called the consumer. We are plundering this planet and we are not doing anything about it. If governments try to clean the air or water, Corporations lobby to have the amounts reduced or delay the implementation. This is scary stuff. Corporations do it to protect the bottom line, to increase share holder support.One person wrote that Corporations make the world a better place or we would be in the dark ages. This does not make sense. How can we say it is a better place. The air and water are poisoned and our forests are being cut too much too fast.We just want Corporations to make profits in a responsible way and not destroy and plunder the earth's resources while doing it. Is it really not that difficult. And yes, it will cost a bit more money, not to just dump affluent in a river or belch fumes into the air. However, in the end you will have healthy happy consumers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying and deeply serious film that everyone should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A two and a half hour documentary on the history and development of the American corporation and how it achieved its current state of world domination might seem like a recipe for a very dry and dull movie experience. Not at all. I was riveted from beginning to end. I checked my watch a couple of times because I couldn't believe that such a stunning pitch could be maintained for so long. Unfortunately, the people who really need to see this movie (everyone who voted for Bush) almost certainly won't. This is not for the faint-hearted or for those merely looking to be entertained. This is a brutally frank and frequently shocking expose of the moral, spiritual and ethical bankruptcy of the American corporate world. It has not been 'dumbed down', it demands very close attention in order to be fully understood. In this respect, it is not similar to Michael Moore's films with which it has been compared. Michael Moore appears as an interviewee, however, and has many intelligent points to make. There are several strands here, with many digressions: particularly chilling was the sequence on the silencing of two Fox journalists who had had the audacity to question why their attempts to expose a massive public health risk were not being aired. To dismiss this as merely "left-wing scaremongering" is missing the point. What this film presents are facts about who has real power in the modern world, and every citizen who gives a damn about the future of the world we live in has a duty to educate themselves as to what it is being done in the name of enormous financial gains for a very small elite of unbelievably greedy and selfish men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but Pedantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie on Friday the 20th of February. The Corporation is a pretty good look at the issues and troubles of the modern market/corporate world. The scenes with the CEO of Interface (largest carpet manufacturer in the world) talking about how he's changing his company to be "sustainable" in particular are very uplifting and interesting.However, the movie does suffer somewhat from a pedantic pace. By the last half-hour of the movie most of the people in the theatre were getting a bit restless as the pacing slows down considerably. The directors do manage to get their point across, but it's not quite as varied and enjoyable as, say, Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine.Part of the problem probably has to do with the linear ordering of everything - first we hear about the problems of corporations, then we hear about people fighting (and failing) against corporations, then we get the uplifting finale where we hear about people fighting (and succeeding) against corporations. This idiomatic setup works fine for the first parts, but just gets banal at the end.I also have to draw attention to the large numbers of portrait shots of the various interviewees talking about their ideas - there are just too many. We really only need to *see* people like Noam Chomsky talk just once or twice - why not let him talk over some other video footage? The sheer number of these is a bit ridiculous - and yet we know that the directors are capable of some very interesting shots, notably with the "few bad apples" scene reminiscent of Michael Moore's "Black Male" scene.Finally, although I liked the overall message, I do have to point out that some of the arguments seem a little poorly "fleshed out". One particular idea, the idea of everything being "owned" by someone, is flaunted briefly but dismissed without being really explored or properly rebutted in any way. The idea may be wrong, but it deserved more attention than the filmmakers gave it - and someone better qualified to talk about it, rather than the somewhat bumbling buffoon the film has.Still, I did enjoy the film. If you're interested in hearing about the corruption of the corporate world, it's a good movie. Just don't expect to be too entertained - "The Corporation" is porridge, not Captain Crunch, for the soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is a corporation indeed psychopathic? Does the Store manager really not know what the associate is doing? Is the cause of this the policies, and procedures that do not allow things to be of clear communication? I did not find this story to be shocking in anyway. Of course a corporation does not know everything about all things that run inside of it - at all times. An incorporation or a corporation is not a human being, it is an organizational structure. How can an organization be marked at a psychopath? It is like analyzing the architecture of a building to be one of deceit or honesty - based only on the way the bricks lay and the glass windows are formed.An institution is not a human being and should not be compared to one. An institution is a fake structure in which human beings operate in order to perform a task and gain financial results in order to live on this planet - in order to pay bills and support life.Perhaps operating within the corridors of an institution and a corporation is frustrating however it is the only system that human beings know that works efficiently.I believe the movie, "The corporation" does indicate how some of them work. However I think it is easy to see the wrong a corporation does - however, every corporation has good and bad parts in it. I think it would have been better to have focused on an actual case study of one large corporation and analyzed it from each layer within the company. From associate to store manager to head-office. The devil is in the details, however - as a whole - as a big picture - the corporation system gains financial results as seen in profits - which in turn builds to the ever success of capitalism.I believe that each person in the corporation machine encounters things that can have the traits of a psychopath - however those are tiny details in the big picture of gaining profits, surpassing the predicted bottom-line results and gaining success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Corporation should be given kudos for being a massive nearly three hour length documentary and still remain mostly entertaining and keep you engaged in the material. However I also felt like they were simply like lawyers trying to prove a case. It would not be hard for them to convince me that corporations are evil and conducive to bringing down society and yet they really pour it on thick and go so far as to try to make us believe that a corporation is equivalent and fits all the qualifications for a medical diagnose of a psychopath. Director and creator Mark Achbar is obviously very passionate about this topic and kudos to him but I think where the film falters is in it's passion. All this information is presented in a very factual straight forward fashion and it just feels like it's being drilled into you for three straight hours. I think the film could have been far more effective given a smaller time frame and some serious trimming. Certainly the film isn't for the weak minded or someone who doesn't want to be intellectually challenged because the film will take some serious thought. I think in the future we will see some great things in documentary film making. Worth seeing if you're doing some studying into the politics of corporations. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsA documentary that explores how the initially very small business industry has grown into a phenomenon bigger than Jesus and has come to have a,not always positive,impact on our lives.It's kind of apt,in this modern age and society,that a film like The Corporation would be made.As comparatively recently as the 80s,films such as Blade Runner and Robocop were depicting how big,major corporations were going to take over the world and how everything would end up being owned by everybody,and it's nice to see a factual documentary proving the premonitions of action fantasy flicks made in the decade of the consumer right.From the off-set,Mikela J Mikael's HAL esque voice-overs give the film an edgy sci-fi feel and,indeed,The Corporation has some chilling predictions to make for the future.One thing nobody could accuse the film of not being is thorough.Some may say it's overlong,but this is a film that truly delves into it's subject matter and presents potential and terrifying scenarios to come and if you can just stick it out till the end,you are rewarded in full.Despite his valued contributions,you can't help but feel Michael Moore's presence in the film is some sort of coy to attract more viewers to come and see the film.The film would appear to have been made a year before his Fahrenheit 9/11 film would go on to become the highest grossing documentary of all time and one wonders whether it would have had a cinematic release at all had it not been for his presence.Despite this,this is interesting and compelling stuff right through to the end.This is truly the age of the documentary and this truly ranks as the best film I've seen all year.*****</fullReview>

The doco is largely humourless and suffers from not having an on-camera narrator to liven up the proceedings. It's preaching to the choir and won't win over many new supporters to the cause.If you've read Klein's No Logo or Chomsky's Hegemony Or Survival, or have seen excellent docos on the BBC like Travels of a Gringo, then you might find this a bit tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very profound, information-packed documentary. It traces the history of the corporation, how it has progressed, and how its current trajectory is leading it going into the future. There are almost too many powerful scenes to recall. The major one everyone will recall is the psychiatrist listing the traits of a psychopath and having every single one of them checked off as perfectly describing a corporation (since a corporation is legally a person). Another powerful item was when the guy said how these designer clothes are made in this third-world country by this 13 year old kid for 4 cents, but the final item when completed sells for thousands of dollars in the developed world. This is a 2 1/2 hour diatribe, which is able to completely eliminate any possible sliver of worth a corporation may have been thought to have possessed beforehand by the viewer-at-large.I initially went to this movie at the theatre because of Noam Chomsky, but, the more I thought about it, I did everything humanly possible to get to this showing when it was available nearby. This is definitely not the kind of movie that will be showing up at your nearby video rental anytime soon.

		<fullReview>This film accurately, and honestly presented the modern corporation in the context of a capitalist global economy. This film helps document the innocent, and often progressive, origins of the corporation at the beginning of the industrial age. From the pragmatic beginning, the corporation has evolved into its modern day form, with the legal rights of a person and the morality of a psychopath. The film questions the very nature of modern day capitalism: its outcomes and its consequences. What I enjoy particularly is how the documentary presents the people of corporations not to be blood thirsty or immoral; they are merely caught in the systemic problems that arise from a capital based economy. The "global economy" has become a Leviathan: a monster that eats resources and people, only crying out for more. This documentary is important because it offers broad, but convincing critiques of capitalism both from the left, (Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn) and the right (Milton Friedman). One the best documentaries I've seen in a while. Highly recommended. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise of this Canadian documentary, directed by Mark Achbar (Manufacturing Consent), can be summed up thus: According to the judicial interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the American Constitution, a corporation is a person. But what kind of person is it? Given its disregard for the law, endangerment of life and environment, and refusal to accept responsibility for its actions, the producers conclude that the corporation matches the symptoms found in the DSM-IV for psychopathy.The Corporation scores a few good points: corporate arrogance, multinational corporations operating outside the law, exploitation of Third World and child labour, the pervasiveness of advertising, patents on life forms and even human genome information, the selling of "terminator seeds" that prevent farmers from saving seed from season to season, and privatization of the water supply. Specially singled out for special attention is Monsanto, which has brought us such fine products as Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH), genetically modified wheat, and Agent Orange.On the other hand, the overall tone of the documentary is anti-corporation and anti-capitalist. A lengthy segment discusses the suppression by Fox News of an investigative report on Monsanto and rBGH produced by Steve Wilson and Jane Akre. While focusing on Fox's cover-up of a story that was in the public interest to report because it would affect their bottom line, the producers overlook the fact that Wilson and Akre were able to sue the same corporate entity for dismissing them in retaliation. Similarly, "Big Tobacco" could not be sued, nor could polluting oil companies be prosecuted, if it were not for the same legal standing that is the subject of this documentary's criticism. Focusing on the cons while ignoring the pros is unbalanced. A short sequence about Arcata, California's drive to ban chain restaurants from the city also appears to paint even small business owners unsympathetically. While criticizing private ownership and capitalism, the filmmakers fail to make a strong case for any alternatives, apart from some well-placed remarks about government regulation and operation of essential services, such as the water supply or firefighting.Something like 40 different talking heads appear in this film to give their opinion: CEOs, lawyers, activists, economists, and others. Two people get significantly more "face time" than others. The first of these is linguist-turned-activist Noam Chomsky - not surprising, since he was the subject of Manufacturing Consent, the documentary that launched Mark Achbar's career. The second person was not so wise a choice: Michael Moore, who is not an expert on corporations or economics, but a like-minded filmmaker. His inclusion seems less like informed commentary than incest. Ironically, toward the end of the documentary he cackles in a most capitalistic fashion about using major corporations to distribute his films, which preach against what they stand for.Overall, for a leftist screed, The Corporation is intelligent and, for the most part, balanced. However, at nearly two and a half hours, it is longer than it needs to be and tends toward the pedantic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Corporation is just an Expensive Power Point Presentation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't rent this movie as a relaxing weekend activity because it's quite heavy and don't try and watch it in one setting because it's very challenging to sit through due to its lengthy, dry content and slow/uneven pacing.I watched it for a little while, then turned it off for a little while and watered my plants and fed my tropical fishes. This helped me digest the massive "talking-head" sessions and reflect on the information over-load. When I finally got through the film I was left with a lot more questions and confusion about what the whole film was really about. Was it made to stir up conversation or to motivate change? Or simply expose the unflattering aspects of Corporations? The film's theme poses the question "If a Corporation is a person what kind of person are they?" It does this by breaking up a selected personality disorder into it's main traits and has these specific traits typed out on static title cards and spliced between the different sections on the film.I didn't think this approach to storytelling was very inventive or creative. I thought the design and style of the title cards cheapened the look of an already "low-budget" looking film.It seems like it would be a rather simple/practical and effective way of breaking the masses of footage up into better organized discussions, but there was no more clarity achieved using this all-too-easy method.The Corporations over-all look and structure was like watching a bunch of typical "fear driven" and boring news footage sandwiched between in bad power-point presentation that just goes on and on.I give a good pat on the back for the filmmakers though, because movies like this are really hard to make. Getting funding isn't easy, securing interviews is a pain in the butt and going through hours and hours of footage of people answering questions and blabbing on and on is a painstaking job (whether or not you have a theme in mind), editing all the dialogue is quite a task especially if you are trying to get a coherent story line out of it in the end. I was surprised at how well they got their personal thoughts across in the end.This movie is worth seeing because it's a good conversational piece and is thought provoking. It also is good for stirring up a debate online if you are bored.Over all it was just "okay" because it was too long and all over the place. It takes a filmmaker with a huge vision and informed activist passion to tackle topic like this in a movie form.Unfortunately I think the movie suffered in the end because it took itself a little to seriously and much of the content could have been removed to achieve better clarity in the point and story line. Perhaps the makers of this film were in love with too much of the footage and couldn't bear to omit more stuff? Maybe that is the price of having such great passion?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even-handed? Yes. Cinematic, No so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Corporation" is a straight-forwarded documentary critique of what is arguably modern society's most powerful institutions -- incorporated business enterprises. What about governments? Well, yes, in some countries, notably Russia, corporations do as directed (just ask a Russian oil billionaire if the warden allows). However, the movie argues, the fairly self-evident point, that elected officials have little recourse but to swing their influence in the direction very large, very wealthy and very well connected people (corporations are legally persons) point. The movie recounts the mechanisms of this influence including congressional votes lobbied, tax codes rewritten and resistors silenced. At its most interesting the film covers the excesses of this power. According to the film, Mosanto, which makes an appearance in most material of this nature, boosts profits by selling seeds that produce non-reproducing plants so that another purchase needs to be made the following year and sues farmers who disagree with their practices. Another corporation buys all of the water rights in part of a South American country so that collecting rainwater becomes a form of stealing which the government enforces on the company's behalf. The examples in the film are many, frankly too many given this is a cinematic release rather than the PBS special it much more assuredly feels like with its multitude of title cards and talking heads most notably Noam Chomsky. Much like a PBS special, the tone is even-handed and civil and makes you understand why Michael Moore earns far more on his screaming, one-sided docs ("Fahrenheit 911") than he does on his more harmonious, balanced offerings ("Sicko"). In short, the movie lacks enough thematic elements to make for a particularly interesting film and the central premise that corporations are very powerful and are profit-driven will shock only the most na?ve. As CNBC's Jim Cramer says: "it is government for the corporations, by the corporations and from an investor's standpoint, that is a good thing."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A thought provoking film and worthwhile. It is, however, intended for a particular audience. Corporations are more or less demonized. For example, Noam Chomsky draws a parallel between the corporate world and slavery. Before the civil war there could be slave owners who were nice and caring towards those in the community. When they were playing their institutional role as slave owner, however, they were necessarily evil because the institution was evil. The same with CEOs. They can be nice people in their interactions with others but when they are playing their institutional role they are evil because the institution is evil. Another segment is on the link between US corporations and Nazi Germany. The film ends on the uplifting note that people can make a difference in the battle against corporate interests. I would guess the film would only be well received by those that are firmly on the left politically. Interesting film, but I have the feeling that for those who choose to go to see it, it will be preaching to the choir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While tending to agree with many of the sentiments expressed in this film, I found myself longing to hear voices from the 'other side'. I think without exception, all interviews were conducted with left-leaning anti-corporation advocates. Where were the interviews with the CEOs and business analysts who can present the other side of the picture. No argument is ever as cut and dried as this documentary would have you know.Given that only one side was presented, you would have expected this film to be short and snappy. Far from it! It weights in at an almost Lord-of-the-Rings length of 2 1/2 hours. The editing throughout is generally very poor, but it was clear that the production company did not enforce limits on the length of this film. All points made are labored and repeated unnecessarily, to the point where you'll be looking for the 'FF' button to get to the next argument against corporations.With better editing and more voices from big-business presenting the benefits of corporations, it could have been a 'must-see' documentary. I'll look forward to Corporation II though....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film, and I agree that it may be more powerful (not better) than Fahrenheit 911 because it doesn't have the caustic wit of Michael Moore. Both films are highly recommended, though.After seeing The Corporation, I had a different take on Donald Trump's Episode #2 of The Apprentice TV show. Brad got fired when he offered to give up his immunity from being fired, which he had by being the project director of the winning team the previous week. It was shocking to the reviewer when Trump fired him as a result of this move. It could be seen on several levels. Consistent with The Corporation, Brad was fired because he was being altruistic. This goes against the company persona's bottom line, making money. Offering to give up a clear-cut advantage was anathema to Trump, who is the embodiment of the Corporation.At another level, it could be that psychologically astute Trump saw beneath the outwardly altruistic act, and saw it as Brad trying to align/compete with Trump, going against the well defined order of the corporation.Both of these could be true. Interestingly, at the end of the program, the leader of the winning team turned and asked Trump if they could give all their winnings to the charity they had used to increase their sales. They had sold their ice cream on the premise that part of the earnings would go to the Leukemia Society. Once the sale ended, the team had to decide how much they could afford to give to the charity and still win the contest. Of course, Trump magnanimously said they could. This was probably not agreed to out of altruism, but because $3K was worth the bonus points he would earn from the viewers!Soon after I saw The Corporation, I saw Silver City, which was serendipitous, I guess, because it served as an example of a corporation as described by the movie, The Corporation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic documentary the dives into the psychology of the corporation, a legal entity. Every time I see one of these documentaries, I feel like I become more and more left leaning. This film touches on social irresponsibility, environmental destruction, international sweat shops, and the behaviour of these corporations about these issues.They hypothesize that The Corporation is a legal entity with a mental disorder. And they support their thesis quite well actually.The highest point of the film was the Water Monopolization in Bolivia, which is a tragic story where citizens were not even allowed to collect rainwater so they could have fresh drinking water because of a corporate monopoly in their area.If Corporations had it their way, they'd patent breathing, and every breath we took we'd pay a royalty fee to the patent holder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't need to be leftist or a Michael Moore fan to appreciate this documentary about the insatiable greed for wealth and power that dominates with corporations. You only need to look at the salaries of the CEOs of Disney, Nike etc compared to the wages paid those who produce the goods they well to appreciate the increasing disparity of wealth in the world. When you learn that US corporations are trying to privatise rainfall in the Third World and force them to use seeds that self-destruct after one season you realize why the rest of the world views the US and its business interests with suspicion.A very harrowing film that is a tad too long, it is nonetheless vital viewing. Absent is the self-serving doco style of Michael Moore. Instead this shows in a remarkably balanced way that the likes of Monsanto are psychopathic entities and the media utterly beholden to them.

Something I would have nightmares about. I also thought it might turn into a real quasi-liberal, neo-socialist statement about capitalism. It certainly had those kinds of overtones but in the end I was pleasantly surprised at the almost positive (dare I say optimistic?) turn that the film took when it presented some of the progress that was being made by the corporate world. The film actually had some resolution to it and was thus more than just a political statement.. Overall it left me with a feeling that I got a very powerful and yet balanced message.One thing ...

I by no means am on the liberal side of things but I felt like Neo, pulling the cord out of the back of my head and detaching myself from the Matrix (for all those Matrix fans out there.) and had no feeling that this movie was tugging at political leftist heart strings. On all the comments about the fact that this is a corporate bashing film, I feel that they have completely missed the point. For all those that see this film; take in the fact, the one single point they are trying to get across is, ACOUNTABILITY. There is no true accountability in the corporate world and the corporation has been given the ability to trample on a lot of our freedoms. I do not think this film was made for the corporate person so to speak, it was made for anyone that is willing to start taking a better look at what is going on around them and stop droning through life letting others control what you do, buy, say, sell, eat, etc? until you are basically led to your demise, and if the facts are straight in this film that is exactly what is going on.I really appreciate this film for its ability to get the point across and make a case in informing the people, through history and documentation these I feel are the key components of a documentaries job and it has done this superbly. Like I said for all those that want to know what is going on behind the scenes you must see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MUST-SEE Film for Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie was 145 minutes long I feared it might be a tiresome extremist leftwing corporate-bashing film -- but happily, it was not. Instead, it was a highly entertaining, enlightening history of the corporation as it has grown from a simple legal structure originally created to protect rights of American freed slaves to something manipulated by savvy businessmen and their lawyers to do everything from limit their personal financial liability to controlling and impacting the entire lives of third world worker communities and governments, the environment, and how and what we consume. The movie makes clear its not necessarily people that are evil so much as the structure of the corporation which creates "psychopath" behavior in the interest of profit. No surprise there. What's interesting is that the movie covers a lot of fascinating ground -- the story of two Fox investigative reporters and their battle with Fox Network and Monsanto corporate lawyers who tried to stop them when they tried to report how RBTs in milk cause cancer; the struggle of Bolivians to prevent an American corporation from taxing them for the right to their own water!;the way big business takes advantage of disasters, wars and tyrant governments both here and in other countries; how pharmaceutical corporations are patenting both human gene patterns as well as and other species' genes for who knows what sinister future purpose; and much much more. They have a leading CEO of the largest carpet manufacturing business in the world talk about how he is working to reverse the damage his company has wreaked on the environment through a conscientious effort to become a sustainable company, and a review of how even if companies such as GE, Philip Morris and Weyerhauser are only paying lip service when they show concern for the environment, it is still better than no lip service at all, and in fact if the trend continues, and people increasingly become more aware of how their consumer spending choices affect corporations, they can in effect vote with their dollars to change things. Similar ground is covered in books like "Fast Food Nation" and "No Logo". I think this is a MUST SEE film for everyone, it is very educational and consciousness-raising, it does NOT demonize anyone, in fact it demonstrates subtly how demonization is ridiculous on either side (left wing or right wing), and it offers a hope for change if people will just stop to think about issues more often instead of burying their heads in the sand.</fullReview>

While watching it I had only one hope in mind, and that was to move to an isolated and as un-corrupt as possible island in the Pacific and just loose all the transparent strings that bind me to our capitalistic regime. Because I don't want to live in this place where nothing is truly mine. I want to live in New Zealand (that seems far enough), have a nice little cottage made of wooden sticks and mud and I want to work on MY bio field every day, that's my thinking now, screw you!!! Michael Moore's final words will stick in my mind for years to come, here he is, dedicating his life to show people the terrible stuff that corporations and politicians do, so why in the world do the very same people pay him to do so, give him all the money he needs to get his little movies made and be able to tell these terrible things. Because somewhere in the last couple of decades people have lost their moral values - they give a big FU to his new movie, they don't give a damn what he says, they get money off of him so they remain happy, very happy. And no one will do anything to prevent them from continuing this destructing path, perhaps not enough people have seen this documentary to realize that the lives they live should be owned by the 60 or 70% of people who starve and suffer their whole life. If it weren't for them none of us would be able to be here and write saddened and irritated comments on our nazi computers and go to work in our nazi cars and perhaps drink or eat something with nazi written all over it. Ignorance is bliss, yet again I agree! Should have watched "Profit" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, if you want to make a documentary, look at this one for an example. I was one of the lucky few to get into the screening at the Vancouver International Film Fest, and appreciate how lucky I was to be one of the first to see this film. The clapping went on for a good while after the movie ended....Being made/released at perhaps the perfect time, THE CORPORATION hits many subjects and takes on quite a tough task: to define a corporation. While the film critiqued many aspects of a corporation, and might seem negative towards corporations, the film truly does its best to frame the issue in a way that is not TOO extremist. It is both educational, yet contains traces of advocacy.I liked the black &amp; white film clips placed throughout, which serve to both define and mock certain aspects about capitalism. Interviews with Noam Chomsky, Naomi Kline, Michael Moore, and a host of others serve to better define certain areas of this broad topic.THE CORPORATION truly succeeds at presenting such broad subject matter in a way that was crafted and edited very well. A nice flow of information compliments the movie, and my attention span was nicely kept in check.I think this movie is thought-provoking, brings up issues which are HOT topics today, and tries out new things and wins every time. Definitely award-winning documentary material here, don't you think? I thought it was on-par with some of Michael Moore's work, an academy award winning director. Saying that, I think the people who made this movie did a fine job. Good work! I want to see more like this!Five Stars / Five.Recommend: Any of Michael Moore's work, as well as "Life and Debt" by Stephanie Black</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite heavy bias and misguided message, still very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can read from the other posts, most viewers will fall into one of two camps. Either they are business sensitive and thus are repulsed by the slant of the documentary/propaganda, or they are frustrated by the sense of lack of control over the undesired consequences of some business activity and thus cheer the big business-bashing. But what can centrists get out of the film, and can a productive message be derived from this stylish, intensive work of art with its overly ambitious agenda and misguided message? First, be forewarned that the filmmakers at numerous instances were either naively uninformed or willfully attempting to deceive their audience. Unless you are knowledgeable of terms such as deregulation, public-private partnerships, corporate and other business entities, privatization and above all, externalities, this film will try to force-feed you a limited, self-serving definition.Second, the film is spread too thin. It tries to cover monopolies, sustainability, child labor laws, consumer protection, racism and military collateral damage, to name just a few subjects, in only the first twenty minutes! Each a fascinating subject worthy of discussion, but more focus would have produced a higher quality documentary and not left it feeling more like a slick rally cry for the left.Third, the film is misnamed. It is primarily about activities of big business (which essentially means publicly-traded corporations, but not necessarily). The film does not explain what a corporation is and makes only a superficial effort to describe how it developed historically.High points. Raising issues, such as 1) are fines large enough to deter undesirable consequences, thus insuring long-term balance in the drive to raise quality of life?, 2) are virgin materials priced correctly to insure sustainability?, and 3) how do companies market products subliminally (the "nagging" angle)?; Noam Chomsky, who although described by some as the ultimate leftist, is always lucid, intelligent, and not necessarily political; and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, who must have a soft spot for the producers.Low points. The "boxes" ('layoffs', 'union busting', "sweatshops'); the psychopath analogy; the overseas sweatshops; the Bolivian water episode; US businesses in Nazi Germany; the glorification of ignorance (the WTO protests); and Michael Moore. Although I personally find Mr. Moore's films entertaining and thought-provoking on public policy issues, he is simply out of his league when it comes to economics. He appears awkward and is utterly dead wrong in a number of his statements.This film could have been about raising the standard of living by generating enthusiasm at a grass-roots level for better government with which to manage the externalities generated by prosperous business. In that way, it would have still become a "message" film, as it had intended, but in a more productive, realistic and honest fashion. Instead, it spits on the word "externality" and launches a frontal attack on the principal means of producing goods and services. Nonetheless, I give it some credit for looking good and titillating the senses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Awful "Corporation"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The corporation has been haled as a scathing expos on the state of affairs of the global corporation and from two perspectives I am most familiar with: film-making and economics, this "documentary" is anything but.Firstly from a less contentious, film-making perspective this is propaganda disguised as film-making. What is immediately evident to anyone who has seen any well-made documentary of recent memory (Fog of War, Capturing the Friedmans, Control Room, Murderball, to name a few)is that the flaws and omissions of "The Corporation" are glaring. Interviewees are are either in support of the filmmakers' anti-corporate views or if they interviewees themselves are apart of the corporate world, only their seemingly sarcastic, "anti-corporate" views are shown in the film. All these interviews are woven together with an ominous, odious voice-over that narrates the evils of corporations instead of acting as a disinterested, third party observer.Secondly, from a economic perspective, which in a way is an extension of the poor film-making of this documentary is that lack of balance. Not one person on screen describe the benefit of corporations, but instead continuously criticize the notion of a corporation. It fails to mention that the cameras they use to make the film, the cars they drive to the filming locations, and the computers they use to edit their footage are all made by corporations. In fact, America was founded on the earliest form of the corporation, the joint-stock company! To only focus on the negative externalities of a corporate structure is to rue the evils of "the pen" by saying Hitler signed all his edicts in pen.I won't try to persuade anyone from not watching this so called "documentary" because if you're a fanatical tree hugger, you can't be swayed with logic and if you're educated in film or economics or both, you won't even be able to make it to part 3 without cursing the corporation that allowed the release of "The Corporation".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie seems to want to manipulate the gullible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its quite funny how many concepts are brought into this movie. From psychology of psychopaths to pricing everything to environmental recklessness to marketing manipulation. So many in fact that its impossible to properly explain to a layperson why some of these ideas might make sense in a single documentary. In fact this seems to be purposefully done to give a biased view of the world so as to create more radical nuts in the world. This review is mostly just a few things I specifically remember being misrepresented. If someone were to read some philosophy on moral dilemmas one would have an interesting framework with which to compare some of the points made in this film. Some of the famous moral dilemma's have to do with someone about to get run over by a train and the actor(you) have the option to save them by pulling a lever, which will kill someone else. There are then things that pile on top of this that I can't possibly explain in a review however the point is that most philosophers would agree that it would indeed be ideal if the person making these decisions were a cold calculating psychopath without much regard for human emotion, so just calling someone a psychopath is not an argument. It might indeed be best if the corporation looked only at profits, for instance if you have one good and two people, chances are by finding who is willing to pay more, you are also maximizing value for that good to society. There's a segment where they explain how a company studied how nagging affects sale and the documentary concluded that this is a horrible thing to do. Sure its terrible to manipulate children to nag more but the company did no such thing, it merely wanted to understand what is driving the demand for their products, maybe it can help them predict something in the future, nothing bad about that. There was a segment in which I thought the film would dig for interesting solutions when it started talking about externalities but it totally just used the concept to further manipulate the layman.There is such a thing as a positive externality and you can make the market have such a thing. For instance on pricing revolting transactions, watch Alvin Roth's Nobel prize speech, to see why putting a price on Kidneys could be a good thing. Its frustrating because the movie gives you some concepts unknown to the layman(except in its more intuitive form) yet fails to help him piece together how these things are combined into a wonderfully synergistic process. There was a short segment on how privatization is bad and public institutions are bad but ALL the MIT/Harvard economists/business people who talked in this movie would tell you that only under certain circumstances is making a good public a good idea, such as the fire brigade example. Its annoying because all this simultaneous cutting in interviews can lead you to think that credible people hold these opinions, because they were talking a few seconds earlier. I think its a good exercise to leave those who disagree to imagine industries which have thrived under privatization. There is honestly a lot of bad things going in the corporate world and some of the issues are mentioned here, maybe limited liability needs to be rethought, maybe patent law as well but advocating that people go out into the streets and "take action" without understanding the issues at hand is the reason why Democracy can fail. Micheal Moore is an idiot by any standard and sensationalism should not triumph over reason, having him be the role model of the story shows the ignorance of the maker of this film. I invite anyone who wants to know more about any of the issues raised to message me for studies/discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two gripes: 1. This movie was a little boring in parts and it was way too long. I fell asleep the first night and had to finish it the next.2. The great thing about corporations is that they are a very efficient way for large groups of people to provide capital to investment opportunities. Shareholders will fire management if they don't produce profits, so management must employ the capital in ways that will produce profits. The best way to make profits is to produce goods and services that people are willing to pay for. Thus, corporations are extremely adept at meeting the needs and wants of society. Getting rid of them or heavily regulating them will hurt society as a whole, and probably wouldn't do much for the non-shareholder stakeholders (environment, employees, etc) that this movie focused on. The movie didn't offer alternatives to the corporation that would be as effective at attracting and allocating capital according to our needs.The movie did raise some points that made me think about environmental issues. However, with 6 billion people on the earth, it is kind of inevitable that we will eventually use up all of our natural resources, regardless of whether we have corporations or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See this film before it is buried and forgotten. Allow it to inform and disturb you. Allow it to motivate you toward acknowledging the imminence of change. As this Populist Martini is served straight up with no twist, it might prove too strong for corporate fundamentalists and the logo addicted youth markets. If you are conservative this film will irk you, it suggests that our institutions of business are psychopathically flawed. If you are a liberal however, you will likely agree with the documentarians that human rights take precedence over The Bottom Line.We have forgotten that fact. Maybe we never learned it. Maybe we are learning it now.Resources are real. Human need and labor are real. Money is entirely imaginary. This is a film that dares to suggest that the pursuit of profit isn't worth pollution, or privation, or acceptable levels of toxicity.The Corporation is an informative, entertaining, and infuriating documentary.Now go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning of the movie almost made me turn it off right away. They used cheesy old film scenes to over-explain their point, which really only made them seem childish and didn't take things seriously.Once the introduction was over, it got a little more serious. However, they did seem to be very repetitive, and images of cute/dying animals, deformed animals, humans with birth defects and garbage trucks full of trash were used in order to turn the viewer's depressing thoughts into anger against corporations. It was a really cheap thing to do. It was also really sad because I believe many good points about corporate irresponsibility and greed can be made without using sad footage to lay it on so thick. It wasn't needed at all.On top of all this, the narrator's tone and voice sounds like someone from a cheesy drama movie where they describe an unstoppable pandemic virus spreading throughout the land.To sum it all up, the movie was alright, but they tried too hard to make the idea of a "corporation" sound evil and demonic. They poured it on so thick that it was hard to take it seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If corporations want the rights of people, then let's treat them like people. How about "three strikes you're out" for corporations? How about suspending the charter of corporations that willfully and knowingly damage our society -the people, the environment? This movie makes the case that these psychopaths should be locked up. The corporate entity has grown into a destructive monster. Yet, through massive marketing, funded with it's ill-gotten wealth, many people regard corporations as necessary engines of our economy and that their actions are at the very least inevitable and unchangeable.A little imagination -see www.parecon.org- and we could easily organize a society where corporations do not have such massive and destructive control.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to cheer this movie but wound up giving it a 7, not a 10. Yes, the enemy, Big Business, may deserve a good bashing due to its passionate pursuit of profit at the expense of the earth and all living things. BUT, while useful as a last resort, bashing may not necessarily result in better (kinder, gentler) business practices. Frankly, if I were a businessman and had to sit through this film, A) I would have walked out after twenty minutes B) I would have given its producers a one-fingered salute and a deaf ear. Did the violence at the Summit of Americas result in any business leaders offering petunias to the protesters? No, because maybe the best way to influence a smart, successful businessman is not to wave a picket sign like a hooligan, but to come across as smart and successful yourself, and speak his language.One of the most basic business laws is: minimize costs to maximize profits. Hence strip mining, clear cutting, sweat shops, and dumping sewage in the river. Immoral and dirty, yes, but also cheap, quick and easy. Being nice is nice and reaps a heavenly reward, but it's not as (earthly) profitable.Business leaders need to be SHOWN that it makes good business sense to be kind to the environment and to their fellow man. No, they frequently don't GET that, ugh. But gee guys, that's not their focus. Take time to understand your enemy a little more. Other comments about "The Corporation": - it runs a bit long, and there's little sense of building to a conclusion. It just ends. (Phew, coffee time.)- Michael Moore is featured a bit too prominently, and the fact that he has the last word makes it seem like it's his movie. On that point, I found "Bowling for Columbine" far more instructive and entertaining.- my pastor just gave a teaching about money before I saw this film. The Bible has much to say about pursuing wealth. Much of it warns us, hey! Remember! You're here today and gone tomorrow! Enjoy your money, but be generous to the poor, and keep things in perspective. Money doesn't last. Not even Solomon could buy his way to eternal life.- Canadians will know what I mean when I say it feels like the NDP has their fingerprints on this. It definitely appeals to the "Power to the People" crowd, which, as I've said, is also its shortcoming. - that stock trader guy, in his comments about September 11th, made me puke. I hope when he dies, people bring their laptops to his funeral and keep their cellphones ON. Hey, time is money, and I'm sure he'll understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Corporation 5/5Since Bowling for Columbine was nominated (and won) an Oscar, The Corporation should also get nominated. It's that good.The most unfortunate thing about this film is that your average person won't see a three hour documentary.This film will reinforce what activists of all types have saying for years about the environment, and the overall elevating of corporate interests above the rights of people. Those with a decidedly conservative point of view who don't have much interest in anything other than the value of their mutual funds should watch this film.Maybe The Corporation will eventually get broadcast on PBS or maybe the CBC. It's intelligent, occasionally funny (watch the scene where protesters end up sitting down for tea on the front lawn of the President of Royal Dutch Petroleum ? Shell, after ambushing the house with a surprise protest.)See it or buy it when it comes out on DVD. It's too good not to share with others.Review by Triniman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrelenting but brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>since no one has posted anything about this moive, I'll say a few words because I just saw this at the Toronto international Film fest. First of all this movie was really long, it was about 3hours, I could talk about it for hours and hours but I really dont feel like it now so i'll just say a bit. This is a lot like bowling for columbine, it starts of really fast, with awesome editing grabs your attention, then slows down a bit and goes into depth on an insanely wide array of aspects related to big corporations. Its like bowling for columbine because it has a good amount of Michael Moore in it, its extremely entertaining, but it's unlie bowling in the sense that its for smart people, there is no senseless bashing of the entity known as the corporation in this, they don't stretch the truth at all, and they dont "go after" anyone, especialy people that aren't responsible. This movie has a lot of interviews of authoriative people on the subject, such as: Mike Moore, Noam CHomsky, Noami Kline, and various presidents and CEO's of companies. Now this is a leftist documentary, but its only about 75% leftist, they do show the other side of the debate, and they do show the good bad guys. I definatley recommend it to anyone interested in environmental issues, media and advertising, the brand name, sweat shops, privatization, free trade, how we are killing of our own planet, products that harm us and we dont know it, basicaly it covers every perspective and every aspect of the corporations. I really hope this goes as mainstream as bowling did because it is far superior to bowling for columbine in many ways, and its just as funny in many moments. It was even funnier at the film fest because the makers of the movie made an introduction, and there was Q &amp; A after, and they poitned out the fact the film fest itself was sponsored by corporations but they still appreciate the support, and also they are looking for a distributor which is also funny because it points out the irony that even if we hate corporations and we are against everything they are for, we still rely on them for A LOT, we will never get rid of the corporation because society relies on it to heavily, it is our biggest social institute.10/10if it does come out on dvd, watch it in 2 parts because you will get a little restless but its still interesting, i found myself wiggling in my seat but listening to every brilliant word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naive look at the world, bordering on outright propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 'documentary' presents a naive and one-sided view of today's economic system. The film basically implies that most (if not all) of today's problems are the direct cause of big, evil corporations.Nobody can deny that the current global economic system does have its flaws. Managers, owners and employees of corporations commit crimes and fraud on a daily basis - as do people who are not associated with any corporation. But no respectable economist will argue that 'the corporation' is the root of all evil.The film does not address the logical implication of its anti-corporation message: What would be the alternative? Would the world be a better place without any corporations? Would the film makers prefer totalitarian governments that always make the appropriate decisions in the people's interest? Do they believe that everybody was better off in the Middle Ages? The film makers often proceed in a very manipulative manner: First, they show some actual or perceived problem. Immediately afterwards, they show a specific firm or some other piece of information. By doing so, they suggest a direct link or even causality between the two, without offering a proper argument or proof.Another blatant manipulation that occurs repeatedly is taking people's statements out of context and perverting the speakers' messages.This film is propaganda in its purest form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today bashing big business is increasingly appealing. Specifically, the mismanagement of government is blamed on multinational corporate takeovers. A case in point is the privatization of the water supply in Banzer Su?rez's authoritarian Bolivia presented as evidence of this argument in 2004's The Corporation, where Noam Chomsky compared the entity of the modern multinational corporation to the slaving enterprise of a former age.That Banzer's rule led to such a dire financial situation where, in order to appease foreign creditors and continue receiving World Bank loans, he was forced to concede and privatize Bolivia's national water supply in La Paz/El Alto in 1997, and then Cochabamba in 1999, is not mentioned. We are to interpret the 'water wars' that then took place in 2000 and 2005, respectively, as solely the result of Suez, and Biwater/Bechtel's inherent greed.In this documentary the much-maligned Export Processing Zones (EPZs) are also the subject of inflammatory rhetoric. Naomi Klein emphatically points to these largely tax-free areas in low-cost, labour-abundant cities around the globe in which large multinational corporations are enticed to operate, where "the workers rarely make enough to buy three meals a day let alone feed their local economy".If we consider basic economic trade theory, we know that, in the real world, national wage rates do, in fact, reflect differences in productivity. In 1975 South Korea was a low-wage-rate low-productivity country, where workers earned 5% of what they did in the US; by 2007 its productivity was around 50% that of the US and its wages had, accordingly, risen.Where, then, does the blame for the appalling living conditions of labourers in certain Central American and Southeast Asian countries lie? In the corruption of their governments, the weakness of their financial sectors, capital markets, judiciary ? in short: the inefficiency of their institutions. That poor people in rich countries should be subsidizing rich people in corrupt poor countries, to paraphrase the late Sir James Goldsmith, is not the result of the liberalization of trade. Rather, it is the fruit of systemic problems in less-developed societies.I would advise anyone who wishes to watch this documentary to do so with an open mind (i.e. remember that it is very skewed to a particular viewpoint). Because of that, and the fact that it doesn't really offer an objective analysis, I give it 5.</fullReview>

Was 145 minutes really necessary to be told something that we already knew - that corporations were evil and bad for everyone.After 90 minutes you kind've got the point - enough already. So I looked at my watch. Jesus, another hour of this sledgehammer-over-the-head pontificating!!! The monotonous commentary didn't exactly help my induced comatose state.Still it would be interesting to see if any opinions are changed by this. Really, mine have - I'm now a full-blown misanthropist when I was only a pessimist before. Not the response the filmmakers were perhaps seeking.That said, I do have my doubts over capitalism and corporations but I also have my doubts over government and people-power too but somehow this film saw only the positives in the latter which only your romantic delusional absolutely believes in, when after all, so-called people power can create tyrannies too (the early Soviet Union anyone). It also didn't tell me what I knew already. This film was strictly preaching to the converted. A quick read of any politics magazine or social science journal will tell you about the issues raised here. So we didn't really need the usual rent-a-quotes such as Chomsky, Michael Moore and NoLogos Klein expounding on their bar-room philosophies on corporatism.A good 30 minutes too long - I dread to think what the 165 minute version is like.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sound bites, but terribly biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a professor in a School of Management, and in preparation for a class this fall, I was looking for movie material to supplement my lectures. The first movie that I rented for this endeavor was "The Corporation." Essentially, this movie points out the corrupt inputs and detrimental results that result from corporations. The corrupt inputs include deceitful, opportunistic executives and manipulative marketers. The detrimental results covered include ethical issues like child labor and the 'patenting of life.' By the end of the movie, the uninformed viewer comes away thinking the corporation is completely despicable.What the movie fails to mention -- leaving it noncredible -- is that corporations exist to bring together funds that otherwise would not be available to invest in the development of products or services that improve our lives. It also fails to mention that corporate growth results from competition fundamental to the search for better products and services.If you already know why corporations are logically useful to our existence, and thus you're not apt to be manipulated by the movie's tedious message, this is a very good movie with some valuable material. However, if you don't know enough to appreciate the innovations that organizations like a Microsoft or a GE has brought to our world, then you're gonna be steered in a terrible direction by the message in this movie.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched 'The Corporation' and was quite entertained, henceforth my rating it a '2' instead of '1'. Essentially, the film goes on to show the true evil nature of the corporation and how it does nothing but harm our society. For me, the high point of the film was Michael Moore pointing out how suicidal corporation actually are by supporting his films to make money when he in fact is their biggest enemy. I found myself banging my head into the table saying, "But if there were no corporations, there would be no mechanism to distribute your films throughout the world!" And that's the entertaining part, this film really does advocate the dissolution of all corporations... and essentially replacing them with one behemoth government that tells you what to do at every turn. Henceforth the film's introducing us to a Californian town that introduces legislation to limit the number of corporate owned restaurants to seven. And if anyone thinks this film is 'balanced', as I've read in previous reviews, they have an agenda. This film made no mention of any good whatsoever that is a product of our corporations. No mention of technical or medical advances... no mention of the millions lifted out of poverty over the last 100 years... nada. This film was an intellectual joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival and was very disappointed. This should really be called "Corporate Greed for Dummies." Instead of being an incisive examination of the pros and cons of corporate culture and possible solutions to some of its ills, it spent most of its time airing old familiar WTO grievances against the corporate world with little new to say. - Disappointing for a 2hr 45 minute documentary.The film was short on new examples to illustrate its points. If Michael Moore can find interesting examples of corporate behaviour (some of which were used in this film) in a relatively short time, surely these film makers can find others in the 6 years that they've worked on the project. Instead, it concentrates on the much heard of third world sweatshop behaviours. An inordinate amount of time was also devoted to only one example of good corporate behaviour. Sadly, the example offered, Interface Carpeting, is not uncommon knowledge. While no corporation is perfect, surely, there are other examples.This film could have been about much more. It touches on some issues about corporate governance, but fails to continue down that path. It would be far richer focus on why corporations behave the way they do and to discuss the symbiosis between business and society. Big business has assumed a position of power in today's society because we have allowed it to do so. How can this power be regulated? What policies can be put into place to encourage good corporate citizenship? The film could also have examined in greater detail the effects of first world policies on the third world. Are there ways to change the thinking about the developing world and to help reduce the effects of the economics of exploitation? What about the complex relationship between much of society and big business? Like it or not, many of us are shareholders of large corporations through mutual, retirement, or educational funds and as shareholders, we hope that our investments are profitable.</fullReview>

If everyone turned against corporations (all are not bad), then we have no economic system. They serve a purpose and without them, you wouldn't have the luxuries you have. I say luxuries because we don't need it, but want it. That's what they do. Not only that, they employ us (for the most part). This movie makes it seem as though corporations should be boycotted as a whole, and that is wrong. This movie misrepresents a lot of things, but at the same time presents many useful things.I enjoyed the movie, except for the fact that it is way too biased for a documentary.

		<shortDescription>Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has a solid message about corporate greed albeit the mask of Canadian government propaganda was just too much. The film was very anti-United States, very pro-Canada. I was very disappointed with the constant bashing of the US government and undermining the United States' moral capacity, ESPECIALLY when compared to Canada. Sponsored by large greedy Canadian corporations just like the American-based ones demonized in the film. I'm a small business owner and it seems like most of the general population doesn't understand that the United States has literally the most regulations on business practices of any country in the world, so why is our government specifically under fire? The Federal Trade Commission is often blamed for OVER-REGULATING businesses in the US, so that's why we are outsourcing more than ever. Very disappointed considering the high public rating. It really makes me question the audience of these types of films. Given the rating, I can assume that you're all media puppets willing to believe whatever has melancholy back-music (and believe me, there's plenty in the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i *had* high hopes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i was dragged out of my bed for this film and frog marched down to the local cinema where i paid my money and i intended to enjoy a film, which i was convinced would be in the style of Bowling for Columbine ... 3 hours later after i had sat through the same point being rehashed and retold to me by various people i ran outside with a splitting headache i had such high hopes for this film, the film had its heart in the right place but the director obviously didn't cut his film enough.i really do want to say something good about this film, so i will - it made a good point - i just wish it had not made it about 7 times, i do honestly believe this film could have been better had it been scaled back - i realise there is a lot to bring to the attention of the viewers but not at the expense of alienating them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new or shocking here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess we can thank Michael Moore for reviving the documentary, but it's unfortunate that I was sucked into paying to see this film.Did you realize that a corporation's primary goal is to, above all else, make money? Did you know that corporations do cost-benefit analyses for everything, and make decisions solely based on the results of those analyses?Is there a problem with that? I own a small company, and, yes, we are in business to make money. If we weren't making money, we would shut down the business.The agenda of the film is to inform, and possibly shock, viewers about the deeds of "evil" corporations. It didn't win me over. There's nothing new or shocking here. Save your money, or, rather, use it to go see the interesting and revelatory "Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't expect a balanced view from this movie. It is a highly biased propaganda piece, although there is some counterpoint scattered throughout. Micheal Moore comments that corporations are only after profits. The narrator announces that the corporation is bound to place profits of the stockholder above the public good. Noam Chomsky, throws in his radically left ideas as frosting on this bitter cake. He paints with a broad brush that even though the people working in corporations may be moral, the institution of the corporation is inherently evil.The movie points out that a corporation will move into an impoverished country and are hailed as a hero for providing opportunities for workers. When the pay rises and the workers start making additional demands upon the company, the documentary states, the corporations leave those workers behind in search of more worker to exploit. There's no denying that there is some truth to that. The balanced point of view is that those exploited workers have had an improved standard of living as a result. It is clearly not up to the standard of living in the first world, but it is an improvement.The movie progresses by creating a psychological profile of a corporation as through it were a person. The premise being the corporation is an amoral or immoral person. They even interviewed an FBI employee that profiles psychopaths. If course, they only look at the negative aspects of corporations.I know one of the experts interviewed, although I won't mention his name because he is tort-happy. I know his motivations are less than honest. He is out to make a name for himself.I am the CEO of a corporation. I am also a life-long Democrat. I have a blog on political moderation that advocates, among other things, reasoned debates on things of importance to our culture. There is absolutely no doubt that there are corporations whose culture is oriented toward the exploitation of people. There are also corporations, like mine, who have a corporate culture toward providing a service to customers. I am well compensated for the service I provide, but I enhance the value of companies I serve and I can serve them with honesty and integrity. Corporations have served to enhance the standard of living for all Americans, although at times in unethical ways. I was looking for a balanced review of the value that corporations have brought as well as things that need to be changed so that pure greed and unethical behavior in some corporations can be held in check. There was an opportunity to present some legitimate concerns about the affect of corporations, both positive and negative, but the producers passed on that opportunity. Ironically, the "What Do We Need to Do?" Segment on the Q&amp;A bonus materials is a lot closer to the reasoned debate that I had hoped for in the movie.If you believe that corporations are inherently evil, this movie will be preaching to the choir. If you are looking for something other than propaganda, you will be disappointed by this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would normally be the perfect audience for this, but I'm sad to report that this film is heavy-handed and one-note. It's unfortunate that, in order to compete with the relentless, ubiquitous propagandistic noise of the right wing, liberal and left documentaries start taking on the same characteristics. Much the same happened to Oliver Stone circa JFK. The film covers very little ground others--including Michael Moore--have covered far better, and the scare tropes of bad propaganda are hammered at you, quite patronizingly &amp; laughably, throughout, the film's sole thesis being corporations are psychopaths. TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW! Sheesh. I give it a few points for occasional great clips from 50s educational films, because I'm a sucker for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for the ignorant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was just another piece of Moore propaganda. It fails to properly explain corporate structure, corporate governance, and even what a corporation actually is. In fact, it appears Moore lumps all corporations together and never distinguishes from publicly traded corporations and corporations such as Goodwill or private family corporations. There is no discussion of the Business Judgment Rule or even derivative suits. Moore's unsupported beliefs. I am trying to figure out how someone who invests so much money into publicly traded securities can make a movie that is directly in conflict with his behavior. When it comes down to it is lacks little educational value and is fairly boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mostly unenlightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen the terrific Fahrenheit 9-1-1, I was lookingforward to this film. Alas. "The Corporation" is not really a film; it'sa seemingly endless parade of monologue snippets with patheticgraphics in-between. In short, this is not a film. It reminds one ofmid-20th Century "educational" films, but is not nearly asinteresting. Ninety-five percent of this film is common knowledge(and if you don't know that corporations have taken over everything,then you are part of the reason why we have the evil governmentwe have). Five percent contained new information. Alas, this filmhad no editor worth his or her salt. It was dreary beyond belief andafter two hours, my friend (who reached the same conclusion as Idid, but totally separately, since we do not talk during movies)looked at me, we got up and made our escape. Michael Moorehas proved over and over that politics and information do not haveto be dull. He knows how to use images to make his point. Thisdocumentary-maker doesn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a load of socialist jargon! Boring, repetitive, mundane stuff that hardly justifies anything. It's all stuff you've heard before that will never be solved. I know that the corporate world is a greedy one, but this piece of propaganda brings flawed logic and tame ideologies.There is a woman honestly thinks that kids nagging parents for TOYS is a tool that corporations use to sell more products. When I was 5 I had no idea what Tyco was! What the heck was Bandai. "I never wanted to play with my toys, I just wanted to frame the shiny logos on my wall above my Ikea made bed right next to my Sony CD player". I believe kids are born with something called "want". She obviously never had kids in her boring life. And if she did, they probably spent their childhood as drooling unsociable moronic drones that are afraid of change.There were some good ideas, but no one will listen to the smart folk, they'll just complain and protest and do it the hard way....which won't solve anything. Quit protesting, get a life, get a job and make enough money to help out in the fight for freedom. Like they say complaining gets you nowhere.As for IBM. Ah, it's 1933 and the Nazis are booming for business. Why doesn't IBM form a partnership? It'll help...Oh no! It's 1939 and the Nazis are murdering multitudes of people! Damn you IBM! Damn you all to HELL! &lt;---Just proving something. (I write this so Fox or whatever company that produced Planet Of the Apes won't send an assassin or a blond, slick "spy" after me.They don't enjoy the marketing aspect of the media for TV, films and such... On the box for this movie it says: "Will do for documentaries what Jaws did for sharks" Contradiction? Hmmmm, maybe I'll buy this movie now...it obviously MUST be good, being that it is compared to Hollywood smashes like Jaws.This movie tries to convert the corporate robots into anti-corporate ones. bleep blip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>their naivety is so poor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These people are so naive to believe that corporations are evil and that nationalizing everything is good.in North Korea, USSR, the Warsaw pact and China, everything was state property, were they utopias? Not by a longshot. In fact, the most deaths in the 20th century were caused by communism and the worst famines were in communist countries alongside the killing fields in Cambodia, persecution of the religious, the gulags among other things.As for the makers of the documentary. i would leave them a choice: where would you want to live? North Korea (communist, no corporations) or South Korea(corporations, freedoms etc.)?</fullReview>
