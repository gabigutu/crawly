		<shortDescription>One of the most successful movies of all time (and I'm not talking about the Box Office take)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 &amp; 2. I don't even mind the "prequel" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly "sell out," he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most "princess" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi "storm troopers." While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it. But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that changed the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star wars made epic fantasy real. For a generation of people it has defined what the cinema experience is meant to be. Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say about this movie this is *THE* movie that changed it all.It's my favourite movie, and not only among the quadrilogy, among all movies; it has everything that can be great in a movie, great characters, great story, great sights, great special effects (they don't show 23 years) and a mythological background that made us dream for decades now, and that'll keep us dreaming for a long, long time. Maybe the characters I liked most in this one are Old Obi-Wan Kenobi, wonderfully portrayed by Alec Guinness, and Han Solo, Harrison Ford's first important role, they're both great.Not to mention John Williams' wonderful score, without of it, the movie wouldn't have been this great it's a perfect mix, that's what it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where It All Began-----10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kid's fantasy. An Adult's memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In respect to the many kids of the seventies. I rated this movie as one of the greatest movies ever made. I was thirteen and enjoyed this fantasy getaway more than I could count. Like many other kids of the seventies you left reality before walking into the theatre and escaped into the adventure once the reels begin rolling. It provided the special effects and excitement a kid was looking for. Even today when I watch this movie on VHS I recall those times. Whenever I get the chance to watch it I feel like that eager thirteen year old over and over again. I hope the new movies will meet the same expectations of kids of this decade and the next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, "Droids" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could this BE any better? (Har. Har.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you ask casual movie fans (read: any of my friends) what their favorite movie is, you might get an answer like this: "Uh..I dunno...Jurassic Park 2 was cooler than the first... but Gladiator had people getting their heads cut off... and Scary Movie rocked, man... that movie is so funny." So what the hell do they mean? Well, beats me. Not too long ago, we were having a "philosophical" conversation about movies, when the subject came to Star Wars and the quels. (Pre and se.) We were arguing which one was the best. One of my friends said, "Well, I gotta admit, the first one is a classic, but the prequel has its moments." I swear a tear came to my eye. I never thought I'd have this kind of conversation with one of my friends.My point here is that Star Wars is a classic even to people who don't know Casablanca from Scooby Doo. It has everything you could possibly want: action, romance, midgets, cool creatures, quotable dialogue, midgets in bear suits, a great score and many more midgets. (Seriously, though, I don't mind midgets.) All this in a non-violent, non-racy, perfect-for-your-wee-ones package.For those of you who haven't seen this movie (yes, all 20 of you. I'm watching you.) I'll describe the plot. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a young man who lives with his uncle and aunt on a desert planet. See. Luke's parents are dead. One day, as Luke is... outside, something crashes and he checks it out. It turns out there were two robots in there, namely C-3P0 and R2-D2. They have a message to give to some guy named Obi-Wan Kenobi (which turns out to be Alec Guiness!) from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). Luke goes off to find old Ben, who lives close to his uncle. Old Ben gives Luke a long story about how his father was a Jedi and he will be one too, etc. When they come back, Luke's uncle and aunt are dead and now, he's not safe. So Luke and Ben and the robots head to Nar Shadaa, a hole, basically. There they meet up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his big, uh, ape-like thing called a Wookie.There's a lot more plot to this movie, and I would pass the limit of 1000 word before I could explain it all. The fact of the matter is, there'S a lot of backstory to this movie. There's probably more backstory to this movie than there is to your LIFE. (Don't feel bad...) I used to be a fanatic. I used to know everything there was to know about Star Wars. And you will notice that I didn't start my review by saying I was blah blah blah in 1977. Why is that? Because, I wasn't at all in 1977. I saw every movie in its special edition form, in 1997. I had seen the movies on TV before, but they never held my attention. Until they were re-released. Just type in Star Wars in a search engine. You'll see that this movie has a rabid following and a detailed history to boot.The acting here is not what's important. It's about on the same level as old adventure films of the 30's and 40's except for a few notable exceptions (Guiness, Ford and a few supporting actors). What makes this movie exceptional is the whole spectacle that unfolds. This is never boring, rarely violent and always a treat to watch. All the creatures, all the characters, all the action scenes, all of this movie is basically perfect. People criticize it as being a kids' movie, as being just stupid mindless action. Well, you guys are right. But that's what this movie was set out to be, that's what it is and that's why I like it.Lucas borrowed from Kurosawa and Ford to make this movie, and consequently, many have borrowed from his work. This movie deserves to be borrowed from. It shaped American cinema, it shaped the way people think about "action-adventure" movies, it spawned dozens of books, two sequels, one prequel, two TV movies, comic books, action figures and legions of fans. If you haven't already seen this... Well ,you probably haven't seen much anyway, so rent this. If you have seen this, watch it again. I think I will. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though now known as "Episode IV-A New Hope," for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first "Star Wars." We will always think of it as just "Star Wars" - plain &amp; simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO &amp; R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. "Forbidden Planet" from 1956 came close, and then there were the "Star Trek" and "Lost in Space" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel "The Empire Strikes Back" is superior - I must disagree).The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began &amp; ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is a movie that has had great social impact, a fact that has often gone unnoticed. A harbinger of a changing mood within the United States, Star Wars was one of the few movies rated General that was released in 1977. Where movies had for a decade been depicting ever more dark topics (Taxi Driver, The Exorcist) Star Wars was a lighthearted adventure. While some may decry the move back to swashbuckling from social comment, I for one celebrate the fact that Star Wars made it possible for families to go to movies together once again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The masterpiece, the legend that made people, like myself stand in line for two hours at ten at night for the midnight show. People coming out of the theater were telling us,"You will not be sorry, it was fantastic, you will not believe it." The first shot of the star destroyer coming across the face of Tatooine provoked loud gasps of awe from the audience. My big brother looked over at me and said," I told you." In 1977, this was not a movie; this was a cultural event that enveloped the entire country. In our city, only the Westgate with its 1100 seat cinema had the honor of showing the movie. They had showings starting from 11 AM to Midnight. Whenever you drove by, there were lines out to the street. The movie, after a thunderous opening, takes the time to develop the main character Luke. The scene of him looking longingly at the two suns with William's music captured the quintessence of youth; the wish to go out there and accomplish something blended with anxiety that time was passing us by. What a scene!! It captured Luke's restlessness that spoke to all the young people in the audience. This is the greatness of the work; the development of Luke. Notice, unlike Guardians Of The Galaxy we do not simply jump into mindless action: Lucas took the time to make us get to know and care about Luke. It gives it its depth.Even Solo is drawn with greater depth than modern movies. We get Greedo trying to shake him down, his open contempt for Obi Wan and his patronizing "Kid" addressed to Luke derisively. We cannot see Chewie's expression but even his grunts sound like they are laughing at Luke also. Lucas knew where he was going with Luke and he purposely draws him as a pathetic, ingenuous, bumbling dolt at the first. Contrast to his entrance in Jedi, look how far the characterization has come. This is the core of why this trilogy worked and the prequel did not. In the prequels, there simply is not characterization. The cast here will not win any acting awards, besides Guiness, but there is development of characters. This is the point of Luke's humiliation at the Cantina with Kenobi forced to bail his dumb butt out. Lucas wants us to see his development. Even at the end of the movie, Kenobi fires those torpedoes not Luke, he tells Luke to just turn off the computer and use the Force. This, by the way, is what Kenobi meant by,"You can't win Darth, if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."While I prefer Empire, this has the best ending of any movie in the history of film. The audiences I was in, people stood and cheered for five minutes when this ended. The timing, the surprise of Solo's intervention, the explosion and the victorious procession: what great writing. It ends with a thunderous crescendo of victory that will lift even the most jaded, world weary person to their feet. It has been forty years now; I still love the movie as much now as I did as that little boy staring up in awe at the screen. We all wanted to be Luke; his nobility was a model to my generation and it molded me into the protector of my family for twenty years. Never underestimate the power of the modeling of good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is the God of all movies. It is the greatest film to have ever been made, bar none. Nothing can be compared to it, nor should it be. It is definitive to our world, our society. It changed the way movies were made: for the better.In the 1970s, there was little unknown director named George Lucas. Little did he know (dispite a nightmarish shoot), that his galactic space opera would literally change the way people lived, worked, played and thought. The secret behind his success? His imagination.The script, the characters, the events, the locations, the humour, the opening, the ending... all perfect. Of course, it's not the most well-shot movie of all time, but there's no denying that nobody actually cares. Star Wars has become a cult and a religion, and earned it's place in my heart as the greatest film to have ever been made......Millions will agree.Whatever I say cannot reach the real truth behind Star Wars: just watch it and you'll know exactly what I mean.The force will be with us, always.Overall: A definitive masterpiece. Will never be forgotten, and will remain in the hearts of young and old for generations. Perfect. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film that opened new doors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a shame that not any other of George Lucas's films were as fun and inspiring as his unforgettable epic "Star Wars: A New Hope". It was a film that has since been spoofed and ripped-off in many forms of media. It has five sequels, and has many branch-off television series. And it is undeniably one of the most financially successful and definitely one of the better science-fiction films of this or any other age."Star Wars" has one of the most brilliantly constructed and detailed alternative reality settings ever. Literally everything in it makes the "galaxy" seem like a real place. Not only is there civilizations of humans, but civilizations of other creatures, and there are livestock and other creatures like in our world. Names such as droids, banthas, and wookiees work out. But I do feel that the "sandpeople" could've had a more compelling name. The concept of blasters and lightsabers were pure genius and the effects used on these weapons were state-of-the-art for their time. The props and CGI used for the other creatures, such as Chewbacca, may not be acceptable if "Star Wars" came out today, but were great for back then. Costume design was magnificent, especially the great details put into the villainous character of Darth Vader, who is perhaps the most memorable movie villain ever. Although he wouldn't really make his terror so profound and complete until the first sequel "The Empire Strikes Back." The concept of the Death Star is also a fine one.But while "Star Wars" most certainly looks great in terms of detail and special effects, and even moreso on the entertainment level, there are some details that I have a really hard time accepting. Mostly, it's concerned with the screenplay. George Lucas is truly a great screenwriter when it comes to developing story, but when it comes to dialogue, he's not the best there is. Some of the dialogue in the film, mostly the lines spoken by Princess Leia, make me wince. For example her quote "I should have known it was you holding Vader's lease. I smelled your foul stench when I was brought onboard." What sensible person would even think of saying a line that dumb? I also personally felt that Luke Skywalker asked WAY too many questions and too many times. In the Tatooine part of the movie, he asks "Do you know what he's talking about?" numerous times, more than necessary. And all of the lines featuring the word "sandpeople" just seemed weakening to the script. The "sandpeople" were suppose to sound frightening, but they just sound pathetic.Basically, the one and only thing that I have wrong with "Star Wars" is its dialogue sequences. And that is because George Lucas's weakness at writing is dialogue, which he freely admits to. But that does not make "Star Wars" a bad movie. Perhaps I was disappointed with it, but it's still a great movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie that changed the way we make and look at movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been by far the greatest movie of all time. The special effects are very fantastic especially when the movie was made before I was even born, even Return of the Jedi was made 7 years before I was born, or should I say it was completed 7 years before I was born. It's like George Lucas who's the Director for all the Star Wars movies including Episode III- Revenge of the Sith, it's like he went back in time a long time ago and he traveled to a galaxy far, far away. I must say George Lucas, I am very impressed. This probably did all happen a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. I just can't believe it, I mean how did he do it, this film is just ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. George Lucas can make any kind of movie he wants. He can even make a movie about what happens far before Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace and he can even make a movie about what happens far after Star Wars Episode VI- Return of the Jedi. So George Lucas I have been a huge fan of Star Wars since I saw Episode IV when I was 5 and I'll be honest, I didn't really understand the storyline because I was only 5. But I was just amazed on the Special Effects, it was incredible for it's time, 1977. And when I turned 7 my mother bought the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition and it was even better with all new Advanced Digital Technology and I started to understand the storyline a lot better. And when I turned 14 I bought the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and it got much better with one of the best pictures I have ever seen in a movie. But the Number 1 thing I hated about the DVD was that in Return of the Jedi at the very end of the movie you see the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker. I hated the fact that in the DVD you replaced Anakin Skywalker's ghost with the Anakin Skywalker from Episode II and Episode III. You shouldn't have done that George. It's great you re-modified the Trilogy and all with new technology but don't destroy the plot, because not even Luke Skywalker is going to have no idea who that person is, and you didn't make Obi-Wan Kenobi look like Ewan McGregor so I don't see why you did that. George try to re-modify Return of the Jedi that way it was before, the face that Luke Skywalker saw him as when he took off that black mask and helmet that Anakin Skywalker needs to live. Alright. That's all I have to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars: The iconic world changer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is now 36 years after this movie hit theaters, but it is not too late to write a review! This movie will and already is in the history books as the movie that changed the world! Star Wars, created by George Lucas, is the most iconic, awesome, epic and action-packed space opera ever made. This movie contains everything you want to see in a movie, for example: action, adventure, mystery, humor, emotion and, above all, creativity. The great visual and imaginative mind of George Lucas made it possible for other filmmakers to get from realistic movies to a generation of movies containing imagination and fantasy. The beginning of the movie is so perfectly written and makes it almost impossible for people not to like it. Firstly, the title scrawl. Although this scrawl was the same as the Flash Gordon series, in Star Wars this iconic and epic beginning was made great by the extraordinary music by John Williams. The music he composed made this movie what it is today and what it was then. His epic score for this movie was deservedly rewarded with an Academy Award. This great creation by George Lucas has influenced me, the American population and the rest of the world completely!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The opening installment of the greatest trilogy in cinematic history...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly a landmark film. When it came out, there had never been anything like it before, and it truly caused quite a stir. I would contend that it is not as good as its sequel, Empire Strikes Back; but it is still a great movie. There is humor, action, and some heartfelt moments. It is also our introduction to some great characters that people will never forget - Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi...and of course everyone's favorite villain, Darth Vader. Alec Guinness really is outstanding in this movie. His role as Luke's first mentor is understated and believable...his somewhat tired attitude in retrospect seems very understandable after watching the prequels - after all he's been through, it is very believable when he tells Luke, "I'm getting to old for this sort of thing." The visual effects are not only groundbreaking, but they still hold up very well even in this CGI-effects laden era. I would contend that ILM's use of modeling and lighting in the old films actually lends a more believable look to the action scenes than the prequels' use of video-game style battles and sensory overload. There is great chemistry between the actor's - and while Luke is a bit annoying, the back and forth of Han and Chewbacca, and C-3PO and R2-D2, as well as Leia's chemistry with Han and Luke, make this movie extremely entertaining on an emotional level - it also makes you care about the characters. Let us compare the lightsaber duel of this movie with that from Phantom Menace. Although the acrobatics and sheer fury of the duel just are not there in A New Hope, we actually feel something when Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down. Conversely, when Qui-Gon Jinn is slain, there is not the same (if any) feeling after it is done. Well, I'm rambling now. But this movie has it all. Space battles, lightsaber duels (a la Samurai flicks), chase sequences, thinly veiled references to the Western genre in the Canteen on Tatooine. A Truly great adventure that, as it ended, was really just beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Excess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very first note of John Williams's horn-blaring score as the film's title in thousand-foot-high block letters flashes on screen is the very moment when American film-making turned inexorably to big-budget, grand-themed audiovisual extravaganza strung together with simple stories, snappy catchphrases &amp; cutesy jokes. But if George Lucas decided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby Cobra &amp; left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he himself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa, the Western-themed "Hidden Fortress," with one scene (the fight in the bar) lifted from "Yojimbo." As a result, "Star Wars" has a bit of the jittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't quite made for them, like people with past life experiences that intrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but THREE heroes in "Star Wars" (four if you include the princess, who has a more prominent role in "Star Wars"). Hamill's Luke is often overshadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any fine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a star), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined farmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, "Star Wars" sets the standard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry was bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest, toylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in "Space: 1999" in favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping movement culminating in explosions of bright color &amp; blaring sound. No wonder there's never any sex. "Star Wars" is science fiction only because it's set in outer space, by which standard "Dirty Harry" is a detective story &amp; "Last Tango in Paris" a romance. Little attempt is made to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out why light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory explanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be counted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the Millennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed time. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a smuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or engineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded excess works because it never lets up &amp; never goes for the cheap &amp; easy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, "Star Wars" creates an array of badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema, headed by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in "Star Wars" is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin (Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded phrases long &amp; gleefully repeated by a delighted America ("This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!" "This bickering is pointless!" "I find your lack of faith disturbing"). Perhaps, with the space program petering out &amp; the hard realities of nuclear energy coming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was wearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of "Star Trek" to bring the writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard &amp; aluminum foil. Never again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be to "Star Wars" than that the "Star Trek" movies of the 1980s followed the simple themes, cuteness &amp; spectacular effects of "Star Wars," turning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps that first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed it "Star Wars" so convincingly that the original name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with its holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!) which likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto &amp; which became more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the sequels &amp; prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the Code of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke &amp; Kenobi. "Star Wars" can't really be judged by the standards of other films, partly because it reset the standards &amp; partly because it became, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no doubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the viewer at once exhausted &amp; exhilarated--and will do it over &amp; over again, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard. If you just want to escape to a galaxy far, far away, jettison all skepticism, lower your shields &amp; prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the latest and last Star Wars (Episode 3), I wondered if the first was as good as I remembered it, or had I just gotten tired of all things Star Wars. Tonight we watched the DVD of the first one (The New Hope or Episode 4, as its now called). What a contrast! Real people, real feelings and emotions, humor, adventure, The Cantina Bar, Luke getting in touch with the Force within, Han Solo's sarcasm, Obiwan's wisdom...Alec Guiness brings a depth to the role lacking in the recent movies....but then again, all of these elements seem lacking in the recent movies. The first one is still a gem! Lucas should have stopped here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the attack of the Empire's forces under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) to her spacecraft, the rebel Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) hides in the memory of R2-D2 the plans of the powerful Empire's Station Death Star that spies from the Rebel Alliance have stolen. She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels. Obi-Wan feels the impact in the Force and when the Millennium Falcon arrives at the destination, the group finds only debris. Further, a tractor beam pulls the spacecraft to the Death Star. What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?"Star Wars", later retitled "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" is the unforgettable and charming sci-fi adventure that surprised the world in 1977. The strategy of George Lucas that claimed that there was no technology available to the cinema industry in 1977 to produce the three first chapters was part of a marketing strategy that kept alive the interest of fans fro the whole six chapters, In sequence, great part of the mystery would not have raised. All the films are engaging, but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Star Wars: Episódio IV ? Uma Nova Esperança" (Blu-Ray) ("Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another experience I delayed far, far too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas' Star Wars is a project unlike one I've seen before, as cliché and as empty as that statement might sound. It's a monumental achievement in the cinematic world, arguably the biggest one ever, that pioneered special effects work and accommodated for other science-fiction projects to follow in the next decades. When released in 1977, with sufficient hype and outstanding reviews, it was a movie-going experience; thousands of showings were sold out (something you never hear about anymore), universal audiences were captivated, cultists and enthusiasts were born, and the eye-popping technology was cherished and admired by many.Watching Star Wars today (now called Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope with the release of the three prequels), there is still a uniquely affecting vibe that it sends with its compelling visuals and wonderfully articulated characters. It's over thirty years old, but it effectively holds the torch that makes it timeless. No matter how far technology progresses, and even with the onset of computer-animation and a heavy reliance on digital cinema, the look and beauty of Star Wars will likely never die out.Since it appears that everyone has seen the Star Wars movies except for myself, I will spare you the boredom of hearing the plot reiterated for the umpteenth time. Besides, I'm not sure if I could explain it accurately. The film is fast-paced, dynamic, and just works so competently, that after a while, I began to dissolve any questions I had about the plot and just go along for the ride. Consistent readers know what I think of constant cinematic evaluations, and that I find them to often be without a reward and potentially lethal to the likability of a film. Things happen in Star Wars; crazy things, logical things, smart things, frightening things, but above all, enthralling things.Speaking of enthralling things, I must admit how often I felt tension build and suspense become prevalent during the course of this film. For one thing, it's blatantly obvious to people who haven't even seen the series that these characters will make it (hence the two sequels). Yet, during several sequences, I found myself tense and extremely worried for these characters (most notably the scene in the trash chute). When a film can make you fear when you know the outcome is when you know true filmmaking tactics are at hand.Something I have notice happen with older science-fiction films is that one of their downsides is their length due to their special effects showcase. Let me explain; Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a visual marvel when it first came out, but its story was extended out about twenty-five minutes longer than it needed to be because they were showcasing the technology, which was breathtaking at the time. It appears, too, that many fans even recall this fact with a bit of sourness, which is why when people refer to the "original trilogy" of the Star Trek films, they usually mean the second film through the fourth one. Star Wars doesn't bear that same quality; it doesn't need to turn the story into a methodical plod just to show off its creative design and visuals. It doesn't feel like a showcase. We get a perfect feel for the environment without having to stare at for an upwards of five minutes.One thing that disheartens me greatly about this series is how controversial it has become. With numerous releases on DVD, and a new one on Blu-Ray, to my knowledge, the only original cuts of the Star Wars films you can see are on the Laserdisc/VHS versions. Because of this, fans have found themselves lambasting decisions made by Lucas, criticizing all the changes he has made to the series on the new releases of the DVDs, his re-releases of the movies in theaters, and lucrative branding/licensing of the figures in the money that, in 2013, continue to flood the store aisles of a Wal-Mart and Toys-R-Us near you. I believe that's one of the contributing reasons to why I never saw or even felt like seeing the original films until now; I felt alienated and bullied, with the series seemingly shoving itself down my throat.On a final note, another impressive element is the charisma and talent of a young Mark Hamill, portraying no one else but Luke Skywalker. Hamill seems like the kind of guy who, after breaking out in Lucas' trilogy of films, would have gone on to do unprecedented projects, but alas, no. Hamill has only acted in either small roles or cameos in films, and hasn't really worked on any other mainstream picture aside from the Star Wars trilogy. While this fact is slightly depressing, as one can only imagine what he could've done, it's fortunate we weren't burdened of seeing him in anything atrocious.Star Wars is, in short, an incorruptible masterpiece on film. A film that launched the genre of science fiction, propelling films about outer space to unheard of heights. It's just incredibly unfortunate to see what dismal treatment it, and its fans, have had to endure since its release.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Directed by: George Lucas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply The Best Of It's Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since its release way back in 1977, George Lucas' epic masterpiece "Star Wars" has gone on to become quite possibly the most popular franchise in motion picture history, with one of the biggest fan followings imaginable. But no matter how much money this franchise makes, or how many people see it, no matter how many sequels or prequels or re-releases or remasters it endures, the original classic still remains to be a very personal film. Despite the success it has undergone since its release, the production of "Star Wars" was a highly troubled one, many people expecting it to not even get completed at all. The hard work and dedication that Lucas and his cast and crew went through to get this thing made definitely shows through, and that makes the movie all the more endearing to watch. Quite simply, it's an incredible achievement in movie-making.Now, these films have been discussed to death, but I feel like I'd like to give my own two cents on the subject, and my thoughts could easily be summed up in five words: "Star Wars" is absolutely amazing. Everything about it, from the acting, the effects, the story, the mythos, the music, the incredible intrigue that has keep this series alive for so long, it all started here, and it's great. I don't feel like I need to go too in-depth with a plot summary, because this is one of the most iconic films in history, but basically, "Star Wars" follows a simple farm boy living on a desert planet named Luke Skywalker, who yearns to fight with the Rebel Alliance against the evil Galactic Empire. Before he knows it, he's thrust into an intergalactic adventure, along with an inventive cast of characters, as he tries to help rescue a princess and destroy the Empire's newest weapon: a space station with the power to destroy planets, called the Death Star.As I said, this movie is awesome. The acting is fantastic all around, each one giving a perfect performance in these incredibly iconic, and unforgettable roles. The inventive special effects are some of the best of their time, and the action sequences are gripping and fantastic, never allowing a dull moment to come through. The story is incredibly fascinating, managing to blend science fiction through the space travel, droids, and aliens, with fantasy through the mystical Force, a defining trait of the Jedi Knights. The intrigue levels are really high here, and it's that intriguing quality that allows viewers to really get invested and really talk in depth about this movie.This film defined a generation. To this day, people still talk about it, and I doubt that it will ever stop being discussed. "Star Wars" is one of the best sci-fi fantasy epics ever made, and will always be a binding Force of cinema for the rest of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This will be a day long remembered - a review 33 years in the making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker encounters two eccentric droids, gets attacked by sand people and is then saved by an old wizard by the name of Ben Kenobi. After a brief chat the farm boy discovers that Ben and Luke's father used to protect the universe as Jedi Knights until his father was killed by the evil Darth Vader. After his aunt and uncle are killed Luke realises his destiny has been chosen for him and he and Ben are going to have to take on the empire, and from this point movie history will never be the same again.Much has been said about this movie and it almost feels redundant to discuss it, but, as it was the first film I saw at the pictures I feel almost duty bound to add my two penneth to the mix and so I will. This film was groundbreaking in terms of effects, but what we have learnt since Star Wars is that all the good effects in the world can't save a poor movie. The thing that makes this movie as damned good as it is, is the mixture of urgent direction, wonderful performances, a damned good script, that often gets blasted as being terrible, (If it was the film would also be terrible ...it isn't, ergo sum ...), a pioneering use of sound effects that really reinforce the more alien characters with a real sense of emotion (specifically Chewbacca and R2-D2) but of course the last big star of the movie is John Williams sweeping epic score, which even today is probably one of the greatest pieces of movie music ever.These days I understand why a film like "Casablanca" and "Citizen Kane" cannot be appreciated by a modern audience because they are so hailed for their enormity on their first appearance that it often cannot be re-experienced by viewers after that. The first time we watch Star Wars we don't actually know that there is anything but Jawas on Tatooine, or that Obi-Wan Kenobi (That wizard's just a crazy old man) is a secret bad-@ss or that Han Solo, good for nothing mercenary, is seen right through by Jedi Knight Ben Kenobi. We who experienced it the first time will always feel it again, but the modern audience, who know so much about the film, cannot.The film is full of classic moments, from Ben Kenobi's reveal, R2-D2's fall, Luke switching off his targeting computer, Han's constant irreverent humour, Ben's "that's no moon", and a dozen more, but even after all these years my favourite moment is that knowing look that Ben gives Luke at the end of his duel with Vader. His wry smile and the blend of music and performance by both Hamill and Guiness is sensational and still gives me goose bumps now. Amazing.Since then the impact of the original three may have been watered down by the prequels, but as much as you can't polish a turd, you also cannot dim the brightest star. Which is why the term "May the force be with you" will always mean so much to so many.</fullReview>

Star Wars is so perfectly molded together filled with pieces all so crucial yet all so wonderful,John William's A+++ score, or James Earl Jones' powerful voice.Really George Lucas' picture should be put next to the word Lucky in the dictionary.He had such a bizarre concept,and people had doubts.I mean if he was pitching Star Wars to me I would too.Yet this is the Little Movie that Could so to say.The acting is A+,my personal favorite performance is Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi.People would argue about Geogre Lucas not being a great director after the infamous Prequels,that's a load of B.S.Lucas pours his imagination on the screen and the audience is captivated.We have to give a standing ovation to ILM which started in the 70's with Star Wars.The movie is still amazing to look at nearly 30 years later and with C.G.I in the movie making mix.The plot sounds bizarre on paper but it works wonders on screen and flows quickly,I don't believe I have ever checked my watch while watching Star Wars.I have to applaud Mr.Lucas,Star Wars has fueled the imaginations of many and will continue to fuel generations to come.One moment can describe the impact of the whole Star Wars experience/impact for me,the scene where Luke looks into the setting suns accompanied by William's brilliant score.It's a very moving scene.I really think it tells you to look out for more in your life to become something so to say.Star Wars can only be surpassed by it's sequel Empire Strikes Back but looking back at both I think they are even.Empire Stikes Back and Star Wars are in my opinion the best movies ever made10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic story with a perfect cast, memorable score and dazzling special effects. Movies don't get any better than this. More space opera than true sci-fi, Star Wars takes you on a magical ride through a galaxy far, far away.The first moment of genius comes right at the very start with a written crawl which gives a basic plot outline and without which all that immediately followed would be hard to place in context. After John Williams' now legendary opening theme we are thrust into the first of many thrilling space battles to come. Almost immediately we are introduced to one of the great movie villains of all time, Darth Vader who is voiced with true menace by James Earl Jones, and it becomes clear that this film is not quite like anything we have seen before.Star Wars may seem to be your typical good versus evil swashbuckling adventure but there's a lot more going on here. The hero, Luke Skywalker, is your typical simple, clean-cut farm boy who will soon be thrust into the middle of a galactic war of as grand a scale as could be imagined. But he is not our only hero. Princess Leia, a leader of the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire, is certainly not your typical helpless fairy-tale princess. She gives as good as she gets. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the older, wiser more seasoned hero and the mentor young Luke will desperately need. Han Solo is a space pirate in it only for the money, not for any revolution. Solo's first mate aboard his ship, the Milennium Falcon, is Chewbacca, a giant Wookiee who is remarkably adept at space flight for a creature which resembles a hairy two-legged dog. Also along for the ride to help our heroes are the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 who provide not only critical help for our heroes but some comic relief for the audience.The performances in Star Wars are all first-rate. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker plays the young, naive Skywalker very well and Hamill grows right along with the character throughout the film. Carrie Fisher brings the appropriate smarts, skills, sophistication and determination to Princess Leia. Without Fisher's quality performance it might be hard to believe that this young woman could play such a pivotal role in a rebellion of this magnitude. Alec Guinness is reliably brilliant as old Jedi master Kenobi. He is mysterious, quiet and reserved yet very strong indeed. Stealing the show is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It seems Ford gets all the best lines and he makes the most of them. Luke Skywalker may be the nominal hero of the film but it is Ford as Solo from which Star Wars gets most of its personality.George Lucas has crafted a true masterpiece here. The classic struggle of the underdog against the evil oppressor takes on many new twists here. The mysterious Force, the foreboding and menacing Darth Vader, alien creatures of all imaginable shapes and sizes, the epic nature of a battle which rages across an entire galaxy...in the end it all comes together to form something unique and truly wonderful. With action and adventure on a grand scale, fascinating characters on both sides of the fight, special effects that were revolutionary for the time and an ever-building sense of drama and excitement Star Wars is an absolute triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beginning of a Wonderful Trilogy of Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the only way to begin this review is to mention when I saw "Star Wars" for the very first time. I was merely a baby, from what I recall my parents telling me before their divorce. I wasn't even born when this first feature film hit theatres. I'm nineteen now, but I must admit that "Star Wars" was one of the many things that decorated my childhood. I always adored it, and always looked-up to Luke Skywalker. It was the type of view I can only assume all boys had; we all wanted to be a Luke Skywalker. We wanted to be the cool hero with a lightsaber. In this review, I will do my very best not to give you a biased review. However, forgive me, for I have always been a "Star Wars" fanatic. This was my first re-viewing in quite a while, so at least I'm reviewing the film with a clear set of eyes.When two droids, C3-PO and R2-D2, escape the clutches of a shoot-out on a spaceship, they land on a desert-covered landscape, only to find themselves captured as slaves. They are reunited among the slavetraders, called Jawas. The Empire realizes that Princess Leia Organa had sent a message along with one of the droids who managed to escape the attack, so they begin to hunt for R2-D2 and C3-PO. Little does the Empire know that a young man, Luke Skywalker, and his uncle, Owen, had just purchased the two droids from the Jawas. While cleaning the two droids up, Luke stumbles upon the message Princess Leia had left for an "Obi-Wan Kenobi". Luke considers "Obi-Wan" a possible relative of a man named Ben Kenobi and goes on the look for him. For now, I will end my synopsis for the fact that I just described the first half-hour of the film. I want there to be more for you. All you need to know is that Luke is taken on a journey that changes his entire life and purpose, helping him make a transfer from a teen who longs to leave the ranch he is stuck living on to a man seeking the fall of the Empire. This film isn't just a film; it is a true adventure.When it comes to the acting in "Star Wars", I truly don't believe it could get any better whatsoever. Mark Hamill was born to play Luke, Harrison Ford dominated his role as the swift Han Solo (a bounty hunter Luke ends up traveling with), Carrie Fisher is courageously independent as Princess Leia and doesn't fall into the shadows of her co-stars, but Alec Guinness was exceptional as Ben (or Obi-Wan) Kenobi. There is something magical and hopeful about the way Alec portrays Obi-Wan in this film. Also, Anthony Daniels is perfect as C3-PO! He may have been the simple comic relief, but I promise you he was the perfect choice for this character. I truly cannot see anyone ever playing this golden-plated character, who has practically become the symbol for any outsider who may have not seen the films. Without a doubt, the acting was exceptional in all respects. I believe the trickiest had to have been David Prowse, seeing as how Lucas ended-up not using Prowse's real voice for Darth Vader. With that thought, I must say that I enjoy James Earl Jones' voice much more for the character.Anyways, moving along! The writing of each character was phenomenal. I feel that the banter was so well-done that it brings these characters to life even more, seeing the situations each of them are in within the duration of the film. "Star Wars" was also plotted very well, with all events and scenes not feeling out of place once.The special effects, I must say, are top-notch, even if they have aged a bit in 2013 viewer's eyes. At some points, the effects look fantastic, while other scenes look like a "Star Wars" fan film from YouTube. That's common with classic cinema, so I don't mind it. I sincerely believe that people aren't the only ones to age.This "Star Wars" film is definitely not my favorite, but it runs right behind "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi", on my list. Overall, it is still very enjoyable with set designs that look like legitimate places amongst the galaxy. The detailing of the sets in this film are just shockingly realistic."Star Wars" deserves the eight stars that I have rated it. I like it, hold it as a memory in my heart, but find it to be an action-fantasy film, for the most part. It is brilliant, it is intelligent, and it is worth a try. I highly recommend the film.May the force be with you all! God bless, and Merry Christmas!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars felt big even before it was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1990s when I was about 8 or 10, I had a VHS copy of "Star Wars: A New Hope" that I watched repeatedly. It was a recording from a television broadcast and was missing the first few minutes, so the opening shots were of C-3PO and R2-D2 walking over the dunes of Tatooine. That planet is not, of course, named in the movie; strange as it is to think, there must have been a brief span of time when I knew the movie pretty well but didn't know the colossal amount of trivial information that I permanently internalized during my teen years. For a while I had no idea there were sequels. But the details and backstories that books and games and movies and TV shows have filled in over the decades were in a way already present, at least implicitly, at the outset. It is well-known that George Lucas was inspired by old sci- fi/adventure serials, and that he tried to give this "episode" of Star Wars the feel of belonging to a far grander saga whose beginning and end were far off. It was an audacious, brilliant move, and it worked on my younger self exactly as intended. I was able to conjure images of Luke's heroic father, supposedly killed in the off-handedly mentioned Clone Wars, and I was able to get a sense of what those conflicts were like from the way that Alec Guinness looked and sounded when he talked about the past. I could feel the long history of Obi-Wan and Vader's relationship in the way they appraised each other during their showdown. I could imagine, vaguely, the previous ups and downs of the rebel alliance and the off-screen machinations of Imperial Senate. That these things were planted in my imagination made the movie feel big and epic, though it is probably the "smallest" installment in the Star Wars franchise in terms of the size and number of sets, the number of characters with speaking roles, and other metrics. The series has not always benefited from trying to depict on-screen the people and events that were at first only evocative allusions. I sometimes wish I could forget everything I've learned from the ever-expanding Star Wars universe (and that, believe me, is a lot) in order to feel again the way I felt when all I had to go on was "A New Hope," and it was more than enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>game changer, but the saga peaked at the start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying that this film was the start of something big, and you cannot take away from it the fact that it changed the face of the sci-fi genre, maybe even the whole film industry, in to what it is today. For its time, the effects, story, characters and detail in this film are are beyond exemplary. Most action and sci-fi films aim to be compared to star wars, a feat that is rare and, in my opinion, has only been achieved by Terminator 1 and 2, the lord of the rings trilogy and marvels: the avengers.A new hope works brilliantly as a first chapter to a saga, however, I feel that it works better as a stand alone film. Unlike many films that are a 'first part', it has a beginning, middle and end, tells everything that needs to be told and leaves the characters in a satisfying place. I feel that having seen the prequels does not diminish anything about this film like it does to episodes five and six.The only problem that I have is that the original theatrical release doesn't really exist anymore, you can only really get the version that has been tinkered with by Lucas to put needless CGI extras in. This is the original and best of the star wars saga, however i do feel that many people see this through rose tinted glasses and will not see any faults in any of the three original films, even though they are happy to say that the three prequels do not exist as far as they are concerned. Awesome film, great legacy, and now that Disney has the rights away from Lucas, a great future too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing I can type here that has not been covered by previous reviewers so I will just leave it at this: For those that haven't watched Star Wars; please remedy that if you're a Sci-Fi fan or just a fan of films with a rich story. Star Wars was one of my favourite films as a child and it continues to be a source of both nostalgic wonder and a film that will always hold a special place with a geek/fan girl like me. The reviewer whom stated that Star Wars is a "Kid's Fantasy. An Adult's Memory" was spot on! I was three years from being born when the film was released in theatres but I was lucky enough to grow up with big brothers who introduced me as soon as I was old enough to watch. I cannot thank them enough for that. There is nothing better than reliving the epic stories of the Star Wars films on a rainy weekend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect adventure movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many influences did Lucas bring together for the first truly big sci-fi (ish) box office smash? Classic Samurai films, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Buck Rodgers. He took a clash of the greatest adventures of the first half of the twentieth century and brought them all into a single, sublime movie.Read/seen/played a kid with his parents/guardians murdered by the bad guys? Or a slightly mysterious/wise/cooky old teacher to teach the protagonist the "ways" of whatever? Or perhaps a grinning, sarcastic buddy that gets the protagonist out of trouble? Odds are if it was made sometime past 1977 you have Star Wars to thank for that.Heck, the very idea of background characters being named and rising to prominence is thanks to this movie. Or more specifically thanks to the toys eventually born out of it. Lucas negotiated the toy and merchandising rights and went right to work putting out every character there was, and since they had to have names in order to sell they were given names. Thus birthing the idea that characters once thought totally unimportant might be more than they seemed for fans of an IP.Oh, and as for the movie itself? One of the best scored movies in history, there might not be another movie in history with music more easily or widely recognizable than Star Wars. It was also written in a way so easy to wrap your head around that much of the dialogue can be recognized even by people that have seen it maybe once or twice.But the biggest claim I would make for the original Star Wars is that its the best edited and paced movie in history. Every movie study and screenplay writing example I've seen (and having taken college classes, and seen quite a few I have wide sample) has the original Star Wars as its perfect example of how to pace a movie. If you want to look for the perfect example of "the roller-coaster" of movie excitement, rising action spaced out with occasional dips, rising to a peak and then falling as the story ends are tied together; well, you're going to find its the original Star Wars.Like with any category of product or scientific field, forms of entertainment have things that shove them forward, that innumerable people after the fact owe a lot too. "Standing on the shoulders of giants" as it were. And Star Wars is one such thing, a giant of entertainment that so many works after it have stood upon to reach for their own heights.But even more important than that, it's just a damned fun movie. I've seen it more times than I care to admit. And yet even years later, years after the rabid Star Wars fanhood of my preteens has long faded, after I've grown bored and have little interest in seeing most any movie a second time I can still watch the original Star Wars and by the end have a huge grin on my face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic tale of heroism, of magic and revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before there was a trilogy, before there were prequels, before there was an expanded universe with hundreds of books, comics and video games, before Greedo shot first and before Jar Jar Bink was a speck of light in George Lucas' eye, there was Star Wars. Even if it's not the best film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in the history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It brought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and multiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.Unlike the rest of the films, there's absolutely no need for an expanded universe or a complete saga to appreciate the original Star Wars by its own right. It's a complete tale, a classic saga that takes its queues from historical epics, samurai films and serials, and contains every aspect of the timeless hero's journey. The fact that it takes place 'in a galaxy far, far away' is trivial - though it did help the film have a bigger impact.Star Wars has very little to do with science fiction; not much of the science in it makes any sense, it might as well be magic. But that's what made it so powerful, and what made the prequels - that tried to explain everything away - so disappointing. Luke Skywalker's story is a classic story of the simple farm-boy who leaves his home and becomes a hero, and for that reason exactly it's timeless, and resonates with audiences even now.Now go see The Empire Strikes Back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Lucas' mythological popcorn film is a two-hour roller-coaster ride that has passed into movie legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas spent four years developing and working on the galactic fantasy Star Wars. This was after he directed the dystopian science-fiction film THX 1138 (1971) and the rites-of-passage American Graffiti (1973). Star Wars was inspired by the Flash Gordon cartoon strip. It cost $8 million to make in Britain with three little-known Americans in the leading roles, supported by British actors. The story is a simple adventure yarn, and Lucas draws on samurai films, Westerns and every kind of myth, ancient and modern. The dogfights are based on a close study of World War II films. Star Wars was an immediate success. It became one of the great phenomena of cinematic history. It spawned two sequels, three prequels and endless imitators, creating a demand for spectacular blockbusters that has not yet ended. Industrial Light and Magic, the special effects unit that served the film, became a multi-billion dollar organization. Lucas himself also became and has remained one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The film certainly struck a nerve in an America recovering from the humiliations of the Vietnam war. Ronald Reagan, elected president three years after Star Wars was made, spoke of the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire' and gave his proposed space-defense system the title Star Wars. The original Star Wars trilogy contributed to the worldwide renewal of the filmgoing habit, but in creating an appetite for child-like blockbusters that depend on special effects rather than on character and subtle narrative, the film unfortunately played a key role in what was to be called 'the dumbing down' of America and popular culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of my Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up behind the iron curtain in Hungary. We hardly had the chance to see Western movies. I was 8 when I saw it, in 1982. I remember we were late from the movie (I went with my brother and grandmother) and we arrived to our seats when R2D2 was trying to find a way out from the icy base of the rebells on Hoth.I started to watch the film in awe, as I have never seem anything like it in my life. It's difficult to describe what impacts it gave me. Yes, on first level the special vision complex of the movie, the freedom fight against dictatorship, the novel landscapes and then the modern technology, but also the Asian (Buddhist, New Age) philosophy, that I had never encounter until then.I couldn't get out of its spell for several years. (I think I was in love with Han Solo for several years, too.) And with the movie - even now.Thanks Gorge Lucas and the Hungarian Distributor, who dared to bring it it in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most popular films of all time, and understandably so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a "Star Wars" guy growing up. I wouldn't say that I was a "Star Trek" guy growing up either ("Doctor Who" was my sci-fi franchise of choice growing up, and still is, even though I'm not a big fan of Russell T. Davies' version of the show), but I would definitely choose my favorite episodes of the original series or "Deep Space 9", "The Wrath of Khan", and "The Undiscovered Country" over any "Star Wars" film. I've seen the original trilogy a couple of times previously, once as a kid, once in my mid-teens, and now I sit down to watch "Star Wars" again, having been inspired by catching half of "The Empire Strikes Back" on TV recently and being enthralled by it.The first thing that struck me is how great the opening shot is, just after the scrolling text that is. The rest of the movie was pretty much how I remembered it being- a collection of great set-pieces and memorable characters, and a great mythology, but with a story which wasn't nearly as grand and great as "The Empire Strikes Back". Although a point of criticism aimed at "Star Wars" by its (relatively few) detractors is that it doesn't quite match the real feel of a 30's/40's serial, I think that it really does, and not only in the way it is shot and the transitional wipes and all that, but in the writing, the acting, and just about everything else. It has that same sense of adventure, and although this particular film is nowhere near as good as some of my favorite serials, it remains something which very accurately captures the feel of watching one of those, and its popularity (and the popularity of "Raiders of the Lost Ark") is hence quite understandable, as very few of even the big summer blockbusters have the same sensibility and sense of adventure, and well, fun.Watching "Star Wars", in spite of it not being my favorite of the original trilogy, serves as a reminder of the talent which George Lucas had at one point. I don't think this film is as good as his previous effort, "American Graffiti", which is the greatest 'coming of age' film I've ever seen, and one of the most beautiful films ever made from a visual standpoint, but it's still got spirit and energy which his later efforts just don't. It's quite sad, really. There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been said already (which is true, certainly of many popular films, but this is freakin' "Star Wars", so trust me, I have NOTHING to add to what has already been said). There are "Star Wars" devotees who swear it is the greatest of the trilogy and one of the best movies ever made, there are detractors who think it's cheesy nonsense, and then there are others like me who like it quite a bit, but aren't sure where all the extravagant praise comes from. "The Empire Strikes Back"... Well, that's a whole other story.8/10</fullReview>

When The Special Edition was getting released into theaters my brother and I were like "We HAVE to see them!" So on opening day my brother and I got in line at Tinseltown 290 in Houston to buy four tickets. Standing behind me is a Cinemark employee dressed as Darth Vader. I don't know why I laughed at that moment. We originally wanted the 10:45pm showing but it was sold out and they added an extra showing at 1am. So at 1am myself, my brother, our Dad and our aunt went to see it. The lights went out and some guy behind us yelled "Chewie!". You those familiar drums then the Fox logo. Then Lucas Film Ltd the people applauded. Then "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away." There was silence for that. Then the "Star Wars" came on the screen the theater applauded loudly. It was great. My brother and I agree George Lucas is a genius. Such imagination. He deserved that AFI Life Acchievment Award this year. George Lucas joins the ranks of Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson among others as a great director. Way to go George!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben "Obi-Wan" Kenobi may just be her's, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope'' is the first movie from the old trilogy. I will always prefer the old Star Wars' trilogy than the modern one, and watching again this movie makes me feel very good! It is a period of civil war,since an evil Empire controlled by Darth Vader and the Emperor has the control of all the galaxies. Rebel bases finally had their first victory against the horrible Galactic Empire, and princess Leia, who is part of the Rebel Alliance is made a prisoner by Darth Vader, since she refuses to say where are the plans of the lethal weapon called 'Death Star'', who were stolen by the rebel spies. The Death Star is a big space station,capable of destroying an entire planet if it's owner desires. Darth Vader also wants to know where is the secret base of the Rebels to destroy it. Since Princess Leia is a clever girl, she placed the plans of the Death Star in R2-D2, and send him to a special mission with C3PO in Tattoine, where he needs to finds where Obi Wan Kenobi is.R2 and C3PO arrives in Tattoine with success, but after a time they are kidnapped by the Sand People, who wants to sell them; for their luck, their buyer is Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen. At the same time that Lukes discovers that R2 needs to show the message for Obi wan, Vader's army went to Tattoinee to find R2 to recover their stolen plans. R2 goes after Obi Wan, and C3PO and Luke go after him. After being attacked by the Sand People and saved by Obi Wan, Luke tells him about the message in C3PO. All this time, Obi wan was hidden in Tattoine as a hermit with the name of 'Ben Kenobi'. Obi Wan then tells Luke many things about his past as a Jedi, and the fact that he was a friend of Luke's dad, Anakin. He also gives Luke a light saber that once belonged to Anakin. The Lars knows about the truth behind Luke's past, that's why specially uncle Owen never let him leave Tattoine. Worried that the Imperial troops are searching for R2 and C3PO, Luke runs in his home's direction, but he discovers too late that his uncle and aunt were killed by then. Sad and without any attachments in Tattoine, Luke decides to go with Obi Wan to Alderaan to help Leia.They two meet Chewbacca and Han Solo, who can take then to Alderaan. Once the money payments is sealed, they enter in the ''Millenniun Falcon'',Han's ship ,and they go to Alderaan's direction. The problem is: Alderaan is not there anymore. The ''Death Star'' destroyed Leia's native planet,since she refused to say where the rebel base stays.Once Luke,Han and Obi Wan comes to save Leia and they succeed in their mission,they know will have other problem: destroy the Death Star.Ps: I think that Obi Wan's death is too weak!Ps2: How does Luke understand what R2 says to him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think there's any denying that Star Wars changed cinema history and deservedly so. At the time of its release, science-fiction was considered a dead genre with the only major films from Hollywood's recent cannon being the work from Stanley Kubrick and cheesy, yet still fun flicks like Logan's Run. Yet, no other futuristic movie wowed more than George Lucas's space opera. From that infamous opening scroll, featuring that amazing heart-pumping score, to the end credits, people were gripped and hoping their heroes that had grown to know those two previous hours could come out alive. While, George Lucas did give his Jedi knights more adventures, I don't think any of those sequels and certainly not the prequels have managed to come close to the original Star Wars that practically defined the baby boom generation. Watching the film again recently, I am still impressed by the awesome power of the movie and the fact that even after thirty years after its release, it gets me more excited than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Sorry, Michael Bay, but you're no George Lucas, that's for certain.After two droids crash-land on the desert planet of Tatooine, they are immediately captured and sold to a young farm boy called Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who desperately wants to leave the rock he lives on with his aunt and uncle. While fixing one of the droids, he finds a message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), requesting the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness). Luke finds Kenobi, a hermit living in the mountains, who tells Luke of his family history. His father was a Jedi knight, killed by the evil Darth Vader and now Kenobi decides it is time to teach him the way of the Force. After Luke finds his family's home destroyed by stormtroopers looking for the two droids, they decide to find their way to another planet. They enlist the help of space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who decides to give them a lift. On the way, they find the Death Star, a giant space station run by Darth Vader, with the ability to destroy any planet of the solar system. Now, they must enter the Death Star, find and rescue the Princess and destroy the station before it produces anymore harm.George Lucas has been criticised for his so-called lack of direction and screen writing abilities, but I don't think most people can deny that Star Wars packs a mean punch in terms of solid entertainment. While Star Wars is playing, all eyes are on the screen savouring every delicious moment, whether it be a fantastic lightsaber duel or a quiet scene between Luke and Obi-Wan. The visual effects (including those in the special editions) are seriously some of the best in motion picture history as they manage to make the viewer believe they're in space, surrounded by various creatures and flying ships. Lucas has gotten a lot of negative criticism for the fact that he believes that the updated version of Star Wars is the ultimate way to see the film, but I don't mind. The special effects are better and they certainly do add to the experience. Greedo shooting first? It's such a quick, minor scene that goes by at such a fast rate, that I don't really mind. I understand where the die-hard fans are coming from, but for the casual viewer, it's practically nothing. Adding to the impressive technical delight of Star Wars as well is John Williams's magnificent score, the best in any Hollywood film. I seriously don't think the film would be as highly regarded as it is, if it wasn't for the fantastic music. I seriously would probably enjoy the film even less without it.Yet, I think the lasting appeal of Star Wars has to be the characters. Every child growing up wants to be like Luke Skywalker, the young Jedi who just wants to save the universe from possible destruction. Meanwhile, the older folks in the audience have the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi to relate and as Yoda shows in the other five films, that old age does not remove one of their abilities. Han Solo represents the coolness of Star Wars and Harrison Ford plays him with enough spunk and gusto to warrant what might be a minor character as a personal favourite of mine. And then, there's Darth Vader, the most famous character and the most chilling villain of the 20th century. James Earl Jones will always be connected with with this constantly breathing menace with a past of many hidden secrets. Even the stormtroopers tremble in his wake, for fear that he will force-choke them to death. With thrilling action, impressive visuals, lovable and both frightening characters and a world full of fascination and adventure, it's hard to go wrong with Star Wars, the epic journey of our hearts and inner wants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A break from the cynical films of the 1970s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest TCM production entitled TCM Presents A Night at the Movies: George Lucas &amp; The World of Fantasy Cinema, was really 2/3 about Lucas's films and it seemed that 2/3 of that was about Star Wars - but that was OK because it finally drove home to me what I have suspected for years - that George Lucas did not and does not have a clue as to what made Star Wars great. He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds. Now back to the original.In that cynical era in which nothing was black and white and everything seemed at least gray and a little tainted came this little space western. The sound effects were hokie, the graphics were poorly rendered, and all of the creatures were real men and women in rubber suits not CGI. But that was not the point. The point was that HERE was a force of pure evil - The Empire - that everybody could be completely against. The heroes were imperfect yet you could rally around them. You have a young boy of about 19 who is treated well by his farming aunt and uncle but wants a bigger destiny, you have an old man living in the hills like a hermit that wants that young boy to join the fight against the empire, and not until The Empire touches the boy personally does he make a rather hasty decision to do so. There is a girl, a princess, who is not waiting for somebody to come rescue her and helpless. She's tough, she can handle a weapon, and she can handle the fourth in their little band, Han Solo, who sticks his neck out for nobody a la Casablanca's Rick Blaine and seems completely mercenary, yet he gets involved. If you like science fiction and good old fashioned adventure you'll like it. If you are young and feel that your destiny is slipping through your fingers and are itching to make a difference, or if you are older and want a chance to right a wrong that you feel at least partially responsible for you'll love it. And you CAN shoot first in the face of danger, have lived a pretty self involved life, change, and become the hero. As the 1977 original trailer said "Star Wars - for the fun of it" and for the philosophy of it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western disguised as a Space adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is by far the most over-hyped movie in the world. And I love it! Sure, on occasion the dialog is a bit corny, but the villains are real villains, and men are real men. And those spaceships! Man, as a kid I wanted to live in the Millennium Falcon. So, the story. Farm boy Luke Skywalker gets pulled into an war against the empire, together with an old General, a smuggler and a Wookiee ( you've got to see it to believe it) and off course a beautiful princess. Throw in two robots for some comic relief, and you are all set for the ride of your life. The original version is the one to watch because it has none of that CGI crap. You can still find it on video if you're lucky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all honesty, I didn't plan on watching "Star Wars" on its 38th anniversary, but a happy accident nonetheless. To see this movie is to go back to a time when the mythology was in its nascent stages, before all the merchandising and parodies (really, a testament to its cultural impact, which is immense). It's deceptively simple; all of the classical elements are here - clearly defined heroes and villains, robots, space pirates, wizards, princesses, sorcery - remixed and flung off into a faraway galaxy. It all makes for a potent brew, to say the least. And when all is said and done, the movie's real power is its ability to tap into the kid in all of us. This is just plain fun, and not even Lucas' shoddy CGI rejiggering can tarnish that.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The coolest STAR WARS ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE is a film that I really enjoyed when I first saw it and I knew from the beginning I would love it and this was the first in a much bigger series and the fourth film in the STAR WARS franchise overall (in chronological order).The story is amazing for a 2 hour film and the film does not feel like it's 2 hours because it goes by really quick and I really think it's just amazing and spectacular and fantastically well-made and there are reasons why it is the best movie of all time and it's the best film ever made.THE CHARACTERS: Luke Skywalker is our main protagonist and he is played by Mark Hamill and he is really spectacular. He is my favorite character, along with Yoda, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, C3PO and R2D2, Mace Windu, Padme, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Emperor Palpatine.Hamill does not fail in anything and his performance was really great and just amazing. Carrie Fisher was really fantastic as Princess Leia and she is not the normal damsel-in-distress in today's movies and she was the right choice for the character. Harrison Ford is really nice as Han Solo and all three actors would later become famous for their roles in these films and they really do a very well good job.Harrison Ford would play both Han Solo in the original STAR WARS trilogy and Indiana Jones in the INDIANA JONES franchise, which I will get to.The next performance is the late Alec Guiness in the best role of his career as Obi-Wan Kenobi and he should have won an Oscar for his part. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew plays C3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca in this film and they do a really outstanding job.George Lucas does a very good job creating an epic space opera series that starts off with the middle of the series and that is not possible in today's film making world, but was possible for 1977 and he does a very good job writing and directing and the screenplay he wrote is one of the best screenplays that I have ever read before in my life.John Williams composed one of the greatest musical scores ever created for a film and his Star Wars theme song is one of my favorite musical themes ever credits.The visual effects back then were amazing and so were the lightsaber battles and the dogfight sequences and they were really cool back in 1977 and it was really cool and just amazingly created and today, they still look amazingly well-done. I have seen the 1997 special edition of this film and I think it is really good, but I also love the theatrical version is just really cool and just fantastic.Overall, I love STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE and the movie is getting a 10 out of 10 from me because everything is just really great and fantastic to inspire a lot of filmmakers including Christopher Nolan, Joss Whedon, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, John Singleton, Dean Devlin and Peter Jackson and it also inspired future filmmakers including myself.It's a smash hit, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1977: A galaxy much too far away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this marvellously old-fashioned hokum with my girlfriend at the packed out Pics on March 25th 1978. Exhausted at all the screen wipes by the end all we were thinking of was hopefully not waiting too long in the cold for the last bus home; so much for intergalactic travel. Star Wars was a phenomena then, and still is ? although I did warn a big fan I knew at the time that it wouldn't take too long for the special effects to go dog-eared with age and even recommended Kurosawa's original to him instead. However, he probably still disdainfully thinks, along with many others that movies, indeed history, began with Star Wars.Young stereotype joins forces with a disparate group of stereotypes to save the white universe and Princess Stereotype from stereotypical space baddies in a adventurous story bordering on corny with then innovative now dated film technology. Definitely nothing wrong with any of that, just that when stripped down it's not only incredible but incredibly ordinary and merely reflects back to me some lovely sunny days from the mid '70's. Even the sinister ugly aliens had somehow listened to the cleaner music of Frank Zappa. Fancy spending trillions of trillions on an immense battleship complete with a titchy flue with a security implication. I saw Lucas's 90's cgi cartoonery revision at the Pics with my daughter, the spacecraft still wobbled and there were many white borders on display but overall his team had done a good job trying to stem the onslaughts of Time on his cash cow. Many of my favourite films are pure - and poor - old fashioned corn but no one on planet Earth thinks they're life changing works of Art in the same way as they do this monument to Luck.The film I saw was Part I full stop; if Disney ever gets to Part XXVII what if they want to do a prequel to the prequel and more pathetic re-numbering and retrospective digital title re-jigging ensues, will Lucas let them? I've always favoured the originals of anything generally and also draw the line at altering future history.I enjoy it immensely whenever it's on UK TV, as I can feel the persuasive Force of not having to think for a couple of hours and to simply enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a milestone in cinema. It changed the way movies were made with its ground breaking special effects. It launched the Star Wars saga, one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Along with Jaws, it essentially created the blockbuster genre, and on top of all that, many aspects of this film are now a cultural icons (The John Williams theme, The Millennium Falcon, The Death Star, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Lightsabers, C-3PO and R2D2 and so much more!)However, even if you took away this film's impact on both Cinema and the world, you would still have a very enjoyable thrill ride in the science fiction/fantasy genre! A lot of elements of Star Wars are a bit cliché: The orphan protagonist who goes from average Joe to hero, the wise mentor, the non violent duo put in for comic relief, the anti hero, the dark threatening villain and the princess. However, what makes Star Wars so great is how likable it makes it's heroes, how intimidating it makes it's antagonists and the unique spin Star Wars puts on these otherwise cliché factors.Enter Luke Skywalker! He's a little whiny at first, but you can't help but get behind him. Mark Hamill's performance definitely helps, but it's also the character's sheer compassion and determination to become a part of something bigger that makes him so relatable. You can't help but sympathize with him as his Uncle Owen holds him back from leaving the farm. Luke also has a firm belief in the force and places a lot of faith in it.Complementing Luke's character is that of Han Solo. Han has far less compassion, and refuses to put any faith in the force. He is certainly more a bad ass in traditional sense and is on the other end of the "hero" spectrum. This is great because it gives the audience options on who they'd like to get behind. If Luke is too much a boy scout, you still have Han to get behind. If Han is too pig headed and selfish, then you have Luke to get behind! Not to mention, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford have great on screen chemistry.Darth Vader is done so well as antagonist that he's arguably the most iconic villain of all time, perhaps tied with the Joker. Everything from the unique mask he wears to the size and stature of David Prowse (the actor inside the suit)accompanied by the voice of James Earl Jones gives Darth Vader a highly intimidating presence. However, what makes him interesting and gives him more depth is that he was once good, but was seduced by the dark side of the force and is now evil. He was a victim of his temptations. Alec Guinness is a brilliant actor and makes Obi-wan Kenobi very likable as well very well spoken and wise. It's very easy to see him as a wise Jedi Master. Princess Leia is a damsel in distress, but she's also tougher than the average one and isn't afraid to take charge. Aside from the great characters, Star Wars just introduces a very distinct and unique universe. There are so many great vehicle and character designs that are imaginative, interesting and original. All of these things keep Star Wars from being anything from generic. Then there's the pacing of the film. The film starts off with a great attention grabbing introduction, then the film starts to slow down a bit for exposition, but then the film becomes a roller coaster ride throughout the entire second half! The action is very thrilling and leaves a big impression.Overall, Star Wars still holds up today as a great film. It hasn't aged a bit; non of it's special effects look dated or silly, the characters are still very likable and soundtrack is just epic. Star Wars, in my opinion is the definition of a timeless film. It is now 36 years old and is still better than the vast majority of blockbuster films that have been released within the last year, if not all of them! Star Wars lives up to it's name of simply being a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars film review final draft 2.docx</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brock Hunt Mr.Hicks ENG 101-008 September 20, 2013A Space OperaStar Wars is a movie which focuses on a rebel alliance that fights against an oppressive regime set in a fictionalized universe a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. We're introduced to the main characters Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader (David Prowse) for the first time. Luke is a farm boy who doesn't have a clue of what is about to happen. Darth Vader is an evil dark lord of the Sith who is trained in the dark side of the force and wants to defeat the rebel alliance. After Luke's family is murdered by the empire, he trains to be a Jedi by Obi-Wan Kenobi to defeat the evil Galactic Empire.George Lucas made Star Wars: A New Hope in 1976 and was released in the summer of 1977. He made episode four first because the story didn't require any high dollar special effects and wasn't sure how the movie would be accepted. When the movie opened, it received great reviews and audiences were amazed at the special effects. He would go on to direct the following sequels Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Little do people know that George Lucas had the stories and screenplays of episodes one, two, and three already done before episode four was ever released. He did this because at the time technology didn't exist to produce the first three films with the fight sequences and settings that were in the first three films.I personally love the Star Wars films because of my personal connection with them. My grandmother introduced me to the Star Wars franchise as a child. On Saturday nights I would stay with my grandmother and she would play the movies on VHS. I never get tired of watching the films. Because every time I do, it takes me back in time when she was alive. Star Wars also opened up my interest in Sci-Fi movies. Some can say I'm a nerd but most don't know my extensive knowledge of the Star Wars franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really One Heck of a Movie from Lucas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas probably did not know at the time he was creating one of the biggest hits not just only of his career but also of all time! As there were rarely movies from space it seemed at the time.Mark Hamil as the main protagonist Luke Skywalker who went from being a simple farm boy to being a grown up man and really stronger and tougher but had a sense of morals and values as he was the most developed character of all the main characters.Carrie Fisher as the feisty yet pretty and tough action gal Princess Leia. As she really should had moved on and had the acting chops but people will forever remember her as Princess Leia no matter what.Harrison Ford as the tough, dashing, a bit of a jerk but with a heart of gold space pirate, Han Solo. Who really began to mellow out and proved to his friends that he was not such a macho jerk and really had a heart of gold.Darth Vader who only had twelve minutes of screen time in the first movie. Really began to also develop. As he knew he had good inside of him but was afraid to show it.And of course scene stealers like C3P0 and R2-D2. As R2D2 is funny even though we can't hear a word he is saying but only C3PO is the only one that can as C3P0 is the perfect sidekick and straight man for scene stealing R2.The movie had wit, charm, personality, and special effects! Wished that both Hamil and Fisher would had gone on further in their careers like Ford did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen "Star Wars", I don't know HOW many times and I just never get sick of it. It's one of my favorites and one of the greatest movies of all time. A movie that's the perfect combination of great special effects, a great story and memorable characters. All these movies that have been trying to make another "Star Wars" over the past two decades generally overlook exactly what made this movie so great in the first place. They tend to just focus on the sets and special effects and overlook the story and characters. George Lucas took great care on all three. A classic movie that will continue to be loved decades from now. Unlike all the Hollywood, big-budget crap coming out these days, this was a low-budget film, but had more magic than all the others put together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR WARS! Just the title evokes a reaction and what follows is a series of emotions. Passion, joy, love, laughter, anticipation and excitement. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was once such a thing as really good films, and Star Wars may be just about the greatest of them all. Without going into too much detail on the other films of the original trilogy, Star Wars may actually be the best of the three just because of its simplicity. Sure Empire takes it to a deeper level, but Star Wars is just the simple and relatable fable of Dorothy on her farm, wishing for a greater existence in life, however in Star Wars our Dorothy is Luke Skywalker, searching for his own purpose in life. We've all been there surely? That's what great films are made of.Star Wars starts out with a small and soon to be obsolete rebel ship being pursued by the ominous and disturbingly bad guy looking star destroyer of the evil empire! The storm troopers soon board and take control of the ship, lead by their captain in command, Darth Vader. The moment Vader steps out from the smoke, stands tall above the dead rebels and his infamous breathing begins, one can easily distinguish the fact he is the most bad-ass evil villain in the history of villainy. And he is. No doubt Vader is as bad as they come, but you instantly get the sense there is more to this guy than first appearances would give. More on that later. So Vader and his storm troopers take the Princess Leia hostage, played wonderfully by Carrie Fisher, who has sent her faithful R2-D2 and his tag along C-3PO away with the plans of destroying the death star, down to tattooine, the Sahara of the galaxy. Que Luke Skywalker, played subtly by Mark Hamill, who dreams of a bigger purpose in life. The chances of fate bring him and the two droids together and from there the film catapults young Luke into the adult world of the rebellion fighting for freedom against the empire.So many great characters to talk about in Star Wars, Han Solo takes the cake for being the best character for my money. He is cocky, smug and shows growth of character the most throughout the film. Harrison Ford created his first iconic character in the arrogant and charming space pilot, captain of the millennium falcon (another amazing creation) and best friend to wookie Chewbacca. I also really like the character of Ben Kenobi. Not only was Alec Guiness the superb choice to be cast as the character, there is so much depth and richness to the character too. Ben is just an old guy hiding in the desert of tattooine to begin with, but once he rescues Luke and they get off of tattooine with Han Solo and the gang, Ben starts opening his mouth and you really get the sense that this guy was once a really formidable Jedi, and still is to an extent. The real power of the force lies within his voice, within his wisdom and advice, which are truly inspiring, not only for Luke, but for the viewer too. Not only is Ben a great mentor and adviser, he is a bad-ass. His climatic duel with Vader is not only thrilling but also insightful, as Ben willingly sacrifices himself, realising he will pave the way for Luke to become a Jedi and save the galaxy. Awesome stuff.Special effects are also a triumph in this film. Everything from the glow of the lightsaber to the fantastic final battle of the death star at the climax of the film all come together in a crescendo of beautiful storytelling. It isn't just effects for the sake of effects, they are in aid of the story and help enhance it. Also, the score of Star Wars is truly memorable and without a doubt, the opening credit sequence of the film along with its famous score makes for a thrilling film moment every viewing.Star Wars has so many great themes involved, but as Ben realises when he surrenders himself to Vader, it is all about the bigger picture. Its about the future, its about growth and learning, coming of age and of course, Han shot first. Star Wars might just be the perfect film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars: One Of The Most Enduring Movie Of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a distant galaxy, a long time ago, young Luke Skywalker assembles his motley crew of allies including space rogue Han Solo and two "droids" -- C3PO and R2D2 -- to rescue Princess Leia, the rebel leader of her planet from the clutches of the evil Empire as embodied by its enforcer Darth Vader in Star Wars:A New Hope.It is epic space opera film series created by George Lucas. The first film in the series was originally released on 1977, under the title Star Wars, by 20th Century Fox, and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by two sequels, released at three-year intervals. Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy's final film, the first in a new prequel trilogy of films was released. The three films were also released at three-year intervals, with the final film released on 2005.The Star Wars film series has spawned a media franchise including books, television series, video games, and comic books. These supplements to the film trilogies comprise the Star Wars Expanded Universe, and have resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe. Obviously,it is a legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci- fi saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same.It is a magnificent film.Lucas set out to make the biggest possible adventure fantasy out of his memories of serials and older action epics, and he succeeded brilliantly.It is a seminal movie that began a whole cycle of sci-fi works and also launched the careers of many actors and craftsmen.A sweeping epic with classical themes lifted from the teachings of Joseph Campbell, but it maintains strong central characters.And most of all,it is one of the most enduring movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that shaped pop culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is great cinema. One of the great things about it is the visuals, the opening shot where the Star Destroyer flies over while chasing the Rebel Blockade Runner is amazing. The music is also fantastic, it evokes early epic movie scores by the likes of Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Miklos Rozsa and also hearkens back to Classical music in the romantic period, especially to Wagner and Holst. The characters and story are somewhat basic but that's part of whats great about the movie, it has an archetypal, mythic quality.Some have said that the only reason this movie is highly regarded is because of people who as as children and idolize it for nostalgic reasons, well as someone who saw for the first time at the age of 16, I can attest that it's stands on it's own very well.It does have a few flaws. The dialogue can be corny at times. Luke's remorse over his aunt and uncles death seems rather short lived, particularly compared to his sadness over Ben Kenobi's death. Despite these flaws Star Wars is still an excellent film. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long, Long Wait For A Movie Far, Far Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a review of the first ( and best ) 'Star Wars' movie. I take it, fellow I.M.D.B. users, that you are already familiar with the plot, characters and production history, and how its success changed the face of cinema overnight. So rather than rehash all the known facts, I want instead to recount a personal memory.I first learnt of 'Star Wars' thanks to Granada's 'The Krypton Factor', a long-running game show designed to test contestants' intelligence, physical fitness, powers of observation and so on. I liked the latter round as it often gave one a chance to catch a sneak preview of a new movie. One week, they ran a clip of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, R2D2 and C2PO escaping The Death Star in The Millennium Falcon, and being shot at by pursuing T.I.E. fighters. I fell off my chair. What was this? 1970's sci-fi movies were mostly depressing affairs, predicting gloomy futures for Mankind, now here was something fast, colourful, and lively, with lasers zapping about outer space and explosions. Right up my street.I had to see it. But the film was not yet on release here. There was no Internet then so I got my movie information from the local paper. I kept checking for news of an impending screening at my local cinema, but no - there was nothing. I began to wonder if the movie actually existed or not. Had Granada pulled off the greatest hoax of all time? I read the Sphere book voraciously until I knew the story backwards. I played the Meco disco single at every opportunity. When Marvel's comic adaptation went on sale, I was almost thrown out of the newsagent for jumping up and down for sheer joy.At my school, 'Star Wars' was a dirty word to sci-fi fans, mainly because it was not 'Close Encounters'. The Spielberg picture was regarded as 'adult' and 'intelligent', while the Lucas movie was deemed 'kiddie stuff' starring weirdos in fancy dress running around with a bloke dressed as a big teddy bear.The wait dragged on and on. In an episode of 'Coronation Street', Gail ( Helen Worth ) asked her then-boyfriend, Steve Fisher: "When's 'Star Wars' coming round here?" to which he replied: "It'll be some time I expect.". His words encapsulated the sheer frustration and impatience felt by all us U.K. fans. The highest grossing film of all time and we can't see it? What is the hold up? Are they redoing bits for the benefit of British audiences? Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness are in it so this cannot be right.In desperation, I told a blatant lie to my best friend. "I have seen 'Star Wars'", I proclaimed. He looked about as shocked as if I'd said I'd spent the night with Carrie Fisher. I claimed that my uncle Eric worked for Twentieth Century-Fox ( another lie. He drove taxi cabs for a living ) as an assistant editor and George Lucas had been so impressed with his work on the film, he had generously given him a print. To back up my claim, I reeled off a long list of plot details and scene descriptions. I got a few things wrong, such as Jabba The Hut and Biggs Darklighter, both of whom were excised from the final cut. But by the time my friend saw the film he had forgotten these. He did beg me to ask my uncle to run the film specially for him on Sunday afternoon, but I deflected this by stating that Uncle Eric's projector had broken down. He never asked again.Being about fifteen, I was too old for the toys, hence on Christmas Day 1977 I was denied the pleasure of reenacting the assault on The Death Star in my garden shed, with the aid of elastic bands, old Subbuteo figures and the John Williams soundtrack thumping out of my Hitachi tape recorder.After what felt like an eternity, the movie finally opened here and suddenly it became fashionable to denounce it as 'overrated'. 'It was childish when they were playing trumpets in the Cantina' was my best friend's verdict. That was all he had to say on the subject ( he would have made a great film critic! ). Many people felt that the film had not been worth the six month wait. I was one of the few to speak in its defence. I was glad that sci-fi movies were fun again. Nobody left the theatre with a spring in their step after seeing Milo The Baby Chimp's parents brutally murdered by the U.S. Government at the end of 'Escape From The Planet Of The Apes'.'Star Wars' spawned two sequels, neither as good, and inspired the likes of 'Alien', 'The Black Hole', 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and countless others. Without Lucas, these would simply not have been made.I am not a big fan of the prequels, but then I'm not young anymore, so can't enjoy that kind of movie in the same way. 'Star Wars' brought 'A New Hope' to those of us wanting old fashioned escapism on the Silver Screen again. I envy kids today for not having to wait until winter for the latest summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie for audiences ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars was my first non-Disney movie that I watched at the ripe old age of 8. Immediately I fell into another world, getting caught in a new mythology from a Galaxy far, far away. My siblings and I would play "Star Wars" in the back yard, saving the galaxy from evil. We would try to make my cousin into the "A New Hope" version of Princess Leia; my sister's hair was too short. My best friend at the time and I would be Jedi knights - we were 8 so it was okay to do this.The best thing I have ever done in my life is watch the Special Edition release of Star Wars. Sitting in the front row, hearing that surround sound and experiencing Star Wars in a way that no one had experienced it since the 1970s and 1980s - it was truly magical. The image of everyone in the theater standing up and cheering when the Death Star blew up sears in my mind forever and was the highlight of my entire movie-going experience. Why can't movies do that sort of thing anymore? Why cant they cause such inspiration for imagination anymore?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars seems to lack the sense of importance that all of the sequels and prequels had. This one just seeks to entertain, and there's nothing wrong with that! Star Wars is one of those miracle movies (a term borrowed from Leonard Maltin) where everything went wrong but it all came together in the end, like Jaws and The Wizard of Oz. The movie was plagued by budget problems, and Lucas was so behind schedule he suffered a few panic attacks, which is probably why he did not direct the sequels. Star Wars takes the audience on a series of adventures, from encountering sand people in the desert to rescuing a princess on a space station. The special effects and production design is amazing. It takes you into a whole new galaxy and makes you believe it's real. I liked how everything looked old and dirty; prior to Star Wars everything in Sci-fi movies looked brand new. John William's Star Wars score adds a whole new element of fun and is arguably the best work of his career. I can't imagine what Star Wars would be like without his music.The main characters are all familiar archetypes. Luke is the restless, immature boy who wants to get off the farm and have an adventure. Han Solo is the rugged pirate who only cares for himself. Harrison Ford really steals every scene he's in with his wise guy attitude. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the Sorcerer/Mentor stereotype, like Merlin. Alec Guinness brings a certain classiness to the role, even though this is not even close to his best performance. His final lightsaber battle is slow and boring due to the limitations of the weak lightsabers (David Prowse kept breaking them!) and his old age, but he delivers his verbal quips quite nicely, as does James Earl Jones. The scene where he dies is still very powerful; I love how Vader steps on his empty robe, it's like he's thinking "hey, where are you hiding?" Carrie Fisher plays the kidnapped princess; her performance is tougher and feistier in this movie. She loses those qualities to a certain extent in the following movies.Hammer Horror film veteran Peter Cushing played the sinister Imperial Officer, Grand Moff Tarkin. It's amazing how Cushing was able to slip into the role of the villain so easily (he certainly looks evil), considering the fact he was most famous for playing protagonists like Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein. I cannot give enough praise to James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, one of the greatest villains of all time. Some of the dialog is embarrassing but the cast was able to bring the characters alive. That is the most important difference between the originals and the prequels. These characters were not complex in any way, but they had good chemistry with each other. The prequel's characters felt like cardboard. I used to think this was the most boring Star Wars film, and I just don't understand why anymore. I've noticed this film gets criticized for bad pacing, and I could not disagree more. Star Wars has the best pacing of the original trilogy. Empire's plot stopped moving in the middle of the movie, and the first 35-40 minutes of Jedi were a total pit stop. Star Wars on the other hand smoothly builds up to the final climax at the Death Star, without any long story lags. The Battle of Yavin has been criticized for being too long (by Alec Guinness and Roger Ebert), but I don't mind. The Death Star's destruction is an exhilarating moment. Star Wars is also the funniest movie in the series. The bickering between the three heroes on the Death Star is hilarious.In 2004 the Star Wars movies were revised yet again for the DVD release. I have to say I'm disappointed with how the original trilogy has been treated by Lucas. He seems to support film preservation in every case, except when it comes to his own movies. To me, replacing actors and revising special effects is just as bad as colorizing a black and white movie. It eliminates all of the historical significance. I hope one day the original trilogy will receive better treatment in the future. I would recommend buying the original trilogy on DVD now while you still can. It might not be released again, but with Lucas you can never tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legend is Born.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All folklore no matter where you come from as several basic tenants. You have the hero, the villain, the damsel in distress, , sidekicks, minions, guides, heroic battles, tragedies and victories. Good stories but hardly the stuff of a blockbusting movie. Or is it...? How on earth to take something as basic as a Good-vs-Evil Hero-vs-Villain story and make a movie that will capture imaginations? It can't be done can it? You just can't do it? Well yes actually you can. If you're George Lucas.I was but a babe in arms when the incredible triumph that is the Star Wars Saga was wowing generations of movie-goers worldwide.But although I didn't experience it on the Big Screen I can honestly say I fully understand and appreciate Lucas genius today 20 years on.I can honestly say I have yet to see another Saga measure up to Star Wars in both its look and its content.The premise of course the story of a young farm boy Luke Skywalker, wonderfully played by a young Mark Hamill who captures Luke's frustrations and desires perfectly.Young Luke seems destined to spend his life on his Uncle's farm on the remote planet of Tatooine doing chores but he dreams off more. He longs to be a pilot and see the universe. But that seems to be nothing more than a dream.That is until a chance meeting with two droids called C3PO and R2D2 results in his befriending an old hermit by the name of Ben Kenobi( Sir Alec Guiness) changing his life forever. For the old Hermit is in fact a great Jedi warrior called Obi-Wan Kenobi and the droids carry a distress message from a Princess on a Star Ship under the captivity of the Galactic Empire and it's ruthless leader Darth Vadar. Now Luke will leave his home and begin an adventure he could only have dreamed of, make new friends and learn things about himself and his family that he never knew were possible.Thus began one of the greatest movie adventures of all time and thus were created some of modern cinema's most memorable characters. All the folklore-type characters are present in Lucas masterpiece but he has managed to change and alter them enough to fit his incredible vision.The Hero of course is young Luke. Spirited and dreamer, Luke is also fiercely brave and loyal and something of an adventurer. He is also desperate to learn more about his Father, about whom his Aunt and Uncle refuse to speak.Mark Hamil is top notch in the role.The Damsel in distress is the Plucky Princess Leia , played with gusto by the then just 19 year old Carrie Fisher. Leia is the sender of the message that changes Luke's life. She is a member of a Rebel Alliance formed to oppose the mighty Galactic Empire and she was carrying the plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon , the dreaded Death Star to members of the her Alliance when the Imperial Fleet attacked her convoy.Little do either she or Luke know that they are connected by more than the droids.Luke also acquires a side-kick in the form of the smart, selfish rouge Han Solo. Smuggler and skilled pilot Han also proves to be a useful ally and a firm friendship is formed between the seasoned Solo and the young idealistic Jedi-in-Training. Solo is played by the ever wonderful Harrison Ford who lends just the right amount of sarcastic selfishness to an essentially good lovable character.Sir Alec Guiness is a cinematic legend and his wise old Jedi Knight is yet another fine performance from this seasoned veteran. Just mysterious enough to make you wonder just who he is and what he knows ( you learn more in EpV) he is also wise and a comfort to Luke ( and indeed the viewer) as he guides the young man ( and us) through his development as a Jedi and a man.Star Wars also gave rise to perhaps one of cinema's most iconic and best loved Villains. His almost mechanical breathing and deep sinister voice ( courtesy of James Earl Jones) have made Darth Vadar the best loved of all villains and indeed the most feared. At this time he is in command of the Imperial Fleet and rules the Empire with an Iron fist. All in black with that fearsome mask he is the epitome of the Dark Side and is wonderfully brought to life by Earl-Jones and David Prowse who wears the suit.And of course as we see later on he is also one of the most human and pitiful characters in the Saga despite being more man then machine.He will become Luke's biggest threat but also his strongest connection, a connection Luke never dreamed he would find but the last he wants to have.This was a new genre of film, Sci-Fi mixed with Fantasy and it worked a charm. The world was, and indeed still is, captivated, and its easy to see why. Its got action, suspense, romance, humor, danger and fear. And all this from Lucas twin interests in Space Travel and Folklore combined with a love for and real skill at making movies. The Saga, so wonderfully brought full circle with parts 1,2 and 3 recently , took off from the base so amazingly created in A New Hope and has gone from strength to strength ever since. This film is a wonder of modern film and I firmly believe it will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the Lucasian Chair of Entertainment - a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.To the squares that loathe it - I pity you daddyos; you'll never experience what millions of us have felt these past three decades. Go and see Henry Jaglom again; I'll stick with Mr. Lucas - he is THE MAN!I love this film. Forget what flaws it has - minor they are indeed. Star Wars has become a mystic myth and that sorcerer supreme, Jedi master George Lucas, has given me more pleasure than I can measure. My favourite bit? Almost impossible to choose. Okay, if I must...the stunning Tie Fighter battle with the Millennium Falcon, a work or art in the editing room. It should be hung on a wall somewhere.George, old chap, if you're ever passing my house please knock - and I'll make you a cup of tea. You deserve that much at least!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the first film I ever saw...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read a lot of the other comments here, I have to say it's interesting to see how many people begin by saying how old they were when they saw "Star Wars" for the first time(Full disclosure: I was three. My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. "Star Wars" was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and "Star Wars", with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.Is it juvenile, at times? Simplistic, even? Sure. So's the truth, sometimes. We want to believe there's a Force, and that Luke can master its use in time to defeat the forces of darkness. So we believe it. Are the effects a bit dated now? Sure, although I still believe them. Did the success of "Star Wars" possibly kick off the modern blockbuster era, which gives us more and more special-effects-drenched dreck every year? Sadly, it probably did. But the thing the wannabe heirs of "Star Wars" usually lack is the one thing that made "Star Wars" such an event--courage.Back in 1977, nobody was making movies like this. Nobody thought a film like this, with its mythic storytelling arc and its sweeping vision of intergalactic war, could possibly work...with the exception of George Lucas and his fellow filmmakers.I didn't know all that at the time, of course. Like I said, I was only three. But having watched more movies than most people my age now, I feel comfortable saying that in its way, "Star Wars" is as much an independent auteur's film as anything by John Cassavetes or Woody Allen-- it has the same sort of daring, the same desire not to settle for less than showing us something we've never seen before. A bold, grand sense of old-style craftsmanship infuses everything in "Star Wars", and the film delivers on the promise contained in its subtitle. At the time, it really was a new hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly kid's movie or world-changing classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a scientific point of view, C3PO is as silly as you can get, from the way he looks and walks to the ridiculous things he says. He goes from berating his friend, R2D2, to worrying for his safety, from calling him incompetent to saying "I knew you could do it" when R2 eventually saves them all. Aside from the incessant whining of Luke, who manages to be funny without having a sense of humor, we relate to him. We feel the frustration he feels when he is stuck on the farm, the pain he feels from the death of his aunt and uncle and later when he loses Ben Kenobi.The waving of blasters with flashes of light which are obviously added later, the terrible aim of anyone shooting at our main characters, and the big presentation of awards to our heroes at the end of the movie make me feel retarded for liking this film so much. But the pure goodness of the good guys (except for Han) makes me want them to win and makes me glad when they do. They're trying to save us all from the evil empire. Star Wars is so popular because most of us want to be the good guys, the ones who risk everything to do the right thing for the right reason and be appreciated by the people we save. This is the reason Spiderman was so enormously popular. He's just a kid who has some moral goodness, whom we can be proud of. Most of us would love to be Luke Skywalker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece in disguise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some claim that Star Wars is nothing more than a simple morality tale that borrowed from classic mythology with good special effects. Comments have been made about the film that it has a simple story and that the movie has simple characters. While all of these claims may have some validity, to say that the film has no depth is unfair. When one studies how much thought really was put in Lucas' trilogy, they should be amazed. While the film borrows from mythology, Lucas has made sure that each film has a major twist from its ancestors. In the first film for example, Luke goes to rescue a princess, but instead she is the one that ends up saving him. Not only does the story telling have a twist on classic mythology, it has an underlying theme and many sub-themes that no other movie can match. After studying the trilogy, redemption is the theme most often explored. Every major "good" character in the trilogy at one time falls and then redeems himself. The ultimate redemption being Darth Vader who will be the main character in the new trilogy being developed as I type. As for the characters being simple, this seems unfair. They are archtypes. Characters common throughout all cultures. Also, all the major characters have motivation for their actions unlike most good guy/bad guy movies. The bad guys in the films are bad because of human flaws such as the struggle for power and greed. They are not simple bad for bad's sake. Even the main villain of the trilogy becomes very human by the end of the trilogy when he redeems himself. The film doesn't show the bad guys only as something to shoot at, but as human beings that have been lead astray. The two trilogies are ultimately about how a human being can become a monster, and that a monster is still a human being in the end. The Star Wars trilogy has more depth than at first glance. Though it does have spectacular effects, this is only to pull the viewer into the great story-telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie so many times, I know the script, I collect the books, ask me any question on Star Wars I could probably answer it.Star Wars is the best movie ever made. It has everything - plot, special effects, great script, endearing characters, one could go on and on about it. It has opened up an entire new universe in a galaxy far, far away. And the best thing about it, it can never end. As I had never seen Star Wars in the cinema it was absolutely AMAZING to see the famous opening line and the prologue disappearing into space. The best thing about it is that it is labelled Episode 4 - a promise of things to come. Of course everyone has seen this movie and its sequels (if not, you've been living in a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . . .) And everyone has to admit that its originality at least makes this one of the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars begins not with opening credits, as the guild would enforce in those days, but with a scrawl that has become legendary. Back then, it was a few lines of yellow text scrolling across a lengthy screen that would be photographed on the backdrop of an infinite star- field, losing itself in a vanishing point far, far away. A modest effect, yet those words instantly paint a picture so incredibly vivid that it would kick-start a hugely popular and successful franchise. And it is nothing without its iconic fanfare by John Williams. Take a listen to Holst's Mars movement and see how Williams transforms all the heroism, all the grandiosity and glory into one of the most recognisable themes of all time. And then we pan down and observe a little ship being pursued by a gigantic one, something so immediately identifiable, and we already are entranced. It is a film that is at once lifted and tainted by Lucas' love for it. We see an entire world envisioned, and the production design so effortlessly ushering us into this aged future. When we crash land in the desert planet Tatooine, we recognise the arid setting, before just a hint of alien and droid life instantly transports our minds to millions of stars and galaxies away. Something so simple as adding an extra sun bathes the horizon for miles and miles with an air of mystery and other worldliness. When we encounter civilisation of sorts, Lucas gently pushes in an intergalactic band, a sleazy bar, aliens and creatures of all sizes - the usual alcoholic suspects. And when we need to take to the skies, the matte painted backgrounds do much of the work; hordes of stormtrooper minions, a grimy and worn Millennium Falcon, the great big grey walls of the Death Star buzzing with machinery and lights. Lucas would later insert his own little (or not so) CGI creations not because of any real need, but because the technology was now available, but this only highlights how perfect the world-building was in the first place. The new digitally rendered beasts look impressive yet noticeable shiny and over- expressive in the worn and dusty Mos Eisley, and sometimes the camera will linger unnecessarily as if to say "Look at what we can do now!" But we had been long immersed before that. The story is of course a familiar one. It has roots in Joseph Campbell's Hero and Flash Gordon and even Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress; a story with mythic origins. And there are tell-tale signs of Lucas own American Graffiti a few years back. But Star Wars has evolved beyond those and becomes a treasure in its own right. The original created a world beyond the imaginable scope of that time, a sci-fi universe so living and breathing that people flocked again and again to experience it in theatres. Little details and mistakes become cultish and infamous themselves; the stormtrooper who bumps his head on the roof, Solo's comment about his ship's speed, and when a character's characterisation is marred, fans respond; Han shot first. Looking back on it years gone by, it is inescapable to notice the ageing special effects. That is simply a fact of changing technologies. Yet I still marvel on how impeccably and competently Star Wars is crafted. The sound design is alien and fantastically so; simple acts of pulling on steel cable and microphone interference create these iconic noises, and of course the bright and noisy hum of the lightsabers. Years on we had incoherent and frenetically choreographed battles that seem more like acrobatic dance recitals, and the blades of light flashed at a hundred miles an hour, but here we have Guinness characterised in these simple but powerful strokes, the intent on his face, the recognition of an old pupil, the concentration of a chess match as they probe for a weakness. The space-fight scenes are edited like a dogfight from WW2 with precision by Marcia Lucas (a remarkable presence you don't notice until her absence), and the simply act of placing these fighter pilots on the backdrop of a whizzing and laser filled backdrop is thrilling. As the motion control photography soars through the space and trenches of the death star, these miniatures and models looks immense and engaging. A gigantic bear-like creature and a small white droid speak not a word, but become fan favourites anyway. There is Darth Vader, who becomes even more menacing when comparing the original voice before the iconic wheezing of James Earl Jones was brought in. There is the plucky young hero, who's fate is only hinted at here, and it takes another two films for the story to become more mature, and his circle to complete. The roguish Han Solo is likewise expanded further in the sequels, as is his relationship with the Princess Leia as they continue to bicker. But is is here in this special film that it all began. The magic of Star Wars is that it takes place in a galaxy so far, far away, but it has become so close over the years, and so familiar.</fullReview>

The story is about a farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who discovers that the used robot recently purchased by his family plays back a message from one Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), begging for help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke asks his father's friend Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) about this, and he discovers that Ben and Obi-Wan are one and the same. Kenobi tells Luke of the battle of the rebels against the ruling Empire and the spiritual energy called "The Force." Soon Luke, Kenobi, and a mercenary named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) join forces to rescue Princess Leia from the Empire's mammoth warship, the Death Star, controlled by evil genius Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones).</fullReview>

After they rescue her, Luke , Han Solo and princess Leia travel to meet Rebel Alliance, princess Leia's team, and hand them the plans which will help them destroy the Death Star. Luke together with Rebel Alliance destroy it and escape. The "Empire strikes back" and "Return of the Jedi" come next and the epic tales continue. &#x3a4;he fantasy galaxy George Lucas invented, along with the different languages and technological creations (light saber, droids) are far beyond our imagination, but if all these existed, we would definitely die to pay a visit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fairy Tale Set In Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May the fourth be with you everybody! Today, on Star Wars day, I figure it only fitting to review the film that started the whole starry craze, Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress! Nah, just kidding, it's Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope of course. It has been said countless times that Star Wars was based upon the Kurosawa samurai films as well as the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 40s, but in my eyes, it's an all around fairy tale in space. Think about it, you've got the dashing, optimistic hero in Luke Skywalker, the wise, old mentor and hermit in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the damsel in distress mistress in Princess Leia, and the terrifying wizard with black attire in Darth Vader. It's like a Brothers Grimm tale or a tale written by L. Frank Baum, who you all know as the mind behind The Wizard of Oz. But what makes Star Wars great is something I can't sum up in one single review, but I'll certainly give it a try for your sake. This is 1977's Star Wars, the film that changed cinema forever. I can relate to this film on so many levels. I see a lot of myself in the characters of Luke Skywalker, C-3P0 and even the cocky Han Solo, a rebellious lad with a devil may care point of view. I can also look up to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has become a lot like his master Qui-Gon Jinn by this episode. He has gone from a brash, outspoken padawan who viewed many creatures as useless to a wise old man who saw the potential in all creatures. I love Obi-Wan's wisdom and it's wisdom I live by every minute of everyday of my life. My favorite line of his is "Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?" He has such a rich perspective of everything and his knowledge of the Force can give you the push you need to go about even the deadliest of tasks. It's his guidance that finally allows Luke to demolish the Death Star at the film's finale and it's probably something that will carry onto mentor Luke in the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7. Obi-Wan is the kind mentor we all wish we could get knowledge from so we could become wiser souls. Darth Vader is a menacing entity and is up there with the Wicked Witch of the West as one of film's greatest foes. The emotionless mask and deep dark voice of James Earl Jones really makes him ever more terrifying than he already is, but if you saw what he once was in Episodes 1,2 and 3, you tend to fear him less and less. It's hard to believe that underneath that breathing helmet is the charred face of Hayden Christensen, a once proud hero with a charming charisma. Little did we know that it would take him two more films until he finally reached his redemption and even than, it was before his untimely demise. Darth Vader is a motion picture icon, not only because of his wickedness and evilness, but because of his tragic past and his fight to gain back what he lost all those years ago. That's what makes an incredible villain, a villain that never wanted to be bad, but was thrust into badness because of one fatal decision.The other characters are also worthy of mention. Mark Hamill prevails as the adventurous, yet good hearted Luke Skywalker who would become the galaxy's most acclaimed hero towards the film's conclusion. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is a lot like Dorothy Gale or Alice in Lewis Carroll's classic Wonderland stories. Sure, she gets captured, but she's perfectly capable of defending herself and even defending her companions. She's a fearless woman who is not even afraid of kissing her long lost brother straight on the lips. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the film's most memorable human character and with his headstrong and hipster attitude, he was what a lot of children wanted to be like when they first saw Star Wars back in 77. He's the ideal punk, but he's also the gallant hero and tough guy who's not scared to shoot down some green aliens (Who cares who shot first!) or stormtroopers. Personally, I became more fascinated with the non human characters like Chewbacca (Why didn't he get a medal!), R2-D2 and C-3P0, for like the humans, they were always trying to get the spotlight and give their share to the story. I feel like C-3PO is the most underrated character in all of Star Wars, for he is often seen as a symbol of homosexuality and annoyance. But Star Wars has a timeless story first and for most and this story gets better and better every time you experience it. Every time you experience it, you spot things you never spotted beforehand and that adds to the film's overall charm and magic. Even though it was made in the 70s, it still has the touch of a story that will last forever and never wear out. With all it's grand special effects (no matter what version of the film it is) and alien lifeforms, Star Wars is a storybook with a grand scale and a powerful, prudent moral that all creatures have a force flowing through them, allowing them to reach out and achieve the impossible.I'm not quite sure but I think that's why we love it so much. That's the reason I love it at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars, now known as Episode IV: A New Hope, is the perfect showcase of everything that makes a movie great. It is one of those occasions where everything in the film seems to of perfectly fell in place(although if you know the story behind the making of it, it wasn't so smooth). The acting, directing, writing, production design, special effects, and anything else I've forgotten, is simply top-notch. This movie did so many things for film, most notably the special effects, but it also gave us three of the greatest young actors of the late 70s and 80s, Mark Hammill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Then the film also created the blockbuster, and is the definition of what a blockbuster should be(humor, emotion, action, heart). On the last point the action is probably the most exhilarating and exciting action I've ever seen on film, the Death Star Trench Run is the definite highlight of the film. This film is just simply superb and is picture perfect, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable films of all-time. It's hard to believe that this all sprung from one man's imagination, George Lucas(writer/director of the film). STAR WARS!!!!!!!!! Rating: A picture perfect 10 out of 10!!!!!!!</fullReview>

I can still remember the anticipation as a little kid waiting in line to see this amazing movie I kept reading about.It definitely lived up to every bit of hype I had heard up to that point. I got my popcorn and my soda, sat down with my cousin and we watched in awe at everything we saw on the screen.I am definitely a Star Wars kid, and feel very lucky to have actually seen the original in the theater, something that today's kids can never experience because all big event films are all children of Star Wars after all. But there will never be anything like this first movie, the greatest film of all time! If you haven't seen it yet, see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In 1977, in a galaxy far, far away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice "scoundrel"), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece. He's one of those movie-characters people will remember as long as films will keep being made and his unsettling breathing noise still echoes in our memories...The beginning of a wonderful saga, whose only rival is The Lord of the Rings.May the Force be with you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I have always loved this movie. I always will love this movie. It is simply amazing. The actors, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher all did an excellent job. However my favorite character was Darth Vader. He is evil with being ugly or digusting. The high level of quality from a film made in 1977 is astounding. Still being from the seventies, this film has some pretty interesting hair. But it is THE film that defined how science fiction movies are supposed to be. I did my term paper on the affects of Star Wars on the science fiction genre and the movie industry itself. Needless to say I didn't have to work that hard, the movies speaks for itself. If you haven't seen it, watch it. I love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll tell you why this movie is so great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was four years old when I saw this movie and I remembered the whole thing, from beginning to end. It was summer and my family was spending a month at our camp. One day my sister (2 years old at the time) and I had been fighting all day. My parents sent us off to bed for a nap before dinner and I grudgingly complied. I was awoken by my father, he was asking me if I wanted to go see a movie. "It has spaceships, and robots, and lasers, you'll love it!" I looked at him through swollen eyes and asked, "does Jenna get to go to?" When I heard him say no, I knew I was in for a HUGE treat. We arrived at a nearly empty theater, and took our seats. When the first jarring chord of the theme hit me, and my father began reading the opening story, I was captivated. It was the happiest day of my life. To hell with all your nitpicking. When something makes that great an impression on a four year old, you know it has to be something truly special. By the way, I'm wearing the Boba Fett t-shirt my son's mother gave me as a gift. And no, I'm not some greasy, Star Wars obsessed dork. Well, not any more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucus stunned audiences with this outer space saga when it was released and deservingly so. It was a film quite like nothing anyone had seen before a truly visual and cinematic achievement. The story begins on Chapter IV and takes us on an action packed journey filled with aliens, intrigue and adventure. The success of Star Wars is ultimately due to the wonderful imagination of its director and of course to the extremely well orchestrated cast. I think George Lucas was riding high with his previous film success 'American Graffiti, but this is far removed from Star Wars, no similarities at all. I was simply captivated the first time I saw this film in the cinema's back in '77 and still am?although the big screen does give it more of an impact. Everything about Star Wars will definitely appeal to a vast audience from children to adults alike?.it's a 'must see film' in my opinion. Then when you're finished watching Star Wars, just think; you have only 5 more chapters to go. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was quite possibly the greatest film of all time, I agree the acting was somewhat lacking, but the effects were beyond amazing, you got to remember, this was 1977. Lucas' vision was realized to its full potential and William's score carried the film to being the most successful film ever made, behind the hunk of crap titanic. The story was one the most original I've ever come across and the movie itself sparked the career of Harrison Ford, quite possibly one of the biggest actors in the 1980's and 90's. Although this was the first and last original Star Wars film to be directed by Lucas, it was quite possibly the best film to hit the market in the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different things to like about this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just re-watched this on DVD. I first saw it when I was 10 in 1981, and I still love this move (one of my all time favorites), but I guess I love it for some reasons different than most other people:1) The movie has no love story to speak of. This is such a huge bonus that it cannot be stressed enough. For kids a love story is sheer boredom - and there are unfortunately very few films without one. For adults the love story is usually pure BS (as the over romanticizing that goes on in Hollywood movies make any love story a nauseous experience. Episodes V and VI scrape the line of how much love story a movie can take before being totally corny. Lets not talk about how much the love story ruins episodes I and II (and will probably kill episode III also))2) There are no lengths in the movie. It dumps you right in the middle of the conflict after the opening (no opening credits to bore your pants off! This is almost unique amongst films). It practically grabs you before you have gotten comfortable in your seat. The DVD does add some lengths with gratuitous CGI which actually hurt the film more than they help (the ride into Mos Eisley and the Falcon approaching Yavin seem interminable compared to the fast paced cuts of the original version. These scenes break the rhythm of the movie badly, they add neither story nor depth nor information - luckily they are far enough apart not to hurt it too much)3) The special effects are still spectacular after all these years. Not in what they look like but how they are shot, the dynamics of it and the ideas for cool POVs (taking old aerial battle films as scripts was a stroke of genius)4) Detail. This thing is all about attention to detail. There is nothing out of place here. Nothing glossed over by large plastic sheeting. everything has structure and depth and looks used. The world it portrays becomes believable. economies are worked out. This has the look of a good role playing adventure.5) The plot isn't explained by the characters. Characters involved in such a plot for some time are supposed to know what the background is without having to talk to each other about it (nobody needs to be told that the empire is evil, this is common knowledge with these people as they have lived under it for decades). Putting things into the scroller at the beginning which could not be said by the characters because it would be akin to them holding up neon signs displaying "For the audiences' information" was a stroke of genius. I cringe at other movies that insert 'let me explain what is happening' scenes.Overall I can see nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack and the sound effects are amazing. Some scenes seem to be re-recorded with different sound standards and thus stand out uncomfortably, but this isn't much of a problem. The actors do their jobs well (especially Harrison Ford when he flashes that roguish grin - he is practically the archetype of the lovable, charismatic scoundrel). This DVD is definitely a keeper (10/10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie came out a few years before i was even born, but somehow one of my first memories was seeing this movie. Every kid I knew loved star wars boy and girl. So basically if i had to sum up my childhood in two words it would be star wars. From the cantina scene to the death star first rate special effects. The opening crawl probably still brings a tear to my eye. Han solo just rocked and Luke skywalker was just adorable. I love the scene in the garbage chute, but my all time favorite scene is when Luke goes outside and looks out to the horizon (the famous shot of the two suns) and the classic music cues up. Oh my god it gives me the chills. awesome!</fullReview>

I have to say #4 isn't my favorite of the films, but it is the one that started the greatest sci fi epic ever. I think for it's time the special effects were magnificent. And the acting was done by REAL actors from back in the day. Now a days all I seem to see coming up in the thespian ranks are pretty boys and girls with fake boobs. What happened. Anyways, i think everyone should watch this movie at least once. If your not "enlightened" by it you'll at least be entertained by a few good humor spots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are only a handful of movies I've given a perfect 10 out of 10, and Star Wars is in my opinion one of the best movie of all time. It is a movie with non stop excitement that will make you want to watch it over and over. The original Star Wars is an instant classic. If you haven't seen this movie, you have to go find some one who has it, and watch it. The amazing space story has original ideas and now in days I can relate a lot of action scenes back to Star Wars. Remember the opening scene of Man of Steel, when Jor-El was fleeing from General Zod's army. It looked like something straight out of Star Wars. I loved Man of Steel as much as the next person, but Star Wars is that original sci-fi adventure that you will love for ever. This first part of the original trilogy will set up two more movies that will lead to one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Please take my word for it and if you haven't seen it already go watch this movie as soon as possible. For the sake of your movication (yes I'm quoting Pitch Perfect) please watch Star Wars you will not be disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the introductory fanaticism of laser works, as well as a bevy of special sound effects, and elaborate sci-fi costuming, which started a whole new revelation in the cinema world. Steven Spielberg mastered the art of galactic warfare through a limitless use of creative weaponry!! The enormous popularity of this film opened the floodgates for copious movies about space battle in the ensuing years ahead!! Initially intrigued by the hit television show "Star Trek", the American public took to the movie "Star Wars" because it pinpointed a sort of personification of a video arcade wonderland, as a result, "Star Wars" utterly fascinated the movie audience!! Harrison Ford is one of the all time box office legends in Hollywood, his big break was with the movie "Star Wars",,, Later, of course, he captivated millions with his stellar performance in "Raiders of the Lost Ark"!! Movies like "Star Wars" do not come along very often, when they do, they set a precedent in the film industry!! I found the film "Star Wars" to be way ahead of it's time with regard to the optical gimmickry that they so superbly effectuated!! The music to "Star Wars" is classic in it's charismatic demeanor, and, by and large, it is understandable that the most prominent critics in the film industry rank "Star Wars" as one of the greatest movies ever made!! "Star Wars" is always chosen as one of the top twenty films in the American movie market by the esoteric and discriminating critics of AFI!! Endless accolades go out to "Star Wars" and the incredible ingenuity it possesses to entertain the American movie goer!! WITHOUT QUESTION!! FIVE STARS!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone in film-making- a superlative sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame them?the attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark too?another solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact, why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heroic dynamic rush of pure adrenaline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSWhat can be said about Star Wars that hasn't already been said elsewhere?For a start, on its arrival in 1977, it was light years ahead of its time. It is a film from which cinema history can literally be divided into two epochs, kind of like BC and AD. Pre-Star Wars cinema was a very different medium. Post Star Wars, studios became ever more reliant on big blockbusters to remain afloat. This has led to some truly brain dead films and, as Peter Bogdanovitch described the `juvenilisation' of cinema. The success of Star Wars was a two-edged sword. Its fair to say without it there would have been no Alien, Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET, Terminator, Jurassic Park, Matrix and Lord of the Rings films. On the other hand there would also have been no Judge Dredd, Lost in Space, Planet of the Apes remake and other assorted drivel that turns up every summer clogging up the multiplexes.Star Wars (or if you're going to be a purist, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope although the subtitle was only added in the 1981 reissue) thankfully, belongs firmly in the former category. If its legacy means we have to suffer second rate imitators from time to time, I believe it's a small price to pay for such a magnificent film. Star Wars is an unmitigated thrill ride - a heroic, dynamic rush of pure adrenaline that has been known to make grown adults degenerate into thrill-happy eight year olds.As I have argued many times, Star Wars is not science fiction in the purest sense of the word. It is much better described by writer/director George Lucas as `space fantasy'. It borrows elements from fairy tales ranging from The Wizard of Oz to The Lord of the Rings. It also is very derivative of classic westerns (such as The Searchers) as well as Samurai films like Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. What George Lucas did was take these elements and stick them in outer space in a way no one had done since the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s. He then threw in the most groundbreaking special effects revolution of all time and this is what he ended up with.The story is comparatively simple. Young farm boy Luke Skywalker lives with his boring Uncle and Aunt on the desert planet Tatooine longing to follow in his dead father's heroic footsteps. He gets the opportunity when two droids show up carrying a message from a Princess who has been imprisoned by the evil Darth Vader. Luke teams up with space pirate Han Solo, his `walking carpet' sidekick Chewbacca, and his mentor Ben Kenobi (who is a former Jedi knight guided by the mysterious `Force') to rescue her.The much-maligned acting of Mark Hamill as Luke is actually often so bad its good, particularly in the Death Star scenes. He makes a very appealing na?ve hero. Harrison Ford's career was launched on the back of his performance as dashing rogue Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher's witty performance as Princess Leia portrays her as anything but a damsel in distress. Elsewhere the droids C3PO and R2 D2 provide superb comic relief. The banter between all the heroes is extremely funny, a factor largely (but not entirely) lacking from the current, more sombre prequels. Gravitas is added with the scenes between Ben Kenobi (the superb Alec Guinness) and the mysterious and evil Darth Vader (wonderfully voiced by James Earl Jones). Vader is, in my opinion, the single best screen villain in cinema history. His frightening and dark presence (helped by his menacing breathing and mask) gave children everywhere nightmares. Vader's character is not developed a huge amount in this film, but in the subsequent installments he proves the most interesting character in the entire Star Wars saga. The other villain worthy of special mention is Peter Cushings' brilliantly nasty Grand Moff Tarkin, the arrogant governor of the Death Star.The special effects, as I've already mentioned, were light years ahead of their time in 1977. In my opinion nothing equalled Star Wars effects wise until 1993's Jurassic Park. Even now, the effects still look fantastic. From the unforgettable opening shot to the final exhilarating space battle, the film is a triumph. The Death Star battle remains the best space dogfight ever put on film. Even though we've all seen it hundreds of times, as the pilots are picked off one by one until only Luke remains we get closer and closer to the edge of our seats. As, the odds are piled up against our hero, Han Solo's last minute intervention and Luke's triumph is, in my opinion, the second most exhilarating scene in cinema history (after the flying bike scene in ET).The production design, costumes and look of the film are terrific (with Imperial greys, whites and blacks contrasting nicely to our more colourful heroes). The outfits spawned millions of nerds wanting to buy full Stormtrooper regalia for ludicrous prices. Also, the editing and ground breaking sound effects are all nothing short of landmark cinema (eg, the breathless space battles and the lightsabres respectively). Also, John Williams' thundering music score is magnificent. The staggeringly epic main theme, the Luke Skywalker theme, the Leia theme and many others have all become touchstones for other composers to imitate.The special edition released in 1997 made some changes to effects shots (which were OK changes on the whole) and added a new, unnecessary scene with Jabba the Hutt. Nevertheless, it doesn't really matter which version you see, the effect is the same.The spiritual overtones in Star Wars are fascinating. From the Christ allegory of Kenobi to Luke's choosing to have faith in `the Force' rather than trust his computer, this film is chock full of interesting interpretations about God, the Universe, and the triumph of faith, love and courage over faceless technology. Star Wars is a reassuring film. That more than anything I believe accounts for its success. People may be cynical, but underneath they desperately want to believe in absolute good and absolute evil.That's why it's as timeless today as it was in 1977.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original version was brilliant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.Of course, I also knew that the film wasn't perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas' budget just didn't quite go far enough, or where there just wasn't enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.For the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer's sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn't look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.Unfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse "When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!". Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you'd have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.The story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.Overall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite simply a masterpiece.By far the film that has progressed the film industry the farthest. This is the breakthrough in films. This film set raised the benchmark for standard of films that is still not being reached by many films today, almost 30 years on.This introduces us to our characters and sets the story for out trilogy. A little slow to get started i grant you. An exciting opening scene is followed by what to my mind is a little too much of Threepio and Artoo traipsing through the dunes of Tatooine. After that though it is a non stop ride of action, adventure, drama and comedy. The excitement of learning about the force will never be surpassed and never has an idea been so gripping.Watch this film if you only watch one film in your life. Of course if you are only going to watch one film in your like then after seeing this i am afraid that will drastically be changed into only watching 6 films in your life!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic bit of fun sci-fi ? a space western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices. The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems. The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire. However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star. Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape. When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi. Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking ? lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation. However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space. The story is simple but contains clear characters. The thing that sets it apart is the fun ? the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front. The action scenes are mostly great ? not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle. The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars! The effects still look good today ? in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer. Sound effects, comedy, music ? it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes' ? Chasing Amy!). He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role. However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas. Ford is perfect as Han Solo ? he adds character and flair to some dry performances. Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role. Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'. But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood. Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The GREATEST summer blockbuster of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Jaws may have started the summer blockbuster, Star Wars perfected it. Out of all the movies I've seen, this movie has the BEST cast in a movie. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, RD-D2, C-3PO, and Darth Vadar are memorable and portrayed perfectly. They are characters who we care for and want to be with. The story is just as good as it's cast. It's well-paced and contains no dull moment. There was never a scene where I felt was unnecessary. We start off the story with Luke and stick with him the whole way through. We watch him change from a farm boy to a hero. The ONLY bad thing I can say about this movie is the Special Edition. I know you heard this a million times, but the changes in the special edition, INSULT the movie. They are REALLY out of place and bother the heck out of me. Other than that, this is a flawless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is simply a fantastic film, on every level this film is amazing.Each of the characters in this film are so well developed and so interesting that you just cannot wait for the next scene with them in it, the interactions between the characters us at times tense and at times downright hilarious, leaving no room for boring or lacking dialogue. The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.Surprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire's space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.One of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.The story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride. Whether its the attack on the Death Star or the Cantina of Mos Eisley the story takes you through the twists and turns of this classic space opera.If I could recommend one sci-fi adventure film to someone, it would be this, it's an absolute must see.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my co-workers, who's about my same age(40ish), was talking about an argument he was having with his 17yr-old son. The argument was whether or not the new "Marvel" films were bigger and better, and whether or not the whole "buzz' around them was bigger and better than the original Star Wars trilogy.I don't think the younger generation will ever fully understand the scale of the first trilogy. They MAY get a better understanding after JJ Abrams returns the trilogy to it's awesome roots.The first Star Wars film, known simply as Star Wars, was a land- breaking milestone of film-making, with a story, characters, and effects(not all effects are cgi people) that melded together into the greatest interplanetary adventure of all-time(at least until the sequel came out).Today's generation can pick between Spiderman, Ironman, Captain America, and the Guardians of the Galaxy to find the film that they love the most, but when I was a kid there was one film, or should I say one trilogy, that stood far, FAR above the rest. The number one argument that is made today by the younger generation is that the effects are outdated etc, but it was in fact Lucas' commitment(at least early on) to use models and make-up to create a world like no other. SOmething that CGI just can't capture. When I saw Guardians in the theater I thought it was amazing, but later I saw it on the 4K 60" TV, and like many flicks, it kinda accentuated the small flaws of the cgi and the set-pieces, whereas I watch Star Wars and it actually shows how amazing the film was in that aspect.CGI isn't necessarily an improvement. It's films like Star Wars and Blade Runner, whose "Gritty" qualities actually add realism to an unreal world. The only problems I have with the first three Star Wars films are the "digitally enhanced versions" that Lucas added later. That's why I eagerly await the original untouched films' release on Blue-Ray.Scores usually drop a bit over time, and as it stands now, the weakest of the original trilogy is scored 8.4(Return of the Jedi), and that is higher than Avengers, Guardians, Cap 2, and Ironman, and FOR GOOD REASON.And the original Star Wars is a superior film in every way as well. No Hokey opening like "Avengers", no lack of storyline like Guardians, no under-menacing not required to act Villain like Cap 2, and while I can't nitpick anything about Ironman, overall it just doesn't stand- up against Star Wars, it's a beatdown.Simply put, it's EVERYTHING about it that makes it better. The acting, the story, the character development, the scale of the production, the start, the finish, the middle and every minute in- between.Part of the problem here is that the added material in the re- released versions really detracts from the original films flow. The stupid dancing crap in Jedi, the Walking Jabba in Star Wars, etc... it did nothing but hurt the original films. The only added footage that didn't detract from the original films was some of the added bells and whistles to "Cloud City" in Empire, and Biggs early appearance in empire, which was wasn't an 'enhancement', it was cut-footage from the original tapes, other than that, the added stuff only hurt the overall quality of the original films. He basically added stuff that was the kind of stuff that ruined the second trilogy, so the original untouched films are still the real gem here. And that's not what these kids are watching either, because the untouched versions are HARD TO FIND!DOn't even exist on DVD or blu-ray. One of the times I'm glad I still have my VHS. Uh-Oh, Gotta-go, Re-tro:)And WHile I love the new marvel films, they don't have what Star Wars and it's two sequels(i'm a purist) have.. that tangible something you CAN put your finger on - because it's REAL.. they built those ships, they designed and made those costumes and set-pieces. That kind of attention to detail, and scale just isn't in the Marvel films. Sure, it's cool to see Hulk crumbling down a building, but this galaxy really doesn't "SEEM" so far away in Star Wars. It has that 'realistic' edge to it. It's the reason that you couldn't make a legit remake of Ben- Hur, Ten Commandments, or other older "epic" films... it would literally cost Billions.Even some of my favorite Sci-Fi's of all-time like Blade Runner and 2001, while milestone's in their own right(especially visually), just do not have the sheer entertainment value that Star Wars has.97/100Star Wars and Empire are 2 of the 42 out of the 3400 films that I have ranked 10/10, and they are two of the most deserving, if not THE most deserving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of a new era!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the genius George Lucas was about to go help Spielberg make the majestic " Raiders", he decided to do something, something that many were surprised when it was announced and didn't take a lot of faith on, which after his release was an absolute success both at the box office and critical, and today the masterpiece of Lucas is a classic that will live forever in the history of cinema! "Star Wars" (not Star Wars IV A New Hope, please), begins with the yellow title suddenly appearing on the screen with an amazing soundtrack from the master John Williams giving us a resume of the history we are about to watch. It all starts with a small spaceship full of rebel soldiers start being invaded by imperial troops led by the sinister and cruel lord Darth Vader (David Prowse). Suddenly the film transports us directly to another side of the galaxy where we have the story of the young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a simple machine repairman teenager who lives with his uncles. A day after his uncle buy two servant robots, R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), which inadvertently bring Luke the chance to realize his dreams of becoming a rebel and fight against the tyrant of the empire, a mission that will take him to the ends of the galaxy and will bring new friends but at the same time extreme dangers.From the beginning, "Star Wars" revolutionized cinema forever, especially the genre of sci - fi that at the time was just "Star Trek" with great success. Lucas of course certain elements form "Trek", since the crew of a spaceship with name style and friendship among the crew, but everything else was a tremendous attack of originality. Unlike "Star Trek" Lucas took the story and the great adventure with a lighter and fantasy tone, not childish but humorous, fun and even a certain religious point when the Jedi Obi - Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) appears in Luke's life with secrets of him and Luke's father past.And just like "Star Trek", Lucas gave his masterpiece unforgettable characters, of course: Luke, R2, C-3PO, Obi-Wan. But also the unforgettable Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the bounty hunter from space who ALWAYS shoots first and asks questions later, giving the film a great humorous touch and a lot of fun (never one character caused such influences as Han Solo did), and even Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) no royal woman before her in a film had never taken up arms showing she knew very well how to take care of herself. Not only the good guys who stand out perfectly in the story, but also the great and unforgettable antagonist ever put to film, Darth Vader, no villain was so cruel and yet so adored by fans.Characters and stories fitting perfectly, but the adventure to be full completed it needed the huge Galactic scenario, which is not lacking in this film. I think Lucas should have thanked Kubrick about "2001" because if it were not for this film, visual effects would never be the same. And thanks to that Lucas gave the film with beautiful scenery and a vast galaxies and an unforgettable and thrilling final battle.The classic that redefined cinema forever with a story well-crafted and told, full of suspense, humor and adventure thanks to its unforgettable characters and stunning visual effects , the legendary George Lucas gave the world a film with tremendous quality and early one of the best trilogies ever made.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Underestimate The Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about George Lucas's 'Star Wars' that hasn't already been said? It's one of the most authentically shot films, whether we're talking about visual effects, cinematography, sound, music, art direction and of course Lucas's direction. Perhaps this was the movie that tagged Lucas as one of the all-time greatest directors. Revisiting this movie more than twenty years later brought back a lot of memories. Obviously it has a lot of nostalgic value.More than two decades after its release, Lucas attempts to make its prequels and the consequences are disastrous. With CGI dominating sci-fi films since the late 90s, the look of Lucas's later Starwar films (movies 1,2 and 3 made in the 90's and 2000's) could not match up to the early classics. They lacked the authentic look and atmosphere and suffered from poor editing. Most of all they were so boring (lacking in energy, lacklustre story, dreadful performances etc) that they failed to engage the viewer.Coming back to the movie at hand, it is easily sci-fi action adventure at its best. It's rich in dialogue. The level of energy and tension is excellently maintained. Even the quieter scenes have you engaged with beautiful visuals and what's also amazing is how simple they are, no complex or intricate designing but at the same time very detailed.The characters are a delight. The casting is solid. Harrison Ford is charming and funny as the laidback and slightly self-centered Han. Carrie Fisher redefines bring a princess in films. Before that, princesses were cast as damsels in distress. Mark Hamill captures Luke's innocence and essence very well. Peter Mayhew, James Earl Jones, and Alec Guiness are great. Aside from the human cast who portray the characters so well, who could forget C-3PO and R2-D2 (voiced brilliantly by Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker)? I could keep going on and on but I'll leave it here to watch 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back'. So long...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of a legend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many brilliant sci fi movies, but there a few that are as well written, well acted and well done as the Star Wars Saga. Action fantasy films that have been a movie inspiration for over 30 years. This is my review on the fist classic hit- Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope.The plot goes like this;Along time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a viscous government called the empire controls the universe. A newly found rebellion stakes back at the brutal empire by stealing plans to their Ultimate Super weapon, The death star, which has the mechanical power to destroy a whole planet in a single second. As the empire hunts the plans down, A princess in charge of the rebellion is ambushed by an imperial battleship. She and her accomplices are captured, but manage to hide the plans in a small droid, recording a short help request to an old man on the planet below. The put the droids in an escape pod and send them down to the planet without the imperials finding out. The droids crash land on the dusty planet and bump into a young man and a old Jedi warrior. They watch the recording of the princess's plea for help. They 2 men set off to find and release the princess from imperial captivity.The plot is rather simple, which is a change from the movie's sequels. The movie's plot is recognisable to other famous movies and is sometime cliché. However, this is not a bad thing. It is not cliché in the since that it is EXACTLY the same as other films, but instead is a sort-of homage the the classics and taking a different approach to the same idea. For example, in the John Wayne film, The Searchers, John Wayne returns to his encampment finding it burnt to the ground and all his loved one dead. The same thing happens in this film; The young man Luke drives home to find his farm is burnt to the ground and his adopted parents killed. It uses classic plot lines and forms them in a very smart way. The acting is pretty good. It contains master performances from great actors like Peter Cushing,Alec Guinass and Harrison ford. All of whom are great, most notably Harrison's and Peter's performances. Harrison produces a grumpy, sarcastic gunfighter type character who always comes up with a droll comment to everything. You always find yourself waiting to see what he says back to a person in a conversion which is rare in film characters. Peter is already a A* actor but after this movie he I find that becomes an even better one. There is a sleazy feel to the character and as soon as he is first seen in the film you know that he is an evil character, which is a great achievement for a villain. Of coarse, I cannot continue without mentioning the other villain of the film. The main one at that who just happens to hold the title of one of the best villains of movie history; Darth Vader! He is a heavy walking, heavy breathing, force choking, brutal killing type character who has death teeming off him. He is a cruel douche-bag but every time you see him you don't know wither to hate or love him. When he executes horrid directives like the force choke, He also adds a dark remark related to the offender's crime. Well written character with fantastic duologue and great lightsabre moves. He is NOT a force to be reckoned with!!The film contains loads of creative Sci Fi elements that, in my opinion, make the film the great thing it is. In the cantina scene, there a A lot of strange creatures that only have a couple of seconds screen time, but really intrigue you. It's not a major part of the film, but it still makes the film seem more real. Now-a-days, directors shove CGI in your face and have no creative appeal to it at all. In the old films like these, they become really imaginative, making latex models and sometimes Stopmotion animation. This is the icing on the cake for me. Props to the animators.The Plot never really drags throughout the film and flows at a steady pace. There are also some brilliant action scenes. In the death star scenes there are some tense shootouts and fights that keep you at the edge of your seat. The battles are fast paced; The heroes can be shooting one minute and falling into a trash compacter the next. The most notable battle in the film however is the battle over the Death star. This is when the rebels launch a massive attack on the death star. This was probably one of the first good movie space battles, with tones of explosions and cannon fire to keep your adrenaline rushing.With Great acting, The best villain of all time and fantastic action this movie is really hard to beat. A Sci Fi classic that needs to be seen.</fullReview>

The studio insisted that the episode numeral not be added until later after the film's success. The main plot begins with droid robots named R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) that help a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and a cynical space pilot named Hans Solo (Harrison Ford I) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) a hairy bigfoot creature rescue a rebel princess, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) that has been taken hostage by Darth Lord Vader (Dave Prowse and the voice of James Earl Jones' voice). The evil Emperor is determined to dissolve the Imperial Senate and crush the Republic Alliance. The Empire will then rule with fear of planet destruction by the Death Star Battle Station that will lead to intergalactic domination. The theme is evil (dark side of The Force) versus good (The Force), with which human nature dictates the decision to do good or evil deeds. Luke is a young man that works on a farm and feels obligated to stay on the farm for another season to help his Uncle Owen (Phil Brown) and Aunt Peru (Shelagh Fraser). Luke is torn by this decision and is told by an old Jedi Knight, Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that his father was betrayed and murdered by a pupil of Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The Empire attacks the farm and kills his aunt and uncle, so Luke decides to avenge his family's death and learn The Force and train as a Jedi warrior like his father for the rebellion against the evil Empire. Eventually, Luke becomes familiar with the good side of The Force and saves the princess. He then uses his piloting skills to shoot a virtually impossible vent shaft, destroying the Death Star and becomes the hero for the rebel forces. The thematic ideas and visual designs used were camera techniques and angles, including panning and tilting in a montage that creates hyperspace to get from one place to another at a super speed, similar to Star Trek. The high tech look has camera views that use the idea of World War II bombers to give the viewer a cinematic feel for the atmosphere, which conveys spaceship views unveiling the motion control camera. Stop motion is used along with puppets for the introduction of a creature named Jabba the Hutt.The film's sounds effects are groundbreaking for the time with the environmental tone of each spaceship having its own high or low-pitch tone that creates a specific sound for the dramatic feel of being in the each aircraft cockpit for the scene. The cockpit voices of the pilots are recorded over an actual shortwave radio, which gives the illusion that the transmissions were natural broken radio talk. Costume design was complicated and difficult to pull off due to the budget that was originally assigned. The C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) robot costumes were so loud that they had had to use voice-over to cover up the sound during editing. The thematic ideas were depicted as a futuristic montage of images and sounds for the technological aspects of space battles. Lucas also studied motifs of Greek mythological creatures to design the aliens, sets and robotic character shots of many of the fictional characters. These ideas compare to Raiders of the Lost Ark in theme by saving the girl and saving the day for the natives, which is also a cliffhanger action film that he created. Therefore, these styles of thematic elements were carried into many other space action creations that Lucas has directed in future films, including the Star Wars Trilogy.

		<shortDescription>Is it as controversial as they say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By reading the title, you immediately think, what? But let me expand on that, there are continuous debates of forums everywhere. Is New Hope the only good Star Wars movie, and has Lucas ruined it with of the new CGI effects. I have to say I don't think so. Now of course I understand the fact that CGI has ruined the nostalgia of the original, but I still feel that the other Star Wars movies are great, especially the 6th movie.I realised that I had side tracked a bit, but let me return to the main point. The movie is great and I feel that it was a brilliant idea by Lucas to make the 4th movie first. It gave the movie a quirk that will always make it stand out.The cast are all excellent, but you can tell there is friction in the movie. Especially concerning Harrison Ford. Watching the Justin Lee Collins show years ago, I remember him saying that there were often arguments about the fact that Harrison thought he should had been Luke. But is it really bad that it wasn't? He not only got to play the well respected and well liked Han Solo, but he also got to make out with Carrie Fisher in her prime.There is almost nothing to faultier, the effects of the original seemed futuristic and the story is so deep that if you're not careful you may lose yourself.I would love to have been old enough to remember when this movie was first released and I would recommend it to almost anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Space Adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars IV: A New Hope is a movie depicting a battle between the Rebels and Galactic Empire for control of the galaxy. Movie critics have defined the term theme as a central insight revealed in a film. The theme of Star Wars is centered on the character Luke Skywalker who becomes involved in the struggle between good and evil. Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, purchases two droids and discovers the connection between their previous owners, Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Alec Guiness; and Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher. The droids reveal the kidnapping of the Princess by the Sith leader Darth Vader, voiced by James Earl Jones, and his plot to destroy planets with the powerful armed space station, the Death Star. With Obi-Wan's help, Luke and spaceship pilot Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, set out to rescue the Princess from Darth Vader. The story of these characters and their ventures is continued in two more films, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The musical score of the movie is very effective in communicating the theme in many scenes. For instance, there is a scene where Luke is gazing at the horizon during sunset. He has just had a disagreement with his uncle about attending the academy before the next harvesting season. It is implied that he is thinking about his desire to leave the isolated planet of Tatooine and join in the Rebel's efforts. The instrumentation of the music in the background becomes the focus of the moment ? the melancholy notes seem to communicate his miserable situation. At the same time, the music is also building, indicating the significance of the decisions he will make. During this moment, Luke realizes that he wants to change his future by leaving behind his minor existence. The costumes and makeup used in Star Wars were very effective in enhancing the storyline. The bar sequence on Tatooine is a great example of the skills of the makeup and costume departments. The alien characters there represent an array of personalities. Also, Darth Vader's entire persona is mysterious because he is completely concealed throughout the movie. His black suit alludes to his being the bad guy of the film. His height also suggests that he is a figure of authority. Star Wars IV: A New Hope is only the beginning of the battle between Darth Vader's forces and the Rebels. The Empire Strike Back, the next movie in the Star Wars saga, has a similar theme. It continues the story of Luke and his friends as he learns more about how his personal history is intertwined with that of Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi. In the beginning of Star Wars, Luke Skywalker is an inexperienced crop duster who has never left the planet of Tatooine. Throughout the course of the film, his character matures because of his experiences with the opposing Rebel and Galactic forces. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to be entertained by an exciting adventure with distinctive characters and an interesting plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit it: I'm a Star Wars geek. When I was ten, I decided I was going to go watch Star Wars one day, and now I'm in love. Sure the movies are long, but I do not understand how they're uninteresting. Anyone could fall asleep while watching it-- I have before-- but that can happen to ANYONE. Anyways, this movie starts a story about great perseverance. Luke keeps working on trying to be a Jedi, save his friends, and help the rebels triumph over the Empire.I'm also going to rant about others who slam Star Wars. Maybe the effects are cheesy, but look at the time era. I've seen effects ten times cheesier in movies made in the 2000's than this. Yes, it's not real, you can tell, but it's not bad for '77. It's pretty convincable, actually, after you get past the whole science-fiction/space theme.As for the space opera, I love it. This, of course, is only the beginning. I might be reviewing the whole original trilogy, but I love how Lucas started Leia and Han so spiteful towards each other and then blossomed that into love. That is my favorite relationship of all times. :3 People are slamming John Williams for music. First of all, I own the soundtracks to Episode IV, V, and VI, and I say it is excellent, along with critics. It totally suits the movie. People are also complaining about Lucas blasting the "Imperial March" every time Vader comes on the screen. I noticed that, but that was in Episode V, when that song was actually invented. It might've had a brief part of it in IV because it was new, but it didn't REALLY come around until V.It's very addicting, and I applaud Ford's acting the best. This movie is what started my love for him. He did an awesome job bringing Han Solo's personality to life, and he's the reason Solo is one of the characters I wish were real.That's about it for now. "Star Wars" is a great movie that will never EVER be forgotten nor lose fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back when Star Wars was cool (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to popular opinion, Star Wars isn't the greatest film ever made. But neither is it, as some people would lead you to believe, the anti-Christ. Instead it's a very enjoyable film that has been blown out of all proportion by geeks and fanboys ? yeah, walking carpets and lightsaber-wielding old men are fun, but they're not the height of cinema.One of the reasons why the original films work and the new ones don't is that Lucas was restricted by money and technology. Here he isn't able to hide his deficiencies behind a barrage of CGI, meaning that he has to craft an interesting story. Of course this means his 'vision' is constrained, but when your ideal vision contains ten ton of needless effects, it's providential that the film came out before the advent of digital technology.It's also worth noting that for all of Lucas' sighing and moaning about the state of film effects in the 70s that the original film still looks pretty great even now. There's something more tangible and believable about effective model work ? you feel like you can reach out and touch the Star Destroyer at the beginning. And although you occasionally get the odd dodgy shot where you can see Death Star landscapes that are blatantly model kits stuck together, it's no more blatant than the horribly phoney CGI storm-troopers in the prequels ? both take you out of the film for a moment; only in the case of the prequels the out of place effects work is far more frequent.Something else that's worth noting is the newly installed Jabba scene. For all the money that must have been spent on it, the CGI Jabba looks far less convincing than the puppet. And the scene, besides needlessly setting up the later films ? it's far better to have Jabba remain a mystery until you finally meet him ? adds nothing to the film. It seems to be nothing more than an effects test for the prequels that followed closely on the heels of the '97 special edition release of the original trilogy.Of course, the most controversial addition/alteration to Star Wars is Greedo shooting first. Quite why Lucas did this, I'm not sure, but it dilutes Han's character. The reason why he was every kid's favourite is that he was a badass. But now he's a slightly more ordinary hero. And although the alteration didn't rape my childhood like some pathetic fanboys exclaimed, it does reflect poorly on Lucas ? the tinkering is pointless.But even though some of the alterations are annoying, Lucas can't destroy a very enjoyable film. For instance, in light of the dire attempts at humour in the prequels, it's quite shocking how amusing Star Wars is. Just take the banter between the robots ? they're like a bickering couple. And then you have the Han and Chewie relationship. Who knew that an ex-carpenter and an overgrown dog could have such good chemistry? And then you have pure slapstick moments like when R2-D2 gets captured by the Jawas ? the way R2 falls over with a thud is magnificent.But the film also has pathos. Take the scene where Luke looks at the setting suns, yearning for adventure, or when he's confronted with the dead bodies of his guardians. It's here that the film comes closest to transcending its B-movie origins. However, speaking of this scene, it's quite shocking to realise that this film was given a 'U' certificate in Britain. After all, this is a film where you see charred bodies and where someone gets their arm chopped off. It may not be Peckinpah, but it's not The Care Bears Movie either.Another piece of violence that I adore in this film is when Vader strangles some Rebel officer and then tosses his dead body into a wall. It's so casual. It immediately sets Vader up as the baddest man in the galaxy. Too bad Lucas had to ruin the character in the prequels.Something else that works for the film is how wet Luke is. He's the na?ve, hopelessly optimistic hero that has probably never thought about a girl, let alone been with one. And then you have Han, the mercenary who loves money and is full of wisecracks. Both are a million miles away from the bland Jedi that poisoned the second trilogy. These are people that you can invest in and care for ? they feel like flesh and blood, as opposed to the characters in the prequels, who talk and behave like automatons.And purely from a personal point of view, I love the stromtroopers in this film. They must be the most hopeless fighting force in the universe. Not only can't they shoot straight, but they're irredeemably stupid, too. Just take the scene where they're scouting Mos Eisley for our heroes. At one point they tap on a door, proclaim it to be locked and move on. That's real thorough! And then you have the scene where the Millennium Falcon is swallowed by the Death Star. Some stormtroopers walk in, and after a two second search, proclaim it to be empty. Wonderful! And another thing I love is the way they don't bat an eyelid when one of their pals gets gunned down by Princess Leia at the beginning. Stupid and heartless; a wonderful combination (clumsy too, as proved by the infamous scene where one of the morons clonks his head on a door).But a few other things that I've pondered over the years ? why is Vader always fiddling with his joystick in his TIE fighter, why does an overly enthusiastic rebel pilot excessively bounce in his cockpit and why does Obi Wan only become a ghost instead of becoming 'more powerful than you can possibly imagine'? I doubt we'll ever have the answers...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quit dissing Star Wars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the comments on this movie that some people have been putting up and frankly, I'm not happy. I know that there are a lot of flaws in this movie but so what? This is still a great movie. I've read comments on how the special effects suck and such. This just shows how ignorant some people are. The special effects in this movie were ground breaking. George Lucas basically founded modern special effects on this movies. If it were not for Star Wars there would probably be no LOTR. Which brings me to my next issue. I read someone comparing Star Wars with LOTR. They commented on how Star Wars sort of ripped off Gandalf using Obi Wan. WRONG! Gandalf and Obi Wan are both inspired by the "old wise man" template. That's right, I hate to break it to ya but Gandalf was not the original "old wise man". If George Lucas had never made Star Wars then he would probably never have started ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). Which would have set back the special effects in movies by decades. Meaning that without Star Wars there would be no LOTR. I am not saying I don't like LOTR because I love it. Comparing the movies Star Wars and LOTR is like comparing the authors Tolkien and Robert Jordan. It simply should not be done. I think Star Wars is a great movie and It deserves to be in the top ten. So before you try and comment on how bad this movie is try and realize where the special effects in the movie industry would be if it were not for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To truly appreciate the impact Star Wars had on the life on the average kid in 1977, you just had to be one of those kids. I was 11 back then and you can take it from me, Star Wars, was just the most exciting thing ever. Yeah I played with the toys, joined the fan club, bought the comics and all the rest of it but that's just regulation kids stuff. Star Wars fired the imagination like nothing before. I remember in the school playground acting out different scenes with my friends and arguing over who was going to be Luke. One time, so may kids wanted to join in we had to get a little creative in deciding who should do what. So just like in the film we got two people to play Vader. One did the voice and the other the sound of his breathing. Someone else had a curious talent for imitating the sound of doors opening and closing. We even had a couple of Jawa's for heaven's sake (Orteedee!). We'd have endless discussions about what Vader really looked like and how cool it would be to own a real Light Sabre - Wow! We kept scrapbooks, put posters on the wall, made models (badly) thought up quizzes to test each other, entered competitions and found endless other ways of enabling Star Wars to enter our lives. I just can't explain how much more of a "force" for fun and escapism it became above and beyond those first two awe inspiring hours at the picture house. Looking back I remember those days with much affection and still retain a fragment of the sense of wonder and excitement only "Star Wars" could evoke. The force is with me, even now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that started it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1999, 22 years since the original release of Star Wars, and we still have people flocking to SW conventions, dedicating entire web sites to SW, spending hundreds of dollars on posters and action figures, and generally assuring that the SW frenzy will live forever. Okay, I'm not critical of the die-hard fans, since I am one myself and very proud of that. I am told I bear a striking resemblance to Carrie Fisher, so I dressed up like Leia for Halloween once, complete with the cinnamon-bun hair. (I wanted to be Yoda but the costume shop said the outfit only had one ear.) Regardless whether you're nuts about SW or not, it is a masterful exercise in filmmaking and the original movie was, of course nominated for an Academy Award. Pretty unheard of for a sci-fi/fantasy.George Lucas famously described the trilogy as a "three-act play." Everyone is introduced in the first act, SW; they are placed in a dark, desperate mess in the second, ESB; and finally they get out of the hole in the final third, ROJ. This setup works fairly well for the trilogy, although some find fault with Lucas's idea. They say Star Wars has too little character involvement, Empire is too dark, and Return is too happy. Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, but I think Lucas's strategy works well in the long-term effect. We grow to love the characters after three movies; things like that take time and sometimes multiple movies!!!Although SW is not my favorite of the three (I find it somewhat campy and unemotional,) it was a fantastic starting block and lead-in to The Empire Strikes Back, which was one of the most anticipated sequels of all time. Mark Hamill was adequate as Luke Skywalker, although the whining was a little irritating. The aerial battle above and around the Death Star is fabulous. James Earl Jones immortalized the ominous voice of Darth Vader. Carrie Fisher is young and tenacious (and not as drugged out as in the second movie. I'm not cruel, just honest!) And Harrison Ford was absolutely perfect as the rough-n-tumble Han Solo.Judging by its cult-like following (heck, even Wedge has his own fan club!), Star Wars is one of those immortal things, so you might as well love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars. The theater was black except for the small light coming from the projector onto the big silver screen in front of a 7 year old boy. His eyes glued and wide in anticipation of a film that he knew very little about other than an adventure in space, a place where he always dreamt of escaping to. When the first note trumpeted out of the speakers for the first time, his heart pounded and his soul was free. This universe that George Lucas had captured and the young man, Luke Skywalker, was the embodiment of the dreamy eyed young 7 year old now watching, vicariously living in that universe. From that point on, I grew a little more hopeful for the future, that 7 year old's spirit still laughing, smiling and even crying inside, encouraging me to escape what I thought a terrifying life of abuse from peers and my own subjugating voice telling me I'd never be anything but a loser. This movie's storyline was inspiring to me as an artist, writer, actor and human being. The underlying religious connotations I've never considered religious overload, merely to believe in something bigger than oneself, an energy that encompasses everything, everyone. At this point at the end of 2015, almost 40 years after its release, I am still drawn into that flicker of light and that very first note, a glimpse into what can be, a piece of my own new hope.May the Force be with you all.</fullReview>

That's what movies are all about and that's what Star Wars gave us.If you never saw it in the theater, get yourself a really great audio visual system in your house, pour soft drinks on the floor (prep this a day prior to get the proper sticky effect) put too much salt and too much butter on a bucket of popcorn that's too big, and hit the "play" button on the remote.</fullReview>

Because we had just seen THE final frontier! We had seen space ships! We had seen other worlds! And not in black and white '50s style sci-fi. This was full color with incredible computer generated graphics. There were real live BELIEVABLE aliens up on the screen! We were flying at light speed across galaxies and star systems! And then the movie was over, the house lights came up, and we had to WALK on CONCRETE to our FOSSIL FUELED vehicles and DRIVE on ASPHALT to get home. How B-O-R-I-N-G. How mundane. I had just seen the future, and then when I left the theater it was all jerked away from me. I'll never forget that feeling. The disappointment of "reality". I've never experienced it with any other movie since, not even any of the other Star Wars episodes. I guess I was just the right age at the right time.At the time I hated Han Solo. Now that I'm "all grown up" I love Harrison Ford and it's Luke and Leiah that make me cringe. But this really was a special movie. The gateway to a whole new wave of movie making.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, entertaining space epic of good versus evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly entertaining and well crafted space epic that has become a modern day legend and spawned several (for me, disappointing) sequels and prequels. This classic is a basic story of good versus evil, combined with a futuristic space setting and special effects. While it may be kind of fun to jokingly tell others 'May the force be with you', no one should seriously be getting their theology from it (as a few cult like followers seem to) since really, it's essentially a science fiction fairy tale.As everyone must surely know, this original Star Wars tells the story of a handsome young farm boy and our hero, Luke Skywalker, who teams up with Han Solo, Chewbacca, a couple of 'droids' (C-P3O and R2-D2), and of course the grand master, Obi-Wan Kenobi to protect the galaxy from the villainous Darth Vader and save the beautiful Princess Leia from the clutches of the Evil Empire.The movie became part of everyday life in the late 1970's and 1980's, and the phrase 'Evil Empire' so commonplace and universally understood that President Raegan used it to describe the Communist regime of the former Soviet Union. His proposed plans for defensive space weaponry even became known as the Star Wars missile defense program.The actors are all perfect in their roles. Mark Hamill gives a charming boy next door heroism to the young Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford a charismatic magnetism to Solo, Carrie Fisher a vulnerability, yet smart and feisty competence to the captive Princess, and Alec Guinness a mature wisdom to Kenobi. Of course the real stars of the show are C-P3O and R2-D2, an extremely lovable character who never actually speaks but simply pops and whistles. Each droid has a clearly defined personality and their interaction together is priceless.It's a great story with wonderfully noble, courageous heroes and dark, dreadful villains. Wonderful special effects of course and star fighting action sequences. In fact, the problem for me with the later Star Wars movies is that, apart from developing the character of Darth Vader and revealing the origin of his wickedness, the other films are primarily effects, star fighting, and galactic bars. Short on plot for adults, in my opinion. I really enjoyed this original picture, but found the prequels and sequels boring to sit through. Also, the Star Wars movies do not have anything comparable to the character interaction present in the Star Trek TV series or films, which I much prefer to Star Wars, even this original episode.However, George Lucas and his string of Star Wars pictures are a legend, and this first movie at least is a barrel of entertainment for both kids and adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What else can there be said about this galactic masterpiece which has not already been said? Now in times where the saga is (hopefully) complete, "Star Wars" still stands out as one of the most important movies of the film history.Even though some dialogs may be silly (but memorable nevertheless) and in spite of several logical mistakes, George Lucas' Science-Fiction-film can easily be considered as one of the most entertaining works ever. The spectator is introduced in a universe full of fantastic concepts and locations and meets there some archetypal characters, such as the beautiful and innocent princess, the keen, naive hero, the dark, evil villain, the wise, old man, etc. The mixture of fairy tale and western elements is extremely fascinating and seems almost perfect. Lucas' direction is so skillful that even the above mentioned drawbacks eventually appear as positive characteristics of this space odyssey.No matter its meantime rather bad reputation, "Star Wars" is and will always remain one of the most magical cinematic experiences you can make. It is one of those movies you would like to talk about hours and hours, but which after all cannot be taken into words.Rating: 96 MarSco</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, along with the whole original trilogy, just blows me away! It truly has all the elements a good story needs. The characters have suction cups all over them that glue them to your memory, because they're just so great! The story revolves around young Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who wants more adventure in his life. Adventure finally arrives to him in the form of two droids, sent by Princess Leia, a beautiful woman begging someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi for help. Leia is a huge part of Rebel Alliance, a group of people determined to stop the Empire's reign of terror and evil. When Luke meets up with Obi-Wan, they set out to deliver plans inside the droid to Leia's father, plans that can stop the most destructive weapon ever from destroying any planet that stands up for good. Teaming up with a cocky pilot who is more caring than he lets on named Han Solo and his CoPilot Chewbacca (big dog/ape/bigfoot like creature) the heroes are thrust into adventure beyond Luke's wildest dreams, complete with a heroine, henchmen, space ships, battles and the most menacing villain a movie has ever seen.Star Wars is a movie you won't forget soon after watching it. It's full of excitement, humor, romance (more so in the ESB, the sequel), great dialogue danger, and a never tiresome fight between good and evil. I recommend the trilogy to anyone and everyone who hasn't seen it (that would be...3 people...don't worry though, I'm a pretty newly converted fan too!) Han Solo rocks! May the force be with you all. 10/10</fullReview>

This highly imaginative story is one that almost anyone could find enjoyable. The weaving of action, adventure, drama, conflict, and a plethora of other genres and literary devices is absolutely remarkable. All of this encased in a theme of science fiction is a clear cut example that great writing is just that, great writing. A New Hope along with its sequels, especially the two that followed, TESB and ROTJ will be remembered for a very very long time, even in a galaxy far, far away.</fullReview>

You have to live under a rock to not know some of the story lines, statements and characters from this film. The funny thing is how some special effects from this movie look BETTER than some effects made in the 2000's (The Rock in Mummy Returns, anyone??) CGI, to someone like me, just can't compete with scale models, puppets, and camera tricks.

		<fullReview>The one that started it all...Spunky Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is captured by the evil, satanic bastard known as Darth Vader (body of British weight lifting champion David Prowse, also the same man who trained Christopher Reeve for 1978's "Superman - the Movie"; voice of James Earl Jones) and exposed as a traitor to the evil empire that has enslaved the galaxy and is challenged by a heroic Rebellion. Two of Leia's robots, the hapless C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and the handy R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) escape the ship and crash land on the desert wasteland planet known as Tatioone. After being captured by Jawas (Hobbit like people who wear cloaks) and traded to a farmer known as Owen Lars, his wife Beru and their nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, the future voice of the Joker). Luke is a callow youth who would like nothing more than to leave Tatioone and find adventure in the universe, then he stumbles upon a message in R2 from Leia asking for the help of an Obi-Wan Kenobi, AKA: Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Luke doesn't know anyone named Obi-Wan Kenobi but he knows a strange old hermit man named Ben Kenobi but is unaware that Obi-Wan &amp; Ben are the same man. When R2 sneaks off in the night, Luke and 3P0 chase him down in the day and are attacked by Sand People AKA: Tusken Raiders. When the Sand People try to raid Luke's hover-car, they are scared off by Ben Kenobi, who reveals himself to Luke to be Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke tells him that R2 claims to be his property and has a message for him. Obi-Wan checks out the message and we find out that he was once a great Jedi Knight and that he was a friend of Luke's father, the late Anakin Skywalker, who was also a great Jedi Knight but one who, as far as Luke knows died of mysterious circumstances; actually, according to Obi-Wan, Anakin was murdered by O's former pupil, "a young Jedi named Darth Vader." Luke, however, has yet to discover the horrible truth behind it all... well, Luke is later persuaded to help Obi-Wan and study the way of the Force, which is what gives a Jedi his power (it helps that the Imperial Storm Troopers mutilated his aunt and uncle while he was out). Luke, Obi-Wan and the robots head off to Mos Eisly space port where they join forces with rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford in the role that made him a star) and his wookie companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Though they're supposed to go the planet of Alderaan, they are intercepted by the Death Star, a giant space station orb that blows planets up real good and was responsible for the destroying Alderaan before our heroes could get there. Once on board the Death Star, our heroes rescue Princess Leia and get into all sorts of hijinx that will change their lives forever. Obi-Wan is tragically killed in a duel with his former student, Darth Vader. In the rousing finale, Luke, Han and Chewbacca become big time heroes for destroying the Death Star. The adventure, however, is only beginning.Well acted, great special effects in both the original theatrical version and the over done special edition, the classic "Star Wars" trilogy is a masterpiece that, for better or worse, helped usher in the age of the blockbuster. Well acted all around by Mark, Harry (as in Harrison Ford), Carrie, Alec and Peter Cushing (as the other villain), but Ford steals the show as Han Solo, the great Rapscallion of the Universe."You're all clear kid now let's blow this thing and go home!" - Han Solo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that taught my generation how to dream.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing about my childhood I can be thankful for, it's the fact that I was a boy between 1977 and 1983. I got to grow up with three of the most inspirational fantasy films ever made. It all started with Star Wars Episode IV in 1977. We all know the story about this battle between the forces of good represented by a fragmented rebel alliance and the forces of evil represented by an intergalactic EMPIRE. And yes, my sister and I had all of the toys, clothes, sleeping bags, trading cards, etc...Let's just focus this review on the last twenty or so minutes of the film. Perhaps the greatest and most inspiring scenes in film history. I'm talking about the rebel assault on the approaching Death Star.Who couldn't be moved by a dozen or so tiny ships flying out to face this massive battle station positioning itself to wipe out their entire army tucked away on a little moon. How about the shot of these ships locking their wings in attack position with the giant Death Star looming in front of them?Some really neat camera shots as the battle begins. The rebels seem to be wreaking some havoc in their concentrated attack, until Darth Vader and some Imperial fighters join the battle. The rebel fighters are searching for a tiny ventilation shaft to drop some "proton torpedoes" into. It seems this is the only vulnerable point on this massive space station. One of the fighters actually gets a good shot at it...We get a shot from inside the Death Star. Moff Tarkin (played superbly by veteran horror film actor Peter Cushing) is approached by one of his underlings."Sir, we've analyzed their attack pattern and there IS a danger. Should we have your shuttle standing by?"Tarkin's over-confident reply:"Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!"The battle rages on. Most of the rebel ships are blown to bits. It looks like Luke Skywalker will be one of them also until..."You're all clear kid, now let's blow this thing and go home!"Luke, without the aid of his targeting computer, takes one last shot. The Death Star has the moon with the rebel base in sight...Luke lets out a sigh of relief as his torpedoes drop down the shaft...Tarkin gives the order to fire:"You may fire when ready."We get a shot of about four remaining rebel ships turning towards home.We hear a technician inside the Death Star:"Stand by..."BOOM!!!!!!!!!!We see the gleeful medal ceremony back at the rebel base.Thank You George Lucas!!!!I'd give it a million of ten stars if I could.So sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No film can ever top this one when it comes to Sci-Fi. The genre was not much more than a drive-in movie filled with D&amp;D players as it's only fans. This movie changed it all. This is easily one of the biggest landmarks in film history. Yes, Mr. Lucas has done some strange things as far as releases and changing things go. I won't get in to that except to say that they are his films, and he can do with them as he will. That aside, this film is one of those great movies that has just a purely awesome story, is not boring for adults and yet it is MPAA rated such that the young can also enjoy it without being bombarded by violence or vulgar language. I'm all for films with those elements, but it takes a special film to be successful without them. In closing, I can say that this was one of the great experiences of my childhood, a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the first (and only) movie I ever obsessed about. I was 11-years old and it is still the greatest movie experience I ever had. Nothing has come close. It was the first cast I ever memorized and I still know the soundtrack like the back of my hand. I can't explain why.It was a combination of the old, Peter Cushing, James Earl Jones, and Alec Guiness; and the new, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil, Carrie Fisher. The special effects are STILL awesome. The story is timeless and fresh some 27 years later.It's just such a great movie to get lost in...still.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Star Wars" became a movie classic because it was intelligent science fiction that went beyond what had been done before in the genre. Lucas' space opera incorporated themes from world mythologies into a movie that both adults and children could appreciate. The result was a franchise that had both popular and intellectual appeal. I have heard college students discuss the Star Wars trilogy as if it were the "Illiad", and it does not seem silly at all for them to do so.What was the appeal of "Star Wars." The first film in what is now sometimes referred to as "the original trilogy" (to distinguish it from the prequel trilogy) introduced the movie audience to "the force," which had both a dark side and a light side; as well as a "will". The universe at the beginning of Star Wars is controlled by an evil Empire, which is in turn being resisted by the "Alliance." The movie begins with the capture of an Alliance ship by an Imperial cruiser. As the movie's villain, Darth Vader, boards the ship in search of secret plans stolen by the Alliance, two droids (including one who has the missing plans) jettison to the surface of the planet around which the Alliance cruiser was orbiting. There they encounter a young farmer (Luke Skywalker), whose father (Anakin Skywalker) was a pilot in the "Clone Wars" (an important war, as we later find out), and an aging jedi knight named Obi Wan Kenobi (the jedi's having the power to use "the force" for combat and enlightenment). As the movie progresses, the jedi knight teaches the young farmer the jedi skills, and they join forces with a blockade runner named Han Solo and a princess named Leia, to fight the evil Empire.This movie brilliantly sets the stage for events that occur during the next two films, but you have to see the entire trilogy to fully appreciate Lucas' contribution.**Note: While it might be tempting in light of the release of the prequel trilogy to see them first, I think that it is best to see the original first, with the prequel trilogy filling in the gaps later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Modern Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film single-handedly changed modern cinema to what we know it to be today. It is the ultimate modern fairy tale. A young knight runs off with a wise old wizard to save the princess from the clutches of evil. Of course, it runs a little deeper than that, and makes the old tale of good versus evil so much more compelling. Setting it long ago in a galaxy far, far away is pure genius and it introduces us to a futuristic galaxy of beautiful style and diversity that leaves us with a fantastic space opera. Despite its unfamiliar setting, we can relate to all the characters. There's the handsome maverick, the beautiful heroine, the aspiring young knight, the wise old mentor, and the darkly clad villain. Even the droids are characters we can recognise and relate to. What is so special about this film is that the distractions of things like politics, geography, and nationality are eliminated to leave us with simple humanity. This film has everything you could ever want. The characters are great; the action's great; the story is magnificent, and of course there's philosophy too.... Oh, what am I talking about? I just think lightsabers are cool...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now. The different alien species are one of the best things about the film. The Cantina scene showing an array of Lucas' creations is particularly fun.I give this film a 7/10. Looking at it subjectively, it isn't a really good film. A lot of clichés, bad dialogue, cracker jack philosophy, and unimpressive acting. Yet, for some reason, I find it hard to say anything bad about this movie. My favorite film as a child, and one I still enjoy, mostly for nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good movie that ruined Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Spoiler Warning********Before I say anything else I need to point out I liked Star Wars. As a movie by itself it was a good sci-fi flick that opened new vistas in special effects and scope of story; quite literally an entire new universe was opened before our eyes.That said, no other movie did as much to bring the "blockbuster" mentality to Hollywood, where the moguls realized it was possible to make so much money on one movie that they could not only retire but buy that island they always had their eye on. It also brought the idea of movies as franchises to the fore, where now the movie came not only with toys but books and games and fast food meals.Sadly it seems "Star Wars" and "Empire Strikes Back" were the best of the movies, as we found out first we were starting out in the middle of the story and later we got the prequels that were supposed to expand the plot but instead only muddled it. (And they were so bad! on top of it.)Star Wars was a cinematic nuclear bomb for 1977, and brought with it the moneymaking mess we now call Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a significant part of the childhood of almost every American born in the later third of the 20th century. This doesn't change the fact that Mark Hamil's acting is simply terrible and the action scenes are simply atrocious. There is no explanation as to why the Storm Troopers cannot aim their guns to save their lives. I don't understand why Obiwan is considered a crazy hermit, when the uncle knew him to be a Jedi knight. I still don't get the flashing lights and buttons on Darth's chest, why didn't Obiwan just use his force powers to switch off the power on the jump suit. Also it is supposed to be about twenty years from episode 3 to episode 4 but Obiwan ages like 40 years. Whats up with that? That whole suicide by Vader thing is incredibly lame, too. Don't get me wrong parts of the movie were absolutely brilliant (esp. acting by Harrison Ford), but it definitely leaves a lot to be desired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has defined a generation, and spawned a multimedia empire. With its now classic scrolling text, it created a new genre of film - the space opera. Influenced by Joseph Campbell, Lucas created a space western that hadn't been re-created since in any serious way. Even the much loved Firefly never had the same cult following. Star Wars' timeless feel resides in its classic archetypes the white hats. black hats to boo, and a classic princess to be rescued. It has a John Ford feel, with comedic relief in the twin yin yang feel of the droids R2-D2 and C3P0, the teacher with Obiwan, the lovable rogue Han Solo, the sidekick with a heart of gold Chewie, the student Skywalker and the love interest with a kick Lea. This is one film series that will end up outliving us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of a movie symbol.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, we see the struggle of the rebels to destroy a secret weapon of the Galactic Empire, whose great general is Darth Vader, a dark, sadistic and mysterious character. Directed and written by George Lucas, this film has the participation of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness and David Prowse.This film marks a before and an after in the sci fi. It's essential in this film genre, becoming, thanks to an imperishable popularity, a cinema icon, given the social and cultural importance that it has acquired over the decades. With an audience always faithful and unconditional admirers, the Star Wars saga continues to this day to impress and captivate. The actors were always excellent in their roles, the director/writer is one of the biggest sci-fi genius, the script is very good and the story has no dead moments: it's an intergalactic adventure that only stops at the end. No doubt that this film is excellent, it is a work of art. However, it seems that the latest audiences have more difficulty in enjoy this film, given the lack of the colorful and vividness of the actual computerized effects and cinematography. They have to understand that this film has been done in a given period, with all the available techniques at the time. And if they understand this well, they're more easily able to admire it. In fact, although the picture is quite different from what we are used to actually, it's still very well done. The special, visual and sound effects have always been good, and leave us amazed to think it's a movie with more than thirty years. The soundtrack is something that makes our hearts pounding. John Williams did an extraordinary job and managed to catapult himself to stardom, with great and deserved merit. I only have one bad comment to do: some of the effects and scenes, such as explosions and fire in the middle of outer space, where there is no oxygen, are scientifically impossible, and this should have been predicted by the production team before the film release. But this kind of errors are endemic in sci-fi.This film won the Oscar for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Soundtrack, which shows the quality of the work developed here. Definitely, despite some wrinkles, this film is like a well-dressed and made up lady, looking younger than it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't born when this movie was released for the first time in theaters. I heard many things about it especially how this movie was so badly received by the most acclaimed critics of that time and predicted very wrongly that this movie will be a bust.Well nearly 4 decades later, yes already, force is to admit that it was a true misjudgment from them. It is a classic and it will remain a model for the genre, the movie which revolutionized everything from A to Z. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I watched it time and time again with the same delight and it never fades away.There are so many to tell about that absolute masterpiece starting with the story. It has anything to please everyone. It's epic, chivalrous, has some dose of humor and first of all a story about friendship and how it pushes to make the most impossible tasks accomplished. There is also that epic aspect of the struggle between good and evil so beautifully depicted.Many of its scenes are also classics like the space battle against the Death Star, the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader or even the final scene of the movie when Luke, Chewbacca and Han are awarded for their heroic moves which saved countless lives.I can talk also about the characters who are as famous as the movie itself. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia Organa, Darth Vader, CP-3O and R2D2 are part of the legend of the 7th art. It has become part of our culture, anywhere in the world.Then you have the music by John Williams which matches perfectly the mood of the movie. It's epic a lot of time, very sad when Obi Wan dies and the rest of the team is mourning his loss. The music is a big part of the effect the movie procures to us, to keep us engaged until the very end.The cast is also superb and there is such a strong bond between the actors which reflects a lot on the movie. At the time they weren't known but I guess there is a before and after Star Wars for Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. Now they have become such recognizable figures and I was very pleased to see them back together in the last installment of the saga even if it wasn't as good as I expected. Their performance were still very accurate like they were owned by their respective characters. How I wish it would have been the same for the rest of the cast.So this movie is how the Legend begins. How a movie supposed to crash became the starting point of a love story of almost 4 decades with the public. Like what you don't need the critics to make a movie becoming a true icon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laser Focused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What really stood out to me after watching The Force Awakens a couple of times and coming back to A New Hope was how focused it is. It's confident in the world it's building and it doesn't try to rush everything. It's not afraid to be weird. I mean it has robots, who aren't even the main characters, walking around in the desert for 5 minutes. Few, if any, blockbusters have that kind of confidence these days.I'm amazed at how much the film expects you to accept in just a short amount of time, but it works because it allows the audience to take in the world. In comparison, TFA has ADHD (not that I hate it).Yes, some of the special effects are dated and some of Luke's lines are cringe-worthy, but it is full of heart and that can be felt throughout the film.People laugh at the poor choreography of Vader and Obi-Wan's final duel, but in my opinion it is still one of the best in the series. Not because of how they are fighting, but because of why they are fighting. Almost every line in that duel is classic.Another good thing is that ANH can stand on its own. It's self-contained and it tells a relatively complete story. These days, a lot of movies that are meant to spawn franchises suffer from sequel-baiting. While the possibility of a sequel is hinted at, the film itself doesn't hinge of having one.It's a shame we can't get a proper restoration of the original version, but despite all the additions, ANH still maintains its essence.That I've watched it so many times and still haven't gotten bored of it is a testament to how good it is. Few films have ever left an impression on me like this one. I don't think it can just be nostalgia. Many films that I liked as a child I later realized weren't as good as I remembered, but not A New Hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In honor of May,the official Star Wars month, I will review all the Star Wars movies in chronological order. Now lets start with the New Hope: It opened on May 1977 and after that the world as a whole changed big time. This movie is even studied as the archetype of the hero journey and made the words like ,lightsabers, the Force, Jedi and names like Lya ,Luke , Han Solo and of course Darth Vader known world wide.Every science fiction flick or TV series after 1977 is in, one way or an order, a child ,godchild or imitator of Star Wars. From Guardians of the Galaxy to Rick and Morty and almost anything in between. The impact can be seen in movies or series from totally different genres, for instance due to its success studios decided to invest in the superhero stories that inspire George Lucas to create this unforgettable saga and from that it came Richard Donner's Superman ,Tim Burton's Batman and the 1992 X-men series and Batman the animated series ,which are the fathers (spoilers) of the superhero genre ,which now dominates Hollywood. In simple ,no Star Wars, no Superheroes!! If you have not watch it ,I feel sorry for you and go do it now!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most essential movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars. It is undeniably one of the most essential and influential movies ever. Star Wars is an engrossing adventure, and it should be seen in a non-remastered version, but more on that later. Tomorrow is an International Star Wars Day, so to celebrate it, the review follows.The movie is a masterpiece of filmmaking without a doubt. It's use of practical effect overshadows the prequels with it's staying power, along with some gorgeous and visually impressive shots. This is true George Lucas's vision before he was trying to sell merchandise. Star Wars is a lighthearted adventure which has a lot of fun, humor and action in it.The plot is simple, yet it pulls you in. It could be argued that there are three main characters, but for this movie I consider Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) to be the sole main character.He is a 20-year old who lives with his aunt and uncle on a planet of Tatooine and has dreams of becoming a pilot, little did he know that his dreams will come true in a way he didn't imagine....Galactic Empire rules the galaxy and there are rebels who are aspiring to crush the Empire, who are lead by Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher). Galactic Empire has developed an ultimate weapon a.k.a. the Death Star which has the ability to destroy planets.The main villain in this movie is Grand Moff Tarkin(Peter Cushing) who leads the Empire troops, and he is a great villain and a joy to watch. However, this movie features one of my all time favorite villain in Darth Vader. It could be argued that he didn't do too much in this movie, but he is definitely a show stealer. The man in a costume is David Prowse, but the man doing the Darth Vader's voice is James Earl Jones. Whether it is physical or voice acting, Vader has a menacing presence.There is also a smuggler Han Solo(Harrison Ford) who is born for his role and Ben Kenobi(Sir Alec Guiness) who actually didn't like this movie at all, but nevertheless put in a memorable performance. There are also two awesome droids: R2-D2 and C3PO which have a lot of comic relief and are a joy to watch. The cast is generally very likable and very good in what they are supposed to do.This movie is iconic. There are so much iconic things in it: The Death Star, Darth Vader, the Force(religion which is considered ancient in this movie), space battles and a greatest fictional weapon - the lightsaber. The movie is full of fun situations and every fan of adventure/space/sci-fi movies should watch it. It should be watched in it's unaltered version, because I feel Lucas's remastering only takes apart great elements from the movie, although it is still a great watch.Overall, Star Wars is one awesome movie, which has elements of adventure, sci-fi, epic, space and fantasy in it. It features a likable cast, simple yet interesting plot and a sense of exploring the galaxy,it has a great staying power, even on multiple viewings and it is impressive how it's sequel manages to be even better.May the Force be with you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Iconic, and Best, Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is directed by George Lucas and is the story of a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) that lives on the desert planet of Tatooine with his Uncle and Aunt. As he reaches his late teenage years, he begins wanting to leave the planet and live his own life, away from the desolate wasteland of a planet. However, as soon as he begins to become passionate about leaving, he meets an old hermit named Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), that tells Luke that he knew his father, who was a Jedi Knight, before the Empire had taken over. This information leads Luke on an adventure, pitting himself against the Empire and the dark side of a mysterious energy called The Force.Near everyone knows the impact that Star Wars had on the film industry. After the massive hit that Star Wars was, filmmaking had changed forever, and for the good. George Lucas had simply revolutionized a new era of film, bringing to life many sequels, and prequels, and an entire new generation of filmmakers and fans. Not only is Star Wars legendary, it's amazing as well. A film can be remembered, and not that great, but Star Wars is, simply put, fantastic.The best thing about Star Wars, if there is one, is the groundbreaking special effects. Even now, almost 40 years later, the special effects don't look fake. All of them look completely believable and great at the same time. This is mostly due to George Lucas' use of models. Rather than making everything out of CGI (cough, prequels), Lucas used small models of the Death Star, the Tie Fighters, The Millennium Falcon, etc. He filmed these models shot for shot, and it payed off, due to just how great the effects look all this time later.Not a single soul can talk about Star Wars without mentioning its score. As most know, John Williams composed the music for Star Wars, and did a fantastic job with it. The iconic opening theme is one of the most memorable songs ever composed, both for a film, and of all time. Near everyone can remember the tune of the song, and it's heard everywhere. In fact, I heard the opening theme being whistled by a worker in my local grocery store a couple days ago. The memorableness of this score is incredible, and deserves all of the praise that it gets.The acting is also great. Mark Hamill does a great job as Luke, and plays the character like nobody else could. Harrison Ford is literally perfect at playing Han Solo, and brought to life one of the coolest movie characters of all time. Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher, is a great character, and is portrayed very well by Fisher. Alec Guinness is absolutely amazing as Ben Kenobi, and so is the actors that portrayed C-3PO and R2D2, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker. All of the actors in Star Wars are very talented, and did great in their roles.Also, the script, written by George Lucas, is astounding. Before this movie was made, none of the cast or crew expected it to do well, especially with the outlandish script. However, nobody could even imagine the vastness that is the Star Wars universe today. The script propelled this film in every way possible, and is the biggest reason, aside from the special effects, that Star Wars was such a success.The last thing about Star Wars that I'll mention is the villain, Darth Vader. Not only is Darth Vader the most iconic movie villain of all time, he's the best as well. Without knowing anything about his past yet, Darth Vader is still a very compelling and fantastic villain. He's menacing, intimidating, and likable all at the same time. Darth Vader is perfectly acted, both physically and in voice (credit: Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones). He's the perfect villain, and did so much for the Star Wars franchise.Overall, Star Wars is easily one of the most iconic films ever made, and, in my opinion, one of the best. Anyone and everyone should watch Star Wars; it's highly likely that you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one movie that changed it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, boy. Reviewing a film that so many critics have been writing about is so hard, but also deserves a try for sure. The original Star Wars is not that kind of movie you love because it's so well made or so complex and deep; you love it because it makes you happy. George Lucas back in the day didn't want to create the perfect sci-fi movie (he says so in a Rolling Stones review), as that was "2001: A Space Odyssey" in his opinion; he wanted to make something special in its lightness, a space opera not focusing on space (as did its future rival, Star Trek), but on a very, very simple story of a rescue (and later on in the saga, a family). Each character is just perfect in his role: Luke, the hero, with his strong sense of duty; Han Solo, the roughneck, a guy whose role in the universe is not yet written but soon will be; Princess Leia, a role model for girls at a time when a woman leading a group of adventurers was just fantasy. And this is just the main squad. I won't dwell on the amazing comedic commentary by the two droids (one of which, without a single word, became the favorite character of many fans!), the ominous figure of the mysterious Darth Vader and the mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, with the delicate role of introducing us to the mystical side of this world, the Force. No movie is perfect for me, and in this case I'll have to state the one, unimportant flaw in the whole original trilogy: the acting in itself isn't great and some points of the plot are off. That said, the chemistry between the actors is palpable and the story is so funny, you don't need to stress every aspect of it.When every single scene in a movie is canon, you know you're watching a masterpiece. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars (later to be known as A New Hope) was released in 1977 after a particularly difficult production directed and written by George Lucas and staring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Alec Guinness. It is the first film in the Star Wars trilogy (fourth if you count the prequels which we're not) which went on to be a huge unexpected success. To this day Star Wars and its successors are considered some of the greatest and most influential sci-fi films ever made, changing the way films were made and revolutionizing special effects.I think Star Wars is fully deserving of its mass amounts of praise because it really is an excellent film, right from the beginning I was impressed. The amazing and now iconic score by John Williams booming while brilliant models (which aren't even noticeable as so) soar across the screen, a small Rebel Alliance ship and a huge Imperial Star Destroyer offer as some great visual storytelling, showing us where each side stands in this massive conflict. The good guys are heavily outnumbered and you feel this immediately as the suspense of watching the Rebel soldiers fear for their lives as the ship is attacked and quickly overrun by hoards of Storm Troopers during an exciting and thrilling action sequence.While the action is superb throughout, it's not the only thing that the film has to offer. One reason these films are as timeless and memorable as they are is because of the brilliant characters that are all for the most part well acted, even if Mark Hamill does show that this is his first major role, often coming off as annoying and poorly performed (something he greatly improved upon in the sequels). The dialogue was well written and felt very natural with great humorous moments which are just a delight to watch. That being said I felt the interactions between characters was something greatly improved on in the sequels.I mentioned before that the special and practical effects were seamless and stunning and the same goes with the costumes, make up and sets. All felt stunningly real considering the fact it was mainly strange aliens and far away worlds. You become immersed immediately in this huge expansive world.A huge player in what makes this film so entertaining is how mysterious all of it is, you are introduced to more names and places you want to learn more about and when you do even more questions arise, some mentions you don't even get a resolution for until Return of the Jedi. It all added to the excitement and tension of the film which put a huge childish grin on my face.Overall Star Wars is a brilliant film, it's exciting, it's epic in scale yet manages to be so close to the characters and emotions that drive the film and make it so classic. The effects are to this day excellent and the score is simply amazing. If you have not seen this film yet (how?), I highly recommend it, something as universal as this will be enjoyed by pretty much anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quest to find it's timeless essence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review has been written in my quest to ferret out why this movie has never seemed stale to me, regardless of the dozen times viewing it since it's initial release as I wonder why it is not ranked as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the last century.The Editing is superb, from the exciting opening shots the tension is allowed to flow exquisitely into informative character development then the scenes start to build up again until the thrilling take off encounter with the Deathstar then the pace is halted but evenly sustained for the final grand conclusion which allows this film to stand on it's own even if a sequel was not to follow. It is action and story melded to perfection.The Dialogue is another aspect that deserves praise, it serves either to inform the audience of the background of this new universe, to create creditable bonds between our heroes and to break the tension with spontaneous levity that allows the audience to knowingly embrace the experiences of these characters as something that they would also like to participate in. Not one single line uttered is wastedAnd lastly the Cinematography. The real secret ingredient to this movies sense of realism. Is rather simple, almost every new chapter starts with a grand galaxy wide-shot then narrows slowly down to intimate close takes, pulling the viewer in and out of this newly created universe and making them feel that there are levels of depth from the galactic to the intimate in it's cinematic world building.One could go on to further analyze the actors, the groundbreaking effects, the characters and the set designs. But I believe that it is these three essential masterclass backbones of Editing, Dialogue and Cinematography that has made this film timeless and should be elevated higher in the critical annuals of cinematic achievements.Lucas's intense study of past grandmasters had served him well and places his first big film strongly in their welcoming company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic Feat Of Imagination, Vision &amp; Creativity That Hypnotized An Entire Generation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that started it all. The first instalment in the Star Wars saga that would later go on to revolutionise its genre, change the landscape blockbuster filmmaking &amp; become a cultural phenomenon, Star Wars (also known as Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope) is a cinematic feat of imagination, vision &amp; creativity that hypnotized an entire generation with its freshly envisioned &amp; awe-inspiring world, first-rate adventure, interesting characters, state-of-the-art visuals &amp; an epic soundtrack.Having no nostalgic relation whatsoever with this epic space opera, all I can say is that my first stint with Star Wars didn't go as well as I anticipated. Where others heaped praise upon its visual effects, set pieces &amp; other stuff, I found it to be a picture that wasn't just awfully dated but also terribly juvenile, filled with cartoonish creatures, unintentionally hilarious &amp; pretty mediocre in all departments. The ingredients that made it a revolution of its time are visible beneath its degraded visuals but it's not as timeless as they say it is.Set in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars finds the galaxy in a state of civil war for a conflict brews between the Galactic Empire &amp; the Rebel Alliance. The plot focuses on Luke Skywalker, a young boy on a desert planet who inadvertently acquires a pair of droids that possess vital information from Princess Leia regarding the Empire's latest weapon plus her request for help, following which he joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a couple of smugglers &amp; his two droids to rescue the princess from the evil Darth Vader and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyranny.Written &amp; directed by George Lucas, Star Wars is his pet project that permanently engraved his name in the annals of cinema and later spawned a franchise that would go on to redefine epic filmmaking. What's commendable is the mythology Lucas created from the scratch, taking inspirations from different sources but adding an original touch to it. The movie features a simple good vs evil storyline, but what elevates it above mediocrity is its then-sweeping special effects, innovative filmmaking techniques, fascinating set pieces, stunning score, few excellent characterisations &amp; a sense of something new yet familiar.Considering the time it was released, Production design team makes efficient use of its limited budget to come up with wonderfully detailed set pieces, the stupid-looking aliens are brought to life with puppetry or whatever means was available back then, Cinematography exhibits some inventiveness which is quite evident from the first frame. Visual effects was groundbreaking in the 1970s but has severely degraded over the years and looks very cartoonish nowadays. Editing provides a consistent pace &amp; fine flow to its narrative but its 121 minutes can become suffocating if you're not intrigued by its fantasy world.And then there is John Williams who contributes with an iconic score that evokes a sense of epicness at all times plus his soundtrack comprises of tracks that beautifully compliment the story's adventurous ambiance. Coming to the performances, Star Wars is notable for launching the acting career of many and features quite an ensemble in Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness &amp; others who chip in with fine inputs in their given roles. Although nearly all the characters present in this film became part of the modern culture, Darth Vader is the only one that was impressive in my opinion, plus James Earl Jones' voice did add an intimidating quality to him.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope may not look as dazzling &amp; revolutionary today as it was during its time of release but its influence on later sci-fi space operas &amp; other films cannot be understated. For me, this was more or less disappointing for its severely outdated visual encapsulation never allowed me to take any of the unfolding events seriously and for the most part, it was downright laughable. It may have evoked an entirely different reaction from me if I had seen it at least 15 years ago but as of now, even though the effect of Star Wars on its genre, blockbusters &amp; film marketing can still be felt, I feel no love for the saga that many happen to be so crazy about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is brilliant even though the "Imperial March" wasn't composed by the time of it's release. Instead we hear the orchestra playing the infamous "Imperial Tah-Dah" as soon as the (not as infamous as the "Imperial Tah-Dah", but still infamous) Death Star shows up.And boy, it is intense. After only like five minutes we finally get to meet the Jawas. And not long thereafter we are introduced to Admiral Tarkin, one of the greatest villains of all time.The only bad thing I can say about this is that it takes almost 100 minutes before we meet Wedge Antilles, the rebel pilot who leads a squadron of small rebel battleships in the attack against the infamous Death Star. In the latter films we get to know him a lot better though. This is only chapter 4! Don't forget that. And may the force b w/ uBest scenes (in chronological order): - Opening Crawl ("It is a period of civil war" -- do I need to know more than that?) - Imperial Cruiser in a jaw-dropping chase sequence. - Obi-Wan and Luke having a chat without drinking tea. - Han Solo talking with a guy about a malfunction over the phone. - The scene where Wedge Antilles squadron gets the work done for the day (still one of most jaw-droppiest scenes in any movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE space opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What 2001 did a few years earlier for serious sf films, Star Wars did in spades for the genre of space opera. I remember sitting in the theater in 1977, glued to the screen, wishing it would never end.Star Wars was a transition for the genre, the first such film that required no, or at least very little, suspense of disbelief. I am not referring to perfection of the plot here, but to immersion in a world sufficiently well simulated to seem real. There are gigantic rusty tanks run by desert creatures peddling junk; dark oily corners in space ships that have seen better days; elevators going into an abyss in gigantic space docks; robots with dings in their exoskeleton; and evil storm troopers that in contrast are white, and shiny, and new.As became clear with the later films, Lucas is not the best director or scriptwriter, and given too much money, he over-gadgeteers every shot. But on a budget, and gathering together his best material, he put an awesome vision to the screen. He had a vision of a world, expanding over the years, within reach of other sublime universes such as Tolkien's Middle Earth or Gene Roddenberry's Federation Universe.Lucas pushed the envelope of hard sf realism as it had been pushed before only once. No surprise that he created venues such as Industrial Light and Magic, or Skywalker Sound, as the technological side of movie-making and the vision of the general universe were is greatest strengths. Much bedeviled and much emulated (by WETA et al.) over the years, the photorealistic special effects movie and the special effects houses that make them are much indebted to him. Mark Hamill once said, to paraphrase, if someone could shoot films without actors, Lucas would be the man. Unfortunately, this prophecy has come too close to the truth in modern action/effects movies, including Lucas' own subsequent second trilogy. But eventually things will settle in, and special effects will be so ordinary that they can be used continuously without becoming the centerpiece of the film. One of the more embarrassing moments of my life was watching Space Balls on an airplane, and bursting into frenetic laughter about a minute into its opening special effects scene, until I realized that the whole plane was looking at me in that mixture of engine rumble and total silence you can only get on a night flight. The scene was not about special effects. It was just silly funny. We need more of that.The story of Star Wars is endearing: a young farmhand is recruited by an ancient knight to save a princess in distress from a dark lord who can destroy entire planets to bend the galaxy to his will. The rebels whom the princess represents eventually manage to destroy a gigantic battle planetoid through a clever attack, assisted by a mercenary with a heart and a pair of bumbling robots. Unlike many modern action movies, this one takes some time to develop its characters, especially the pair C3PO and R2D2. So what if the idea is derivative of Kurosawa, and John William's fantastic music of Dvorjak! Dvorjak also copied a thematic opening of his best symphony from Beethoven's 9th, Scherzo, for 6 full emblematic notes. If you're gonna steal, steal from the best! And many have since taken this to heart by stealing from Star Wars.The film remains great in its remastered version, except now Lucas' heavier hand of later years can be seen: Mos Eisley is virtually tumbling with creatures put there to fill the screen with effects. It took until LOTR a few years later for effects to develop to the point where they are just present, not overwhelming. But Lucas had already achieved that ultimate goal with much less money and just as much heart in 1977.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Saw This For The First Time in 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, I saw this movie at the age of 12, maybe a little older than most kids were when they saw it for the first time. I understood very little of what was going on because I hadn't seen the three prequels, which I made a mental note to watch after seeing this one.I like the movie because it's a great opening for the second three movies. It starts out with some great comedy from our two robot friends C-3PO (voiced wonderfully by Anthony Daniels), and R2-D2. After a little bit of this, we get to know Luke Skywalker, and the story truly takes off from there.I like how the plot clicks along at what I'd call a steady pace. We meet all of the characters in scenes that were set up quite amazingly, and it all leads up to the duel at the end, where Obi-Wan Kenobi meets his unfortunate end, which was the saddest part of the movie for me.One thing I love about this movie is Darth Vader's voice, provided quite magnificently by James Earl Jones. You can feel the tension when his voice is coming out through that mask.If you haven't even heard of Star Wars, I recommend you start here if you want to go in production order. However, if you want the entire story, start with Episode I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This first "Star Wars" film(though later sub-titled 'Episode IV') was a groundbreaking, box office shattering breath of fresh air to the cinemas, and science fiction in particular, which had gotten bogged down in bleak Dystopian futures. Nothing wrong with that in some cases, but moviegoers craved more, and got it with this extremely exciting tale of youth rebellion against an evil galactic empire led by Darth Vader(I though he was a robot at first viewing as a youngster!) a memorable creation, whose entrances were punctuated by the grand music of John Williams, who created an unforgettable score here that kids imitated endlessly! Fine cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing and Sir Alec Guiness. Climax is truly exciting, though film has a few lulls at times, this is still great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Star Wars" was the start of something new, something different, something extraordinary for those times. Until today "Star Wars" considered the best Star Wars movie of all times. Personally I liked it very much and I can compare it with the other two movies of the classic trilogy: "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" and "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi".George Lucas makes a great direction (nominated for the Oscar of Best Director in 1978) such the writing and screenplay (nominated for both for the the Oscar of Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen) and that great job seemed during the whole movie. Gary Kurtz also did an extremely good job for the Picture of the movie who is also nominated for the Oscar of Best Picture.The theme of this movie is that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) are going to save Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse) and they are also want to save the universe from the Empire's world-destroying battle-station.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the very first movie I was allowed to see on my own. I remember that the movie theater I was taken to was one of the finest at the time, which made the experience even better.I had the chance to see the action figures even before the movies, so by heart, I was a natural fan. I remember all details, from the entrance with the scrolling story, the ship pursuit, the first Tatooine scene. I just loved everything about it, including the fact that it was our very own Tikal that served as scenery for the rebel base in Yavin IV.Star Wars changed my life, brought to my eyes a world of wonders that I dream of, and allowed my child imagination to be transported to what I still consider the best place in the world: fantasy.For the time that the movie was made at, the effects were incredible, from the ships, the blasts, the use of The Force, and the light sabers, everything was just amazing, it is a jewel of the cinema history.For sure, is a film that I will introduce to anyone I can (and I speak of the young-lings) and make sure to keep alive in the tradition we keep with my brother, watching them all every year.This is how big of an impact it made on me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1977 was the year that kicked off an iconic batch of stories set a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. From the dynamic mind of George Lucas, 'Star Wars' is a monumental piece of sci-fi greatness, in which it is a film that all aspiring sci-fi writers and directors have looked at for inspiration. With a creative plot and characters that only a true imaginative mind could've created, a stage was set for much beloved film trilogy.The casting was great, I don't think anybody could ever imagine the characters introduced in this film being, acting or sounding any different to how they do here. Leading the way is Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, closely followed by the other main protagonists Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) which led to a stellar cast allowing their chemistry to grow as the movie went on. Also present and profound were Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker playing droids C-3PO and R2-D2 respectively, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca the wookiee, and David Prowse as Darth Vader, voiced by the legendary James Earl Jones.But enough about the actors, what really makes this movie special are the visuals, graphics and special effects that nobody had so immaculately achieved at this point in time; the TIE fighters scenes and the soaring planetary landscapes must've been so breath-taking, in which case they still are today. Along with excellence in special effects, there is also excellence in original score-writing, in which most will agree that John Williams' best work lies within this movie.Dynamic, creative and at times very funny (mostly because of C-3PO), Star Wars lives as a real innovative turning-point in cinema, though the emphasis on the effects and visuals almost overshadows the fact that this is one of the greatest and most lovable films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie is definitely one that I am sure that at some point in their lives EVERYBODY has seen. When I was a very young child (from when I was about 6 or 7 to when I was 11 or 12) I was OBSESSED with this series from these movies (yes including the prequels... moving on) to the video games.Now without me being biased to the fact that I adored all things Star Wars as a child. The Star Wars Universe is one that fans of fantasy or Sci-fi might be drawn towards (I say "might" for a reason that there are some people who don't like this). John Williams music score is fantastic. The acting is great, especially from James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi. The other acting ranges from good to decent.So this movie is a good one to sit down and watch for an entertaining night. I will rewatch the sequels and the prequels to see if they are as good as I remember them (with this one it wasn't but then again I was a kid when I first saw this).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this as a kid, and I have to say, this is a great start to the Star Wars franchise. Star Wars does a great job of introducing all of the characters that are so important to the Star Wars films. Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and Han Solo. They all are great. Also it establishes the main conflict of the film right off the get go. Because of how great they do of establishing characters and conflict it allowed the sequels to succeed as well and further continue from this film.Also the story is awesome in this film. Luke Sky-walker, a farmer, becoming a Jedi knight and going on an adventure to help rescue the princess. This is a great story about how someone who thought they were nothing becomes something that is truly needed.The action is legendary. There is plenty of laser fire in this film and who could forget the epic attack of the death star towards the end of this film. Films like this show that you do not need constant action through the whole film at every part. There is great setting up of events prior to much of the action taking place. This helps establish the conflict and allows for the audience to understand the situation and why the action must take place.Music is awesome as well. Star Wars always had the best music of any film. However Star Wars does not have nearly as good of Music as "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". Or even as good of music as was in the three new Star Wars films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars - A Renewed Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I've missed this all these years. This has got to be the movie phenomenon of perhaps, the century. From what I gather, almost every avid movie watcher is in some way or the other aware of the existence of something called Star Wars. Today, I took the plunge to experience it first hand courtesy the arrival of The Complete Saga on Blu-Ray.What makes Star Wars powerful ??? Is it the characters ??? Not for me. I believe its the well fleshed out story, which looks like it has been adapted from an extremely detailed novel of sorts. What also worked according to me was the development of the movie's narrative - it just flows smooth as silk with no such points existing in the movie where the director has none of the universe's story to share and has just added fillers. There is never a dull moment in Star Wars - it all moves one sequence after the other and they all connect so wonderfully that you're left mesmerized. The characters and performances in my opinion are not bad but they're not as good as the aforementioned aspects. And I trust that these are only going to get better in the movies to follow now that they've been successfully introduced to the audience.Needless to say, the film is a technical marvel. And any praise of the film's technical prowess has to be incomplete without a mention of the film's visual effects. That Lucas could even dream about filming these ambitious sequences three decades ago is remarkable. There's a behind the scenes documentary which shows the making of some of these sequences. Its a must watch for those wondering over how visual effects were done in the good olé' days. The shots are truly breathtaking and so is the editing - everything's wonderfully put into place. Its hard to believe that the first cut of this movie was considered to be a shoddily edited piece of work.The first time I heard the Star Wars main theme, which in the movie was right at the beginning surrounding the opening crawl, my jaw almost dropped. This is because here was the tune that I had been perhaps hearing since my childhood at innumerable award functions, events, advertisements and other such situations but I never actually bothered to investigate its source. I used to believe that its a tune which must have been specially composed for the Oscars, then recycled into being used elsewhere. The theme can best be described as uplifting - and John Williams, a maestro.Missing out this movie meant missing out on one of the most brilliant movie experiences of all without even being aware of it. No amount of talk related to this movie is enough until you've seen it for yourself. I won't get into plot and cast details here because I'm confident that with the presence of so many reviews out there, these must have been taken care of countless number of times. I just felt that I needed to write out the excitement that has gripped me after watching this film - an excitement and curiosity about what the other films hold in store. Its not a perfect film and its certainly going to have its share of detractors and bashers. But this is one film that should be bashed only after its been given a fair trial. And there's a fairly slim chance that you'd wanna do that once you've seen it. This movie has introduced and involved me into the Star Wars universe. And now, I'm off to The Empire Strikes Back the next week !!! Score: 8.5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just an opinion. Star Wars. The name clearly shows what is seen in the movie, but it's amazing how the saga, or rather the "universe" Star Wars, does not pass the feeling that something is bad, something evil people, the image of Darth Vader with the music who makes perfect sync with him, is not enough to scare anyone. The death of Darth Maul may have been the scene of more thriller saga, and even had blood. I say this tongue in cheek, but of course shocking scenes of thriller genre are not part of Star War, and should not do. The complexity of the lifestyle of a Jedi is a portrait of a disciplined good nature. The Star Wars universe has no doubt, makes sure the existence of force and it is proved in all the skills displayed by the knights, it has the Force not as a god, but as something that connects everyone and made them everything. The trips are simple in hyperspace! I think George Lucas portrayed much our world in Star Wars, however left the dark side of the force less obscure than ours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: I was 10 years old when my dad shows me that piece of art. As a kid, and when we see star wars for the first time, we discover an other world, we passed nights to dream about it, being the hero of that world, simulating fights with light saber... Of course i'm not from the star wars generation, i grew up with the second trilogy. But that first trilogy and especially this movie got an unique atmosphere. The deterioration of my old VHS copy shows the love i've got for this movie, that we can't see now from digital files.Story: 10/10 The story is the strength of that one, we find a narrative plan reused by many sci-fi movies later.. Directing: 7/10 The directing is classical, very academic. The development is linear and understandable. Photography: 10/10 Sets are the strong point of this episode. All cult for my taste. Editing is good with this innovative transition effect. Obviously, special effects look aged but they're still convincing. Music: 10/10Obviously, what would be Star Wars without this perfect music. Each character has his own theme that blends extraordinarily well with the kind of space opera. Cast: 8/10 A good casting, including a convincing Mark Hamill.Final note: 9/10'Sorry for my bad English, i'm french so be kind ;-)'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i wasn't born in the 70's, i wasn't around when this first came out. i was a child of the 90's, and grew up watching these on video tapes and the 1997 special editions. however, that doesn't make a difference, these movies were extremely awesome and still are. i now can enjoy them on my big HDTV on bluray quality. and this is probably my favorite of the 3 original films. but having seen many other movies since i first saw star wars, i must say, i feel bad for kids who grew up in the 70s! i mean, what movies did they have to watch that was for kids? i feel a bi spoiled because i grew up watching the awesome films of the 80's and 90's. but in the 70's, all these movies about twisted anti-heroes, exploitation films and dark and downright disturbing story lines. talk about a dreary era in cinema! Rocky was probably one of the few movies that actually featured a real honest good hero and not some taxi driver deadly gross anti-hero crap.then came Star Wars. the biggest movie not just of the decade, but of all time. it shattered records and was a film kids as well as adults fell in love with, and to no surprise. its not meant to be some deep dark drama about killers and rapists etc, its just a lighthearted action filled adventure that gave moviegoers hope in a decade of real trash cinema (oh excuse me, "high art" *rolles eyes*). star wars literally saved the world (of cinema) from the depths of some real perverted filmmakers of the time (kubrick, scorsece, etc). families and kids could finally go to a movie and not be affronted with disturbing messages and images. what a relief! and movie's were forever changed. the following year, Superman the movie came out and also was a film families and kids could enjoy, and after that, the awesome 80's came and was a decade that featured some of the best action adventure films in the history of cinema. Indiana Jones, gremlins, all those big Arnold and Stallone films, Batman, back to the future, Ghostbusters, etc. ALL thanks to Star Wars. and the tradition continues to this day. thank you Lucas for saving movies and not letting it get sucked into the black hole of 70's dark twisted cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is one of the best films ever to be released in modern cinematic history. Definitely one of the best movies from the 1970's. It has good use of CGI, special effects and visual effects. They actually look very good for a movie released in the 70's. When this movie came out, it was a box office hit. And to this day, it is getting more and more popular. It definitely had a huge impact on modern cinema. This movie has a lot of heart and soul. The acting was just out of this world. Harrison Ford was awesome as Han Solo. James Earl Jones did an amazing job doing the voice of Darth Vader. While David Prowse did a great job doing Darth Vaders physical movements. Darth Vader is one of the best movie villains of all time. Star Wars is a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) - May the Force Be with You!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director George Lucas brings one of the most fantastic pieces of film in cinematic history with the groundbreaking "Star Wars". This movie can prove that I am a complete science fiction freak. Farm boy Luke Skywalker has been asked to protect Princess Leia from the evil clutches of Darth Vader, and the Death Star station. Along the way, he is joined by uncle Obi-Wan Kenobi, the greedy Han Solo and his trusted companion Chewbacca, and two droids named R2-D2 and C3-PO. Throughout the movie, it's a stunning journey that beat the odds of cinema. "Star Wars" is one of those epic science-fiction flicks where you already know that you will enjoy it in the end. Let me just say that once those flying credits through the galaxy in the beginning are finished, you are in for a treat. I enjoy everything about this spectacular piece of work. The casting of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, and Carrie Fisher was quite excellent. Even the characters of Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C3-P0 seem so memorable. George Lucas delivers an incredible directing job, and brought a lot of his unique imagination to the screen. John William's breathtaking score blew me away, the visual effects are astounding and it puts you into the action, the sound is sense-tickling, the editing is pure genius, the costumes are well unique, and the art direction feels so imaginative. This is one of those movies where it can let you escape the real world, and send you into a world like no other. So, if you are a fan of science fiction, and you enjoy watching George Lucas flicks, then "Star Wars" is the movie for you! "Star Wars", in my review, "one of the most imaginable science-fiction movies ever made".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This post is about the original vs. the tweaked remake.There is only one decent version of this film and that is the original one!Several scenes are ruined by the inclusion of silly CGI creatures running around on the remakes, also the remakes include explosions that are obviously lifted from Star Trek.There are those of us who would rather see stop motion animation than CGI because it is actually more realistic ? every fiery explosion (in the background as the hero runs away,) looks identical, also there is something unreal about CGI footage that is much better done With matt overlays.Same with King Kong ? give me the original any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not much to say about the original Star Wars movie which haven't already been said a million times. These movies have been analyzed in multiple levels, but the best way to describe the original one, in my humble opinion, is: this movie is a celebration. A celebration of movie-making as a visual media, with an endurable and magic story, full of adventure and excitement: that's the lasting appeal of Star Wars. Aside of all the hype or pseudo-intellectualism surrounding the criticisms of the movie, the simple fact is that it's just a familiar story ("The peasant rescues the princess and becomes a knight"), told in such a visually creative way and funny mood, that it becomes something entirely fresh and new.Leaving aside the criticism George Lucas deserves for some other movies he made before and after "Star Wars", it's undeniable that this was his finest hour, and one of the finest moments in cinematic history.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely enjoyable, but hindsight reveals flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 24 when I saw this when it first came out. I saw it on a really big screen, and it was the first film I had seen with sound so carefully constructed on a system which did justice to it. I couldn't believe the bass rumble when the Imperial destroyer appeared overhead chasing Leias' shuttle-craft, and the stereo "whuzzh"ing of the light-sabres across the auditorium - wow! And I had been a big fan of the Lensman books in my teens, and this movie was quite obviously cut from the same cloth - this was the first time that space opera had appeared on the screen and been visually convincing. Even now I still taste that magic when I watch episode 4.Hindsight shows that the script wasn't that hot, and that the characters were fairly cardboard. But the movie is so full of great moments that I can forgive it most things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There really is no way to describe this movie. It changed everything in film after it. It is one of the top grossing films in history. But what made the movie so great? It was the fantasy. It gave people hope when there was little hope left. It recaptured people's imagination. When it came out in May 1977 America was in bad shape. The Vietnam War had just ended which took 58,000 young mens' lives. President Nixion had let the country down. And the hippie movement had swept the country. Then a low-budget movie called Star Wars comes and takes America to a galaxy far, far away.The story is powerful. It tells the story of young farm-boy Luke Skywalker's journey to heroism, but along the runs into quirky characters and mishaps. It truly tells the hero's journey from pion to victorian.The characters all have there place. Mark Hamill truly delivers the role of Luke Skywalker. Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford played their characters of Princess Leigh and Han Solo very well. Princess Leigh broke that princess stereotype that many people knew and Han Solo is the rough-and-tumble space cowboy that you love to hate. And Peter Mayhew defiantly captures the feat of playing Han Solo's wookiee co-pilot Chewbaca. And the best of all is Sir Alec Guiness's portrayal of Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi. His elegance and sophistication. And who could forget James Earl Johnes and David Prowse as Darth Vader. And C-3PO and R2-D2 and comical relief to the situation.And John Williams couldn't have done a better score. It adds excitement and enchantment to the story.And the Special Effects is there to compliment the story. It was truly futuristic and amazing for its time.Finally the story reminds us that there is Good and Evil and Evil has to be defeated. And Good shall conquer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Ate Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The irony of George Lucas' career is that he started out making experimental avant-garde short films and became, not always of his own volition, the closest thing the modern film industry has to an authentic classic mogul. His key problem had always been his inhibiting bashfulness when dealing with people. However, his strongest distinction has always been his shrewdness. Fans of Lucas see his sovereign autonomy as a significant countermeasure to the supreme control of Hollywood, his idealized enterprise to spend (and make) his own money on new innovations and projects that have benefited the rest of the industry as something to be commended. Dissenters, nevertheless, lose hope in what they perceive as a dominating juvenilization of the American film industry in the wake of Star Wars---the watershed that proved that Jaws and Close Encounters were no flukes but the real thing---holding Lucas and Spielberg specially accountable for the gaudy spin-off merchandise-driven summer-blockbuster mentality that has steered the business for the past three decades.I'm somewhere in the middle. More clearly, I'm guilty of ranting in favor of the dissenting argument on several occasions yet I'm aware of the validity of the former argument. I look at Star Wars now and see a film that barely holds a flame to at least a dozen or so other American films of its decade. I think what makes Star Wars, even as a stand-alone film, strike more thunder than virtually any other film in decades before or after it is its television series-scale mythological content. The fact that it was meant to be a saga spanning several films was something scarce even in a decade when Jaws 2's and French Connection II's were beginning to pop up here and there. The scope of Star Wars' story must've been as much of a shock to the system as the enormously ground-breaking FX.It's basically one of the quintessential Good Vs. Evil Sagas. It's classic in that sense. What I like about its universe is that it depicts a civilization "a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away," suggesting that we here on Earth were likely cavemen or conquistadors when they'd already spanned an interplanetary life-sustaining geography, had technology that not only begets robotic slaves and laser dogfights in space that mix the mass of a warboat and the agility of a fighter plane, but "weapons of mass destruction" that don't just "nuke" entire cities or countries but whole planets. The presumably "human" characters are able to speak languages spanning countless planets' worth of alien species. Lightsabers. Regardless, it's all on the verge of a cataclysmic struggle between a totalitarian regime and a rebel organization. The rebel organization is seemingly apt to be weaker without heroic figures who believe in an omnipresent energy that gives them purpose and power. The totalitarians, on the other hand, and more interestingly, use this omnipresent Force to motivate their evildoings. I wonder maybe if this Force is at the heart of the problem.Nevertheless, civilization has consolidated into a clear-cut case of good, wearing white, and evil, wearing black, "May the Force be with you" and the Dark Side. As much as I love the concept of intelligent life in the universe far more advanced than us and sharing parallels, I feel like Good Vs. Evil is too archaic to be the general philosophy of everyman in a civilization that could possibly be millions of years more advanced than us. Then again, maybe that's the most significant clue: What if in a future far ahead, we're advancing technologically at the same rate as we are now, so life has expanded much further, yet we're still preoccupied with fighting over the same platitudes and ideologies as now? You can't help but quibble in your head over which religions would be the good guys and which ones would be on the Dark Side.Or maybe that's just the classical sort of tale Lucas wanted to tell. After all, his supposed influences, some I've noticed and others I guess I trust, range from Kurosawa epics to John Ford westerns, from Buddhism to abstract metaphysical theories. These aren't bad sources of inspiration, and many share, to some degree, a sense of hero worship, feelings of power directed, to whatever extent, toward fighting evil. Regardless, no other Star Wars character holds a candle to its villain, Darth Vader. Yes, Obi-Wan comes in close, but we all know what happens to him and who does it.There's still much more to say about the movie, but unfortunately it's limited by its low rank on one's priorities. Perhaps my real favorite character is the music, the immortal symphony we all know by heart. And my theory as to why the acting of Vader's generals, admirals and underlings tends to sound like a pub scene in a bad werewolf movie is because half of acting is who you're acting off of, and Vader's James Earl Jones voice is what gives him gravity, not whoever was under the actual helmet. As for the Special Edition additions, I don't know. Completely unnecessary Jabba the Hut scene, although it adds foreshadowing for Han Solo's arc. The world/creature details and CGI shots have a much different look than the comparatively realistic remaining film, making me more conscious of watching the movie than its story and immersive atmosphere. Lucas had great ideas and lots of unassuming pluck, but as the propeller of not only blockbuster but franchise mentality, sequels, prequels, reboots, remakes, revisiting the 20th-anniversary tampering, the joke's somewhat on him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the top 10 greatest movies of all time hands down!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie might have been the greatest movie of all time.Think about it, it was the first movie ever to do so many things, or if not the first, the one that really trademarked the techniques. The other day I watched Avatar, and at the end, when the dragon-like creature flies off into the sunset, its wings formed an X and I said, "oh hey, they totally ripped that off star wars." The save-someone-by-flying-in-from-above from seemingly nowhere move came from Star Wars and the Millennium Falcon, the list is endless. The whole idea of "the force" has been re-manifested in so many ways, avatar being a recent example, again. The more I think about it, the more groundbreaking this movie was.And I haven't even gotten to the special effects breakthroughs, which is what the movie was known for at the time. I'm not really an expert on that stuff but suffice to say Star Wars had the best special effects by far of any movie at the time it came out.The Acting was terrific, and though the sequels were almost as astounding, they couldn't quite match the first one. A truly special film that every person should see before they die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sci-fi masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the year 1977, when Star Wars first opened to theaters, many people were excited to see it, so it made a huge amount of cash in the box office and so far is was one of the best movies of all time.This was before the Lord of the Rings, Back to the Future, The Matrix, The Bourne series, and Jurassic Park trilogies.It stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, Anthony Daniels, James Earl Jones (Voice of Darth Vader), Kenny Baker (inside R2-D2), Peter Cushing, etc.In a galaxy far, far away, a psychopathic emperor and his most trusted servant - a former Jedi Knight known as Darth Vader - are ruling a universe with fear. They have built a horrifying weapon known as the Death Star, a giant battle station capable of annihilating a world in less than a second. When the Death Star's master plans are captured by the fledgling Rebel Alliance, Vader starts a pursuit of the ship carrying them. A young dissident Senator, Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), is aboard the ship &amp; puts the plans into a maintenance robot named R2-D2. Although she is captured, the Death Star plans cannot be found, as R2 &amp; his companion, a tall robot named C-3PO, have escaped to the desert world of Tatooine below. Through a series of mishaps, the robots end up in the hands of a farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who lives with his Uncle Owen &amp; Aunt Beru. Owen &amp; Beru are viciously murdered by the Empire's stormtroopers who are trying to recover the plans, and Luke &amp; the robots meet with former Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) to try to return the plans to Leia Organa's home, Alderaan. After contracting a pilot named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) &amp; his Wookiee companion Chewbacca, they escape an Imperial blockade. But when they reach Alderaan's coordinates, they find it destroyed - by the Death Star. They soon find themselves caught in a tractor beam &amp; pulled into the Death Star. Although they rescue Leia Organa from the Death Star after a series of narrow escapes, Kenobi becomes one with the Force after being killed by his former pupil - Darth Vader. They reach the Alliance's base on Yavin's fourth moon, but the Imperials are in hot pursuit with the Death Star, and plan to annihilate the Rebel base. The Rebels must quickly find a way to eliminate the Death Star before it destroys them as it did Alderaan.Back in 1997, George Lucas was recreating the trilogy into special editions to the series, by adding special effects, different scenes and altered dialog that almost ruins the whole trilogy. (If you see the original films, you know that they've made some serious changes to the films that Star Wars fans would of noticed).There's no words to say about this movie, it's a masterpiece that we all knew. The performances of the actors were amazing, special effects of its time was great, and the directing was great too.It's one of the best movies ever created, and one of the best blockbuster movies ever.Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope gets 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is often seen as the first blockbuster of the modern era, but Star Wars was the first film to become an phenomenon, causing a massive stir with a mass audience and was the start to one of the biggest film franchises ever. It cemented George Lucas' reputation as a filmmaker and has become a cinematic classic for generations of film fans.The Galactic Empire is in the middle of civil war, between the evil Emperor's forces, and the Rebel Alliance. One of the Rebel's spies, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) discovers the Empires plans for their new weapon, the Death Star, a space station that is powerful enough to destroy entire planets. She is captured by the evil Darth Vader (David Prowser/James Earl Jones): but Leia was able to sort the information on two droids, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 (Kenny Barker). The droids crash on a desert and are saved by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and when he listens to Leia's message he becomes involved in the mission. Luke meets the man who Leia wanted the message to go, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness), an elderly former Jedi Knight. The two team up and go to one of the roughest towns on the planet. They hire the serves of Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), and his hairy companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to help them. This crew end having to go into the Death Star, and forced to save the Princess and battle the power of Darth Vader.The production history behind Star Wars actually pretty interest, and had all the makings of being a flop. It was cast with unknown actors, the budget ballooned, many of the actors did not get along, particularly Anthony Daniels and Kenny Barker, and Fox got cold feet with the film. But this was not the case, and of course Star Wars was a massive success. The first saw the film when I was 11 and it still hold power over me. The actors in the film are decent throughout, this was the role that truly brought Harrison Ford to prominent, and he is easily the best actor in the film. His character is cool and has chemistry with everyone as the smuggler who seems not to give a damn. Both David Prowser and James Earl Jones ooze power and domination as Darth Vader, Prowser as the physical performer and James Earl Jones offering a menacing voice. Of course Sir Alec Guinness was good as his role as Luke's mentor and surrogate father. Carrie Fisher had excellent chemistry with Harrison Ford having a love hate relationship in the movie. And of course Mark Hamill was good in the leading role.But despite the actors efforts, this was George Lucas achievement, having written, directed and produced the film. As the sole writer/director this is the best Lucas has ever did. Lucas throws many sci-fi fantasies into this film, space travel, giant and laser weapons, psychic powers, multiple alien creatures, and basically fun adventure and action. The action scenes are excellent thought and the special were fantastic, particularly for the time. Even now they are still amazing. This also the best script Lucas has written, whilst the adventure was grand, the focus was on interesting characters you could care about. Lucas made sure the character were well developed and the world was grand, it was obviously based on the Roman Empire.Lucas shows when Special Effect are done well with a good story it can enhance the film experience. Lucas also hired John Williams to make the score for the film, which was a wise move. Williams make one of his best scores and it his music added to film, particularly the Death March.An all important classic.</fullReview>

Yet, the only reason they found said errors is because they watched it a billion times and are trying to be trendy. Most of the errors are not that huge anyway. Face it, this is the greatest adventure of all time.Words do not do this movie justice. Its Star Wars, if you are one of those uptight snobs who haven't seen then check out it, it will blow your mind and make you feel young again. It will remind you will people love films. Without Star Wars there would be Alien, Terminator, Indiana Jones, ID4, Matrix, Avatar and about 75% of the movies that are still popular today. It is the beginning of the modern age of film making. It has aged well and even though Lucas sorta botched Han shots first, he did a good job of fixing some of the errors of the special effects for the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When George Lucas was writing Star Wars he certainly had the force with him, a truly inspiring force that led to the greatest masterpiece of all times. For many this movie may be thought as another good vs evil sci fi movie, however this is not the case, Star Wars changed the course of film history,it gave a whole different meaning to the word sci-fi, enchanting visuals, great costumes, great plot and great acting. The actors were like they were born to play these roles, Marc Hamill as Luke Skywalker, the heroic kid that has never met his parents, loses his aunt and uncle yet with the help of Obi-Wan, played amazingly by Alec Guiness, he starts his journey to fight against the dark side, together with his friends, Harisson Ford who perfectly fits into the shoes of the arrogant captain Han Solo and Carrie Fisher who plays the beautiful and decisive princess Lea. I am 18 and it's really ashame because i listen to my friends etc talking about star wars and considering it a piece of crap, it's really ashame because those as many other people judge because of the new trilogy, however the original sw trilogy deserves everyones respect because we are talking about an epic, people say that the story is nothing new and they have seen a similar one many times, however think just think of how original this movie was back in 1977, it was a turning point in history. I believe that all true movie lovers should watch the original trilogy before daring to judge this cinematic colossus that has lived its mark in the history of movies. We all owe respect and appreciation to Lucas and all the people that helped for this movie to be made and for young people like myself and millions of others to be talking for it even three decades later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had gotten curious about the Star Wars saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies.And after that, I love the Star Wars saga."...In a galaxy far,far away... " The evil Galactic Empire rules the galaxy with an iron fist. Having the plans for the Empire's deadly weapon - The Death Star space station from rebel spies, Princess Leia of the planet Alderaan hid the plans (as well as a distress message) in a droid (robot) called R2D2, when her ship was attacked by the evil Darth Vadar. Luckily, R2 and another droid named C3PO escape with the plans to a desert planet called Tatooine.There the two droids were captured by creatures called Jawas, and were sold to a moisture farmer named Owen and his nephew Luke Skywalker. Upon cleaning R2, Luke found Princess Leia's distress message; but it had a malfunction. The message was for a Obi-wan Kenobi, of course to Luke, it must be old Ben Kenobi who lives in the hills. That night, Luke discovered that R2 was gone! He and 3PO went out to look for him. Sure enough, they found R2, who was looking for Obi-wan. But they are in the territory of the dreaded Sand People! Luke and 3PO were attacked by them and little R2 hid. But luckily they were save by a cloaked figure, who happens to by Obi-wan. Obi led the three to his place and the distress message was played. Obi-wan then tell Luke about the situation and about the Jedi Knights, that were wiped out long ago; then he asks Luke to come with him to Alderaan. But Luke wants out of it, on the count that he would be in big trouble from his uncle. But Storm-troopers that were looking for the droids, attacked and killed his uncle and aunt. So Luke eventually joins Obi-wan. They enlisted the aid of a smuggler called Han Solo and his Wookie mate Chewbacca, and their ship to save Princess Leia. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.So I really love this film and I don't have any particular scene. I also the musical soundtrack by John Williams was excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie's okay, but you have to have the education of a ten year-old child to not laugh your butt off all the way through. The movie starts off with two spaceships chasing each other and firing laser blasts at each other -- didn't the producers know that sound does not travel in space? Next we get a scene inside one of the spaceships -- and all the people are standing on the deck, as if there was actually Earth-normal gravity in space! They should be floating in free-fall, idiots! A bit later the Millennium Falcon blasts off from a planet and goes to "lightspeed" with no relativistic effects whatsoever. I thought everyone knew that the speed of light was not a limit that could be arbitrarily broken like that. Furthermore, even traveling at "lightspeed" the ship would still take several years to get where it's going -- that's why the unit of distance is called a "light-year".The movie goes on to treat us with several more very loud space battles, some of them fought by spacecraft that look like they were based on modern jet fighters, and the tactics inspired by Red Baron dogfights. To be fair, the special effects of the original 1977 version are very good. The movie loses a few points in the politics department, by taking fairy tale monarchies and transplanting them wholesale to space -- after all, the story is about a quest to save a princess from an evil empire, and involves a duel between a white knight and a black knight. There's also Han Solo, a space cowboy with a talking dog called Chewbacca as his sidekick, and a pair of robots for comic relief. (BTW, the robots are not gay. Robots are machines and therefore asexual).It's easy to see why this movie is so frequently ridiculed. No one who saw it in 1977 took it seriously, and it's lived on for the past thirty years as a total joke. Science fiction fans consider this at about the same level of quality as "Barbarella". Which is too bad, because it's really quite a fun little romp, kind of like the old Saturday matinée serials of the 1930s and '40s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Fantastic World Universally Transferred To Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the dawn of the 20th century, people started to think outside of the days of the world wars and the economically unstable depression era of the early 1930s. The observations and scientific research of the heavens of space brought upon great motivations upon writers to develop fantasy stories and fairy tales of the unknown that would inspire people in the rising genre of science fiction, in which some of the great and historic works included The War of the Worlds and The Lord of the Rings. Let's focus on the emptiness of space. Just as much as people wondered about our planet Earth and thought it to be entirely flat, we thought and we still believe that there might be life in outer space. We could imagine there to be organisms with flesh tissues or they could be microscopic cells or bacteria. Then it could be that there are human beings that are just like us in a remote galaxy.So let's explore the concept of a race of mankind that are eons away. We then ask if these humans might come to us and offer neutral peace, or are they hostile warmongering fighting factions that plan to invade our home. That is the conflicting issue of a clash of races in a hugely developed and inspiring film directed by George Lucas, entitled "Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope". This is a terrific film and the strongest of the year 1977, even though it was succeeded by Woody Allen's film Annie Hall for winning the Best Motion Picture of the Year Oscar. In this Star Wars film its dramatic ideas established a very broad cultural network of other Star Wars episode films, comic novels, and even merchandise toys for fascinated children.Lucas's selected cast which I think blends very well with the story includes Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, a young Tatooine farmer and determined Jedi protégé; Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor and Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the towering huge actor David Prowse as the black caped and masked Sith apprentice Darth Vader, who is the commanding warrior of the diabolical Galactic Empire. In fact, he is given an extra scary technical feature of a mechanized voice: the vocal work of the mighty James Earl Jones. A fascinating and smart looking American actress named Carrie Fisher appears as Princess Leia Organa, a white dressed rebel who defends her Rebel Alliance forces and confidentially obtains an electronic layout plan of a pale gray spherical station named the Death Star, which contains a horrifying heated green laser that could shatter and implode entire worlds. Who knows what would happen if the Death Star drifted over to Earth. Eeek! Thankfully Leia happens to have two loyal droid friends, a blue white R2-D2 and a perfectly golden metallic C-3P0, who hide the digital architectural plans in their circuits. On the other hand, I must say that I really love Leia's round sided hairdo. Carrie Fisher must have received the best hair stylists. And now the empire's Death Star weapon is headed by its leader Grand Moff Tarkin, portrayed by Peter Cushing. Tarkin and Darth Vader plan to use the Death Star to manipulate and blackmail city and territorial planets to end its recognition of an ailing Republic and obey the Empire. Should there be insubordination of the Empire by a particular world, that planet would be facing a big green laser protruded from the Death Star. The two figures of imperial power Darth Vader and Tarkin scheme to use this opportunity of power to consume whole worlds with fire that might have the presence of Rebel space bases.Even worse, Leia is kidnapped in a boarding brawl between rebel soldiers and white imperial stormtroopers in her Tantive IV ship. She's imprisoned in the plain black cells in the Death Star, and the poor Leia is toyed with by Tarkin in a bluffing matter that she would lose her home world Alderaan unless she submits the planet where the rebels are. And to show how tough these invaders are when Leia fesses up, Alderaan is ignited by the laser into a fireball! This sinister setup proves that there is no time for Luke, Han Solo, and Obi-Wan to fly around in the Millennium Falcon and watch a nova show in the space horizon, because they have to get cracking to bump back at the Galactic Empire.Going through all the visual contents of this classic fantasy adventure by George Lucas can be exhausting, which is why that I basically state that this movie is very amazing. Such beautiful and long shots include the aerial views of the tan and yellow clouded planet Tatooine, the R2-D2's curious exploring of mountainous valleys and canyon gorges of Tatooine and the numerous thrusting shots of the movement and bright laser fire between ghost-like TIE fighters and long, cool looking X-wing ships. The film shots that go in out, along, and tracking the trench forms of the other-worldly Death Star is a must see as well. As I have stated before about science fiction and literature, this monumental film takes that concept to great zooming concepts of exploring cosmic battles and dynamic locations. The exciting Star Wars film is accompanied by some of the outstanding early works of soundtrack music by the American composer John Williams. This six-time Oscar winning Star Wars is an enormously brilliant adventure of universal drama and excitement that contains lovable characters and warm, friendly relationships. I really do feel exhausted from mesmerizing about the greatness of Star Wars, which is why I give this a 10 star ranking. I appreciate IMDb's highly voted placing of this movie with other dramatic fantasy films such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Dark Knight, Raiders of the Lost Ark and other fantastic storytelling movies that are admired worldwide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good clean fun. This movie didn't ask you to think about any deep and weighty subject matter. It was good vs. evil almost literally in black and white. And when you left the theater, you didn't have to digest what you had just seen. To top it off, it reached out and grabbed you in the opening scenes with a fantastic shot of two ships in space doing battle. Even the bar scene was believably because the weird characters were not computer generated. They were played by real people in costume, and the viewer knew it and could live with that.It was clear at the end that Darth Vader had escaped the destruction of the Death Star, but it was unclear how the small, one-man fighter he was in could have traveled far enough on its own to be rescued.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Star Wars", in case you've been living under a rock for the last thirty years, is a sci-fi action/adventure about a group of rebels trying to save the galaxy from the clutches of the evil Empire. At the time of its release it became the highest grossing film of all time. It then went on to spawn two sequels and three prequels, not to mention numerous spinoffs in various forms of media.The principle characters in the story are Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), an idealistic farmboy, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a cocky starship pilot &amp; Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), a feisty rebel and 'damsel in distress'. All have been assimilated into popular culture, as have numerous supporting characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader &amp; Chewbacca. The cast is indeed a good one but objectivity is difficult at this point since the cast and characters are so inextricably linked.George Lucas's script does a fine job of creating an energetic story and populating it with memorable characters. His direction is well handled but the best aspects of the film's visuals come from the ground-breaking special effects. Sure, they may not be outstanding by today's standards but they were breath-taking at the time and for many years afterwards.In addition to the stellar visuals, the film also excelled on the aural front. The sound design by Ben Burtt masterfully brought the world and its creatures to life and resulted in a special achievement award from the Academy. And who can forget John Williams's legendary score, which, in 2005, was chosen as the greatest American film score of all time by the AFI.Simply put, this was a film that not only connected with millions of people but changed movie-making itself. As a result, it is a must for any film fan. That being said, I've only rated the film an 8 for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I feel that the trilogy is best appreciated as a whole and, secondly, the follow-up refined the characters and storytelling to such a degree that the original suffers slightly by comparison.By the way, if you've only seen the prequels (Episodes I thru III), don't let them dissuade you from seeing the original trilogy. The original trilogy is much, much better.Also, I recommend watching the original versions of the films, not the 'Special Editions' that Lucas messed around with for the 20th anniversary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1977STAR WARS?DIRECTOR GEORGE LUCAS? After finishing a couple of Doctor Who's Central Casting sent me to E.M.I. Studios to work on another space film for seven days. I did ask them if they had any other work because I was fed up with wearing space outfits and the like? (Little did I know about STAR WARS). There must have been about fifty Supporting Artists gathered on the first day, some putting on white space type suits, some being fitted out in weird make up and costumes and the rest of us waited around to see what we were going to be.We had plenty of time to sit around chatting and playing the odd game of cards. When myself and a chap called Ronnie Conrad got a call to go to the wardrobe dept, They dressed us in black space type suits but without a face mask?(Were they telling us we were ugly enough to look like aliens). When we were dressed we sat at the back of the set and waited to do our bit. I got talking to a giant of a man (Dave Prowse) from the West Country and he told me he was playing a character called ''Daft Ada''. I found out later that day he was playing ''DARTH VADER'' (It must have been Dave's strong Cornish accent that made it sound wrong). Ronnie and I did some odd bits during the week and then the 2nd A.D. called for us to do a bit of business with our old mate ''DARTH''. We were going to arrest Princess LEIA (Carrie Fisher)? Carrie's parents were Eddie Fisher (singer) and Debbie Reynolds (singer/actress). Debbie starred in the film ''Singing In The Rain'' in 1952 and I, as a twelve year old, was in love with her... (It soon passed). Anyway lets get back to ''DAFT''.Darth, Ronnie and I walk along some corridors and then into the cell where The Princess was being held. Darth had all the lines to say while Ronnie and I stood there looking ugly. (Typecast) In between lighting the set Carrie was very chatty and asked what else we had done in films. (Has she got that much time to spare?) I also met Harrison Ford and was to work with him again over the next few years. Star Wars was the highest grossing money film that I ever worked on. Some say it took a Billion Dollars at the box office and video sales? Twenty five years later I am held in deep respect for being one of "DAFT ADA'S" men, by my Grandchildren? Thanks Mr Lucas?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To this day, all of the original 3 (4 thru 6) still excite me to no end. I was surfing the satellite TV selections and came across the beginning of the move. Just hearing the opening music and watching the opening scenes brought me back to the time when we went to movie theaters to see films and sat up front to get the total effect of a movie.It's sad, and, in a way, good to know that people don't have to go to a theater to get that experience. Granted, if you want to be one of the first to see a film... you know what I'm getting at.Star Wars, and all of it's later incarnations, are masterpieces from Mr. Lucas that can never be denied in their place of glory in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long time ago in a decade without CGI...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first "block-buster" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the '80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn't even attempt to fire before Han killed him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to look at this film without offering the comparisons of Empire and Jedi. Sure they had much bigger budgets and a more intricate plot in the case of Empire. But Star Wars must be viewed for what it was intended as, the opening of a whole new world. As a cynical 33 year old I watched Star Wars for the first time in years and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's true that some of the dialogue is stupid, the effects a little shaky and even the acting (Hammil's especially) is wooden in places. But film is craft and to imagine one mans vision crafted it is amazing. It could have been terrible, it could have been a stinker but he put a team together that to me, pulled off miracles. The story is not original, it's a composite of every fantasy adventure written but it makes for a dazzling spectacle. John Williams, the man who made Jaws the tension filled thriller it is, scores a dramatic, fan fare opening. It's as if he knows how important this film is. I have to love it. More accessible than Lord Of The Rings and a pure piece of pop history. Star Wars is not the greatest film ever made, but it's certainly an important one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Origins of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to remember that many years ago George Lucas admitted that the basic core idea for the movie was wholly derived from the Seven Samurai. Just as the Magnificent Seven had lifted that plot and re-located it from Japan into Mexico, so Lucas took the very same idea and re-located it into Outer Space. Count the heroes: Obi Wan, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3PO. Seven, right? And they have to take on the whole menacing force threatening a nice, peaceful civilisation and restore order and justice. Which of course they do. OK, that basic plot is hugely embellished and adorned with highly impressive special effects (even now they still look great), but at the heart of it the original Star Wars film is essentially a hi-tech sci-fi re-telling of the Seven Samurai. BTW, I still can't bring myself to think of it as anything other than Star Wars, "in brackets the first one". How can it be Episode IV when it was the first one to be conceived? Is Lucas ashamed to admit he's just milking his cash cow? Or ashamed to admit he's not really done anything else of note outside of the Star Wars franchise? As for earlier comments about this movie having changed the world - or even just the world of cinema - all I can say is get real, get a life and get out more. It's a couple of hours of entertaining fantasy, and not all that original at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching StarWars is like the earliest memory I have in my life..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watch StarWars when I am like three or four years old. I watched it with my mom and dad in my home. At that time, the only thing I can remember from the film is only a laser gun, mean black robot with red laser sword, spaceships, and Luke Skywalker. From the first time I watched it, this film totally amazes me, truly capture all of my imagination, and inspiring even for children of my age. Since then, I remember I watched this film almost everyday.. especially during my lunch and dinner.. (I love to watch movie while eating).Of course I skipped all of the dialog part that I don't understand and only watch the Death Star shooting scene, the ObiWan vs DarthVader, and the final spaceships battle. I grew up with this saga, fill my entire room with StarWars action figure, bought all of those stupid Star Wars coloring books.Now that I am older, I still believe that this is one of the best movie which ever made. George Lucas really captures all aspects of storytelling to this film, there are action, drama, suspense, adventure, comedy, thriller, anything (except horror of course) in this movie. It is the most compact movie of all time, consisting of every factors possible to be in a movie.Mark Hamill has done such a wonderful job playing his characters, Luke Skywalker.. It is a character that set the standard and become a role model for what should main protagonist in adventure film should be. As Luke Skywalker, Hamill successfully portrays his teenage farm boy image, with the sense of humor and jokes that really feels that Luke is the REAL person who lived in the galaxy far-far away from this earth.However, the brightest star or the show is Han Solo.. Mr.Ford plays this character brilliantly, he made Solo such a charming character and capture the totally audience's heart. He makes Solo a REAL space pirates with the way that he escape from trouble, his lack of respect towards fair head to head fighting, jokes in the most critical times, and his witty comment throughout the laser gun fight with the stormtroopers.Princess Leia also made a terrific impact to the series, it is one of the very first KICK ASS and in-your-face princess character ever. It is totally capable of defending herself and not the typical stupid princess who got into trouble and start screaming "HELP MEE.." without really doing anything. C-3PO also plays a very important role, as the source of comedy and tension-breaker throughout this film with all of his non important but funny comments. It is even funnier to watch other characters reaction toward his comments.Last but not least, the greatest character created by Lucas, and the baddest, greatest, most iconic villain of the 20th century, Darth Vader played brilliantly by David Prowse and James Earl Jones. Darth Vader is really the greatest antagonist of all time. He got scary mask, black armor, blood crimson colored laser swords, a brilliant strategist, what else can you asked for? The greatest thing that differs Vader from the typical villain is that Vader is literally an unstoppable force, without any mercy at all, he crushes all of his enemies and even allies who got in his way, he shows no hesitation in pulling the trigger. He doesn't have the stupid villain arrogance that usually ends up by killing the villain himself in the end. Vader demonstrate his seriousness in striking down the unguarded Obi Wan and in demolishing almost every Rebel Starships remaining on the Battle of Yavin.With all those great and groundbreaking characters, George Lucas acts as the final catalyst to create such great classic. He ingeniously mix all those complex characters and adds almost every elements of storytelling to this masterpiece. The story moves up pretty well in a brilliant up and downs, as he divide the scene to a perfect proportion of funny scenes, emotional scenes, action scenes, he is really showing us all the meaning of BALANCE.. With his final touch of genius, Lucas as the director wraps up all the amazing cast, mind-blowing and out of this world story, great special effects into one of the best work of art in our time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first star wars movie that earned ambitious George Lucas an Oscar nomination, and millions of dollars. This was the launch to various sequels , toys, games and defined the star wars mythology like no other. I have to give it to Lucas, the story is amazing. The creativity is awesome, the excitement is average (because the special effects in recent movies have more zest) but nonetheless it will still have it's place in the history of great movies. Luke Skywalker lives with his boring uncle Owen who aspires for Luke to continue the family tradition of being a farmer and to take care of their land when he passes away. But Ben Kenobi, an old "hermit" opens Luke's eyes for something more adventurous. He helps Luke go on an amazingly stellar journey to rescue a tough princess from the bad but likably powerful Darth Vader. To get there, he meets the cocky but handsome spaceship pilot Han Solo and his hairy buddy Chewy. Also, bringing in the humor are two smart-ass pieces of machinery, C-3P0 and R2D2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately, I have been writing reviews on some of my favourite movies when I realized I had not reviewed or even seen Star Wars in great some time.Star Wars is very fast moving with great acting performances, lines and the feel that the people enjoyed what they were doing. The film is a great piece of work to the sci-fi genre and is presented cleverly and well written. This is another great example of a movie that has not been expected to do well in cinemas but has anyway. Out of the few people who have not seen this, or there has been a large gap since your last view, you should immediately go and get your hands on a copy of this fantastic movie.Overall, this movie is a service to all great movies. It throughly deserves its rating and goes to show once again you don't need to have the biggest budget, to come out with the best movie. I rate this 83%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Movie of the Galaxy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that probably changed sci-fi and fantasy films of the cinema, full of action, imagination, nostalgia, character development and charm. The 4th movie of the Star Wars trilogy, but the first and original Star Wars movie filmed, it starts with a ship being invaded by Darth Vader, who has kidnapped Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Later on, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) in an attempt to rescue the Princess Leia, who leads a group of rebels to defy the evil empire controlled by a ruthless Sith Lord and guarded by his trusted servant, Darth Vader. They must also stop the Death Star from destroying the galaxy. The result is one huge mission to save the galaxy, supported by superb direction and story from George Lucas and a memorable music score from John Williams.Each character was given his/her unique purpose in the movie, but all are committed to achieving triumph of the dark forces of evil. This fast-paced movie gives the audience a break from the reality of the problematic world, and takes you to a journey into an imagination beyond belief. Not to be missed.So, may the forces be with you.Grade B+</fullReview>

I was astonished. Raiders of the Lost Ark had the most impact on me, but Star Wars was just as good, if not better - a true epic for all ages.It's so good it's influenced many films over the years - Serenity, Spaceballs, The Last Starfighter - and some less obvious - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (a cocky young rogue teams up with an innocent boy to save a princess from an evil supernatural warlord - sound familiar?) - and it really does live up to its reputation.It's cast of memorable characters - Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader... brilliant. If you look for it, there's even a shot of smoking corpses on Tattooine. How that got past the censors...Anyways, buy some popcorn. Put it in the DVD. Sit on the couch. Immerse yourself in the greatest science-fiction film of all time.The force will be with you... always</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that changed Hollywood (for better or worse); still amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the original can still stand head and shoulders above the competition. One of the all-time biggest box office titans, the first film in the original STAR WARS trilogy is a 24-karat film classic in the same vein of such cinematic masterpieces as The WIZARD OF OZ (1939) and CASABLANCE (1942). Even the decades of sequels, lame knock-offs, and crass commercial tie-ins cannot dim the sheer brilliance of the ultimate space opera. When re-watching the film all these years later, it remains impossible not to get caught up once again in the film's irresistible sense of adventure and excitement.Much of what makes the film special (and what director/writer seems to have forgotten when creating his uneven prequel trilogy in the late-nineties/early-2000's) is the relative simplicity of the entire project. This is not to deny the various technical merits of the film, as Lucas is a true pioneer in large-scale effects-heavy film-making. The still-impressive special effects designed by Jonh Dysktra and John Stears set a new standard for film visual effects, and the production design and Rick Baker's make-up effects are top-notch without being overdone. Impressive as the film's technical merits remain, however, the film's true heart lies in good old fashioned story-telling.In the end, STAR WARS excels as entertainment simply because it is a great story told in an fresh and inventive manner. The characters have all justifiably become pop culture icons, especially Mark Hamill's quintessential put-on hero Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford's quick-witted pilot Han Solo, and everyone's favorite bickering robots, C-P3O and R2-D2. The perfect amount of sophistication is brought to the proceedings by screen legend Alec Guinness, who delivers a performance of great nuance and indisputable class. Best of all is the infamous Darth Vader (sinisterly voiced by James Earl Jones), who remains one of the silver screen's greatest villains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Hamil plays Luke Skywaker, a young man working his uncle's moisture farm on the planet of Tatoonie, who dreams of becoming a pilot and joining the rebel alliance. "If there's a bright center of the universe, your on the planet that is farthest from".Carrie Fisher plays Princes Leia from Alderan, who is part of the rebel alliance, a renegade movement seeking to overthrow the Evil empire which is the current government, that is run like a dictator ship. "The more you tighten your grip, the more star systems slip through your fingers".Harison Ford plays the Smuggler Han Solo, who Runs illegal activities for the gangster Hutts. A man who seems only in any adventure for the reward he is promised, turns out to have true heart.James Earl Jones plays a villain who uses the Dark side of the force wielding a red light saber. "A young pupil of mine until he turned to evil, betrayed and murdered your father".Underneath the grand space ship battles, the light saber duels , and the incredible imagination of George Lucas, beats a simple story that almost anyone young or old can relate to. A movie you can watch with your kids or something you can see with your friends. Its even a good date movie, with sparks flying between Han solo and the princess, just about anyone who gives this movie a chance will enjoy it.Even when they released the "Speical edition" in theaters several years later, The special effects upgrade to make the film more current didn't impress me that much. What did impress me was that adrenalin rush I felt for a second time, when Luke is aiming for that vulnerable place on the death star and Lord Vader is closing in ready to destroy him, all to the beat of an incredible score by Jhon Williams. This movie brings back all the joy i had seeing it as a kid and growing up with it, and to me thats the most imprecise thing a film can do, is stand up to Time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without Star Wars, the film industry would be way behind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is basically the "generic" fantasy story with a Sci-fi twist. The film contains the same basic characters we see in these fantasy stories, including the young hero who is the son of a great warrior (but doesn't know it just yet), and who is also usually a farmer's hand or apprentice, the kidnapped damsel, the wise old wizard, the outlaw and this buddy, the evil ruler, his right hand man, the dragon and the comic relief. The way these characters are done is brilliant and they are all memorable.Star Wars tells the story through the eyes of the 2 lesser "heroes", the droids R2 D2 and C-3PO (who represent the comic relief). They fall into the hands of Owen Lars, a moisture farmer on a desert planet. While cleaning the droids, Owens nephew Luke Skywalker (the hero) finds a message for Obi Wan Kenobi (the wise old wizard) by Princess Leia Organa (the damsel), an Imperial Senetor who's been arrested for supplying important information to the Rebel Alliance, a "terrorist" groups fighting for the freedom of the galaxy, and is being held prisoner on the Death Star (the dragon). Meanwhile, the Emporer's (the evil ruler) right hand men, Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader, send Impirial Stormtroppers out to track the droids.Back on his home world, Luke Meets Obi Wan, who teaches him about "The Force" and the ways of the Jedi, an order of Knights who once upheld peace and justice in the Old Republic. In fact, Luke's father, Anakin, was Obi Wan pupil and a great Jedi Knight, but was killed by another of Obi Wan's students, Darth Vader. After hearing the message, Luke, Obi Wan and the droids hire space pirate Han Solo, and his co-pilot, Chewbacca (both represent the outlaw and his buddy), and head for the planet Alderaan, but with the Empire after them their mission will not be easy.This has got to be the film that revolutionized today's film industry. Without it, we wouldn't have some of the greatest films of the last 20 or so years, or at least these films wouldn't have been as good. In act, we may not even have Harrison Ford, who rose to fame after playing Han Solo. While making Star Wars George Lucus founded Industrial Light and Magic (or ILM), which first used CGI animation (used bring some of your favourite films to life) in Lucus's Willow.Whether you love or hate Sci-fi and/or Fantasy, you should check it out at least once in your life.Star Wars was the last great Science Fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars has religious themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that a large part of the appeal of 'Star Wars' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. However, the movie was also a classic battle of "good versus evil" with many religious undertones and spiritual themes. Many topics such as greed, temptation, and redemption are debated in the film and I've read that George Lucas admits that he injected religion into the 'Star Wars' films (see Time magazine, April 26, 1999). Luke is told to let go of his everyday perceptions and stretch out with his feelings, to act on instinct. He is taught that some of what he sees may be like an illusion and that his perceptions can lie. When he comes to realise this, the Force will open to him.For me the whole idea of the Force is fascinating and I suppose there are various ways in which it can be interpreted -- as God perhaps, or religion itself? Or could it simply be some profound level of meaning beyond our everyday reality; this is the interpretation that makes most sense to me.At a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the Force). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality). Breaking through relative truth to make direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, and perhaps a Jedi knight could be seen as a spiritual warrior? There are many more examples of Buddhist philosophy in 'Star Wars' and I look forward to reading a recently-published book on the topic by Matthew Bortolin, called 'The Dharma of Star Wars'.May the Force be with you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can be said about the original Star Wars film, or as we now know it, Episode IV: A New Hope. This movie changed all the rules, and then some. The beauty about this movie is that it has spanned generations of fans and will continue to be passed down to generations of fans as those who love these films share them with their children.My earliest memories of Star Wars are just owning a bunch of toys, and having a few coloring books. I was too young to remember experiencing the films when they were first released, the original came out 2 months before I was born, but that has not affected my fond memories of these films. I really didn't begin to love these movies until I was in high school, sometime in the early 90s. To me that just demonstrates the power and effectiveness of these movies all together. By the time I saw Episode IV, the special effects were old hat, but the stories resonated with me so much, as with anyone else who loves these films, that they will always be my absolute favorites.So much can be said about the Ep IV itself, the fantasy adventure, the groundbreaking effects, the fun and brilliant performances including Alec Guiness who was nominated for Best-Supporting Actor despite his attempts to dist5ance himself from the movies. I recommend anyone who loves Star wars to go out and rent some of his films such as Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai and Ladykillers, all classics.To myself, this original film represents innocence, not only in the characters but in its legacy. The innocence of Luke Skywalker as he leaves his farm boy life to pursue his destiny. The innocence of the children and millions of fans who love this movie to their death. That to me is what Star Wars is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic sci-fi adventure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tough to write a comment for this movie. What is there to say that hasn't been said before in countless other comments? From back in the days when great movies flowed from George Lucas like water, "Star Wars" has become a classic. Nearly everyone has seen this film and few people have I ever heard talk bad about it. Personally, I have absolutely nothing negative to say."Star Wars" is the story of young Luke Skywalker and his chance meeting with the Jedi (a man who once acted as a guardian of the galaxy, using a mystical power known as the Force) Obi-Wan Kenobi. This meeting leads to his eventual joining Kenobi on a quest to rescue a princess held prisoner aboard the Galactic Empire's powerful space station, the Death Star. The story is exciting, with characters that are forever memorable.This movie goes to show that Lucas originally had a knack for great casting. When casting for this movie, Lucas says he looked for actors/actresses with great personalities (I won't ask why that changed for the prequel trilogy). Casting the relative unknowns Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher was one of the greatest moves ever made by Lucas. I could never picture anyone but Harrison Ford as Han Solo, the cocky smuggler and pilot of the Millennium Falcon.While Lucas acts as if the low budget special effects are a weakness, I consider it a bonus. The planets in this movie have a gritty, lived in look. The space travel and starships look realistic enough to keep me engrossed.Usually I recommend watching a movie I praise at the end of my comments, but this is "Star Wars". Who hasn't already seen it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film represents, I think, for many people, a new and vibrant mythology that will live on decades into the future and be passed on through generations in the same way that literary tales like Rapunzel or Jack and The Beanstalk are.The advent of the cinema means that the medium on which the story is told is film instead of paper. It's as simple as that.There are so many great moments in Star Wars thats its hard to pick out a singular event from the story to dwell on - but now that the Revenge of The Sith has finally elaborated on the Obi-Wan/Anakin compratriotship the final light saber duel between them is given a tragic excitement that wasn't there before the prequels.Many people will disown the special editions as OTT, ruining the original vision - b*llocks to that. See the Special Editions - they are aesthetically much better and the expanded visions of creatures and systems fits in more with the new trilogy.Look out for the Storm Trooper tw*ting his head against the blast doors in the death star and also notice that the fat sh*t pilot at the end is called Porkins.A timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars was the movie that showed you could use special effects and make it look "special." Who is going to forget the end of the movie, with Luke Skywalker shooting through the canyon on the Deathstar, attempting to the be hero. How wonderful did that look the first time you saw it? Nowadays, that is easy for computers to reproduce, but the scale and scope of the effects by George Lucas and his team is what created the sheer awe and joy of Star Wars. The story is not bad either. A classic Western story with clearly defined good and bad guys, with Eastern Mythology thrown in there to add a mystical element, this first movie is actually the forth chapter of what will eventually be 6 (maybe 9?) movies, set the foundation shrewdly of what has become one of the world's most popular science fiction series. The essential characters, some of the back stories, and wonders of the Galaxy far far away are all introduced, and giving the audience a pretty good time while at it. Originally produced as a stand alone movie, the people at Fox Studios had no confidence that Star Wars would succeed so plans for the following sequels were not on the drawing board, Star Wars is entertaining, but do leave us with enough questions about the Force and Darth Vader and the unseen Emperor that when the following movies do come out, the audience was more than ready to embrace them, and make Star Wars the most successful science fiction series ever.</fullReview>

It's just everything works so right together. Great story, great actors and great special FX for the time.This film is based around farm boy Luke Skywalker, and the realisation of his destiny from wise Jedi Knight Ben 'Obi-wan' Kenobi played by Alec Guiness. They set out to rescue Princess Leia from the evil Empire, and we meet many a memorable foe along the way, such as Vader, Tarkin, the storm-trooper that hits his head on a door! Has a brilliant ending with a space duel and a fight between two old friends.If you only see one Star Wars film, make sure it's this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lucasfilm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Star Wars was shown in 1977, it changed film history and people. It was a huge success, and it wasn't long before fans started to wear costumes and watching the movie for the 50th time in theaters. 20 years later, George Lucas made Special Editions of the trilogy, and it disappointed many fans. They said that Lucas butchered the films and "raped their childhood." I wouldn't know how to feel, since I wasn't there when Star Wars was first released. I didn't care for Star Wars when I first watched it as a kid, but upon second viewing, I liked it a lot more. Lucas' changes to the films never really bothered me that much (I couldn't really understand why many people hated that Greedo shot first. Nor who or what the hell is Greedo).The film starts with a gigantic Star Destroyer chasing a small ship and finally capturing them. 2 droids go to an escape pod and gets sold to Luke Skywalker with his aunt and uncle, while Princess Leia is captured by Darth Vader, a heavy breathing man wearing a mask throughout the whole film. The plot is pretty simple, but it's surrounded by the world of Star Wars that George Lucas made (with much inspiration from Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress). The Star Warsverse impressed a lot of people with how it was created and how vast and many different planets present in the galaxy.I thought that the film started off so slowly and some parts were uninteresting and just goes on and on. So much unnecessary cuteness was put in the first 30-40 minutes of the film. Yes, it's the most light-hearted film in the trilogy, but it just couldn't avoid being too childish. The costumes and make-up are quite impressive, and the visuals still hold up to this day, where blowing up planets won't consist of sparks and a ring to it. Too bad that Lucas couldn't appreciate the time that the film was made.We are then introduced to one of the best characters in the Star Wars Trilogy, Han Solo, with a "walking carpet" Wookie named Chewbacca. Luke Skywalker, along with Obi-Wan Kenobi gets Han Solo and Chewbacca to rescue the Princess. Rescuing the Princess and getting out of the Death Star is one of the most enjoyable and hilarious parts of the film. The Lightsaber fights aren't as fast-paced or 'complicated' compared to the Prequels, but that doesn't become a problem at all. The chemistry between Luke, Han and Leia become a treat to watch and often times hilarious. Getting stuck with these hilarious characters that you care for 2 more films isn't a problem. That's one of the magic of Star Wars: quirky, delightful characters, which is certainly lacking in the Prequels (okay, I'll stop it with the comparison to the prequels right now)I love model ships that are put into a blue background and get destroyed. And because of the lack of technology back then, Lucas puts into good use this technique and does it well. He may have added some CGI in the Special Editions to make it more exciting, but I'm happy with the result. With great characters, exciting action scenes and such a rich, vast galaxy as their surroundings, it's no wonder that Star Wars became such a huge success and is still loved by many people up to this day.8.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can still remember sitting in the theatre at 4 years old watching this movie with my Dad. The movie is great overall, but perhaps one of the best scenes in all of cinema is the great Battle at Yavin where the struggling rebellion destroys the evil Death Star. Luke Skywalker came to be a childhood hero for me. The magnificent score by John Williams only hightens it's brilliance. This movie for me is the best of the trilogy and I'm sure will stand the test of time as with all great movies. You might say I'm somewhat partial to this movie being from the bay area near to where George Lucas directed some of the movie so I can appreciate his direction and his style of directing.I give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is the stuff of legends, mainly because it finds its inspiration in countless folk legends and archetypes, but also because it became the inspiration of an era. It was probably the first ever cinematic cult phenomenon and one can measure its power by the sway it still holds 27 years after its release.The story couldn't be simpler frankly so do dwell on this detail would be to miss the point entirely. The backdrop is the main character of the film and it is nothing short of miraculous! The alien vistas and locals while otherworldly have a worn look that makes them unbelievably real (unlike the often fake-looking CGI of the prequels). The technology looks real. This authentic look gives the action scenes a power almost transcendental. It surpasses anything we've ever seen because despite it's otherworldlyness it all works. So the world Lucas creates more than makes up for the bland characterizations (these are only archetypes after all so don't expect too much depth, that's a advantage Empire Strikes Back has over the entire saga) and acting, although veterans Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones give this more dignity and weight and there's a very welcome cynical "this can't be real" look from Ford that means the film doesn't take itself all too seriously (something lacking in the prequels).This vision of fantasy has it's flaws but it still solidly deserves cult status for it's gargantuan strengths: a legendary score by John Williams, era-defining special effects, a mythology and fantasy that rival anything ever imagined by a film-maker, great action and a pure naive heart that makes it impossible to resist and is seriously lacking in today's blockbusters.Star Wars is more than a film: it is in itself a reason to love movies. It is a testimonial to man's imaginative powers. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless classic (major spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe that what is really a humble, conventional space opera has become nothing short of an international phenomenon. Spawning two sequels, a trilogy of prequels, countless merchandising spin-offs and a rabid fan culture, "Star Wars" has developed a mythology all its own. Yet, in spite of all the hype, looking back on "Star Wars" makes it very easy to see why it has become so popular.To begin with, creator George Lucas' plot was ingeniously simple, incorporating character types and other elements from old Saturday matinee serials. The result is an enjoyable storyline with easily identifiable characters. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a farmboy from the desert planet of Tatooine, becomes embroiled in a rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire. He teams up with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), the last of the Jedi, a near-extinct breed of guardian warriors; Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a reckless, apathetic mercenary; his hairy sidekick Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); and finally C-3PO and R2-D2 (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker), a pair of bickering robots. Together they must rescue Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the clutches of the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones). Later, Luke must face up to his destiny as a Jedi as helps the Rebellion in their attack on the Death Star, a planet-destroying superweapon...The plot could not be simpler, or more enthralling, than that. The characters are very easily identifiable (the earnest young hero, the wise old mentor, the cynical mercenary) and the embracing of story conventions contributes to the story, instead of detracting from it. Much criticism has been made of script-writer Lucas' lack of flair with dialogue and to some extent this is true.It is to the credit of the actors who embellish their characters with a depth and a presence. Hamill is possessed of a fine mix of enthusiasm, bravery and youthful naivety as Luke, and Harrison Ford is wry, smart and likeable as Solo. His cynical, couldn't-care-less attitude to the chaos all around him stops the film from taking itself too seriously. Carrie Fisher is also excellent as Princess Leia, giving her regal character a strength and a backbone. Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker are a lively and funny source of comic relief and here, unlike in the sequels, they actually contribute something to the plot.Of the villains, James Earl Jones lends an all-knowing powerful air to the voice of Darth Vader, who is given a strong physical presence by David Prowse. Although Vader was to become the main villain of the series, here he's really more of a henchman. Keeping him in line is Grand Moff Tarkin, played with ruthless authority by British actor Peter Cushing.The special effects were revolutionary in 1977, giving the many fights and space battles a style and a sparkle that had never been seen before. The lightsaber duel between Vader and Kenobi, and the final attack on the Death Star, are the main highlights here.In a way, "Star Wars" has become the victim of its own success. Rumour has it that Lucas will revise "Star Wars" and its sequels yet again in the upcoming DVD releases, to ensure they dovetail exactly with the recently released prequels. This does makes sense to do this, yet the danger is that Lucas will lose the spirit and verve that encapsulated the original film.P.S To really enjoy "Star Wars", make sure you see it in a large, packed cinema. I guarantee this significantly increases the already high entertainment factor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Star Wars" has been blamed for most of the evils of the last 25 years of cinema, and probably rightly. But no-one who saw this film on first release aged seven could possibly give it a bad review. It's a simple tale of good-versus-evil, but there's still so much for even the most cynical and cultured of viewers to enjoy: the rousing music, the 70s haircuts, the skillful use of the Tunisian desert (completely convincing as another world) and of course, the stunningly composed opening scene where the great triangular battleship, impossibly large, passes overhead for what seems like an eternity. Then you have the characters: Darth Vader, the perfect villain; C-3P0, the camp droid; and the bickering duo of Leia and Han. And the touch of extra class added by Brit veterans Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing. And, most important in an action adventure, there's the perfectly paced, self-contained plot, notably matched in precisely none of its numerous sequels.It's aged well too. The special effects, then revolutionary, immediately made every previous science fiction film essentially unwatchable, and still look good today (and the "enhancements" of the special edition are really quite small). It's not the best movie ever made, but for my generation, "Star Wars" remains the film of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Film that started it all. Literally. Sequels, trilogies, merchandise, you name it. Star Wars (I refuse to call it ?A New Hope') has shaped the Hollywood we know today.Star Wars isn't a brilliant film. The plot isn't even particularly original. But what it is (or more specifically was) is a totally groundbreaking exercise in production techniques and values. Nothing like it had ever been seen before and as such, captured the imagination like nothing ever had or ever will again.Even by today's standards, the sets are lavish, the costumes are cool and the characters are just fantastic. You can see why literally everything that appears on screen for even a second has its own action figure. Chewie, the Stormtroopers, Greedo and all the others bristle with imagination and convincingly portray ?a galaxy far, far away' for the first time ever. Personally speaking, I don't think it has ever been surpassed in science fiction and probably never will. And that is why the franchise has been successful. It created a whole mythos, with the Jedi, successfully blending hi-tech with old style religions and prophecies. I don't think there will ever be a phenomenon like this again. And, although The Empire Strikes Back is technically a superior film, this remains, in my opinion, one of the biggest milestones in cinematic history. I mean, look at it! It was made in 1977! I know its been tinkered with but most films dont even look that good today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I ever saw Star Wars is a day that i will always remember. I was not around when the originals came out in the theaters, but i did get to witness this great adventure on tape. I was eleven years old, the summer between fifth and sixth grade and i was preparing for my first trip to boy scout summer camp. Anyways, I always heard from friends and from other sources about how great these films were so i got my mother to rent it for me one day.I could not believe how action packed and exciting this film was. The plot and the characters, the evil and the good, rebellion and power. It introduced me to a whole new world of mystery and imagination.The great thing about this movie is that everyone can find something to relate to, real or imagine. To me, a young innocent child of the world, Star Wars gave me a sense of wonder, a chance to imagine myself as a hero such as luke skywalker or han solo. No wonder so many kids a generation before me grew up worshiping these films, they give us a creative outlook, an ability to leave our world and pretend to be somewhere a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.Years follwed. I saw all the movies, read all the books that followed, bought all the toys i could find. It was an adventure, a part of my childhood that i always look back upon with fuzzy and warm memories. I hope one day i can have children that can appreciate these wonderful movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sci-Fi classic, one of the best ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Points: Truly a classic and, for its time, ground-breaking movie, Star Wars is one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made. Even today the original movie, which is now actually Episode IV of course, holds up pretty well, even in the special FX department. When you realize that Star Wars has been around for twenty-five years and Lucas can STILL pack a theater, all one can do is kow-tow to one of the gods of Sci-Fi. Bad Points: About the original movie, there is little to complain about. What few complaints one could conjure are due simply to the fact that the movie is so old. But all things considered including age, the only complaint I have is that its very typical in a lot of ways. With the exception of Princess Leia, all the main characters are men. Surely a technologically advanced society would also have moved forward in a social way as well, meaning more women in positions of authority. This is prevalent throughout the Star Wars series. Also, Lucas's directing was a bit banal. It was okay, but nothing spectacular. Someone like Stanley Kubrick would have made the movie absolutely immortal.Bottom Line: The bad points are very minor ones. Overall, anyone who says that Star Wars isn't a fantastic film doesn't know what the heck they're talking about and you should lend no weight to their opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid I worshipped this movie. I still have my collection of toys and books but I hardly ever watch this movie anymore. I tend to regard it as something from my childhood and leave it behind. Nonetheless it is still a classic movie that I have never forgotten since age 5. This is really the only George Lucas movie I like (besides the sequels and prequel). This is the most lighthearted of the original trilogy and my second favorite beating out The Empire Strikes Back. With that said this movie will remain a classic for many, many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film's force will be with us for a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In early summer 1977 I found myself taking in the sights on Times Square one Saturday afternoon, and I came across a long line of people waiting to get into Loews Theater (which turned out to have a screen, oh, about a half mile wide) to see "Star Wars." For several months I'd been intrigued by a silver-gray movie poster at the Memphian Theater back home that said simply, "Coming to Your Galaxy This Summer: Star Wars." My feet were tired from walking all over New York, so I decided, "What the heck," and got in line. When I bought my ticket I was given a pin-on button, about three inches in diameter, upon which was printed against a blue field of stars, "May the Force Be With You." "Wonder what that means?" I thought, and I pinned it on my shirt. I found a seat and for the next two hours, as I sat suspended in space from the front row of the balcony, "Star Wars" transported me, as no movie had before, to adventures in a time and place I could never have imagined. "Star Wars" took my breath away. Almost literally. When the Millennium Falcon kicked into overdrive and the stars stretched, I nearly fell out of the balcony. The next day I traveled home and told all my friends that they would soon see a new science fiction movie that was about to sweep the country and they would all love it. They thought I was nuts, but I was mostly right of course. (Can you believe some people don't love "Star Wars?") Now I have the new version of all three "Star Wars" films on LaserDisc, and I expect to continue enjoying them for years to come. And yes, I like the new versions better. The Jabba the Hutt scene was an especially welcome addition to the first film.</fullReview>

This was the first time I've seen Star Wars in the cinema. I've seen the old version (from 1977) on TV before and I was a litte disappointed because there were only a few new scenes. But nevertheless Star Wars has found its place as one of the best films ever, like the Jungle Book or Casablanca. I am looking forward to the new Star Wars movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves its staying power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is misunderstanding to call Star Wars science fiction. Science fiction needs to develop, dwell on, and often to strike the audience with awe over a plausible scientific or technological development greatly surpassing what we know. Lucas pondered early on with John Williams whether the character of the music should be electronic- mystical, as science fiction would suggest. They decided against it-- and can anyone doubt that Williams's actual score captured the true texture of the film much better? Set in "a galaxy far, far away" though it was, the music and almost everything else stressed the familiar rather than the strange. The parallels with our own culture were deliberate and a source of amusement. We are to feel at home in this world. More on this later.I remember seeing this film for the first time, being in my mid twenties but catching upon in many ways on that adolescence which had passed me by in my teens. I was with a wonderful, unorthodox friend, a little younger than I and different from anyone I had ever been friends with before. He led me all the way down the aisle to sit in the very front row. I had never done that. Something so, well, extreme hadn't been my style. I was, in short, prepared already for a different kind of experience, and Star Wars provided it.Part of the initial success of Star Wars was due, I think, to its simple and straightforward morality. As others have detailed, everyone knows who the good guys and the bad guys are here. The good guys are brave, confident of their cause, and they win decisively. I'm not sure it has been remarked, however, how ready we were for something like this. When it came out, the U.S. was disillusioned and demoralized.First Vietnam. Then Watergate. Inflation was eating the economy alive. We had become guilt-ridden and unsure of our instincts. We were tired of shadows, ambiguities, and catch-22s. By seeing clear-cut heroism work in a galaxy far, far away, just maybe we could bring it back home where we were missing it badly.Also, at that time, I detested where I was living and working. It had been a mistake to move there, and I seemed trapped and wondered if I would ever get out. Are we in charge of our own lives, I wondered, or leaves tossed randomly in the wind? So I really empathized with young Luke's despondency, stuck on a dismal backwater of a planet when he wanted to be where some action was. It was exhilarating to follow him as he was drawn into the vortex of important matters. I daresay we we have all felt like that at times; so this is one more fantasy which Star Wars plays out for us.It is stunning to reflect on how well I remember first seeing this film, and how long ago it really was: some of its adult fans today weren't even born then. But One can't even say that this shared admiration crosses generational boundaries. It simply obliterates them. How many films become blockbusters, and their delighted makers rush to cash in on the craze with one or more slipshod sequels which can be counted on to suck? Lucas never did that. His craftsmanship and creativity have been consistent, and now his patience has got to be almost unique. He has now been working on the fourth episode for almost two decades; and the world is still waiting for it with bated breath. It had better be damned good. And something tells me it will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Space Opera Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm continuing to watch all six episodes of "Star Wars" in preparation for "The Force Awakens" (at this point I'm considerably late to the game, but better late than never). Last night I watched "Episode IV: A New Hope", which is of course the first of the six films to be made.The last time I watched this movie was about a year and a half ago, when I watched the original trilogy with my brother who had never seen any of them. I had watched the prequels then, too, on my own in preparation for the latter three films, and at the time I remember being ever so slightly disappointed with "A New Hope". I didn't get that same slight disappointment this time, perhaps due to watching on a larger screen TV, or perhaps due to not having the anxiety of wondering what my fellow and first time viewer thought about the film, who knows. I do think I now have a good appreciation both for what makes this film great and what makes it distinct from the other movies."A New Hope" is, in its own way, the simplest of the Star Wars movies. Sure, the story has a lot going on--but there's less to keep up with than in the more complicated prequels (which I think are great, by the way). It's this relative simplicity that almost takes away from the movie. "A New Hope" doesn't set up its characters with a lot of back story--Darth Vader hardly gets one at all, especially if you're watching for the first time and don't know much about the Star Wars mythology. One could argue that a tad bit more background at certain points could have been helpful. And yet, despite its simplicity, it's a perfect movie overall. It tells just enough to be enjoyable on its own merits, and it firmly establishes its characters as archetypes in film history--both its protagonists and main antagonist. Yes, its effects are a bit cheesy at points--it was 1977, so at times things look a bit like an Atari game. Still, it all just comes together into a seamless and enjoyable film, and one that is just all around fun and entertaining.I will note that the movie is best viewed on a larger television--as I noted above, this certainly made a difference for me in my two most recent viewings. HD should be obvious as well, so definitely opt for Blu Ray for this one. All in all, I have to give this movie 10/10 stars. It's the perfect epic space opera. So simple that a kid can easily keep up and love it, but enjoyable for all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AN over-rated but awesome film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most over-rated film in the saga. Don't get me wrong. I love A New Hope. But it definitely is no way as good as the sequels. This film started the series and without it being such a success, there is no way we would've have got the others so firstly I'd like to say thanks. My favourite thing about this film is we get our first glimpse of all the best characters. Vader, Han, R2, Chewie, 3-PO. It was annoying that Lucas ended up including Jabba in this film and I would have preferred to not have that scene because it ruins the look of Jabba. I love the opening moment when we first get our glimpse R2 and 3-PO. The Cantina scene was a delight and easily in my favourite scenes of all-time. It has it all. The awesome music, first sight of a lightsaber in action as well as our favourite duo Han and Chewie. Also we can't forget when we see how big of a scoundrel Han is when he shoots fi... Wait! Lucas changed that!!!!!! The plot is a little ludicrous if you think about it (many of it being implausible) and this film is way more childish than the second two. We also can't forget Luke and his whining. The acting was great but it didn't blow me away. Particularly Alec McGuiness who could've done better as McGregor showed us. The worst part is the end though. I can't help but wonder why they didn't give Chewie a medal as well. It's inconceivable! This film had many awesome things about but it's the little things that didn't make it as awesome as the other originals. This timeless classic will forever be one of my favourite films and deserves to be loved. Acting: 9/10 Dialogue: 9/10 Plot: 9/10 Characters: 10/10 Entertainment Value: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About As Good As I Remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was raised on all six Star Wars movies, and due to the recent release of Star Wars VII I felt the need to re-watch the series. My opinion of this movie has remained generally unchanged. The plot of A New Hope is, although not particularly original by today's standards, still a good one. The galaxy is ruled by an evil empire and a rebellion forms. I actually never knew why the rebels fought the empire when I watched it as a kid, nor did I know what a rebel was. So the plot didn't feel old or boring to me. The characters were decent, but once again, not horribly original by today's standards. I still found that they were just as likable as I remember them. Star Wars as a series is one that, although did great when it first came out, doesn't stand up to that nearly as well by today's standards. Reason being this series set the standards, so we've seen so much of Star Wars already in modern science fiction movies. The series does not age well, but when you think about it from the perspective of when it first came out it really is quite a good series. Overall A New Hope is a solid addition to the science fiction genre, and one of it's most important contributions. Despite not aging very well, it manages to hold up as a classic that I will never forget, and I think it will hold a special place in every person's heart who watched it when it first came out (or as children like me). In the end I would recommend that everyone give Star Wars a watch. Whether you like it or not is not important, but you just need to see it if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having grown up with the "Star Wars" trilogy, then "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about "Star Wars"?George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the "Star Wars" universe. And it doesn't require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...The cast in "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved."Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships. It is an enjoyable movie for the entire family, space nerds or not.If you are not already familiar with the legendary "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" movie, then it is more than due time to get to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many films I saw as a child that, upon an unbiased reviewing, I found objectively bad. This was not one of those movies. Of all of the films released since the beginning of the medium, this one will go down in history as a masterpiece in all respects.

Its legacy is impossible to ignore. Its part in the greatest story ever told is essential.There is something about Star Wars that makes it a film classic.

		<shortDescription>It might be cliché to say but Star Wars is surely something special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can write off the Star Wars series really easily. It's talked about nonstop through every decade. Your audience who are Star Wars "fan boys" are likely the most boisterous fans of any film series. Unlike many others, it's a series to whole variety of people and that's why it's made so much money through the years. It will always be one of the few series known to create trilogies so many years after the last trilogy in the series. Director, George Lucas has remastered the original films so much it has got to the point of being very tiresome. All of these things are a bit much but still I can't deny what great art Star Wars: A New Hope is. Of course, this is the Star Wars movie that started it all.In the simplest way I can describe it, the plot of A New Hope consists of enemy and empire leader Darth Vader taking Princess Lea (Carrie Fisher) hostage. A hotshot named Han Solo (Harrison Ford), two droids named R2-D2 (who has major plans of the empire) and CP-3P0 and basically a young kid named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) are the main keys to saving the galaxy.At the first glance, the plot seems a lot to comprehend even if it is so original. It comes down to good characters that helps the plot work. Han Solo is exactly Harrison Ford's personality; so cocky and such a scrooge so it's hard not to like him. Luke Skywalker is really the ultimate underdog character and it's just make you wish Hamill had a career outside of this series because he brings so much to this character. Princess Lea is what a princess should be; she's sexy and much more likable then the other princess characters around. Darth Vader right from the start gives off of a vibe of an ionic villain and he's the character you want to see more of even if he is the villain. Really, even the droids have some character development where as CP-3P0 is nerdy and a clumsy fellow and R2-D2 is always willing to be in the big moments. This classic gets even better once you realize how well it's made. For a film made in 1977, it seems so new and effects that are acceptable even now. There is action that never lets up and the third act action really is something. From the desert area where Luke grew up to the many spaceship scenes, the settings are really chosen well which is really something for film from the 70's. Even more, it has a 70's-type charm that is not dated still. Basically in a nutshell, I am saying that this first installment of the Star Wars series is timeless. Very few films come close to what this film is. This is the type of cinema that comes around in once a lifetime for a person. Even though I am a bigger fan of the Star Trek series (please don't shoot me fan boys!), I can still can get into Star Wars quite a bit. It might be cliché to say but Star Wars is surely something special.</fullReview>

A New Hope is the film that started the magic of the Saga even tho is not as great as the sequel that came after it Episode IV is definitely awesome from the beautiful cast to the good writing and direction. Too bad that George Lucas had to change some of the most awesome scenes in a cut that has way too much CGI and for the record Han Shot First.

		<fullReview>Star Wars (1977) **** (out of 4) Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins forces with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) as they plan to go after Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who is being held hostage by Darth Vadar.Whether people like it or not, STAR WARS is one of those ground-breaking movies that became a massive hit and it eventually took over the world. Watching the film so many years later it really is amazing what George Lucas was able to do with this film and what would follow. I will gladly admit that I'm not a fanboy of this series and in fact this recent viewing was the first time I had seen this since it was released in its Special Edition form. With that said, even though I'm not a "fanboy" it's impossible to deny that power that this film contains.Storywise there's really nothing overly ground-breaking here but in my opinion that's what makes the film so darn good. There's no long-winded or drawn-out story to drag things down. The basic premise is rather simple as an up-and-coming fighter gets his opportunity to be great and sets out to do so. I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they're worth.It's really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it's easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts. Both are quite good in the film as are Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, the two veterans of the picture. With that said, I think it goes without saying that it's Harrison Ford who really stands out in the role of Han Solo. His comic timing with Chewbacca has made for some of the most memorable moments of this film and he's simply delightful to watch in the role.Of course, fans will debate the tinkering that Lucas has done with the picture but I think both versions hold up extremely well. I understand the purist who want to view what they originally saw in theaters and I understand those who defend the updating of the effects. Either way, STAR WARS is a rare blockbuster that also manages to be extremely well-made and deserving of its reputation.</fullReview>

It's become so iconic and immersed in pop culture that it's sometimes hard to just focus and enjoy the movie itself and not see it as a part of a huge phenomenon.All it's status and fan base aside, I try to do just that when I watch it and still enjoy it for what it is. For all it's imagination, the plot is nice and simple, basically a good guys VS bad guys western in space, leaving you to not think too hard about anything but just enjoy the many weird and wonderful locations and the characters.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a farm boy who wants to leave his home and fight the dark imperial forces led by the sinister Darth Vader, and it isn't long before he's thrust into an adventure after he meets the ageing Obi Won Kenobi (Alec Guiness). Hamill does fine as Skywalker but he is outshone by the much more interesting Guiness, and Harrison Ford, in one of his earliest roles as cocky pilot Han Solo, who finds himself reluctantly embroiled in their mission. Ford not only gets to play the most likable character but he has the confidence and screen charisma to be much more memorable than the protagonist.Even so, all the other characters are great too. The droids R2-D2, and C3P0, Han Solo's hairy sidekick - the Wookie, Chewbacca, and the feisty Princess Leia, (Carrie Fisher) who doesn't fit into the typical Hollywood damsel in distress category at the time.Some of the dialogue may now seem a bit corny, and some of the acting mediocre but it doesn't matter because there's a light, campy tone to the movie anyway, so it doesn't ruin the enjoyment. In fact adds to it for me.Lucas' genius was mixing Samurai and western elements with Sci-fi and using what he had with the budget to create a bizarre and memorable universe. Seen now, compared to the pace of modern Sci-fi movies, the movie's first half actually moves along quite slow, which is no bad thing in my view. It allows you to be pulled into it's world, and he cleverly uses the droid characters to take you on the journey, from the opening sequence right until the end. A revolutionary idea for the time. But then there's so many things about Star Wars that's revolutionary.Lucas has since tinkered about with the original trilogy and has ruined the franchise for many not only by doing this but with his prequel trilogy too. In some ways I agree but it doesn't take anything away from what he achieved with this in 1977. A movie that opened up audiences' imaginations and still holds up as not just as an influential classic but an entertaining fantasy adventure in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in a galaxy a long time ago and far far away, young farmhand Luke Skywalker take's his first steps in embracing his lineage and his destiny. In the midst of a intergalactic war with the rebellion that has spanned years and torn apart the galaxy, the evil galactic empire and its dreaded new weapon the Death Star have spread fear throughout the galaxy. Having been captured by one of the empires most sinister agents Darth Vader, Princess Leia sets off a chain reaction that will forever change and define the galaxy...The movie that ushered in a new era for blockbusters and ground breaking special effects that brought forth a new precedence in what can be achieved in film and storytelling. At one time the highest grossing film of all time. The story, sweeping, the characters and locations memorable and what many have dubbed the greatest sci fi movie of all time.Lucas takes you on a roller coaster ride of action and adventure that had as of yet to be every experienced in film. Once again John Williams scores this movie where in this instance the soundtrack only strengthens and endears the film for legions of fans across the world, having spawned 5 sequels and with an upcoming 6th film coming out in 2015, Star Wars is simply put one of the finest gems in all of film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is fantastic. Especially the Theatrical Releases, the ones George Lucas didn't mess with. The story is a classic tale. a modern fairy tale. With a farm boy who sets off on an adventure after his last family is gone (well there is still his father *MAJOR SPOILER* Darth Vader *MAJOR SPOILER*). He must fight against the evil Galactic Empire. It is just one of those movies you can put yourself into and feel the action and the feelings your meant to feel. It is a true classic. Of course George can't take all the credit for this fantastic movie. It has a great by John Williams and fantastic acting by Sir Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrey Fischer, and we can't forget R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). Even though the movie may be oldish, the effects hold up even to todays standards, in fact I think they look better than most effects we see today! Overall if you haven't seen this movie, you are insane and need to watch it (don't be afraid if they call you a nerd. They're just jealous :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Film Of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film I saw as a kid. This film (as well as the sequels and prequels) have been with me forever. I probably saw this when I got out of the hospital and put the tape into the VCR, yeah I was around when those were around. I think it should have won all of the Oscars it was nominated for. It losing Best Picture, Director and Screenplay to Woody Allen's Annie Hall, is just inexcusable. That film was boring, while this film is great, but that's just my opinion on Annie Hall. George Lucas was influenced by Serials like Buck Rodgers and Flash Gordon, as well as taking classic tales like a boy wanting to go on adventures meeting some interesting characters that eventually meet a wizard, that meet a couple of other interesting characters all to save a princess from the villains is all fairytale stuff, and George Lucas knows that. He even puts mythology and religion into the film, later in the Prequels he puts political stuff to show how things that were so good they collapsed and how someone gained the power they did. From the opening crawl, to the destruction of the Death Star, from seeing Luke meet C-3PO and R2-D2, to Luke getting his fathers Lightsaber and learning about the Force by Obi-Wan, to them meeting Han Solo and Chewbacca and all of them going to the Death Star and saving Princess Leia and Darth Vader killing Obi-Wan, to Luke destroying the Death Star and killing Grand Moff Tarkin, seeing the victory of the Rebels, this is a Masterpiece that deserves it's place in Film History.</fullReview>

And of course memorable songs like Binary Sunset or Mos Eisley Cantina Theme. Except all this this is the story of the fight between good and evil. And in this universe goods win all the time, like we always wanted. These are what you need to make an legendary movie and affect people. And also beginning of a huge franchise. Even George Lucas can not know his movie will be that successful. But in the end he made a great masterpiece to everyone can love...</fullReview>

If it wasn't for George Lucas I don't think we would be seeing movies like Alien and Terminator the same. The reason I think this Star Wars film is the best is because this one develops its characters the best and builds its relationships much better than the others.Overall if you are wanting to get into star wars this is the place to start.

		<fullReview>The ground breaking visuals never seen on cinema was a shock to many of us who's seen this movie for the first time. After over 30 years, it's still the best movie of its type.I didn't notice this when I first saw this movie but Ben Kenoby does mention about the "Clone Wars" in this episode. If this was a far reaching foresight on George Lucas' part, my hats off to him. This movie has more visceral impact compared to the CG filled episodes 1-3. It just shows that you can't beat the real thing. More I saw it, more I was in awe of all the fine details that was put into this movie. Each of the scenes were directed precisely without a flaw. George Lucas was an awesome director when he made this film. Ben Kenoby also mentions about Darth Vader who killed Luke's father - as we find out in the next episode, this was only a metaphor. The movie is both simple and complex at the same time.There's no word to describe this movie. Made on a relatively modest budget, it's still the finest movie of its kind. It shows that money is no substitute for talent.It's a miracle that we have this movie. I'd say it's one of the crowning achievements of human civilization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in my early 20's when the First Star Wars movie came out. Unless you were there, experiencing this new type of movie magic (because, up until then, we didn't have any kind of movies like this) it's hard to understand why it became the sensation that it did.The original promotions for this Star Wars was a full page ad in all the major newspapers with mock-up's of a unidentified young man and a girl (Drawings in black and white on a white background that ran for WEEKS before the movie premiered. There was no indication of who they were or what the movie was about other than the Title. It cause a HUGE reaction of excitement and people were talking about it for weeks before the movie was released. I had to arrive at the theater 3 hours early and wait in line around the entire theater with hundreds of other people just to purchase my ticket and then sit another 2 hours in the theater waiting and wondering what it was going to be about. Up until that time, special effects were in their infancy. This movie reached a new level for the entire viewing audience in the world. We watched a new dawn of entertainment begin.People have to remember that back then, there were no cell phones, no CORDLESS phones, no computers, gas was 57 cents a gallon and phone calls from a pay phone (which was your ONLY option unless you had access to a land line corded phone) were 10 cents. Video games weren't available in the old stand up versions yet. It would be years before play at home video games were invented. There were no CD's, vinyl records had to do.....cassette tapes were on the forefront....nor had DVDs been invented. 19 inch TV's were considered LARGE. No cable, no satellites. FM radio and color TV's were only a few years old. Anyone under the age of 30 has no idea of the pure magic this first Stars wars was. And as one of the other users mentioned, George Lucas loved the old time Saturday kids serials and he NEVER, in his wildest imagination had any idea how he would create one of the most incredible franchise's in the world. Both he and Steven Spielberg changed the course of modern history. Had their movies never been made, today's special effects would not exist.Today's youth have grown up with everything at their beck and call...cell phones, computers, incredible video game graphics, and extraordinary special effects in action movies. A lot of them have little or no respect for anyone who is older than 40. They have no idea how George Lucas and Steven Spielberg affected today's world. My generation saw the future before it existed. If you look at the technology in the Episode III, it is near perfect; and if you watch the 4th original episode (the first movie), you'll see that even 30 years ago, the way the world was viewed we STILL don't have the actual technology in real life, NOW in 2008 that George Lucas created more than 30 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that a film is released and it literally changes society. Pop culture, modern film and cinema history took a hit when this film was released... yes even before the 'Episode IV' title was attached.'Star Wars' wasn't just another Sci-Fi film, it was the first time in a long time a filmmaker's vision transferred to celluloid untouched by executive hands and actually worked.Sure, millions will say that it's one of the greatest films ever... perhaps in Sci-Fi circles. It was, easily, one of the most influential. Not because it spawned a billion dollar industry for special FX, toys and marketing or five sequel films... but it led the way for all the films and filmmakers to follow in it's footsteps.Was it greatly acted? It was OK. Was it greatly written? It was an original, paced story.But with it's effects, score and direction, it all came together... and in the end, that is what great epic film is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated PG for Violence The Star Wars saga is one of(if not the most) popular saga out there.The first film came out in 1977 and ever since then there have been plenty of fans who go as far as dressing up and waiting in line for days when the sequels come out.In my opinion I think the original Star Wars trilogy(Episodes 4,5 and 6) are the best.Episode 1 was a disappointment, Episode 2 was better and Episode 3 was closest to the original three.The special-effects may be dated as of today but back in 1977, it was simply amazing.Darth Vader is a very cool villain as well.The film is basically about a farmer named Luke Skywalker who with the help of a princess named Princess Leia,Han Solo a pilot,Obi-Wan an old Jedi-knight,two robots named C3P0 and R2D2(who are in all six Star Wars films) and Chewbacca, Han Solo's wookie friend, they must destroy Darth Vader's death star.Star Wars is a very entertaining sci-fi film and if you haven't seen it(you're in the minority) you must!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Star Wars" was the first movie I ever sat down and watched (I believe I was two at the time). Over time, of course, the initial "Oh wow!" factor wears off and it becomes just another sci-fi movie. But it really shouldn't-- this is *the* sci-fi movie. That is not to say it is the best of the entire genre-- I really don't think it is, but this was where everything changed for the last time (other major genre changes occurred in 1968's "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Planet of the Apes"). The photography and editing combine very well, making it flow better than almost any film the '70s ever produced. Harrison Ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) have a great, well-realized, almost love/hate relationship. But the real star of the movie is Darth Vader-- that gigantic black-suited, raspy, evil mastermind who brings new meaning to the word "power". This is not only because of James Earl Jones' fantastic voice-over, but also because of David Prowse's physical presence on the celluloid. The movie's vulnerable point comes in the sweeping, epic style, which very nearly overdoes itself on numerous occasions. However, "Star Wars" is a classic, even though it cannot really be considered the best of anything. And a word to the wise-- watch the 1977 original. Those special effects shattered doors and set new standards, while the 1997 re-release's cheap digital work only serves to make a good movie look fake and inconsistent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original star wars has still got to be the best sci-fi's ever made, now 30 years old. George Lucas was on to a winner with star wars and these first 3 star wars are him at his best.The story is about Luke Skywalker (mark hamill) who buys two droids - c3-po and r2-d2 from the sand people, who unknown to Luke have just came from an imperial starship, Darth Vader is looking for these droids. (Anyway to keep the story as brief as i can.) Darth vader comes looking for the droids, kills lukes foster parents, Luke finds obi-wan kenobi (alex guinness) and old jedi. Obi-Wan takes Luke under his wing as he tells Luke that Darth Vader killed his true father (in a way). Luke is determined to train as a jedi so he can kill darth vader and avenge his fathers killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love these movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one especially. It all started right here, and despite the cheesy lines and some of the bad effects (even though most of them are pretty incredible, especially for that time), I can't help but love it.Maybe it's the actors. Because let's face it, these actors were born to play these parts. Mark Hamill never really had another hit, and really, honestly, he's not a very good actor. But he was perfect for this role- some may say he's too whiny, but isn't that really what Luke was at the beginning? The same goes for Carrie Fisher- she never had another big, important movie like these, but I can't imagine the movie without her. Maybe other people can, and that's okay for them, but for me, I can't see anyone else as Leia.And what would this movie be without Harrison Ford? I have a theory that the reason the newest three Star Wars don't match up at all to the old ones is because the characters aren't interesting at all. Anakin is vaguely interesting, but we already know his story and Hayden Christensen doesn't do anything with the part to keep us intrigued. Amidala is boring, and while I think Ewan McGregor is a great actor, there was nothing he could do to instill anything worth watching into the character they wrote for Obi-Wan.And that's why these movies need Harrison Ford. Han Solo is without a doubt the most interesting character. In the new ones, there's no one with snappy retorts and sharp comments to keep the pace of the movie up. In the new ones, there's no one to give us the surprise ending we knew was coming but we didn't know how they were going to pull it off. I don't know about anyone else, but when I first saw this, I thought Han had actually left for good. It didn't even occur to me that he would come back to save the day in the end. And I'm not stupid. At least that's what they tell me. And without Harrison Ford, Han Solo would not be near as interesting as he is.Alec Guinness deserves plenty of credit too. His part is without a doubt the most boring in the movie, yet he makes it worth watching. His lines are usually descriptions, clichés, or they provide backstory. The actors in CSI will tell you that lines like that are hard to make entertaining. Yet Guinness is able to do so with years of training. It's no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar for it.Oh, and there's the awesome action sequences with the light saber duels that, even though they tend to repeat themselves over and over, are incredibly dazzling. There's the epic feel and the neverending story of it all. There's the beautiful scenery and realistic set pieces. There's James Earl Jones's and Anthony Daniels's respectively foreboding and entertaining voiceovers, with Vader's wonderfully addicting breathing. There's the sweeping cinematography and that even makes the intimate scenes seem big while still retaining the urgency and the, well, intimacy of it all.It's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic sci-fi film that started it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars, now known as Star Wars Episode IV, is a great classic. It's still amazing how it's held up after all these years. It tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a poor farm boy who, after meeting old Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins the greatest journey of his life. He goes up against the evil empire and Darth Vader, who has a past with Obi Wan. Not a whole lot happens in this original Star Wars, but it revolutionized sci-fi films as we know them, with battling space ships, laser guns, and hologram communication. The acting and the writing isn't the greatest there's ever been, but it doesn't stop the movie from being completely enjoyable. Star Wars totally deserves the attention it gets and the money it makes from books, video games, TV shows, toys, and it's following sequels.Star Wars will forever remain a classic, even if critics continue to ignore George Lucas's creativity.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In simplest forms, Star Wars, like many other space operas, is basically cowboys in space. With also a touch of medievalist within it and with a simple distinction between good and evil, making it fun for people for all ages.This movie also succeeds in true escapism, with no references to Earth, with a culture unknown to us, truly taking us to a galaxy far, far away. And that concept may also have been played as to the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.The comedy duo between C-3P0 and R2-D2 will always be memorable. Though we can't understand what R2-D2 is saying, it's the reactions of C-3P0 that brings it to life.Though still 3 years away from reaching Star Trek's racial and sexual equality, the damsel in distress concept is not as painfully stereotypical as in others with that concept. Even breaking the stereotyping.This movie is inspirational in terms of visual effects and sci-fi art. Bringing forth creativity. And it was great idea to use dog fight footage from the 2 world wars as references for the incredible star fighter scenes.Though many of the plots for Star Wars comes from other stories and movies, they are seamlessly integrated into this movie.And if Star Wars could have maintained this level of quality all throughout the franchise, it would have been in an extremely close second to Star Trek as best sci-fi genre of all time, and ranking the movie 9.5 out of 10.Unfortunately with the disappointing prequels, the not-quite-up-to-snuff "Return of the Jedi", and the special editions that in many ways hurts the original trilogy rather than helping it, the Star Wars franchise is now struggling to maintain second place for best sci-fi genre and reduce the original Star Wars to 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, an evil Empire has constructed a massive battle station called the Death Star, which can destroy an entire planet. Rebel forces, led by Princess Leia, have captured the Death Star's plans, but are being pursued by the sinister Darth Vader. Leia hides the plans inside a robot, R2-D2, who falls into the hands of Luke Skywalker, a restless farmboy stuck on a remote desert planet. Luke learns of the important plans and teams up with Obi-Wan Kenobi, an old Jedi Knight, and Han Solo, a smuggler and mercenary, to rescue the Princess and get the plans to the Rebels.It's difficult to review Star Wars objectively, for two reasons; firstly, it is undoubtedly the most successful and influential movie-making phenomenon of all time, and secondly, I was an impressionable young boy when I first saw it and instantly fell in love with it. Its genius is of course the great genius of thirty-two-year-old Lucas, who wanted to update the hair-raising science-fiction serials of the thirties he'd seen on TV with modern film techniques, and to enhance them with a profound sense of alien culture and classical mythology (he cites Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress as a key influence). The movie, despite being a very arduous and risky production, is an absolute triumph on every level, and redefined how populist movies should be made, both technically and artistically. The story seems both new and old, the characters are unique yet archetypal, the settings are wonderfully bizarre and the performances are terrific (Ford in particular). The technical realisation of the alien words is stunning, especially in the use of art-direction, unforgettable sound-effects (by Ben Burtt) and amazingly innovative use of mattes and model-shots - the movie pioneered the use of computerised motion-control for optical compositing. The credits list is a who's-who of brilliant visual effects men; John Dykstra, John Stears, Rick Baker, Doug Beswick, Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren, Ken Ralston, Bruce Logan, Bruce Nicholson, Joe Johnston, Peter Kuran, Phil Tippett, Dan O'Bannon and John Wash, to name a few. Finally, the incredibly powerful orchestral score by John Williams adds tremendous panache to the picture, sweeping along the emotions and the actions with deliriously dramatic music. That this film is a pop culture icon is undoubted - what makes it truly astonishing however is that Lucas made it on his own terms, without compromise, when everyone was advising him otherwise. The work of a true artist should always be measured in these terms. Okay, it's just a movie - but what an exceptional, original, exciting, dramatic, eye-popping, dazzling, brilliantly-made and unforgettable movie. This review is of the 1997 re-release, which features many new effects shots (mostly in the Mos Eisley sequence), a new scene with Han Solo and Jabba and a few other shots not in the original film.</fullReview>

I don't hate science fiction and futuristic films (because that's why he's known), it's just that those are not my types of movies. Anyway, I know some people that say he's great. He made "Star Wars" thinking he would make a trilogy, this was number 4, then he did 5 and 6; he probably thought it was over, but some years later he showed us the beginning of something we had already known the ending with "Episode I" and "Episode II". What happens before this film, departures from a movie that has not been released yet: that's "Episode III".There's a time (now) where the special effects are "show ups". I like to think there was a time when they were used to serve the story; for sake of entertainment. Now, plots are merely complex, but effects are totally outstanding. "Hero" was lauded by critics, but it was just the visuals for me; beautiful visuals, of course. Then the plot?That's why I'm thinking of passing by "House of Flying Daggers": same actors, same director?No, thanks.Well, special effects weren't remarkable in "Star Wars", but they were definitely the best they had at that time. I didn't care about them, anyway, because Lucas has fun creating his own world of adventure, fantasy and whatever you want so say; but it was fun! What can you expect of some big letters flying in space that say: "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"? The thing is Lucas' whole team worked their asses to develop this fantasy full of pleasure, and gave us the costumes, the sceneries, the characters?Unique stuff!I wasn't alive at the time the movie was the phenomenon it was, and still is; but it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride that everyone should take the chance to experience. Getting out of TV, and very young, Mark Hamill looks natural as Luke. He seems very promising in his role; the role that assured his career's "take-off". Alec Guiness passed away some years ago, with the Oscar in his merits, and the recognition for his performances; including his classy and for always remembered Obi-Wan Kenobi. In this film specifically, Carrie Fisher wasn't much used and not as pretty as her character should be. However, intelligent enough to provide the qualities that launch a career. One paragraph should be dedicated to Mr. Harrison Ford. I heard he wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for George Lucas. The whole story I won't say, but I'm glad Lucas discovered some of the genius in Ford. Lucas gave Ford the character of Han Solo that would bring Indiana Jones after the trilogy. After Indiana Jones, Ford's career would be irregular, with some little peaks. But here, here?Ford is magical. Incredibly natural and very good?"Star Wars" is one of those movies that make you be supportive with the characters. We want their good, we want to join them in their journey and watch them survive; even when we already know what's going to happen. Excellent performances by Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and Kenny Baker as R2-D2: considering they hadn't got much to do but they were important? They were funny and an excellently teamed up for their roles?The ending announces a sequel; filled up with happy images, simple shots and that wonderful music by the amazing John Williams; who hasn't been more than five years without being nominated for the Academy Awards (he won it for this one). All of this, of course, all of this wouldn't exist without George Lucas' mind (he'll be remembered for this!). How he did it is a long story hidden behind one of the most fascinating cinematographic experiences of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars was considered a breakthrough in movie making and visual effects together and I agree. George Lucas has made what is considered the coolest and greatest universe ever. Having been denied from almost every major motion picture company he was able to get it released from 20th Century Fox.The story is simple yet extraordinary. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a young moisture farmer on the desert planet Tatooine and lives with his aunt and uncle. After buying two droids (robots) Skywalker hears a story and wants to help the beautiful Princess Leia being held by the evil empire. Skywalker ends up befriending a few unlikely characters: Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as a pilot, his sidekick and co-pilot Chewbacca the Wookie (Peter Mayhew), and Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and head for a large battle station to rescue her.But standing in their way is the evil empire, the robotic man Darth Vader, and his battle -station the Death Star which is able to destroy entire planets. The story, though pretty much a rescue story, is catchy and exciting filled with loads of action and encounters with hundreds of bizarre aliens. Star Wars is one of the best films I have ever seen and gave birth to the Sci-Fi industry in Hollywood. The characters are entertaining and slick. The action is faced paced and visually stunning. Star Wars: A New Hope. Starring: Mark Hamill, Alec Guiness, Harrison Ford, Peter Cushing, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, and Carrie Fisher.5 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beware there is a possibility of Spoilers that follow! None better, although many have tried. It didn't win the Academy Award for Best Picture. So what, half the time the best film of each year doesn't even get recognized by the Academy. The other half, they're just playing off of trends. A New Hope is the rarest of films, one that stands the test of time, and one that no one could have predicted the success for. It spawned the greatest movie trilogy of all-time, yes, of all-time! It raised the bar on how films were made, packaged, and promoted. Very few times in history, does one film change the entire industry. The characters are easily relatable to yourself, and the themes that George Lucas deals with are deep and more in depth than they first appear. Take two hours and watch what a truly great film looks like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic when it first came out and now, still a 'classic' almost 30 years later on DVD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My five children were all under the age of 10 when Star Wars came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, 'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.The Star Wars movies also were responsible for jump-starting the career of Harrison Ford, and today he is probably better known for his next trilogy, as Indiana Jones. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars was great, A New Hope is total crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got the box set of the first 3 Star Wars movies, only to discover that it contains A New Hope, not Star Wars...for those who don't understand the distinction, Star Wars is the film that was released in 1977, capturing the hearts, minds, and dollars of movie-goers everywhere. A New Hope if the crap that Lucasfilm released in the late 90s that includes really poorly done CGI and new scenes, many of which contradict things that we've previously seen in the film (just why was that bounty hunter looking for Han Solo? for Jabba? Jabba finds Han in the very next scene... dumb dumb dumb).Star Wars was great, and if i could buy that I would watch it a thousand times. As it is, Lucasfilm ripped me off for another $43. I'd donate it to some orphanage or something, only i prefer to just throw trash away. Congratulations, Lucasfilm, on tricking me out of my money. It's the last you'll ever get. From here on out, I'm done with yer products, even the non-Star Wars ones. This paying customer says "c ya".BoOh, btw... The Phantom Edit is what Phantom Menace could have been, and even it can't overcome the bad story, bad cinematography, and atrocious acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Lucas has vandalized a classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember fondly the original Star Wars movies in the theatre when I was a child. They were an excellent combination of special effects and plot development which made them the great classics that they are.Then the prequel trilogy came out...The prequel movies abandoned plot cohesiveness in favor of creating more opportunities to showcase the computer generated effects which are produced by Lucas' firm, Industrial Light and Magic. Foolish plot holes were created and the overall tempo of the movies was compromised to achieve the goal of more and more special effects scenes. Most people have been able to simply offer a dismissive sigh, accepting that George Lucas really isn't a very talented screenwriter, and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a script when it's being written. At least we still had the original trilogy, which rests in our memories as great cinema.That all changed with the release of the new DVD version of the original trilogy. Lucas jumped in with his clumsy editing and rewrote whole sections of these movies so that they could be more like the prequel trilogy. "Modern" CGI effects were inserted into the classic movies in a seemingly random manner, breaking the continuity of the originals into a sick parody of the memories that we all have of these classics.One of the sadder botched edits done to the first Star Wars movie (now called Star Wars IV: A New Hope) appears to have been done out of political correctness. I guess Lucas now believes that a good guy would never shoot first in a gunfight, so in the bar scene where Greedo confronts Han Solo it appears that Lucas had to make some changes. I remember as a kid watching the original movie at the theater in 1977, and cheered as Han Solo covertly drew his gun under the table and shot Greedo without warning. I was surprised to see this scene edited for the DVD release to show Greedo actually firing first, missing badly from about five feet away before being shot by Han Solo.Special effects added throughout the movie seemed to do little more than break the flow of the movie in the same manner in which they cripple the prequel trilogy. The worst examples of these edits actually occurred in the final movie, Return of the Jedi, so I won't comment about that here.I wonder whether this isn't some marketing game, where Lucas expects to make a bundle of money off the badly edited DVD, and then in about 3 years will repackage the whole thing again without the modifications to release a version of the first trilogy that we would all run out and buy. However, much like the whole "New Coke" conspiracy theory, I really don't believe that there is any plan involved in this badly edited product. This is just the final product of the inflated ego of George Lucas, a man who believes that his special effects can make anything better.If that is the case, then he is badly mistaken. His additional special effects have vandalized a cinema classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> This is without a doubt, the best of the Star Wars Saga. It has endless action, good characters and screen play, special effects and music. It would have really been something if this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1977 but Sci-Fi movies aren't likley to do so. I would have given Harrison Ford an Oscar nomination because he has the best character which practically made the first three great. Alec Guiness is great as Obi Wan Kanobi and receiving a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Peter Cushing in his best role and taking a break from the Hammer horror movies. This is a movie loved by many and is a classic from beginning to end.</fullReview>

Star Wars is what most people first think of when they think of "science fiction." Why? It's because this film is wonderful and groundbreaking in that it is really the first modern sci-fi film. The story is what really makes this movie...it is very well planned out, and grabs the viewer, making them want to keep watching all the episodes. This applies to all the Star Wars movies (Ep. I-VI, III to come soon). The now universally recognized soundtrack by John Williams adds immeasurably to the movie as well.</fullReview>

I was surprised by the great quality, story etc. The special effects rule (most are actually stop-motion done with a gigantic number of frames, but if you watch closely on Hoth in V you can see an AT-AT missing some frames) and the music by the legend John Williams is beyond anything.

With those words and John Williams's absoutely unforgetable score, George Lucas welcomes us into the Star Wars universe. I love this film and the sequels and prequels, but the first is still the best.The casting is brilliant, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher do a wonderful job and Luke and Leia, Harrison Ford (who was a little known actor at the time) plays Han Solo perfectly, Alec Guiness plays Obi-Wan brilliantly.But the one role that will stand out is James Earl Jones's Darth Vader, for me, he is one of the greatest villians of screen history.This is a great film, 10/10!</fullReview>

Not only did it awe us with eye candy, they created an incredible story.Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, Harrison Ford, Sir Alec Guinness, and James Earl Jones make up the principal cast of this movie. This movie immortalized these people. They played the parts very well.The music... John Williams is the god of modern composers! This music is so gripping and powerful! Williams rules!The story... words cannot express how incredible it was.If you have not seen this movie, you are possible only one year old, or you've been living under a rock for 30 years.

SW is also very special because its sequels are even better. The prequels aren't as good, but they're awesome too. SW is definitely my favorite movie. I think almost everything is perfect.

		<fullReview>Star Wars without question is one of my favorite film series. This particular episode of the saga is not what I would call the best of the entire series but it is definitley a timeless classic. I first saw Star Wars when I was 6 years old which was in 1993 and I was blown away by this film and I still am to the day. I remember my father saying that he had gone to the movies to see Star Wars when it was first released in 1977 and he mentioned that he had fell asleep during the movie, then I thought how could you fall asleep on a movie like this ? Not many people in my family cared much for Star Wars, but I have to say that it is one of the greatest film series ever made. A New Hope is probaly my third favorite in the series, in which case The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite and Attack Of The Clones is my second and right after that comes A New Hope. There isn't much to say about Star Wars except for that is a phenomenon and a timeless classic space opera which will be seen by people of all ages in generations to come. I think that George Lucas is only making the series better by adding the three prequels to the original trilogy. A New Hope is a classic movie and is a movie I must have seen about 30 times. Four Stars. I reccomend this movie to anyone of any age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those poor stormtroopers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is one of those films, I fear, which, while undoubtedly good, has been idolized to a ridiculous degree: to such an extent, in fact, that I believe there are actually sad losers out there who have turned Star Wars into some sort of religion or way-of-life (a bit like the Trekkies with Star Trek). While I must admit that I enjoy the film and its sequels myself, they're not THAT good, and some of their scenes and special effects (especially in the first) are looking embarrassingly dated by now eg the computers in the Death Star, and virtually everything in the climactic final scenes over that feared Imperial construction.Anyway! As the above summary may suggest, these are not my main beefs with Star Wars. My main gripe with the Star Wars films (especially the first), and something that I feel does not get enough of a mention, is the appalling treatment meted out to the stormtroopers in them. I must admit, I have something of a stormtrooper fixation. Their uniforms are very cute (and what I wouldn't do to be able to slip into one myself), and I was actually led to believe that they were halfway decent at their jobs (they are, after all, in the frontline when it comes to enforcing the Empire's feared and evil rule). So why, then, are their lives so cheap in Star Wars, and why do so many die such humiliating deaths eg falling off ledges or into pits, or being shot almost as an afterthought by show-offy arseholes like Han Solo. It's a disgrace! Those guys deserved a lot better.</fullReview>

The Special Edition is also proof of its still popularity, proving it is still popular today.

		<shortDescription>Defining Moment Of The 20th Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Star Wars" is perhaps the most successful movie franchise of the 20th century. From movie ticket sales alone, it has made George Lucas a very wealthy man. Add the toys, games, t-shirts and other merchandise and it should establish Lucas as part of history. A person has just got to start wondering how this movie ever become so incredibly profitable. Although this movie is watchable and even innovative, I really cannot put "Star Wars" in the same categories as impressionable films like "Sunset Boulevard", "Stagecoach", "Casablanca", "The Bridge On The River Kwai" and even "Pulp Fiction".My reason for saying that pertains to one factor, director George Lucas. Although many would argue, I think that Lucas is not a good director. He always seems to be lacking focus with Star Wars' story, in which was almost the case with "American Graffiti" (Thankfully, he didn't). I'm very impressed with the innovative visual effects of "Star Wars" as I am with any film afterwards that ever utilized it justifiably in connection with the certain film's story (it's sequel, "The Empire Strikes Back" is much better in many aspects). Unfortunately, outside of it's visual delights, it just doesn't have anything that other films hadn't already shown (even if this was made for children). From the whole "boy leaves home" beginning (Mickey Rooney has done it before with more feeling) to it's much appreciated "bar room scene" (straight out of many westerns and even some war themed films), there isn't anything we haven't seen before. Although the whole galactic twist on which the movie is based is totally original, majority of the ideas are still pretty much re-hashed from greater films (Kurosawa's "Hidden Fortress", Errol Flynn/Michael Curtiz movies, etc.). To re-evaluate, the bad parts consists of lack of originality. The idea's, topic's and situations' originality in which a film's greatness lies are sadly missing. The good parts which are visual design in terms of special effects and costumes definitely proves it's place in being a great landmark picture. I just don't recognize it as the one of the greats. This reaction could be the result of years of watching movies again and again and unexpectedly realizing a certain film's depth and lasting capabilities. A good, not great movie full of innovation yet lacking any depth that is only realized when seen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is a triumph in filmmaking. It has a simple plot, good acting, and it is one of the most original and creative films I have ever seen. And all of those elements combined make for one of the best movies I have ever seen.Most of you who are reading this probably have seen the film, but for those of you who haven't, (See it now!) I won't give away the plot of the film, even though you might already know it. The film stars Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo, who is my favorite character), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Alec Guiness (Obi-Wan Kenobi), and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, who is one the most evil and menacing villians to ever grace the screen. The film co-stars Peter Cushing (Grand Moff Tarkin), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO). The relationship between R2-D2 and C-3PO adds some humor to the film, also.Like I said earlier, Star Wars has a simple plot, but it still has a good plot. That's one of the reasons why I like the movie so much. The movie does have some good performances, also. Harrison Ford brings sarcasm and wit to his character Han Solo. Alec Guiness does a great job and the wise, old Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. James Earl Jones does a very good job as the voice of the villain, Darth Vader. Mark Hamill does a pretty good job as Luke Skywalker, but he sometimes tends to get a little annoying. The film also has exellent visual effects for its time.This film is directed by George Lucas, who hasn't directed many other movies, but he is still a very good director and writer. He wrote all of the Star Wars films.Overall, I think that this is the best of the Star Wars movies, including Episode 1, which was a bit of a disappointment, but a good movie all the same. If you haven't seen this legendary film, don't waste your money to rent it, go out and by the whole trilogy. You won't regret it. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Star Wars is one of the most memorable motion pictures of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the critics who didn't like Star Wars, the primary reason was that Star Wars was a movie with great special effects with no substance. Star Wars is more than just the special effects. If this were so, this movie would fare a little better than Stanley Kubrick's "2001 A Space Odyssey" which appeared in 1969. "2001" had great special effects, an excellent musical score, but the movie had long periods of boredom with some exciting scenes thrown in.The reason for the popularity of Star Wars is a unique mixture of new special effects techniques, fantastic musical score (John Williams) and character interaction. The humor and sarcasm between Luke(Hammil), Leia (Fisher), Han (Ford), combined with the special effects make this one of the most memmorable motion pictures of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can be said about a film that has never released its grip on its audience, and that has become one of the most legendary films ever? Not much, but as a sci-fi fan, I have to voice my utter thankfulness that this film was realized. It has given millions of people two hours of the very best in space adventure drama. The classic theme of good versus evil in a wonderful movie filled with details and characters to set every sci-fi buff humming. It's magic. It's wondrous. And it's probably one of the most entertaining movies ever made, along with it's sequels. The "Star Wars" saga is really a genre of it's own, it's hard to imagine how to compare it to anything else - it stands out from all the rest in an impressive way - no one has ever tried to make anything like it, and if they would, they wouldn't succeed.The stuff that dreams are made of...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a pathetic film. for children unfortunately watched by adults who refuse to grow up. first off it starts with the viewer watching a battle in space. you start in the middle of a battle in which you dont know whats going on. you watch as two robots wonder around a gun fire and never get hit. the ship is being seized by an empire that is made up of the worst marksmen in history. this movie is just a revemped version of the old knight in shining armor going to rescue his damsel in distress. unfurnatly the only one in distress is the viewer. then you are introduced to a boy named luke who gets chased around a desert by guys wearing brown paper gowns called "sand people" who they them selves get chased off by an old man who make noises with his nostrils. he rescues luke and decides it is a great idea to go into space and take on the empire on their own.(he must have known how bad thier marksman skills were) they hire a smuggler and a walking carpet that never stops growling to take them into space. do i have to say more. this is an insult to my intelegence. i recommend watching a good sci-fi flick like Battlefield Earth,Dune or Waterworld</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are one of the few people on the planet that hasn't seen this one, don't bother if you are looking for a real Science Fiction movie. In 1977 when it was first released Star Wars was billed as a real science fiction movie that would top anything previously made. What we got was a fantasy void of any science that takes place in OUTER SPACE. People actually booed when Darth Vader appeared on the screen, not because he was the villain, but because of the realization that serious sci-fi was not going to happen here. I enjoyed the movie despite this but I'll never forget that sinking feeling in my gut when I realized here we go again another Walt Disney type movie complete with puppets and mystical heroes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just seen Episode 1, I watched Star Wars Episode IV again to see if I could get some sort of idea of how the story may join up in two episodes time. I couldn't really figure this out, as there are thousands of possibilities. But I must say that Star Wars is still as good today as it was 20 years ago. The special effects were still good, not as impressive as Episode 1 but for the time, they were excellent. What is weird is that in basic terms Star Wars is just a good vs evil story, but its the way its done with all the other elements interwoven that make it so good. The end battle scene is the best, and has been copied many times over in numerous inferior films. I cant really imagine what life would be like without Star wars, i grew up on it and it holds a special place in my memory. As soon as the now famous score by John Williams starts up you know you're in for something special. Why can't they make more films like this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STAR WARS--The Original American Film Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long, long time ago, I was never familiar with STAR WARS until this familiar sound of music played on the radio. Later, visions of action figures on TV commercials dominated my Saturday mornings. This sure was a completely giant success story that even I couldn't understand way back in my pre-school years, but it was just happening. It took years of waiting experience to get a new VCR, and I finally took advantage of the Force. If you were like me, your early childhood days have been rough because you never got to see the STAR WARS trilogy. Fascinated by flying spaceships, bold warriors, and especially C-3PO and R2-D2, the days were a joy to behold. George Lucas' sci-fi epic that includes this first original movie is a timeless treasure, thanks to his establishment of a fantasy adventure that goes galactic. He's not just an ordinary director, but a director of technology. The excitement of its epic combat battles are worth infinite viewings, and was destined to blow away the audience with a rapid-fire force of impact. And this revolutionary piece led to numerous imitators!You can very well remember how George Lucas and the whole ILM gang made this trilogy through its history of complications. The original STAR WARS was a terrible undertaking for Lucas because he wanted a movie that feels true to realistic. When JAWS was playing in 1975, it showed off some new special effects technology of a great white shark, and managed to achieve in editing. That hit film was released at a time when production values remained tight, which they were often called "B" movies. STAR WARS has been the same thing, and it wasn't exactly clear that high-quality visuals would ever be possible. It would take more than the entire National Football League to create a 70s masterpiece. Lucas tried, and won by displaying a thrilling speed of action with a lightning fast pace. One example is the brief "hyperwarp" scene, where one blink of an eye ruins your day. When you have an incredible view of the fireworks, there's always a big plot to make more excitement. Like the movies themselves, one good story leads to another.Without characters, there wouldn't be a movie at all. Make them appealing and then everyone can enjoy the fun. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) lives the adventure; Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is always the bold type; Chewbacca The Wookiee adds to the chemistry with his furry appearance; likeable droids C-3PO and R2-D2 are loved by the kids. But there's always the villain, Darth Vader whose familiarity would still be hated through fun, but always recognizable. This first installment actually serves as an introductory platform for the characters and their potential of things to come. We know them well, but this is only the beginning (in Episode four!). Keep in mind, though, that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has always been the central hero of the series. Pretty fascinating!Always take notice of the 1997 Special Edition. This is a mandatory must for STAR WARS newcomers who still haven't taken advantage of the Force in all these years. The myth is that there aren't a whole lot of changes. The truth is that they're saying quite a lot because the editing of these enhancements is phenomenal, and hasn't been done before. It's a remarkable achievement in modern film technology, and the scene with Jabba The Hut explains why. Remember that some of original pieces of footage remain the same with a certainty of noticeable glitches, which is still a minor offense. Add to this some incredible restoration and we still have a sci-fi gem that will stick around longer while the new trilogy slowly builds on. Think of this, you're watching an entirely new movie!I hope this original movie and the whole trilogy in itself doesn't fall victim to a terrible amount of backlash when EPISODE ONE arrives. That one will do excellent business based on our cravings for special effects; they actually sell the movies! Should it happen, this would be a fatal blow to preserving a quality image to American cinema, past or present. We must take for granted that movies are essential as entertainment, and how the many possibilities can be discovered. Judging a movie's popularity against the odds is only going to hurt it. It is currently being demonstrated with E.T. (1982) and TITANIC (1997), two highly acclaimed films that are receiving tons of negative criticism and scrutiny from the public. They do this by pushing popularity off the wall. At least we know how to handle STAR WARS movies carefully, and while we enjoy science fiction as a make-believe cushion, it's important to know that it took a genius like George Lucas to create a universe where excitement exceeds the imaginable. Without him, the movie industry would be in deep space beyond the far reaches of our galaxy. The greatest movie ever made? Only on a cult level; it is the best one for the crowd, but consider this a fine American piece of movie art for all.The Force will be with us.....always.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably everyone has heard of the Star Wars movies. They stand out as pieces of mythology, classic film lore, and technical wizardry. Star Wars set the standard in Sci/Fi movies and special effects have been a huge part of movie making ever since. Simply put, Star Wars is a masterpiece, made with meticulous attention to detail by a reclusive but highly knowledgeable film maker known for experimenting. Star Wars speaks to the child in all of us, that naive spirit of adventure, of Good versus Evil, that pure idealism that surrounds us with feelings of awe and wonder. It's a great work of imagination, of tribute to the classics of the past, of legends, heroes, magic and wide open fantasy. George Lucas was right when he said that modern audiences longed for a mythology all their own, and he delivers with his epic story, aimed at kids of ages 8 to 80, with a grand sweep. I love these movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, I really cannot understand why everyone loves this movie so much. The story is corny and really not science fiction at all (it's fantasy--there IS a difference!), the acting is not very good (especially not Mark Hamill, the main character, who is just sort of bland-o), and though the special effects were groundbreaking in 1977, if the movie were released today they would only be so-so. I think the reason for the film's continued popularity is because at the time it was released, the enormous baby boom generation were all teens and twenty-somethings, the right age market for a movie of this type. Now they've all told their kids about how *great* it was, and now *they're* all flocking to see it, just like their parents did, based only on what they've heard. The forty- and fiftysomethings love it because it reminds them of when they were young too. It's nothing more than nostalgia and word of mouth. Why this movie instead of others that were released in the late '70's? Well, perhaps because it *is* the first movie released with the type of overblown special effects we've all gotten used to in "science fiction" movies. Hollywood just doesn't know what makes a good movie anymore. I suppose story, script and acting don't matter. Just lots of eye-candy. And this has always appealed to a young market. Like I said, if this same movie were released today for the first time, it would be quickly forgotten. I find it reprehensible that this type of comic-book action flick is now the definition of "science fiction." It's nothing more than fantasy; true science fiction makes you think. The best example of a *good* science fiction movie is still "2001: A Space Odyssey." A more recent example is the underrated "Contact." No, neither of these movies have laser-gun battles, cutesie-pie aliens, or dark space lords. But those are the creations of Hollywood and really have nothing to do with science. My point is not to ruin anyone's good time--it's a harmless movie and fine for kids to watch and for middle-agers with arrested development still living with their parents, but it should be pointed out that this overrated movie is mediocre Hollywood entertainment, *not* great movie-making. I rest my case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Force will be with you, always."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 1977, during a time when most motion pictures were all about being rough and gritty, Star Wars exploded onto the scene with its fresh take on classic adventurism and epic storytelling. The immense popularity that followed ensured that it beat the odds against a skeptical studio that never saw the viability of the franchise, and ensured its resounding success for decades. It has since become the progenitor of all modern blockbuster films.Whether you start the series here or with the modern prequel The Phantom Menace, you'll be immediately submerged into a unique and original universe. Great care and consideration is placed into every person, place, and thing in the series, with an exceptional level of background and detail. Entering the Star Wars universe is one of the deepest and most lively franchises, even to this day.The story kicks off right in the middle of a big space pursuit, and maintains steadily fast pacing throughout. The original special effects have always been impressive, with loads of quality models and matte paintings that still hold up. There are a number of added CGI scenes from the '97 update, which haven't aged that well. But what really matters is the spirit of the movie; whether lurking around the seedy underbelly of Mos Eisley, or storming the decks of the Death Star, the movie is loaded with action and comedy, and it takes itself seriously only when it has to. The resulting thrill ride is as lighthearted as it is exciting and memorable.Borrowing directly from Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, and with some influence by classic sci-fi serials like Buck Rogers, the story for this is not terribly original, but it is a solid and fresh take on the genre, with a cast of fine characters. The biggest and most original contribution is Luke Skywalker's journey from being a humble farm boy to being the hero of the Rebel Alliance (featuring themes that echo Lucas' previous film American Graffiti). The film's structuring allows for a steady introduction to all the characters and concepts, making it easily digestible and continuously iconic.The film is competently-made, with solid photography and editing. Special effects are groundbreaking for its time. At times, I feel that the imagery with the given camera angles, lighting effects, costume and set designs, are like an evolution of THX1138, lending the film a slick futuristic appeal. Acting tends to be a bit hammy in all the Star Wars films, but are probably at their best here; Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Sir Alec Guinness bring the characters to life in a vivid and memorable way. Writing can be quite nutty, but the dialogue is memorable. All of the film's sets, props, costumes, and special effects are swell, even if they do show their age a little. And the music is excellent; John Williams' original score matches the movie perfectly, and is exceptional.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With All Due Respect, This is Not a Great Movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The important points about this movie are very? The first of the ones around it; is that overwhelming success. It was incredible to see how the audience declared "war" over the entire hippie, realistic, experimental American cinema (whatever the name of the problem was) that prevailed since the end of the 1960s, celebrating a real glossy and entertaining another one. Apparently this movie returned the word commercial to movies, being Hollywood's perfect revenge out of the TV?previous expensive "not hit" movies?or the else illnesses, and the birth of the modern blockbuster as we know right now.Additionally, I think that (Star Wars) gave the movies very effective influence; which's pushing powerfully the teenagers as the cinematic heroes. Yes, Disney movies did it before, but on a short-range and not with a gigantic prosperity. So it paved the way to next hits with venturesome leads who range between 10 and 18 year old (recall E.T., The Goonies, Back to the Future), defining the ages of the moviegoers for years to come as well.Then, the important points "in" it. For one is the combination of the script. It's smart to gather factors of the western legacy, the old world's legends and the sci-fi space adventures. And it clicked. I loved the most that team of : strong mystic knight (Obi-Wan Kenobi), reckless bounty hunter (Han Solo), willful girl (Princess Leia), heroic immature boy (Luke Skywalker), English ? so devoted ? butler (C-3PO), and clever little robot (R2-D2); instead of the mythical animals of the ancient legends. And not to forget the magical evil man Darth Vader. That selecting of soul, mind, and heart vs. blackness, coldness, and inhumanity was damn creative despite how using them wasn't mostly as creative. And, these special effects. I believe that was a milestone at its time. The next stops will be (Terminator 2) and (The Matrix). Let alone that music score. (John Williams) is the one who can make the symphonies so marketable. What I love about such a man is his understanding when it comes to expressing many themes in high passionate way. And the way how he gave that plain tale a profound shadows and enthusiastic spirit. Without his music this movie could have lost good deal of its personality and prestige. Away from all of those points, the script wasn't that competent (something to be assured of with the next, not written by George Lucas, sequel. And to hold by your own hands with the next, wholly doomed, wholly written by Lucas, 3 prequels !). I don't remember a twist or surprise. The thrill wasn't that super. The characters were so comics; namely funny and naive. And I hated points like for instance how Chewbacca was so unnecessary, rather unused ! I watched it more than once, and I can't deny the feel of bore in some places. For one reason the dialog is so-deeply-insightful-it's-uninteresting, seeming so geeky and no entertaining. It's things to be written but not to be said (exactly as Carrie Fisher referred to Lucas once). And for another the direction was ordinary; many scenes were tepid and humdrum.The action sequences weren't the best. The long last one of exploding the death star was yes kind of new image but surely artificial, monotonous, and lacking any real suspense. Although the lightsabers idea was impressive but the swordplay wasn't. Generally the movie relayed more on the cool look more than the smart directing. Unlike many of the movie's attackers I didn't hate the acting. It was suitable and fresh. The thing is that script didn't endow these actors with many characteristics, or hard situations to watch and enjoy them deeply. Still Harrison Ford is the winner. Aside from his wit, the lovable cowboy was absent for years. And simply his character was the more human; the type that will be nonexistent in the prequels. The "New Hope" matter was a new carp! I don't know how Lucas did that in cold blood? But clearly he did it only for himself. Otherwise, it's a practical lesson in how to toy with an old movie to change and alter, how to irritate viewers by some useless CGI, and how to destroy the history (since it makes you totally out of the mood and distracted between the original 70s's quality and the 90s's one !).The sequel is way better. Mainly because Lucas was out of the writing and the directing. These previous defects I mentioned will be doubled in the next trilogy of prequels; where the script will go down, the action will be so missed, the direction will be downright tedious, the CGI will hugely and provocatively rule (as if it's the point), and the acting ? sorrowfully ? will hit the rock bottom also ! Nostalgia got a big hand in the top rank (Star War) achieved. No doubt, the viewers of the late 1970s were so thirsty for that substitute dazzlingly-made world, being extremely fed up of countless anti-heroes, needing desperately a portion of sheer noble adventures or good American values. Not the "Dirty" Harry, not the "British" James Bond. So they got all the reasons to adore this movie. It looked different and desired for them, unlike someone who watched it in 1998. Because deep down inside (Star Wars) is averagely entertaining time. And despite my admitting that it has great effects, it is not a great movie in my book.</fullReview>

It pays homage to the great adventure films of yesteryear, including "The Searchers." Hamill and Fisher failed to capitalize on the success of this series while Ford parlayed his role as the wise-cracking Han Solo into super-stardom. Despite his disdain for the film, Guinness is masterful as Obi-Wan. The majestic score by John Williams definitely adds to the excitement.

		<fullReview>Alright, judging from this vote I love this movie. This is definitely a film that raised the standard for movies when it came out. And in 1977, this was never done before. For 30 years ago, that was pretty exciting seeing all of those lightsabers coming out, the blasting ships, etc. Even though these things can be easily done now, 30 years ago this was tough. And just about everybody knows about this trilogy. Episodes IV-VI are probably the best known trilogy out of any trilogy ever made. I might be wrong, but I'm just guessing.The plot is awesome. Here goes: A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.... (That is a tagline, people!) there are these people in the Rebellion who are fighting against the Empire. We first meet C-3PO and R2-D2, two robots who are trying to escape the ship most of the people are in. We see a lady inserting some form of message into R2. Both of the robots escape in--you guessed it--an escape pod. The lady, who we now know as Princess Leia, is caught by the Clone Troopers. Enter Darth Vader, the coolest villain ever, who is somewhat the leader of the Empire (after the Emperor, but that's not the point). They take the Princess away to the Death Star, their space station. Oooo....Meanwhile, R2 and 3PO land on a planet called Tattoine, and get lost. They get captured by these Munchkin-like creatures with hooded cloaks. They get sold to these two guys named Owen Lars and Luke Skywalker. Luke lives with his uncle and aunt (Beru). Luke finds something in R2. He sees the Princess (although he doesn't realize it at first) saying, "Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope." He thinks that she may be talking about old Ben Kenobi, the hermit who lives as an outcast. He finds Obi-Wan, and takes him to his house. There, they see the whole message. Luke finds out about the Force, the lightsaber, the Jedi (if I were Luke, I'd be thinking "Cool....").To finish up this quicker, they meet Han Solo, they rescue the Princess, Obi-Wan dies, and Luke destroys the Death Star. Does that fulfill your need of figuring out how the movie goes? Anyway, watch this movie. It'll be worth your time (I think).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the first three movies evolve from their VHS-releases to their newest DVD-releases. Of the three movies of the "ancient era", this really sticks out as the best of them all.I was very young the first time I saw this, and it captured me with its fantastic creatures, the action, the whole universe was so convincing to me, and the characters were really good and left a good impression on me. Seeing it again more than 15 years later, still makes me feel like I did back then.This movie is obviously very influenced by 2001: A space odyssey, as seen in the interior design of the rebel space ship in the opening scene, and the docking scenes with the Death Star. Not that it's a bad thing, it is something I felt added a lot to this movie.Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi both fail to keep up with the goodness of this movie in terms of consistency and use of scenes. In particular, there is this new CG-enhanced music scene in Return of the jedi that is so embarrassing to watch it almost destroyed the movie, and the coming of the Ewoks just goes from bad to worse. Luckily, Star Wars does not have this sort of bumpy-ride feel to it, and one that had the most graceful evolution of the three movies with the new releases, except for the "Han shot first"-scene treatment.9/10</fullReview>

Star Wars is storytelling at it's greatest. Brilliant characters and amazing settings. Good versus evil, right versus wrong. For it's day, the special effects were unbelievably spectacular and totally groundbreaking. I could watch this film over and over again and never get bored and I do. This is a film that everyone should see at least once. Without the following 2 sequels and the 3 prequels that form the entire series, Star Wars can easily stand alone head and shoulders above any other film, ever made. Added to the other 5 episodes, a legendary tale is created. The one, the only Star Wars. A#1, cream of the crop, best of the best. **********/**********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent! The beginning of a dream...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I can say is that "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope" is the best, in my opinion, of all six "Star Wars" films.I've seen this movie in just about every viewing method possible (both versions), and no matter how I view it, this movie is always the same. Combining the retroness of the 1970s with that of the future, "Star Wars" is in a different breed of sci-fi entertainment - nothing cheesy like the old 1950s monster or space drive-in movies, and nothing too arty and ordinary like the space movies of recent fare. Lucas and his team have done an excellent job with "Star Wars." Oh sure, the recent movies may not be up to par like the original ones do, but still, this is a movie series that will forever be stuck in every human's life."Star Wars" is one movie that should never be missed. If you've never seen "Star Wars" in your life, then you need a reality check!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really impressed my the moment it began. I gasped as I saw how advanced the movie was since it was only made in the late 70s. To me, it's one of the best movies ever made. Despite the lack of technology, the movie still came along as one of the best masterpieces and I have to agree, it cannot be compared to the the new Star Wars movies which are totally horrifying.Basic Plot: It begins with the Empire trying to take the princess' ship so that they could know where the rebel area is when C-3PO and R2D2 go on to Tatooine and find look who goes on to save Leia, who is his sister and falls in love with her. Great watch! Watch it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello, I may seem like a star wars geek, but all i am here to say is that star wars episode 4 is probably the greatest film ever. And probably the start of the greatest trilogy ever, maybe next to the lord of the rings. Any way, this film has everything, amazing special effects for its day, probably the best plot ever in a film, great acting, and characters that will stay with us forever. Who can ever forget Darth Vader, C-3PO, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia. Nobody can, this is the greatest movie ever, definitely recommended- 10/10.Sincerely, the TTmaster2004</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How I love thee Star Wars, let me count thy ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reasons I love Star Wars, especially episode IV, are numerous. I love it because it opened space opera to the masses. I love it because of the humanity of the characters. I love it because of the relationships between the characters. I love it because it's fun, it just is, it's a fun movie. I don't see how people can dislike the actors, to me the acting is charming and enjoyable and even a form of escapism.I think the reason some don't like the film is because they do not appreciate it for what it is. Perhaps they prefer films that just provide entertainment in it's simplest form. In which case I would not say it is for you. The entertainment in this film comes in many layers.What this film is, is an escape to a galaxy far, far away, yet it feels so close to home. A nobody goes off and becomes somebody. Adventure is the order of the day. Knight rescues damsel from sinister fortress. The film is extremely fast paced and not in key with traditional sci-fi, that is why it is so accessible to so many.With the prequels I felt I just didn't care about the characters. In the original trilogy the characters are bonded to you by steel. The death of (so and so) is so powerful. When the old man with the white beard dies, you care. Gandalf? Who the hell is Gandalf?It doesn't have the darkness of the empire strikes back or the digital polish of the prequels, but it does make up for it with sheer good-natured, puppyish enthusiasm. It's my favourite in the series for all these reasons and more.Thrilling from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR WARS 1977 10/10 GEORGE LUCASI loved this Star Wars because it started the chain that is the biggest sci-fi film series in America. It has made millions in the box office and has made us fans of the brilliant Yoda, Chewbacca, Anakin, Luke, Padema, and more. I am not a Star Wars fan but I do enjoy the movies very much. They are a George Lucas masterpiece that will live in Hollywood for centuries and centuries. I gave it a 10/10 for the scifi stuff and all the cool effects in the movie itself. I give it two thumbs up. It also had an end but no beginning. It was a test to G.L. to see how much we all loved it. Which we did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was but 7 when i first saw these movies, and needed my dad's elbow to hide my face in at the scary parts. I didn't understand the main plot and ideas of the movie at the time but now, I am older and watching the movies again, i can watch the movies without my dad and I love them. I have even started reading the books. Take it from me, if you haven't seen these movies, you should. So whats the basic plot? Luke Skywalker, otherwise know as son of Anikan leaves his home to begin a journey as a Jedi knight. He receives his first training from Obi-wan Kenobi, or as Luke calls him, Ben. He encounters many dangers, and meets new friends along the way, such as Princess Leia, Han Solo and his Wookie, Chewbacca. R2D2, and See-Threepio. Well, I wont spoil things for you, so why don't you watch the movie for more details.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the 70's, what was a period of confusion, after a decade of war,turmoil, and strife, it is ironic that a film about a fictional Galactic Space War, would deliver such a cathartic emotional response !!!This is the legacy of Star Wars, George Lucas' little independent film, that almost no major studio wanted to do....A cast of characters so diverse, the abstraction is a classic !A young warrior wannabe Mark Hamill(Luke Skywalker), the rogue element, Harrison Ford(Hans Solo), a princess, Carrie Fisher(Leia Organa),a Wizard/Jedi Knight,Alec Guiness(Obi-Wan Kenobi),An Ultimate Evil Knight, Darth Vader and eventually the Emporer, and two little Droids,R2-D2, C3PO,comedy relief and the eyes and ears to help us view the movie !!!The Empire has taken over the galaxy, but a small force of rebels refuses to be dominated !!The blueprints for the Death Star, the Empires Super weapon about as big as a small moon, have been stolen by the Rebel Alliance, and are being tracked down by Darth Vader !!!Princess Leia hide the plans in R2D2, and launches them onto the planet Tatooine, hoping they find their way to Obi-Wan Kenobi, a former active Jedi Knight, who used to protect the Old Republic !!!Luke Skywalker,finds the Droids and the plans and attempts to locate Obi-Wan on the planet of Tatooine !!!The Imperial Storm Troopers are on the trail of the Droids, and eliminate all who have come in contact with them !! Lukes' relatives, have been killed by the Storm Troopers,relieving him to explore the cosmos, become a Jedi Knight, help the Rebel Alliance, and free the Galaxy !!!The special effects were so advanced, because it allowed freedom of movement, which was incredibly unique, way ahead of its time !!!Can Luke become a Jedi Knight, will the Empire triumph ?Who is Darth Vader ? Stay tuned thru 2 more sequels, the watch the 3 prequels, all of your questions will be answered!!! A Great Movie for its time, but somewhat dated by the evolution of the same technology that created this film!!! See how it all began, way back in 1977, the highest grossing film of that year !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Trilogy Ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course now it's not really a trilogy anymore is it? But the title refers to episodes 4-6. Now on to the review: Star Wars is hands down the best clash of good and evil any person can find in movies ever. For those who haven't seen it, and shame if you haven't, this one kicks off in the middle of a war in space between the Emperor and the Rebels. Luke lives on a desert planet and longs to join the rebellion, but can't because his Uncle Ben doesn't want him to. Shortly into the movie the family purchases some droids and Luke soon finds a message hidden in R2D2's data for an Obi Wan Kenobi. Things kick into gear once Luke follows the droid to Kenobi's house and thus begins the adventure. Obi Wan believes that Luke can turn out to be a Jedi just like his father was and takes him under his wing teaching him the way of the Force once they get off Tattooin. During the movie you'll run into the memorable characters like the evil Darth Vader, the cocky Han Solo, Chewy the Wookie, and Princess Leia. Hands down episodes 4-6 are the best trilogy ever created. See it now if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Sci-fi movie ever conceived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And the funny part of this is it is not a science fiction movie. Like Mark Hamill says it is a fantasy! I did not realize this for almost 20 years. The plot elements are all there for a fairy tale. A white knight, a princess, and an evil lord. When I saw this film for the first time I was eight years old. I saw it on laser disc and it blew my mind. I thought "This absolutely has to be the coolest movie ever made and that guy in the black costume is the most evil looking guy who ever lived." I believe Darth Vader was number three on the Best Villain List after The Devil and Adolf Hitler. Even now I still think so. I can't believe there is a single person on the face of the Earth who hasn't seen it and if there is I pity them more than I can say. I can't wait for the trilogy to come out on a deluxe edition DVD set. That's the one you're gonna want to own. May the Force be with us.</fullReview>

All other films will forever be forced to compare to it. Rightfully so.Imagine, a sci-fi film trumping all other films ever made. Quite a feat. Quite a feat it is.

		<shortDescription>The best film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977 the entertainment industry was not quite up to the 21st century standards. The special effects in Star wars are not fantastic but they would have been in their time. Still, Star Wars is the best film ever made, it was released in a time where people were using special effects for disaster movies and no one thought it would do that well but it took the UK and America by storm and it became he 4th most attended movie ever (but the 3 above it: Snow White, Sound of music and Gone with the wind have all been re-released so it's pretty unfair) and the 2nd highest ever grossing film (Behind Titanic which was released over 20 years later when ticket prices were over double the price). The nobodies who played the parts became huge actors of the time, Harrison Ford is hailed as the most successful actor of all time. The rest of the trilogy was also very good, Empire strikes back is also one of the best films ever (dunno what happened in the Phantom Menace though, whose idea was Jar Jar Binks?) All in all i think it's a pretty good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Sci fi adventure ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars was the film that changed cinema forever. It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.My favourite scenes include the opening sequence: the massive imperial Star Destroyer roaring over the screen attacking the fleeing rebel cruiser, that scene is mind-blowing on a cinema screen, i love the introduction of Darth Vader emerging from the smoke of the laser battle between the Stormtroopers and the Rebels, i also like the way Vader is established as an evil killer right away when he crushes the neck of some poor hapless rebel prisoner holding him up with one hand and throwing him to the side like a rag doll, this gives Vader's character a sense of malevolence from the kickoff.I also like the lightsaber duel between obi-wan and Vader on the Death Star more so for the verbal exchanges between the two Jedi 'When i was with you i was but the learner now i am the master.' Obi-wan:'Only a master of evil DARTH!!!' The duel is not as energetic as Luke and Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, but it is still a powerful and moving moment especially when Luke, Han and Leia make a dash for the falcon and Luke sees Obi-wan cornered by Vader. That scene is one of emotion that Lucas hits right on the head, Luke sees Obi-wan's plight, Obi-wan smiles at Vader, he raises his sabre and closes his eyes, Vader strikes as look screams 'NO!' and John Williams score swells with tragic loss as Luke blasts away at the Stormtroopers. Its the one scene that sticks in my mind about A New Hope, that isn't special effects or cgi.The final aerial assault between TIE fighters and X-wing fighters over the Death Star is perhaps the most exciting finale of any movie, the tunnel chase with Luke's X-wing and Vader's TIE fighter thrills ALL the time. Finally i have to say when i talk to people who have seen Star wars in any shape or form, rarely do they say they don't like the movies, but when i do meet someone that hates these classics they ALWAYS say the same thing: 'Im not really interested in films.' That says it all, does it not?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this was a pretty good movie with some pretty good effects (just make sure you don't overwatch it, or you'll get bored with it).The idea for Star Wars is pretty good. I loved the character of Darth Vader. I'm not saying I'm rooting for the bad guys, I'm saying that the idea of Vader is an interesting idea. I mean, think about it. The Jedi order is abolished, and the only one who is allowed to use the Force is the Sith (the dark side of the Force). My favorite characters are Han Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2. I like Luke too, but I don't think he became a real big big favorite until ROTJ. I also enjoyed Obi-Wan Kenobi. The effects are fantastic, especially for its time. The aliens are interesting, the bad guys are well-done (though how humans came to be the dominant species is a little surprising. Sorry, but compared to some of the other beings I saw in the Star Wars universe, it's a little surprising). I love the lightsabers and just about everything about this movie. The only problem I have is with the Force, as pretty much all Christians do. But we're able to draw enough Christian elements out of it to tolerate it.humor, action, and a lot of tension with Solo and Leia, very, very good. I don't know if it deserved the standing ovations it got in the theaters, but still great. A new hope indeed!</fullReview>

He was so cool as his character who was played by James Earl Jones. The special effects are kind of cheesey, but c'mon it was made in 1977. I mean give it a break.

		<fullReview>WARNING: Possible spoilersPersonally I can't stand this movie. Everything about it is an eye-sore , the acting, the special effects, everything. I've heard people criticize the Matrix because the thought it was implausible and that the acting was sub-par and yet most of the those same people say that Star Wars is one of the best films ever made. I can't understand this, I fail to see how the acting of Star Wars is so much better than that of the Matrix. Then there is the plausibility of the Star Wars plot-line, I find it very hard to believe that a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there happen to be humans that speak English and have psychic powers. One other thing that is a little less than believable it the concept of a "Light-saber", these crystal powered swords produce a laser beam blade that can cut through the toughest of materials, it isn't the damage that this Light-saber does that I find implausible is the fact that the blade of the Light-saber is a laser. Anybody that made it past 5th grade should know that laser light does not magically stop 3 ft above its point of origin (like in this film) and that it is not a solid force that ricochets off of other beams of light.In my opinion you would be better of with Star Trek which actually has some shred of theoretical possibility, because when I see a Sci-Fi that I really like it usually has one thing...SCIENCE! I'm not even going to honor the movie with a grade.very disappointing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars: A New Hope is a great film. It started the whole Star Wars universe (that is for all of us who aren't George Lucas) and gave us a look into a primitive futuristic past. I, being a die hard Star Wars fan, believe that anything that is remotely related to Star Wars deserves a good look over and this definitely beats a lot of other movies to the top. The only thing that I can fine wrong is the acting. Most of the actors have gone on and improved very much in their acting abilities like Harrison Ford. But in the beginning he was not very good in fact I would even call his acting stiff. But we should give him a break because, this was his second movie after "American Grafitti." The only thing that got on my nerves throughout the whole movie was how whiney Luke is. Lines like "Uncle Owen, Uncle Owen??" are screamed at a whiney high pitched voice.

		<shortDescription>A great movie - for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Star Wars" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. It's the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades, no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as it's not too memorable what they say and do, but what they look like, especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But it's just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film, I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. "Star Wars" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then, feel free to watch the old films like this one, but not too many. The very first Star Wars film here is not a great achievement in terms of story, only in terms of all visual and audible aspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant, but dated, and badly altered by Lucas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Long ago in a galaxy not so far away, former film student and up and coming director George Lucas wrote and directed a modest story about good and evil. Entitled "Star Wars" this film would become one of the most popular films of all time. Spawning two sequels, a selection of weak re-masterings and an often dire set of prequels, this film is the film that changed the way people looked at cinema.Raised by his aunt and uncle, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) dreams of the future. Accidentally discovering a message by a rebellion inside two droids, Luke sets off with his friend Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) to save the day and help defeat the Empire and the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones).From the offset, "Star Wars" gives indications of it's intentions. A freedom based rebellion fighting against an evil Empire, the film draws a very strong line between good and evil (a line which will eventually become blurred) and simultaneously provides us with the ultimate Science Fiction Epic.Over a quarter of a century old, this film and it's two sequels is perhaps one of the most famous and popular films of all time. Entertaining and addictive, it has some serious flaws, but we overlook them due to the feeling of child like joy that it gives us.Written and directed by creator George Lucas, this first film, second sequel "Return of the Jedi" and it's prequels, contains some of the worst lines you will ever encounter. As one star said to Lucas "you can write this sh*t George, but you sure can't say it".The problem with George Lucas is that "Star Wars" has always been his baby. As a result, Lucas often gives the impression that the only person to be allowed to change it should be him. Releasing remastered versions of his original trilogy, Lucas is constantly cutting and changing his original film to degrees that it is beginning to loose a lot of it's original glory.Released in the 1970s and early 80s, Lucas's original trilogy is a joy to watch because of what it is. At the time an original, well constructed film, by modern standards, the special effects are laughable. Aliens consisting of men in masks or rubber puppets, part of the beauty of the "Star Wars" trilogy was always it's out of date style. Unfortunately though, as the times have changed, George Lucas has released altered versions of the film with new, inappropriate, special effects and scenes which feel out of place. Lucas needs to realise that films are good because of what they are, they don't need to be constantly updated. Films like "Battleship Potempkin" from the 1920s were good because of their story and because of the meaning at the time. If someone was to release an edit of 'Potempkin' with colour added, a new soundtrack and brand new special effects during crucial scenes, the film would loose some of it's beauty. With "Star Wars" this is what Lucas has done. Adding random animals to scenes and reintroducing an edited scene starring future bad guy Jabba The Hutt, Lucas has corrupted the wonderful film he worked so hard to create.Everyone who has seen it, tends to love "Star Wars". Often winning polls to find the best ever films, this marvellous trilogy is a reminder to so many people of a childhood past. Sadly though, as the films get older, George Lucas refuses to let them date gracefully. Constantly rehashing and rewriting, Lucas is already responsible for an atrocious script, only to add to his crimes. The series were wonderful when they were first released, and Lucas should have kept this in mind and kept his hands off. A classic in it's own right, but it won't be if it's creator keeps on changing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best (if not THE best) scifi movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came along when science fiction was a stagnant genre, it redefined the way we look at movies. This was the first movie in the star wars saga (the others include, the empire strikes back, return of the jedi, the phantom menace, attack of the clones revenge of the sith) and one of the better ones of the series.Characters like Luke Skywalker, Ben Kenobi, Princess Leia, Han Solo and Darth Vader (arguably one of the best villains for a scifi movie) become instant classics.This movie had its great, classic moments and remains my favourite film. The action in this movie is great, even today and the special effects were very good for their time.Over the years Director George Lucas has made various alterations to the films which have upset many of the fans. I think that these alterations do not change what the film is about at its core, and does not change my mind that star wars (no matter what edition it is) is my favourite film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Star Wars dozens of times, I can look at it and say "yes, the acting isn't that great, the writing is poor" etc etc. But every single time Han Solo flies out of nowhere in the Millenium Falcon and saves the day at the end, yelling "Yahoo! your all clear kid!' I get goosebumps. I feel like I'm 7 years old all over again watching it in the theater with my older brother. I KNOW Han is gonna save the day, but every time I watch it I always wonder if Luke is gonna make it. Its truly a classic scene ranking with the best ever. Lucas does such a fine job with the DeathStar battle it still has me on the edge of my seat 27 years later. 10/ 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best. Movie. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever else George Lucas does in his career, and no matter how Episode III turns out, what no one can take away from him is that in Star Wars he created, IMHO, the greatest two hours of film in cinema history. And that's ignoring the fact that it's the first part in what is, again IMHO, the greatest movie trilogy of all time. There's probably nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't been said before, but who cares, I'll say it anyway. My thoughts on what makes this film so good are difficult to list in only a 1000 words, but here goes. It's the most exciting two hours of film you'll ever see, featuring beautiful princesses, scary baddies, likeable rogues, daring-do and success against impossible odds. It has a masterfully crafted script, one that any student of screenwriting or film history should study, utilising a template of Joseph Campbell's hero's journey theory and Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. It's the perfect standalone adventure film, with a classic good against evil battle, yet at the same time hints at the existence of a much grander story that lends it a feeling of incredible depth. It's a film which can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike, and shows that the best kids movies, the ones that really stand the test of time, are the ones that don't set out to be kids movies in the first place, but just to be really good movies that will appeal to kids. It has the greatest opening sequence in film history, featuring the best special effect of all time. It has John Williams fantastic score, featuring the best title theme ever. And of course it has Darth Vader, quite simply the best villain in movie history (I still remember absolutely cacking myself as a kid when he breaks that Rebel troopers neck!).I could go on, but there's really no point. It's been said before but I'll say it again, if you don't like Star Wars, do you really like movies at all? Yes, the dialogue is extremely ropey in places and some of the effects are starting to show their age, even allowing for the changes in the Special Edition. But like the ridiculous 70's hairdo's everyone sports and the fact that C-3P0 is so obviously gay, this just adds to the films charm. And so what if the fact that Star Wars still commands such affection is based on nostalgia? Even stripping all of that away it remains a tremendously exciting, brilliantly conceived film. The fact is that if I could only watch one more film in my life, then it would have to be Star Wars.(Note - while I'm rating the film as 10/10, I have to subtract one point from the Special Edition, just for the fact that Greedo shooting first really detracts from Han Solo's hero's journey, and Han as a character, not to mention looking stupid.)Rating - Original Edition - 10/10 Special Edition - 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings about the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doesn't it drive you crazy that George Lucas is only releasing the special editions of the original Star Wars movies? I've been looking forward to these DVDs since DVDs began, and boy, hasn't George Lucas made us wait? Star Wars used to be the greatest movie ever made. Not good enough for George. He had to fancy it up with computer generated bits and pieces that, like plastic surgery on a beautiful woman, only served to fake it up. It used to be chunky and real. You felt like you could reach out and touch the spaceships. Like you could really smell the Wookie. But now it's just another Lucasfilm cartoon. At best, a trailer for the current unholy trilogy. I want my Star Wars back. My old reliable beloved Star Wars. Where is it George? Why isn't it on DVD? I'm hardly alone in my feelings here. Star Wars has a massive fan base but how come it's been so roundly ignored? Surely everyone wants the original versions. At the very least, the option to watch the original versions on the special edition disks. That would be great. Maybe Lucas is going to make us pay for the special editions and then, in a few years time, release the originals and shake us down some more. He knows we'll pay, and money does appear to be the only thing he cares about. When George was young he was like Luke Skywalker, then for a while he was Obi Wan but now he's forever Jabba, vile gangster and ravager of fans. Thanks. I had to get that off my chest. Please everyone, let me know how you feel about this. Should I just chill out or should we organise a march on the Skywalker Ranch? FREE STAR WARS NOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one was the dawn of a new way to see movies. This movie created a heritage, and a cult movemement that will probably never end. "Star Wars" is by far the greatest cult movie ever, and it changed the way people make and see sci-fi today. Of course, this was a tightrope work, and it shows. The success wasn't insured, and George Lucas really risked it here, and one can tell by the quality of the overall movie that this one wasn't so financed as Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. But it remains an absolute classic, and the Special Edition in 1997 really souped it up, adding cool effects and new sequences, making the experience even better. This movie started a legacy, and even today, one the eve of seeing the new chapter, I know I can see it without getting tired. The force will always be with the people who see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most influential science-fiction movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next to "2001: A Space Odyssey" this is the most influential science-fiction movie of all time.Yet the movie is way more than just simple science-fiction. It's adventurous, epic, fantasy sparkling. The characters and settings are amazing and are truly something that should speak to your imagination. When you just think about it makes you realize how brilliant and ingenious the story and the movie actually is. Sure, it's obvious that George Lucas was obviously inspired by "The Lord of the Rings" and "Kakushi toride no san akunin" but Lucas knows to put in such great and original moments and characters that the movie still deserves much credit for its originality. Basically Lucas came up with an entire non-exciting universe complete with planets, races, technology and politics."Star Wars" is one of those rare movies in which everything works; The story, the characters, the pace, everything makes sense and work well together and are what make "Star Wars" a rare movie that in a way changed the way we look at movies.The movie is well casted. Casting Harrison Ford as Han Solo is probably the best choice of the entire movie. He's perfect as arrogant space pirate and extremely believable in his role. Casting old school actors Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing was also a great move. Alec Guiness is perfect as the old mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi and Peter Cushing is brilliant as Grand Moff Tarkin, next to the emperor the only person who dares to speak up to the biggest villain of the galaxy Darth Vader. In a way he is an even bigger bad guy than Vader in this movie. But still there is no denying that Darth Vader is really the ultimate bad guy. Never has there been a movie with a better bad guy. Vader's character introduction alone is what him a classic character already. And then there is his suit, it makes him mysterious and ultimately evil looking. How can there ever be a bigger bad guy than him?What make the movie work more than anything is the brilliant music by John Williams. He knows to come up with some amazing and some of the most recognizable theme's in movie history. His musical score is what makes most of the scene's work and is truly a tool that helps to tell the story. Like in all Star Wars music, his music is present throughout the entire movie, one of the reasons why Star Wars is also sometime's regarded as a space opera.The special effects are truly amazing, even these days. The final space battle with the death star is really one of the greatest special effects achievements and really edge of your seat stuff.The people that worked behind the camera are the one's who deserve the most credit for the cinematic classic that "Star Wars" has become. People that worked on the special effects like the ILM guys and persons such as John Dykstra, Dennis Muren, Joe Johnston and John Knoll, paint artist Ralph McQuarrie, production designer John Barry, make-up artist Rick Baker, composer John Williams and of course director and writer and person ultimately responsible for the huge success of it all; George Lucas.I seriously really could go on and on for ever about the brilliance of this movie but I'm afraid that I'll probably bore a lot of people with that. The brilliance of everything about this movie is simply something you've to experience for yourself and luckily a lot of people already have. "Star Wars" is really one of those you movies you simply have to see at least once in your life.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't see how any adult could sit through this mixed bag of Sesame looking,and Sesame named,characters. I took my kids to see this boring, boring, movie in it's debut. 10 min into the movie I realized, this movie is meant for the 10 to 15 year old mentality as are most of today's movies. Special explosive effects, stupid unpronounceable character names is the ticket for the Oscar, no need for a story. Although,this movie had a story that no kid or adult could understand . Then when you start remaking the movie dozens of times over like Jaws 15, Rocky 85, the Harry Potter series,and even the God Father 3 it destroys the original movie they start to look like all our cable re run movies. All those Star Wars chronicles are just a reminder of today's adolescent movie mentality. I fell asleep during the first movie and my kids 8 and 12 could not tell me what is was about. I tried again to watch it a few years later but couldn't make to the end it was like I was being put through a KGB torture interrogation. Sorry Star War fans but I'm on to TCM to watch an adult flick I'll leave the Stars War series to the kiddies and the Star Trek fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primitive-Looking By Now, But A 'Must" To Set Up The Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that's because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.The first hour of this film sets up the second hour plus the two sequels that followed in the 1980s, showing how the principal characters were united, who they are fighting against and what mystical powers they have at their disposal. Note: it was even interesting to watch this film decades later after the final installment, episode 3, was viewed. It made this first entry make a little more sense, knowing the complete story (who was related to whom, how some died, etc.). It was also a shock to go back and see the special-effects in here after viewing those final three films issued in recent years.I always got annoyed, to be honest, at two things in this initial Star Wars film I felt were overdone: the "Rambo" mentality in which hundreds of shots are fired at the good guys and never hit them and the constant arguing between Carrie Fisher ("Princess Leia") and Harrison Ford ("Han Solo"). By the third film, thankfully, that bickering stopped and everyone was "on the same page."Despite how old this film is, it's a "must" for this collection since it sets up so much of what is to follow. It's also kind of fun to look at this again and see how young everyone looks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there anything that hasn't been said about this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being born 19 years after this movie was released, I never got a chance to see it in theaters. I was even too young to see the re- releases in 1997. My father first exposed me to these movies when I was about 5 years old, when I couldn't quite grasp just how big these movies were and how much of an impact they had on American, and even world culture. Back in 1977, the world was hurting. It couldn't tell the difference between tyrants and leaders in politics, and villains and heroes both on and off the screen. Star Wars changed that. Whether you think it's overrated or the best movie ever, it would be foolish to say that this movie didn't change anything, be it Hollywood, our perception of leaders, or even our perception of ourselves. This movie, and it's subsequent saga, is, likely, the single most talked about movie in history. If you don't like it, you've at least seen it. If you haven't seen it, you've no doubt at least heard about it. That being said, that means that just about everything has been said about Star Wars. It's great, it's bad, it's overrated, the acting isn't exactly on point, the effects are breathtaking, it's corny, it's nerdy, it's geeky, it's a phenomenon, it's just plain good, everything has been mentioned. So why am I writing this review? Because that means I get to contribute to the story. The story of Star Wars goes far beyond its own universe. We are part of it. The fans, the haters, George Lucas, me, you reading this, now, we're all part of the story of Star Wars. This review may get lost among the thousands and thousands of others, but I still get to contribute to the preservation of this story. The more we talk about it, the longer it'll stay in memory, and the longer it'll exist. When the movies are finished, possibly forever, the story will still live on for future generations to enjoy. Now I get to be part of that story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Of The Original Trilogy, But Still Solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to come up with a franchise more iconic than "Star Wars." Its cultural impact and effect on filmmaking is legendary. The epic Saga of a galaxy far, far away is one that will continue to stand the test of time for generations to come. And all the imagination captured by these classic stories, all the hysteria it brought out among its fervent fanbase, all started with a movie that made it into fewer than 32 theaters on opening day. So, what do I have to say about the first film in one of my favorite cinematic franchises of all time. While "A New Hope" is a decent film on its own, and I'm beyond grateful that it became such a massive financial success, from a filmmaking standpoint, it's easily the worst of the original trilogy. Does that make it a bad movie? No. GOD no. That said, it is FAR from great and certainly one of the Saga's weakest installments.Easily the worst quality in the movie is that so many of the characters are tropes without any relatability or depth. This was a problem that would be fixed excellently in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi", but as far as "A New Hope" goes, the characters are REALLY weak. Luke Skywalker is a shockingly boring, bland protagonist whose only interesting trait seems to be his consistency in making mistake after mistake. Princess Leia represents the worst of male screenwriters not knowing how to write female characters. Her only personality trait seems to be that she's "badass." (But only when the plot needs her to be, otherwise she's a damsel in distress.) Obi Wan Kenobi is by far the worst of the bunch; as bland and uninteresting as mentor figures go, Kenobi consistently lies to and manipulates Luke's emotions in order to get him to join the Rebellion. By the time he has his final stand against Darth Vader, (A horrendously choreographed joke of a fight with zero emotional impact or investment and some of the worst dialogue of the entire saga including "Only a master of EVIL, Darth!") I see no reason why I should be rooting for this character to win, or even survive. The acting isn't much better. While Mark Hamill would prove to be quite good as Luke Skywalker in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi", he's simply wooden and uninspired in "A New Hope." Alec Guinness fares even worse with a performance is as phoned in and wooden as humanly possible. Don't take my word for it, Guinness has admitted in several interviews to phoning in his performance and finding the character of Obi Wan wholly uninteresting.Hands down though, the worst performance in the movie, if not the entire Saga, has to go to Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. Almost everything about her acting here is cringeworthy; from her "on again, off again" British accent to her constant changes in approach to the character (Sometimes she's serious, sometimes she's snarky, sometimes she's strong, sometimes she's vulnerable, e.t.c), Fisher is all over the place as Leia in the worst possible way.It may sound like I'm bashing "A New Hope", but I do really enjoy this film. Harrison Ford's performance as Han Solo is downright iconic, bringing unmatched charisma and passion to the notorious smuggler. His arc from self-centered scoundrel to selfless hero is done excellently, and I really did enjoy how much this character who constantly claimed to only have it in for himself was constantly risking his own skin to save Luke. Also, he gets arguably the best lines in the movie ("Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her!")All of the villains here are excellent. James Earl Jones as Darth Vader is obviously the highlight of the movie, carrying an aura of menace and fear that VERY few actors could replicate, but Peter Cushing is extremely underrated in his turn as Grand Moff Tarkin. Cushing's coldness, arrogance and subtle sadistic nature in his treatment of Leia help to make him a truly detestable and loathsome villain. While Vader is a villain you just outright love, Tarkin is a villain you love to hate, and the sliminess and cruelty Cushing brought to the role must have made it very hard for him to convince people he was a nice person after the film's release."A New Hope" is noteworthy for its strict following of Joseph's Campbell's "Hero's Journey" style of storytelling, and its a style the film does very well. While simple, Luke's coming of age story is nonetheless compelling and investing, and would usher in many, many films in a multitude of genre's that would follow such a template, albeit much better in many cases.The film's comedic moments are fantastic and just give the film a truly undeniable charm. Apart from Han Solo's hilarious wisecracks, the classic duo of the bumbling C-3P0 and the frustrated R2-D2 make for some truly laugh out loud moments and arguably the funniest scenes of the Saga ("I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you! I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault!")The effects present in A New Hope were outstanding for the time, and have aged beautifully. There's a real charm to the imagination and effort clearly put in the film, particularly with the aliens in the famous cantina scene. You only need to watch that one scene to realize how big and diverse the "Star Wars" universe can be."Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope" is a decent film with an amazing impact. Though not as well aged as its two sequels, and though it has its fair share of problems, it's still a classic movie with more charm than you wave a stick at.</fullReview>

Also there is no Earth in this film which makes it very different from cosmic and futuristic films. Also filled with space odyssey style spaceships and visuals. As well as an artificial planet, wow, awesome, awesome, awesome. But there are reasons I don't like this film. I will move on to those when I say my secret word.ANYMOO!!!I know people love this film so much for it's endless fun and originality. But I thought it wasn't intense enough for me and overused lightsabers and spaceship fights which I didn't enjoy so much. Ligtsaber duels to me weren't so amazing because they looked like lens flare versions of swords and spaceship fights were boring and not very tense. But I loved he opening scene with the lazer pistol fights and the all the events on the desert planet. The desert planet was my main focus in the film. It had creepy creative creatures. The little brown hoodie midgets were beautiful and cute. The sand people were life threatening and well designed. Finally we get to the cafeteria creatures which were of different shapes and colours and were beautiful.I rate this movie 3/5(Most movies made for mostly fun I rate 3/5) for great fun and beautiful visuals and costume design.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of Star Wars, I never think of the series as a collection of movies. Star Wars has always been in my life. To me, it is as if these things that happen in the films have actually happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...George Lucas changed history in 1977, when Star Wars was released. It's mind-blowing special effects and characters are so memorable. The film was inspired by westerns, Flash Gordon, World War II dogfights and samurai.The story is all about a young moisture farmer named Luke Skywalker, who lives on the desert planet of Tatooine. He has dreams of leaving the planet and joining the Rebel Alliance and becoming the ace pilot he knows he is. Then he can fight the evil Empire.His life changes when two droids are purchased for the farm by his Uncle Owen. These droids (C-3PO and R2-D2) carry a message from Leia Organa, the Princess of Alderaan. Princess Leia requests help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. After R2-D2 goes missing, Luke is attacked by some deadly desert savages named Tusken Raiders. But, he is saved by an old hermit named Ben Kenobi. Luke finds out that Ben is actually named Obi-Wan and that he is a legendary Jedi Knight, the keepers of peace before the the time of the Empire.Obi-Wan tells Luke that his father was a Jedi too. He gives Luke his father's lightsaber, the awesome sword-like weapon of the Jedi. He asks Luke if he wants to come with him to Alderaan to see what has happened to Princess Leia.Along the way to Alderaan, Luke and Obi-Wan meet Han Solo and Chewbacca, smugglers who own a starship, the Millennium Falcon.Of course, we also have Princess Leia who has been captured by the Empire and is being interrogated by Darth Vader, an evil dark Jedi, called a Sith Lord. He wants to know where she has hidden the secret plans for the Empire's secret weapon that can destroy planets, the Death Star.With Luke and the other heroes prevail?The soundtrack by John Williams is probably the best movie soundtrack ever made. Whilst Mark Hamil and Harrison Ford play the parts of Luke and Han really well, the standout performance is the late Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are used to using the concept of love as little more than a hyperbolic adjective. But a greater meaning is inferred when the hyperbolic love becomes a presupposition altogether. "I love sci-fi" can be a casual statement, but people that love Star Wars are more than just fans, they are a cohesion of people with a commonality. These groups are sometimes manifested as sub-culture. A sub-culture can cross ethnic and generational divides to the point that it's own identity politic transcends the individual differences. That is what is so socially attractive about it. If you don't believe me I encourage you to attend comic-con. In sub-culture, where fraternity itself supersedes all other classical forms of descriptive love, we must call it agape. More than just an adjective agape is itself a phenomena. The American philosopher Alan Soble goes so far as to explain agape as unique in that is it "rationally incomprehensible". So as it was in reformation Europe, the spirit of what compelled all high minded conversation, all intellectual strength outside of material need, was a shared excitement in cultural common. Technology, as it evades every aspect of our lives, is so pervasive that it actually forms a sort of macro-culture. We have a digital deity, devoted to incomprehensibly, with all the same rigor of religious disciple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope tells the story of a farm boy Luke Skywalker who upon his purchase of two droids R2-D2 and C3-P0, and running into the old and wise Obi-Wan Kenobi he is thrown into a world bigger then his own.A New Hope has great sense of pacing and having a flowing narrative build up to its conclusion almost flawlessly. The characters feel like real people with fleshed out motivations. The effects although aged today definably inspired what we have today in the art of cinema. The score just like all the other films in the saga is fantastic. But what this movies greatest feat is just how much it inspired a generation of cinema, as well as is outstanding impact on pop culture that keeps this film fresh.In spite of how much we can all appreciate this movies impact it is still far from a perfect movie. Most of the acting is hooky, and the effects are hard to by today. And although it has a good sense of pacing it still has many plot conveniences. The action is also pretty slow which prevents it from feeling like a real fight is going on. Even the dialogue is pretty hooky and hard to by. This is a problem because if characters are unable to talk like people do it makes it hard to relate to them and get invested in there conflicts.In conclusion I can appreciate its impact on culture, as well as love the movie. I personally consider myself to be a Star Wars fan. Keeping in mind that I feel on an objective level I consider this picture to be above average instead of great I'm giving this one a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is an absolutely timeless movie that when I view these days, immediately takes me back to my childhood.It's pointless to say that this movie is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time because all you have to do is watch it and really think about the fact that this was accomplished in 1977 and there's no words left to describe just how brilliant this movie (and its sequels) truly are.The story in this movie is unique, interesting and most importantly, fun, while both the visuals and sound effects are absolutely astonishing (for its time). The characters are lovable and you just can't help but root for Luke, Han Solo, Chewie, Leia and the rest of our rebel heroes while they try and save the galaxy. And what really can you say about Darth Vader... Is he the greatest on-screen villain of all time? While this is highly subjective, for me, yes, a thousand times yes and his menacing form is truly brought to life by the voice of James Earl Jones.If you've seen this film then you already know how amazing it is and if you haven't, stop wasting precious moments of your life which you could be spending watching Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time to get back to my Star Wars reviews! There might be a bit of a Star Wars bias in this review since I love this franchise. If you want to avoid that, click out. Anyways, this movie was a landmark when it first came out. It was one of the only sci-fi movies released that doesn't have an alien invasion as the focus. This movie is engagingly original and feels very inspired. It also feels very 80's but in a good way. The effects still hold up very well. Maybe that's because the effects keep being updated but my point still stands. The space scenes are still impressive and are still a lot of fun to watch. The lightsaber duels on the other hand, are pretty weak. Even one of the most intense scenes in the movie: the lightsaber duel between Obi Wan and Darth Vader, let's face it, is just two guys tapping lit-up swords. It's still an intense scene so it doesn't bother me that much but compared to the action scenes in the other Star Wars films, it's really underwhelming. Me and my brother used to joke about that. The story might be a bit cliché by today's standards as a classic underdog story but do I care? No because all the new ideas here are just so interesting and awesome! The characters in this movie are all iconic. Darth Vader was cool in this movie until the stupid prequels came out, but other than that, all the characters are awesome! You couldn't forget them if you tried! Overall, this movie is iconic and holds a very special place in my heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a joy to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is a glorious swashbuckling tale, filled with memorable (and now iconic) characters and told at a ripping pace.It's such a joy to watch.Even now, the special effects hold up remarkably well. The X Wing / Tie-Fighter battles in particular are marvellous. The light sabres are brilliant (although the sabre fights themselves seem a tad lacklustre now).But the best thing about Star Wars is the sheer love and care lavished on the fictional galaxy created for the film. It's a rich and varied place. The attention to detail is unequalled. There are weird and wonderful aliens at every turn. The cast is delightfully wide- ranging - Jedi, mercenaries, monsters, robots, soldiers and of course the star of the show, Darth Vader, all feature prominently. And the plot - simple enough (good guy versus bad guy), but fast- paced and varied. None of the scenes outstay their welcome, but make way for another equally as good.It's simply an expertly delivered ripping yarn</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, originally released as Star Wars, is a 1977 science fantasy film written and directed by George Lucas. Ground-breaking in its use of special effects, this, the first Star Wars movie, is among a handful of the most successful films of all time and is generally considered one of the most influential as well. The film was selected to be preserved by the Library of Congress as part of its National Film Registry. The film was selected in 1989, the program's first year in existence. The film is set about 19 years after the formation of the Galactic Empire; construction has finished on the Death Star, a weapon capable of destroying a planet. After Princess Leia Organa, a leader of the Rebel Alliance, receives the weapon's plans in the hope of finding a weakness, she is captured and taken to the Death Star. Meanwhile, a young farmer named Luke Skywalker meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has lived in seclusion for years on the desert planet of Tatooine. When Luke's home is burned and his aunt and uncle killed, Obi-Wan begins Luke's Jedi training as they?along with Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2?attempt to rescue the Princess from the Empire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one word to describe Star Wars is magical a flawless masterpiece. One reason why I don't give it a 10 is because it hasn't aged well even with George Lucas C.G.I it still hasn't aged well at all. It is still remembered as a classic but show to kids today they will most likely hate it. What makes Star Wars so special it's the story Luke is one of the last and only heroes I can get behind for me it's mostly the villain but you feel for Luke. Now am gonna say the acting isn't great Mark Hamill does have some laughable moments in the film but what would have made this film even better is if you saw it when it first came out I didn't but how mysterious and weird it was even for the time it came out in.The plot involves two droids who get lost from a ship which was invaded by the empire. They are carrying the plans to the death star which ends up being the whole plot of episode 6 so Luke finds the droids then finds some creepy old man named Obi Wan Kenobi who teaches him to use the force oh and they find Rick Deckard I mead Han Solo and they go places.Yeah the film is brilliant but like I said earlier this film isn't for everyone since it hasn't aged well but I would give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic start and an incredible sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The perfect follow up to Episode III. It manages to walk such a fine line between so many genres. At times it's an action film, other times a comedy, sometimes even tragedy, it is all of these things and it still manages to make every second of it engaging. It never feels over-stuffed, it never feels bogged down by delving into so many genres, it just 100% works. I can't think of many films that can do that off the top of my head. The score is fantastic, the characters are timeless, the film is quotable as hell, and it ties in perfectly with the previous films. This is truly one of the greatest achievements in cinematic history, and it hasn't aged one bit! The effects may not be as good as "Avatar", but it still manages to have genuine excitement and thrills. Anyone that says this has aged horribly (or even at all) is dead wrong. If you don't like this movie, then I don't like you, plain and simple. Absolutely incredible! May the Force be with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars is the Modern Day Blockbuster! An Awesome Tour-de-Force!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about this Sci-Fantasy film directed by George Lucas, that hasn't been said before? Everybody knows how magical, exciting, epic, and fun, this space adventure is. After all, it was directly influence by other older mythological stories like the Arthurian tales, classical Greco-Roman mythology, &amp; old Sci-fi film serials like the 1936's 'Flash Gordon'. The movie even got influence from historical events like the foundation of religion beliefs, American westerns, Samurai Culture, and even World War 2 and Vietnam. Plus, I think, everybody know that the film follow the hero journey path laid out by mythologist Joseph Campbell's book, 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces'. So, what are some things, you might not heard of? Well, here's one. Did you know that Lucas had originally wanted to remake the 1930's Flash Gordon movie serials, but the rights were snapped up, so he choose to make his original Sci-fantasy movie, instead. The original story of the film was way different than the film that came out with lizard people, helmetless villains and older main characters. One big different is how long, it was. It had to be split up. The discarded first half was later used as prequels, although some have disputed this claims, saying that Lucas never mapped out the story at the time. Regardless of that, the half of the story Lucas was left with, was still too long, so it was split and rewritten into three parts with 1980 'Episode V: Empire Strike Back' and 1983's 'Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'. The first of this trilogy would be the film that Lucas would make, originally called 'Star Wars', now retitled in 1981 as 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. Anyways, both versions of the script had a plot where a royal is trying to deliver a device, through a ship in a last ditch attempt to rescue a planet, from being destroy by an evil empire. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the generic plot is a bit secondary. It's really not anything new, when you think, about it. After all, films serials like 1939 'Buck Rogers', had stories like that, every week/weekend. It's not perfect at all. There is ton of plot-holes in the film that doesn't make sense, mostly with the Death Star to be note, here. However, I'll let those things go, because it's supposed to be, a fun-corny unrealistic fantasy movie even if the movie has contrived coincidence moments. Yet, I can't let the mediocre acting in this film go pass. I really didn't like the farm boy turn Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)'s whinny little voice. I really wanted him to shut up, most of the film. Also, it's bit weird, how Princess Leia's (Carrie Fischer) weird British accent, comes in and out. Despite, the limited acting chops of the two main leads, they got better as the film series went on and their characters were very memorable. In my opinion, the supporting cast was probably better than the main cast. Harrison Ford as the scoundrel smuggler, Han Solo was a lot of fun. Much of the great humor of the film, comes from him. Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi was amazing! I love how Shakespearean, he was. He made me, believe in the force. Last, but not least, Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin was brilliant. His enthralling voice &amp; his charming, yet evil manner was evil and menacing. The same goes with James Earl Jones voicing the character of Darth Vader. Still, I would love to see a version where 'Star Wars' try-out actors, Kurt Russell, Jodie Foster, Christopher Walken &amp; Toshiro Mifune played these characters. Anyways, most people remember this film for its visuals special effect and action. Those were amazing, even if a bit dated. Another noticeable thing about Star Wars is the soundtrack by composter John Williams. His thematically rich score would give a heart to the action and usher in a new era of romantic old-style music in films. Even the sound effects like Wilheim scream were top of the line. Another thing, worth noting is the exotic locations. All of them, work, even if the production for this film was troublesome, due to weather issues. Another great thing about this film is the well-paced editing. For the most part, the original 1977 version, had really no slow parts. Yet, the 1997's Special Edition kinda ruins that, by adding fake-looking pointless scenes like Luke talking to his crewmates before the battle or Jabba the Hutt visiting Han Solo. While, a lot of the Special Edition edits, do help the film, by retouching outdated visual effects; it also kinda hurts the film. A good example is the 'Han Solo shot first' scene, which kinda betrayal his pirate-like character! While, this might sound controversy, I think the Special Editions were indeed somewhat needed. Updating old source materials is nothing wrong, as long as you keep the original films out-there, as well. After all, the special editions kept 'Star Wars' fresh on everybody mind in the mid-1990s &amp; got me, into loving this film franchise. It's work for what it is; which is a Director Cut version. Some people might hate it; some people might love it. Nevertheless, it expose new audiences to the mythos of these films. Star Wars is one of those films that has become sewn into the very fabric of our popular culture. With the continued prominence of the Star Wars story through movie sequels, animated series, video games, and toys, I glad this movie went on, to great success in awards and money. The impact of the first film in the series was enormous - tremendous profits helped to generate funding for Lucas' state-of-the-art special effects factory known as Industrial Light and Magic, Lucas' sound company, THX &amp; Lucas' American film and television production company, Lucasfilm. Overall: It was indeed a cinematic masterpiece. Every major movie blockbuster released today, has George Lucas to thank for. So go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the tidal wave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I saw this in the theater on its first release in 1977, not long after we had finished grad school. We took with us a much older friend of ours (more than a generation older in fact) who wanted to see what all the fuss was about but she was a bit too shy to go by herself. It was all great fun but of course no one in the world could have predicted the entertainment phenomenon this franchise would become. In fact, Star Wars was just a one-and-done intention until its massive popularity fueled the making of TESB. (When the opening credits of the sequel rolled starting with "Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back", it was electrifying: everyone looked at each other saying 'What?? this is episode five? what are 1, 2, and 3?" and Lucas's grand plan was off and running. I'm not sure it would have happened though if the sequel hadn't been better than the original.)But back in 1977, we just enjoyed the straight-up simplicity and verve of the plot -- good versus evil, admittedly cardboard characters, dazzling space battles that were more fun than they had any right to be. In some sense it was fresh and dynamic, but more than anything else it played like a fond homage to the old-old Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon serials all dressed up with great SFX (which in fact our movie companion had grown up with).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is kind of overrated, but that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. This film changed cinema as we know it today. It changed many things: Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing, Action and just Fiction. What it didn't revolutionise was acting or directing. Aside from Alec Guinness' great performance and good ones from Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones, the acting in this picture is a touch stilted. Mark Hamill is winy as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford is always complaining and Carrie Fisher seems to go in and out of a bad British accent. They're not bad by any means, they're just not good either. Now that we got the bad stuff out of the way, I can praise the rest.The action is more revolutionary than it is good, there's nothing exceptional here, it's just OK. I think I was too busy thinking "How the hell did they do that in 1977?!" to actually care about what was going on. Actually, I take that back, I did care about what was going on, it just wasn't the action that made me root for the Rebellion, or the special effects. It was the characters. They aren't brilliantly written or anything, they're just really likable and engaging, aside from the flaws that I pointed out.The story is great. It's original, it's inspiring and thought-provoking. The Force is a brilliant idea. It could be interpreted as anything. Maybe religion or belief. The story may have its flaws, like some small plot holes here and there, but I don't really care. It's a fantasy. And as I said, I was rooting for these characters. When a movie does that, I cannot say it's bad writing.Easily the best aspect of this film is the creativity it brings to the film industry. All the aliens, the robots and cyborgs and androids that they come across are all visually compelling and incredibly designed. It's so... cool, there's no other way to describe this movie than cool. Darth Vader, the film's villain is a prime example of that. He looks cool and he sounds cool. We don't know that much about him yet at this point, but at least I wanted to. I love Darth Vader.Overall, I'd say Star Wars is a pretty good film, truly revolutionising film in general with breathtaking special effects for its time compelling characters, an interesting story and brilliant costume design and makeup. I would say the special editions are pretty lame, but I guess they're not as bad as everyone else says they are. Star Wars: 7.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classics, phenomenal and arguably the best sci-fi flick masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.Plot: Luke Skywalker joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a wookiee and two droids to save the galaxy from the Empire's world-destroying battle-station, while also attempting to rescue Princess Leia from the evil Darth Vader.The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want's them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70's film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi he is excellent. Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 This flick get's a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.Star Wars (later retitled as Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope is a 1977 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas.

		<shortDescription>Not as overrated as it seems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question has often come up, as with any movie of renown, of why this movie and its successors have been so successful and highly regarded. But after some thought, I think I have somewhat of an answer. The response I usually get when I say that an older movie is overrated is that "it was great for the time", which usually is in reference to the visual effects. I always come back by saying that Transformers has some of the best effects of the past decade, but we don't exactly regard those as great works of cinema. If a movie is really great, it can speak to people of all times and doesn't need to rely on spfx to be respected. I saw this movie first when I was eight, and I can tell you straight up that I didn't notice or care that the effects were cheesy, and at the time it was by far my favorite movie. Now I'm not as into the series and get a couple of laughs from the dated visuals, but I still respect the movie because it is one of those rare gems in which the big budget and commercial appeal don't lull the filmmakers into doing a sloppy job. I would imagine that people walked out of the theater amazed on many different levels. For many, it might have been their first time seeing a fluid combination of technical spectacle, an exciting adventure, an empowering coming of age tale, and a chance to immerse themselves into another world/Galaxy. There are similar sci-fi movies still being made such as the Matrix, Inception, and Lord of the Rings (Mad Max: Fury Road seems to fall under this as well, but I haven't seen it). Movies such as these are a wonderful treat because we love great visuals, but we also hate it when big budget blockbusters leave us feeling robbed and disappointed. So it's awesome when one of these results in a great- not above average but great- movie that speaks to most of its audience.By today's standards, the characters are a little generic but they all have distinct personalities and voices, good development, and importance to the plot. Even the two droids, while they might not be considered characters, advance both the internal and external plots. Their external contribution is obvious enough, but I think they really help Luke's development too by reflecting his thoughts in a way. C3PO is always playing it safe and being logical like Luke's farmboy side wants him to be, while R2D2 is always doing something active without caring if it's smart or not. And if you look through the story, R2D2 wins these debates every time Darth Vader, while not the epitome of villains himself, has definitely become the prototype for an intimidating on-screen force. He may not have been the first to don the stereotypical black cape, but he sure made it memorable. It's true that the acting isn't great, but it's no worse than today's action flicks.The story is also a bit generic for today, but that might be a result of similar movies using Star Wars as a model for their own stories. I know there are people out there who obsess over the plot holes that have come up because of how George Lucas decided to build his continued narratives. And if you read some of the justifications for why one Death Star took 20 years to build and the other only took 4, or the reasoning behind Obi Wan acting as if he is not Luke's father, they are a little flimsy. But I would ask you to get over these discrepancies because George Lucas was likely not planning for sequels and none of the holes are really that major. I know this can be hard, because I tend to obsess over dialogue or exposition that I feel is unrealistic. This doesn't mean you have to like it, but it's much harder to get something out of a movie if you're too busy nitpicking. So hate it as much as you want, but please make sure you give it a serious look too.Lastly, I want to comment on the Force. If we're honest, every true Star Wars fan wishes or has wished they could use the Force. But I think if we understood what the Force is, we could actually use it in a realistic way. I know that sounds cheesy and invalidates all your attempts to get sodas from your fridge by telekinesis, but please hear me out. The Force, by my interpretation, is acquired by becoming in tune with the world around us and it exists in our own reality by different names. If you look at a few philosophers, they discuss concepts concerning reality that should make sense. What I find fascinating about the Force is that it encapsulates the entire idea of faith, and I don't mean that religiously. All the characters utilize the Force by having faith in the concept of it, faith in their own possession of it, and faith in its effects on the people around them.Most people are either ardent fans of this series or have friends and family that are. If you somehow have managed to avoid watching it, I can respect whatever aversions you might have. The ardor of the fans is enough to turn anyone off, but it is possible to enjoy and appreciate the series without becoming part of a stereotype. Overall Rating: 7.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen Star Wars yet, then you won't have seen Star Wars at all. Excellent for fans. Effects are good even for today. Characters are well thought out and detailed. Every scene is a work of art. It has become the most quotable film of all time. Must watch more than 15 times. It's Star Wars. Better left alone. Watch the original, not the remastered rubbish.The most iconic Science Fiction film of all time ever. The cast of characters includes some of the coolest and funniest in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Mark Hamill, THE Joker, is full of passion and strength while Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the coolest looking character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that booming voice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being quite new to the Star Wars franchise, I have decided that before I can go and watch the new release, I need to watch the previous films in this franchise. Being the person that I am, I have decided to watch them in the order that they have been released, rather than the order that the timeline in the story follows.Taking into account that this film is now almost 40 years old, I will make no comment towards the special effects that make this film the sci-fi film that it is. All of these characters have been around for so long that, even though I haven't seen the films before, I still recognise them and know who they are. Cue the start of the film, with R2D2 and C3PO working their way through their spaceship as battle breaks out around them, eliciting many squeals and comments from me as they have always been two of my favourite characters.The acting, at times, had me wincing with embarrassment, but many of the quotes throughout the whole 2 hours had me pausing the film to have a good old laugh.I cannot wait to carry on with this series of films and, hopefully, finish them off in a short while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long Time Ago ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film that changed it all."Star Wars" is the pinnacle and holy grail of all geek films, it was an unexpected atomic bomb in the 70s and revolutionized film making and is still changing the way we view and make cinema until today. Although it isn't a "Godfather" or a "Citizen Kane", it certainly is a tremendous achievement in film making in terms of visual effects along with a simple plot about a Flash Gordon adventure with some Sci-Fi thrown in and it blows 1977 and our minds until today. There's not much to say about the plot of this story because I'm sure almost everybody knows it. It's about the story of Luke Skywalker, an orphaned boy in Tatooine awaiting for adventure. He then gets 2 droids which brings him into the middle of a crisis between the rebellion and the empire. Luke then meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, which then led them to meet Han Solo and a whole new simple yet familiar adventure to save the princess occurs.It's amazing how all of this came together, it created a universe so vast and rich and inspired more than what the universe had. It inspired a generation and the future generation. The visual effects and the then unknown light saber battles were groundbreaking. The practicality of the effects back then even at the start of the film through the text scrawl were breathtaking. Each and every meticulous detail brought a whole fandom together to make a 2-3 page Wookiepedia page about it. The music and the soundtrack remain iconic until this day, from Binary Sunset to the Imperial March. This film also brought countless pop culture references that never fail to satisfy fans.As for the flaws for this film, you could say the Stormtrooper's aim, or maybe the plot holes discovered after several years (the droids escaping, etc) (prequel plot holes), (or maybe even the special editions). But you could also say, that these things have little to no effect to how the film holds up, in fact it even adds to it. This film, as said by JJ, is a mystery box, there is a mysterious twist and turn you don't know about and you get more invested and intrigued into the story as they establish it. This is the beauty of the film, and it's the beauty of each and every other movie it inspired. As the Force Awakens nears its release, Star Wars will live on to a new generation, and this film will always be remembered for changing everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beginning of a legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first stone for a pop culture monument. not impressive. but nice and useful for its profound innocence. an old fashion Star Wars, full of secrets, naive like its heroes, mixture of Medieval stories and Sci Fi, mirror for teenager 's ambitions, dreams and fantasies, proposing interesting characters and fight scenes who seems be more than fireworks. the fight between Good and Evil. start of a legend. and beautiful slices of humor in different forms. a film who preserves the emotion and fascination of its first public. and, sure, the crazy risks for George Lukas. story of three heroes and exotic in admirable manner, it is always fresh. or, maybe, evergreen. for the small details, for the acting - Han Solo could be different? Luke Skywalker is not the best image of the boy from each from us ? and maybe, as more than piece from large puzzle, a wonderful story about courage. and about Force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite of the franchise.Great humor, intense action, and great characters. Star Wars is not the best sci-fi film but great epic tale.Lucas shows when Special Effect are done well with a good story it can enhance the film experience.Excellent adventure classic features great visuals.And the music? OMG.Wiki quotes:"Lucas hired composer John Williams. Williams had worked with Spielberg on the film Jaws, for which he won an Academy Award. Lucas felt that the film would portray visually foreign worlds, but that the musical score would give the audience an emotional familiarity; he wanted a grand musical sound for Star Wars, with leitmotifs to provide distinction.""IThe American Film Institute's list of best film scores ranks the Star Wars soundtrack at number one."Great job Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't just my personal favourite film, but I strongly believe it IS the greatest, most iconic, most successful, most influential, most inspirational, and most adventurous film ever to be put on screen. I also strongly believe The Original Star Wars Trilogy is the greatest trilogy of all time (you could argue TLOTR Trilogy). It's the most iconic and the largest fictional universe in cinema, fiction, sci-fi, literature, and in our memories. Wonderful iconic characters, great acting (aside from Mark Hamill), perfect solid story, perfect pacing, great effects (for its time), a wondrous sci-fi fantasy adventure with a farm boy, a smuggler, a wookiee, a princess, an old wizard, two comic relief robots, and a menacing villain. How much better can you get? Even if you don't say it is the greatest film ever made, it is DEFINITELY one of the greats, along with The Godfather, Citizen Kane, The Wizard Of Oz, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Schindler's List, Dr. Strangelove, Seven Samurai, The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, and etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw this movie because of the upcoming The Force Awakens movie. Of course before I watch The Force Awakens, I need to see the other Star Wars movie, then I started with Episode IV. It was good? Not only good, it was great! Especially its special effects. Was it action packed? Yes it is! The actors in this movie did a great job on portraying their characters. Speaking of characters, they were actually likable especially my favorite, Han Solo who was played Harrison Ford.I gotta admit, the first parts were kinda boring but it gets well when the action starts. That's why I give it 7 stars. I'll still continue on seeing the other Star Wars movies then I'll try to review them.In conclusion, Star Wars is a great film! I really appreciate it and probably one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good start to the Star Wars Franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, it's not the best of the original three Star Wars movies. It had some rocky starts with some odd looking little creatures in a brown hooded cloak (Jawas), but the story did go much smoother when Luke had to finally go on his own. It was sad to see uncle Owen and Aunt Baru die...but it did further the plot for Luke and Obey Won Kenoby to start their adventure. My favorite part to this movie was near the middle part of the movie, where Han tells Chewey, "Way to think with your stomach. " Pure hilarity! It had been, of course that the big guy had smelt something amongst the trash that the whole crew had been standing around in. And the final battle, while the massive space station was destroyed, it opened up a stunning cliff hanger for episode five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredible Start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back in 1977, this film literally blew the entire world of cinema out of the water. My Mum once told me how when she saw this film new at a cinema in Leicester Square, the first image of a Star Destroyer sweeping overhead was the most unbelievable sight, and to that I can agree. This film is truly spectacular, even today it looks good!So where do we start? As a war rages between the oppressive evil of the Galactic Empire and the forces of the Rebel Alliance, a ship carrying Princess Leia is captured by the Dark Lord Darth Vader, but not before she is able to safely stow plans to their new and ultimate weapon, the Death Star, into the memory banks of Droid R2D2, who escapes with his counterpart C-3PO. On the nearby desert planet of Tatooine, they come under the ownership of Luke Skywalker, a teenage boy who's no doubt bored senseless of his mundane life in the desert, and aspires to leave the toils of his remote world. This dream comes true when he bumps into ageing Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, who, after receiving a message for help from the Princess, takes Luke with him as his apprentice aboard the Millennium Falcon with smuggler Han Solo and his co-pilot Chewbacca, destined to seek out the Rebellion and deliver the plans before the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction is completed.There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been said before, the story is a classic adventure story, with an intimidating villain, a strong hero who's easy to relate to, being both wide eyed and naive, a wise old master, comedic sidekick robots, a cool and collected partner in crime, and of course the damsel in distress.The acting is fantastic, all actors and characters being memorable. The special effects, which even though were only done with scale models and a few post-production animations and enhancements, still look incredible today, I dare say even better than modern CGI in some instances. I will say that the fight scene above the Death Star at the end of the movie does go on for a little bit too long, with a lot of repeated swooping and diving and swooping and diving, etc. But, other than that, I have absolutely no complains, it's a smart film for adults and a gripping adventure for children. There's nothing not to like!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope - EMC's Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally titled "Star Wars", and before all the questionable special edition changes... This masterpiece graced our silver screens in 1977. Star Wars!!! The movie had dark thoughts surrounding it, would it be a major flop, this was thought by all who were part of the production, but this darkness ended, when it became the second highest grossing film in America, and one of the worlds most cherished motion pictures. It was a monument of its time showing off its impressive special effects and neat space battles.... The plot center's twenty years since the the great Jedi Purge when a rebellion against the Empire has begun under the control of the beautiful Princess Leia Organa, daughter of Anakin and Padme Skywalker. Far out on Tatooine lives the new hope of the galaxy in the form of Luke Skywalker, a moisture farmer on the other side of Mos Eisley, watched over by Ben Kenobi who has great plans for him. This fourth chapter, chronologically, in the Star Wars Saga remains in all our hearts with such iconic characters like Han Solo, played greatly by Harrison Ford, Chewbacca and Darth Vader. Almost every shot and line of the film is engraved in our memory as we look back on the film as one of our childhoods' ultimate adventure movies. Though when watched with the rest of the Star Wars movies it remains certain that most of the plot twists in further films were never meant to be. This film's just basically a war in outer space somewhere, and the clichéd story of how a farm boy becomes the hero, saving the princess and defeating evil. For these reasons, we've ranked it just ahead of The Phantom Menace making it fifth. Its sometimes boring pacing and dated dialog stands out at points, though we must never forget how this film impacted cinema and sci-fi for generations. The light saber duel is slow, with unmemorable choreography, though is emotional at the end. It's a great film but compare to the next two falls just a bit short....</fullReview>

I remember asking to see the film but my parents wouldn't let me until they saw it first to make sure it was OK because I was so young. They saw it and loved it and took me the following day. I can even remember when my dad bought my first Star Wars figure R2-D2 and the smell of the plastic as the package opened. I have been hooked with Science Fiction films ever since. They used to show the making of Star Wars on television and I would always watch these shows with amazement and try to learn all of their movie magic tricks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, but not without flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: I am 18 years old and until now I had never seen Star Wars. While most people's view on Star Wars nowadays is clouded by nostalgia, here is my unaffected take on these 'classics'.Star Wars IV: A New Hope was the movie that introduced the public to Star Wars, when it came out. It's humor, cast and writing is for the most part spot on. In fact, I have only 2 problems with this movie.1) I watched the 2004 DVD remaster of this film, and it wasn't perfect. In many scenes, the audio quality would suddenly drop and in some cases it just sounded straight up dubbed and out of place. Not quite a problem with the movie itself, but a distracting element nonetheless.2) The pacing felt off. The movie seems to just jump from scene to scene with hardly any context or explanation between. One scene they are landing on a planet, then they cut to a room where they are planning something, and then they cut to them setting the plan in action. All of this in a couple of minutes! Not to mention that there is a serious lack of character development. Blame this on the film being the fourth in the series all you want, but that doesn't change the fact that this was the first movie to be released. And you can't expect to release a movie, and then develop the characters two decades later.These were my only issues, and they weren't massive. This movie is still incredibly enjoyable and quite re-watchable. The humor is fantastic and so are the special effects (for their time). I can understand that this is a classic.It is a great movie, all things aside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since so much was said and written about this film I decided to tell you how was it when I saw it the first time.I was 10 years old. Cinema was called Dubrovnik and the city was Sarajevo. Back then Sarajevo and Dubrovnik were two beautiful cities in the same country, Yugoslavia. Today they are not. Dubrovnik is in Croatia, and Sarajevo is a capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Well, in any case we had cinema called Dubrovnik in Sarajevo. It was located where today is a multiplex Cinema City in Sarajevo.Just like any kid of that age I was so scared of Darth Wader. Later I was more scared of the real Darth Wader (Dick Chaney). The Imperial music added to the scare. Later I learned that clones were the good solders of the Republic, but back then they were really scaring. Scaring as hell! Later in life I met so many scary people in my life, it is a miracle I am still alive, I escaped death at least dozen of times, and I am still here to write these lines.Chubacka was scary too, so did all other funny creatures from the café...I loved shape of the Imeprial star ships, and I was still wondering why princess Lea wore her hair the way she did.Concept of good and evil. I thought after watching this film that in the real life good will always triumph. Later I learned that good and evil are not as black and white as they were portrayed in this film. There are a lot of shades of gray. Funny, back then for some reason I wanted for the Empire to win, totalness of them was so calming, I felt if they won peace would come to that galaxy. Child*s mind. My sons were the same way, until I persuaded them that the princess Lea*s lower organs should be protected! I was so mesmerized by THE FILM that I watched it over and over, we started fan clubs which were not that happily looked by the Yugoslav secret service, but because they were also mesmerized by the film they tolerated it. Later when my sons fell in love with THE SAGA they were able to collect all the memorabilia, books and all. We were fighting with the plastic light sabras, that I almost got my eye poked out.So that how it was long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (originally released as just "Star Wars") is a masterpiece.Although the plot of the film is so simple that it almost hurts, it is brilliantly executed.It's a hero's journey in which the main character, Luke Skywalker, starts his adventures and finds himself in the middle of something bigger than he ever imagined. It is his story. Unfortunately, Luke's story tends to diminish the other character's stories in the first Star Wars trilogy. It's quite acceptable in this film, because Leia is the only character who really suffers from that (her non-reaction and non-follow-up on Alderaan's destruction is a shame). Sadly, this got even with with the next two films.Star Wars was a technical breakthrough and is in some ways still the best of all the Star Wars films.9 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Star Wars is a true masterpiece of ingenuity and film-making. No science-fiction movie(except for its own sequel, The Empire Strikes Back) has the power of Star Wars. It is well written, funny, action-packed, intelligent,well... it is everything! Name a quality, Star Wars probably has it. It features the legendary special effects that this series is well known for... but it has more(unlike the disappointing Phantom Menace). It is packed with fantastic characters that are impossible to forget. The story is perfectly developed and the dialogue is always good(unlike most actions/science-fiction movies). In fact, why am I talking to you about this movie? You have almost certainly seen it(probably a couple of times) and if you don't agree with me, you probably don't care about my opinion.I am big movie buff, but I am also a Star Wars fan. 10 out of 10 is too low for this one! It is a fantastic voyage and if you haven't seen it already, you should get the DVD or download!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting and settings and premise of the film was good. Pacing was good.This film was probably my least favorite of the latter three Star Wars films, though.Some things didn't make sense to me, like Obi submitting so easily and Luke not even bothering to use his visor for that final shot. It just didn't make logical sense and the lack of human psychological reality detracted a bit from the movie for me.I feel that this film was a good setup for the other two, but I feel that that was all it was. An introduction to the characters, background, and lore.A bit more action and character development could have helped, though I did enjoy some of the subtle comedy in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars without Han Solo is like Indiana Jones without his whip. The new star wars trilogy may have better CGI but they are no match to the old trilogy when it comes to memorable characters, dialogue and the thrill.Star Wars a new hope is enlightening, fun and draws you in to want to see what happens when the Empire Strikes Back. This episode IV is well designed there is not too much dragging in talk and theories just a brief introduction to all the characters involved and then straight to the main event. The CGI and screenplay is one that takes you by storm, as you watch this movie and compare it with the recent trilogy you start to wonder what the difference was, as the difference in the CGI is very minute.George Lucas is a visionary and what he started with star wars is what many have been dreaming of doing for time past, a franchise that can go on for a long time. This 1977 space movie is written and directed by George Lucas himself and this movie influenced many others that came after it. The movie was originally just named Star Wars; it was after its success and corresponding sequels and then Lucas idea to make a prequel to the sequel, which the movie now became Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope as the movie tend to follow the events that happened after Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.The Galactic Empire is led by the Sith Lord Palpatine and his apprentice Darth Vader, both have been in charge of the Galactic Empire for years, and they are facing an opposition by a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance. The Galactic Empire has become more driven by technological advancement as the way of the force seems to be known by only few, the Galactic Empire have a new weapon named Death Star, a space station that can take out a whole planet in seconds.Detail plans of the Death Star were intercepted by the alliance and Princess Leia was taken it to the rebel base when she and her starship occupants were captured by Darth Vader. Before her apprehension she stored the data in her droid and sent it off to go find Obi-Wan Kenobi, the droid on its way got acquired by farm boy Luke Skywalker, and due to some circumstances beyond his control Skywalker decides to accompany Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi on a daring mission to rescue the rebel leader Princess Leia.The level of design in the movie is so well done that when an upgrade of the same set design is introduced in the new trilogy, you would feel the movies were made in the same time. Lucas upon production of the movie created his own special effect company Industrial Light &amp; Magic to handle the effects in the movie, which was a huge leap ahead of others for the company.Here is a movie from the way back in the days that you just have to watch and admire the work that went into making it.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply The Greatest Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been over 35 years since I first saw this unbelievable piece of cinema. And the weird thing is that I was a little disappointed that first time. Star Wars had been SO hyped that by the time I saw it back in 1977 I was expecting a non stop shoot 'em up from start to finish. The fact that the movie came out of the gate so quickly when Darth Vader and his storm troopers attacked and boarded Princess Leia's starship only increased those expectations. So naturally the folloeing scenes in the desert on Tattooine right after that intense opening was a bit of a letdown..it seemed to go on FOREVER, even though it really doesn't last that long. It wasn't until the 2nd time I saw it that it really hit me just how great this movie was. I think the trick was that I wasn't watching it with expectations or a critical eye the 2nd time..I just sat back and enjoyed it. A friend at the time criticized it for not being good science fiction, but he had it all wrong. Star Wars isn't a science fiction movie per se, though there are some terrific sci fi elements in it. At its heart, Star Wars is a fairy tale..maybe the greatest ever told.I guess I'll give my "critics analysis," such as it is, as to why this movie is so great. It's not the effects, or the action, or the sets, even though all of the above are spectacular. It's the story, the dialog, and most of all those memorable characters who immediately draw you in. Mark Hamill is terrific as the eager young Luke Skywalker, who at this point in his life just wants to quit being a farmer and have some adventure. Carrie Fisher is equally good as the sharp-tongued Princess Leia. Fisher makes the most of some good lines ("Would somebody get this big, walking CARPET out of my way?!"). Harrison Ford is spot on as the cynical, wise-cracking, swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (my favorite character in Star Wars). Not much to say about Obi-Wan Kenobi, other than the fact that he's played by the incomparable Alec Guinness, an actor's actor for whom a bad performance is a contradiction. Guinness could make the most basic line of dialog sound interesting. And oh, those robots. The back and forth between C3PO and R2D2 is beyond priceless. And of course, there's the bad guy to end all bad guys, Darth Vader. But as mean and heartless as Vader is, he's also, in a weird way, cool. The scene on the Death Star where Vader nearly chokes a pompous ass of a general to death (the first time we witness his telekinetic powers) is classic. You can see that Vader does not suffer fools well, even (or especially) when they're on his side. The action sequences, though very well done, are not overdone. George Lucas does a wonderful job of taking the concept of the dogfight and transposing it to outer space. Ditto the sword fighting scenes, substituting foils with light sabers..truly inspired. The same is true for the visual effects. They're wonderful, but they support the story and characters rather than upstage them, and although there are a lot of neat visuals, somehow you don't feel bombarded by them (unlike subsequent Star Wars movies, alas..). Again, having a strong story with compelling characters helps. The sets are terrific too (the Millennium Falcon is my favorite). One thing I like about Lucas' universe in Star Wars (as opposed to Gene Roddenberry's in Star Trek) is that not everything is pristine and perfect. Machines and equipment from the Falcon to the droids look well used. The scene that best personifies Lucas' universe is in the bar. It's like something right out of the old west..only with space aliens. You also get a bit of mysticism and sword and sorcery (as in the Force) to go with the sci fi..which will be expanded on in future films. A buddy of mine once said that Star Wars was the first movie that was EVERYTHING that a sci-fi action adventure could be. George Lucas called it his gift to a generation which grew up without fairy tales. I just call it fun; the greatest tour-de-force in motion picture history. Yes, there are movies which are far more serious, which examine human imperfections, harp on social issues, etc., but when I go to the movies, I want to forget about the world's troubles for a couple of hours, not be reminded of them. And Star Wars is the definition of escapist fair. The first one in its original cut is the best. The 90s re-release with added scenes and enhanced effects, though still good, was not necessary, and Lucas flat out ruined one of the classic scenes in the original movie: the scene in the bar featuring Solo and Greedo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that changed the world...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a summer 1977. But not just an ordinary summer! It was the summer that Star Wars premiered for the first time ever! The idea for Star Wars came from director George Lucas, who had written an incredible screenplay about "a galaxy far, far away..." Lucas' draft was rejected by many major film studios before 20th Century Fox finally agreed to distribute the movie. And thank god for that! George Lucas was to direct, Gary Kurtz was producing and Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher was playing our beloved leads! The film was shot with a tight schedule and limited budget, and the movie was masterfully edited, scored and visualized! After many commercials, we are back to the summer 1977! The film collected rave reviews, and ultimately grossed over 750 million dollars! The film went on to win 7 Oscars in the technical category, including Best Original Score, having lost the in the major categories to Annie Hall. Star Wars is a one-time only experience to behold. Like LOTR the Star Wars trilogy is not just films, but experiences in themselves. Every single time I watch the trilogy I almost cry out of nostalgia. And I'm not alone! It's hard to really explain why Star Wars is so extraordinary. Maybe because that in a time when people only saw movies like The Godfather and Citizen Kane, Star Wars was indeed the first sci-fi blockbuster! And it's awesome! Star Wars introduces us to the beloved galaxy our characters live in, and then again it doesn't really use some sort of narration or anything. We slowly learn about their world from subtle hints in the dialog, and one could argue that it is a better way to introduce the viewer to the world with a sort of mystique to it! Let's talk about the characters!Mark Hamill plays Luke Skywalker who represents the good, young man who we are to follow in the rest of the trilogy! Hamill is the ultimate lead and he is very good as Luke! Luke is not that interesting when put under a microscope. But that's the whole point, his character is meant to evolve as the series progress! Harrison Ford creates one of the most badass and beloved heroes ever put on a screen! He completely disappears into the role of the smuggler Hans Solo, and his character is only over-shadowed by someone I will talk about later! Carrie Fisher is beautiful and stunning, and she matches the role of Princess Leia Organa completely! The best character however lies in the greatest villain in cinema of all time, Darth Vader! His costume is memorable and so is his mask noice! Menacing as he is with the physique of the living mountain David Prowse, and with the powerful and crafty voice of James Earl Jones, Darth Vader is without breaking a sweat, the best villain of all time! Alec Guiness is also a great hero in an Oscar-nominated role as Obi-Wan Kenobi!In the technical category every Oscar is a 100 percent deserved! The visuals at the year 1977 is out of this world, and so it the sound and film editing! One of the best things about Star Wars is the famous music by John Williams! He won a deserved Oscar for it, and every time I hear it I am overwhelmed by nostalgia! Star Wars just has everything for a sci-fi blockbuster! A fantastic theme tune, wonderful direction, superb writing, a great story, amazing character development, a fantastic villain, stunning visuals, amazing heroes and I could go on and on and on! If you haven't watch Star Wars watch it! It's one of my, many fan's and many peoples all-time favorite movies! Everything is deserved!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars not only transports you to another galaxy but fuses action with the right amount of humor and introduced the world to some of the most memorable characters of all time. I think I can pinpoint the moment I "became a woman" to when Han Solo usurped R2-D2 as my favorite character. It's not just that it's Harrison Ford at his hottest with a super sexy wardrobe (that vest! the little jacket he wears in Cloud City!), but the fact that he's a rebel struggling with the fact that he's found a cause and a group of people he can care about. Practically everyone in Hollywood tried out for the role of Han Solo including Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, and Bill Murray! But Lucas finally went with Ford, despite originally being dead set against using an actor he had worked with before. I think what makes Ford an ideal Han Solo is the fact that he really wasn't taking anything too seriously. This gives Solo a cocky but sweet vibe that is completely lovable. He purposely didn't rehearse his line for the scene where he must stall over the intercom in the detention block so it would seem spontaneous. It's such a fun, cute moment and it makes you realize how important it is to have the right cast. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/03/02/star-wars/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Issues with the science in the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that this is a movie with imagination being the focus. Nevertheless I wish to point these out.1. For some reason people in the movies seem to like animals looking similar to dinosaurs. We see them in the Entire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Given the technology why would anyone use someone like the Tauntauns in the Hoth planet if they had good technical transport. 2. Why have sounds from moving spaceships. Sounds travel in places where they can, there is no sound in space. 3. Next, the X wing fighters, they seem to be a slightly improved variation of the F-14s with capacity to travel in space, everything is done by people. We have automated fighters already, most future planes are going to be fully automated. All testing and correction seem to be manual, now most of these are fully automated. Given this being the future it will be more so.4. A lot of the fights between the imperials and the rebels seem to exaggerated versions of video games. It looks silly really, where people sit on laser guns, target points and shoot them. It gives an impression that the movie addresses small kids and the video game market.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi fantasy classic and a childhood favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977 "Star Wars A New Hope" formerly just called "Star Wars" was released in the movie theaters and cinema was never the same since then. To this day "Star Wars" remains not just a classic but an experience for generations of moviegoers. If I had to pick which movie trilogy that truly introduced me to cinema it would be the original "Star Wars" trilogy.(Granted it was the "Special Editions" I grew up watching in the 90s but I think that the theatrical cuts are better because it shows all the hard work they did without CG.) So in a way I'm thankful that I watched this movie and that the original trilogy opened my eyes to movies.The original "Star Wars" is an epic yet simplistic story of Good vrs Evil influenced by Joseph Cambell's hero mythology and others like Akira Kurosawa films and Flash Gordon serials. The story should be familiar to everyone by now since its part of our pop culture.(But if you have never seen it, GO SEE IT. Watch the trilogy and share it with family and friends because it has something for everyone.) With the exception of Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin and Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi who were already well established actors, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia were unknown actors that became household names because of the popularity of this movie and everyone plays their parts well. Anthony Daniels is a robot named C-3PO, Kenny Baker plays as R2-D2 and Peter Mayhew is the Wookiee Chewbacca. Lets not forget the most iconic character that has embedded into cinema history as one of the best movie villains ever Darth Vader played by David Prowse and voiced menacingly by the great James Earl Jones.When you watch the theatrical cuts you have to appreciate how groundbreaking the special effects were at the time since they were creating new technology for effects while filming. Everything was done using models and props and it all still holds up very well. The soundtrack just screams epic since its done by John Williams. As for writing and dialog ask anybody if they have never heard of "May The Force Be With You" and you'll get the picture.George Lucas made a masterpiece for the modern age. Its just a shame he wont re-release the original theatrical cuts since he claims that the newer versions are his true vision. In the end "Star Wars" remains one of my favorite films from my childhood and an influential classic for the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for me, it is a religious film. the universal values, the same battle between Good and Evil. only nuances are different.but it is difficult to define not only film impressions but the sense of a cultural root. it is fascinating and impressive. strange and part of a way to understand world. heroic and common. because it is a fairy tale but its purpose is not entertainment but rediscover of a wise way to explore mysteries of every day. so, not Lucas genius is axis but need of public to be seduced. and Star Wars remains a good exercise. because it is a kind of game and adventure. because each detail is perfect and the travel is like the wind of winter morning. because it is a mythology who has like faith imagination. because it remains unique. and slice of a golden age for everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of a sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin this review, I want to say that I've never heard of this film or the others... until... one day... when I stumbled upon it both on television and on a video copy, I said to myself in amazement, "Wow. What a great film it is." I do agree with the others that this is indeed one of the best movies in the history of Hollywood. I love how it took the science fiction genre to the next level in cinema history and it's done really well. That's why I'm giving this a solid 100% for being an epitome of brilliance from George Lucas himself.It has no flaws at all which is a good thing because it's redeemed by it's pros that made it a masterpiece for all time. The story is very original and has a great concept. The direction from Lucas is excellent and I like how it moves along very nicely at the 2 hour length. The action sequences are great especially the flight sequences at the Battle at the Death Star scene, but the strongest aspect goes to the acting and the special effects. Mark Hamill, Alec Guiness, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher did their roles as the brave and bold Luke Skywalker, the tough and cocky Harrison Ford, the beautiful and rebellious Princess Leia and the wise Obi-Wan (or Ben) Kenobi while James Earl Jones did excellent as the menacing Darth Vader with a deep booming voice.Overall, Star Wars (or Star Wars IV: A New Hope) will always be recommended to others as one of the best films in cinema history. Thank you George Lucas. With your charm and brilliance, this deserves a thumbs up from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorites, one of the greatest films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's now known as "Episode IV - A New Hope", but I'm calling it what it was when it came out, "Star Wars". But if you call it "A New Hope" that's fine. I've loved this and the other two original films since I was 6 years old, and I always will. Ever since I saw those yellow words blast on the screen with John Williams music playing in the background, I was addicted. Don't worry, I'm not going to talk about the stupid changes that Lucas made to this film. Story: A young farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who longs for adventure. Having been raised by his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, he's always wondered who his father was, and has longed for a life beyond his home planet Tatooine, but his Uncle Owen won't allow it. One day, he and his friend Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) join forces with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a wookie Chewbacca and two droids C-3PO and R2-D2 to save Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the clutches of Darth Vader and the evil Empire. After they save Leia, Luke joins the Rebel Alliance who use the blueprints of the Empire's new battle station called the Death Star, and with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca, Luke destroys the Death Star and all is well... for now.All the actors deliver 100%: Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker perfectly embodies the heroic young boy who longs for adventure and would do anything to help his friends. Harrison Ford owns the role of Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is great as Leia, and Alec Guinness was perfect in the role of Obi Wan Kenobi. As for Han and Leia, I love how the two are always arguing, and makes for really entertaining dialogue. The character of Darth Vader (physically portrayed by David Prowse, and voiced by James Earl Jones) is probably the best on screen villain of all time. The first time he comes through the fog on that ship in the beginning of the movie gives the audience the impression that he is the most menacing and evil figure in the galaxy.What makes this a great film besides the story and the acting? The special effects still blow my mind, even today and John Williams' score is terrific. But the main reason why people love this film and the other two so much is that the characters and the story are the main focus and not the spectacle. Unfortunately that's the way it was in the prequel trilogy (even though I thought "Revenge of the Sith" actually ended the saga on a better note). The story is shared through the experiences of Luke Skywalker, a wide-eyed innocent who has yet to explore the unknown. Star Wars and the other two movies as a whole is a coming of age story of Luke growing into becoming a Jedi Knight like his father before him. Plus, Luke, Leia and Han are the most normal people in the entire trilogy, and their interactions with each other seem real.Fans can say what they want about George Lucas, but I give him a lot of credit for giving us this great saga which has inspired so many people all over the world, and will continue to be an inspiration for future generations. If you're one of the few people on the planet that hasn't seen Star Wars, do yourself a favor and watch it. It's awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two basic types of great films: films that critics love (Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey) and films that the public loves and the critics do not love that much, such as Star Wars and Gladiator. Usually, the films that the public loves are better in fact: critics pretend to like different things to make themselves "superior". But the fact is that Star Wars is simply pure entertainment and anyone who denies its greatness is pretty much being pretentious and dishonest.But this film Not as good as Empire Strikes Back, though still excellent. I would recommend Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke, both by Miyazaki, for those that liked this film.</fullReview>

Top marks to Mr Lucas for his vision. It's hard to find any fault with the film, from the acting, direction, production values and the musical score by John Williams. Every time I watch I am transformed back to my childhood. I just wish they would make another set of films that follow on from the original 3. I cannot praise this film enough. A film for every child, parent and grandparent Two hours of pure sci fi fantasy in its best form. It left all other films of that genre in the dark, May the force be with you!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away..." Those are the very words that starts one of the greatest movies of all time: Star Wars. I first came across Star Wars when I played Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire on the Nintendo 64. Then I got curious about Star Wars. Many questions raced in my mind: What is Star Wars all about? Who's Luke Skywalker? I was so curious that I got this movie along with its two sequels. Here's the premise...Luke Skywalker, a young man who lives with his aunt and uncle, is about to enter what may be the greatest adventure of his lifetime. Along with the legendary Jedi master, Obi Wan Kenobi; the beautiful Princess Leia; the battle-ready Han Solo; Han Solo's Wookie sidekick, Chewbacca; and two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, Luke must defeat the menacing Darth Vader and destroy the Death Star. But will Luke Skywalker and his friends make it in time before the galaxy is doomed? The special effects are absolutely amazing, all the characters are creative and original, the music is beautiful and phenomenal, and this movie will go down in history as one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and the greatest movies of all time. Starring Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, and James Earl Jones as Darth Vader.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's hardly anything this reviewer can say that hasn't already been said, and said better, numerous times before, about this milestone in cinema and the popular culture. The story, of a simple farm boy from an isolated desert planet meeting his destiny as one of the brave souls fighting an evil intergalactic organization, is wonderful fantasy in a science-fiction setting.The mythology it creates ensures its staying power, as well as the many endearing and entertaining characters we meet along the way. There's the reckless, macho mercenary Han Solo who learns something about doing things for others rather than just himself, the wizened old warrior Ben / Obi-Wan Kenobi who instructs our young hero Luke on the ways of the "Force", the young Princess Leia determined to right the wrongs being perpetrated in this universe, the loyal anthropoid spaceship co-pilot Chewbacca, the menacing bad ass that is the black garbed Darth Vader, and the odd couple robots R2-D2 and C-3PO who provide us with a healthy amount of comedy relief.The movie is cast to perfection, with old pros like Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness supporting the talented up and comers Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher. A team of technical wizards, who pioneered some ingenious special effects, bring us from one visually astounding environment to another, from the desert wastes of Tatooine to the stark efficiency of the armoured space station The Death Star. John Williams, the man behind some of the most instantly recognizable music scores of all time, supplies the iconic score here that lets us know, right from the first moments of the film, that we're in for a good time.Of course, those of us who have become extremely familiar with the film over time would give anything to once again be experiencing it for the first time, which is why it's a joy to see it as younger viewers are introduced to its sense of wonder. It's equal parts thrilling, suspenseful, and humorous, and gives us an effective final dogfight in space equivalent to that of an old time war movie.Just speaking personally, this has great resonance for me as it was one of those treasured films of my youth and one had better believe that I was a proud owner of a number of the toys. I always looked forward to a viewing and even as an adult when I know what to expect, the fun factor of the thing still comes through strong.This is definitely one of those films that cinema lovers ought to see at least once in their lifetime.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars - The film that changed everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is one of the most important films Hollywood has ever produced, it marked a huge turning point in the way films were made and marketed. George Lucas struggled for years to make this film happen, he is a true visionary of cinema and people should never forget that. His ambition and creative mind allowed the world of Star Wars to come to fruition. To me Star Wars is Cinema, it has the classical story of rescue the princess but set in space. However it is the way that George Lucas told the story, amazing visual effects, bombastic sound, mythical plot points merged with very likable characters, all of which was refreshing for Hollywood in the late 70's, people were entertained again. The 70s were a special decade for film, many great modern classic films were produced by Hollywood's younger talent, Spielberg, Scorsese, Coppola, Ridley Scot, De Palma, Kubrick. But Star Wars created hysteria on a global scale and is unlikely to ever be seen again on this level. So to George Lucas thank you very much for giving us Star Wars and influencing so many of the great blockbuster film makers we have today including James Cameron and Christopher Nolan, without Star Wars Hollywood would be a very different place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guiness, Peter Mahew, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Cushing star in this 1977 sci-fi film directed by George Lucas. This begins in a far away galaxy where a starship is taken over by an imperial starship led by Darth Vader (David Prowse &amp; voiced by James Earl Jones) and governor, Moff Tarkin (Cushing). Princess Leia Organa (Fisher) sends 2 robots, C-3P0 (Daniels) &amp; R2-D2 (Baker) to deliver her message to rebel fighters on a desert planet, Tatooine informing them she's been kidnapped by the galactic empire. C-3P0 &amp; R2-D2 land on Tatooine and become the property of farm boy, Luke Skywalker (Hamill) who discovers part of Princess Leia's message and about old Jedi wizard, Ben "Obi-Wan" Kenobi (Guiness). Luke and C-3P0 go after R2-D2 when he decides to go see Ben on his own. They meet Ben who saves them from death and hears Leia's whole message about her abduction and plans of the empire's powerful new weapon, the death star, a space station with enough power to destroy a planet. Ben tells Luke about his Jedi father, Anakin who was his apprentice and how he was betrayed &amp; murdered by Vader. Ben convinces Luke to learn the ways of the force and they meet smuggler pilot, Han Solo (Ford) and his hairy sidekick, Chewbacca (Mayhew) who get more than they bargain for. Soon, they rescue the princess and join rebel fighters in an attack on the death star. I grew up watching this and enjoyed it since. The cast is great, the effects are good and John Williams' score is excellent. I recommend this sci-fi classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No film has ever had a greater impact on both the film industry and popular culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, Star Wars. THE epic film among epic films. An entire multi-billion dollar genre was born the day this film was released.We can debate the story elements, we can debate the script, we can debate the plot, we can debate the set elements, we can debate the casting. It's not a perfect film by any means in the technical or production sense. But those special effects...those characters...the pure magic of it...all in a galaxy far, far away. It can't be explained, only experienced. And for kids and young people in 1977, there was nothing greater. It was a jaw-dropping experience. There had never been anything like it.It ran in theaters for over a year, uninterrupted. There were lines out the door for six months to see this film. It was perfectly normal to run into people who had the seen the film 20 or 30 times.So, what we can't debate is the staggering popularity of this film, and it's profound impact on popular culture and, to some extent, modern society. It's not too bold to say that the light speed advances in digital and computer technology that we take for granted today were accelerated by the intense "high tech" optimism and pursuit of advanced technology that this film inspired, both in terms of its technical special effects and its portrayal of advanced tech devices and platforms that seemed perfectly normal to the characters in the film. Young people saw what was possible, they were floored by it, and they were motivated to make it real, and make it better.This is the most popular film ever made, and that carries enormous weight. More than enough to offset various shortcomings that critics may find. In all honesty, no other film even comes close to the popularity and impact of Star Wars. Not E.T., not Shawshank, not Private Ryan, not Gone With the Wind, not Wizard of Oz.Consider yourself fortunate if you're part of the Star Wars generation, those kids and teens of the 1970s who experienced this film when it blew the lid off the industry and wowed the world. It was a very special thing indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope was a landmark in the realm of sci-fi fantasy, special effects, and cinematic quality. I will not deny that I am a loving fan of the Original Trilogy. However, this film seems to be put on too big a pedestal, and people tend to ignore the pacing and sometimes rushed tone to it all. A good example of reference is Family Guy's Blue Harvest, a feature length special in which Family Guy spoofs the entirety of Episode IV. Haven't you ever noticed the truth in some of its particular jokes?"You don't believe in the Force, do you?" - Chris Griffin/Luke Skywalker"Oh you mean that thing you just found out about like three hours ago and are now judging me for not believing in it?" - Peter Griffin/Han SoloHuh. He has a point. I understand that Star Wars is space opera, and some grounds are allowed for a more exciting pacing and a little over- the-top dialogue, but in recent years its begun to stick out to me. Obi- Wan Kenobi in the Original Trilogy to me was memorable, but not very integrated as well as he could have been. His and Luke's relationship is only geared towards vaguely knowing one another and Luke's aunt and uncle's deaths convinces him to tag along with this questionable man.This allows for Obi-Wan to introduce Luke to a new world he would have never been able to see for himself before. Though it seems a bit unrealistic when you think about it, but this IS space opera, so arguing realism is pointless anyway. The point I'm making is that I know too little about Obi-Wan and he has such little an impact on me as a character that his "death" at the hands of Darth Vader leaves me shrugging.Anyone who knows me in terms of my taste in film and literature, knows I am a fan of dystopian fiction is presented correctly. For all the backlash the Prequel Trilogy receives I quite enjoy the dark elements in Revenge of the Sith.The special effects are state of the art, but that's mostly what people refer to in terms of film quality. Star Wars in and of itself is a living homage to films of the past, regarding different times and genres in the same way that Indiana Jones was influenced by the B-movies and action serials of the black and white days. Cinemassacre's review of the franchise explains it in greater detail.The score by John Williams is fantastic. I don't know one person (fan or not) who wouldn't recognize certain scores from the film, such as the track played when Luke is staring at the twin suns. The universe is vast and interesting, and the tone works (although a little too fast at times). Star Wars is a great example of cinema, but greatest film of all time? Eh... not really. Especially compared to Empire Strikes Back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Writer talks about Star Wars movies influence, Joseph Campbell and new myths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All, Like many of you, I'm a fan of Star Wars. Since I was born in 1977, I'm what you might call a Star Wars baby. At least that is what my mother told me. Star Wars has been a part of my life for years.Times have changed, but I remember feeling like the characters in Star Wars were friends who I was on a journey with.A few years ago, while at dinner with friends. A cinematographer asked me what my greatest movie experience was. Without a doubt, Return of the Jedi's opening scene, where Darth Vader walks down the plank... I remember the audience's ovation.The movies were fun then. Like many of you, I was expecting to feel the same magic, when the last three movies were released. It didn't happen. I could be wrong, but I think the most exciting thing to happen in the Star Wars universe, within the last 15 years, has to be the Phantom Menace TRAILER. I remember seeing this on the internet and hearing the audience going crazy. For a split second, it was 1983 all over again.As the years have passed, I've grown attached to films with similar themes. The hero, who takes off on a journey and has a similar quest to Luke. A few years ago, I sought out the writer of another favorite film, The Last Dragon.The writer, Louis Venosta revealed to me, that Joseph Campbell's book, A Hero With a Thousand Faces, was an intricate part of his writing. I had never heard of Campbell until this time. After reading several of Campbell's books and meeting with Venosta, I thought about writing the sequel to the Last Dragon, but then realized that I needed to write my own story.As a native New Yorker, and someone who could have lost his life during 9/11, I felt that a story needed to be made. A new myth. I finished writing my first book in 2008. Over the last few years, I couldn't figure out how to get the story out to the people who needed and wanted to read it.Like many of you, I hate all of the remakes. I was watching EMPIRE OF DREAMS, the documentary of the Star Wars films and I see a comparison between the time when Star Wars was made and the current state of affairs in the United States today.The name of my book is MASTERNEVER AND THE FLOW OF DEATH. You can download the entire book by visiting www.masternever.com I've included an entire soundtrack that accompanies the book.

		<shortDescription>Finally, I Got A Chance To See It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, after 33 years of it first release I finally got the chance to watch this movie I'm dying to see for quite some time but somehow never really get the chance to see it. I wanted to see why so many people claimed it to be the most revolutionize and the most inspiring sci-fi movie of all time; and also I really wanted to see what happen after Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.If you were like me then you most likely wasn't born yet when this first release. But like me you will get a chance to watch all Episode I, II, III and Clone Wars. Which will intern will make you know what to expect and not very surprise like most people who did watch it in the '70s and '80s ? there will be no surprise as, who is Obe-Wan and the Force that he brag about, you will already know that Luke is Darth Vader's son, and so on.In this fourth episode I got a chance to finally see Luke as a young man with a mission to save Princess Leia from the evil clutch of The Empire. The story was simple and not as complicated as it does with all political stuff in Episode II and III, I enjoy it. The only problem for me was the course of the movie seem to run too fast at time that I don't really get a chance to see or feel for some certain character, specially Obe-Wan/Uncle Owen/ and Aunt Beru.Otherwise everything else seems to be perfect (I tried to imagine it as if I was watching it in the '70s): the CGI ? what can I say about it, it is even better than some movies that were made these day (or was there a digitally re-master CGI, that why it look so good). I also enjoy the casting, they work well and blend in together and give some what a much more believe able than what I saw on Episode I, II and III. I love Han Solo cynical character. I will not go into anything else it has been said I think zillion times. It was an awesome film; it is still an awesome film. Definitely a must watch.Recommendation: Got myself a DVD and it worth it.Reason to Watch: People claim it to be one of the most influential Sci-Fi of all time.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is pretty good but I also think it's somewhat overrated. I did not think it was good as some people claim it to be. I'm sure this was a masterpiece in 1977 but in today's day and age in film making, this is just an ordinary science fiction movie. This movie is better than the first prequel though.This movie focuses on Luke and Leia and the rest of the rebellion as they try to defeat Darth Vader and the Empire. Also Luke and Obi-Wan befriends the cocky Han Solo, the navigator of the Millennium Falcon.The acting is pretty good. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were solid. Of course I recognized the voice of James Earl Jones. Sir Alec Guinness is on par with Ewan McGregor from the prequels.The droids once again provided some humor. The special effects were not that good compared to the standards of today. I loved the themes by John Williams.Overall, this is a pretty good movie though not the best in the Star Wars series. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a good story and cool effects, but it's soooooooooooo violent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the various characters to be quite entertaining and the mythological allusions to be very fitting. War is always entertaining and war in space, with the grand glorious backdrop of infinite stars can only be spectacular. It was so profound an experience for my adolescent mind in 1977 that I wanted it to be real. I wanted to live in this majestic universe of black and white choices and absolute power. I am still recovering from the profound impression it had on me, 33 years ago. Arrested development is an understatement.Many millions of words have been written about this film series but few of them deal with the morality of war; the fact that killing - no matter how inventive the device with which you execute someone - is probably a mistake. It seems that violent death is a deeply cherished aspect of our culture, a defining element in fact. Even the treacly adorable Ewoks have their heads and arms and torsos mangled as payment for their appearance in the series. Seems like a raw deal to me... Anyway, if destroying living beings is something to be celebrated, then Star Wars is a Fabulous F?te. Magnificent Mayhem. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Gave Sci-Fi Fantasy Films A Makeover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer &amp; director George Lucas didn't invent science fiction as a film genre, but his landmark film "Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope" and its sequels and spin-offs certainly propelled science-fiction from the fringe to A-class productions. What made "Star Wars" so charismatic is the hokum that it embraces with such consummate love. Lucas has attributed his inspiration for the "Star Wars" franchise to his memories of Saturday matinée serial cliffhangers as well as his fascination with mythology. Mind you, nothing in the "Star Wars" franchise is remotely original except for its reliance on hoary clichés and conventions that fuel the 'space-as-an-adventure' formula with exotic worlds, lethal aliens, and ravishing damsels-in-distress. Basically, Luke Skywalker is another embodiment of "Flash Gordon" and Darth Vader is a riff on Ming the Merciless. Harrison Ford's Han Solo may be an outer space smuggler in a fast ship, but he resembles an old frontier western gunslinger for hire to the highest bidder. Alec Guinness is the older gunman/samurai warrior with a strange mind-set that enables him to control weaker minds. Robots and droids emerge as memorable characters, too. Surely, Darth Vader with his long flowing black robes, respirator breathing vocal deliver, and unmistakably Nazi-style helmet qualifies as one of the top twenty all-time evil villains. Lucas contrives weird aliens and animals and populates his film with a number of visually interesting settings. The Death Star as the ultimate weapon is really cool and presents the ultimate challenge to our heroes because they must destroy it. Essentially, the Death Star is comparable to the eponymous "Guns of Navarone." There is a lot of sophistication wrapped up in this seemingly superficial saga about a galactic rebellion against tyranny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every generation is touched by great films that can later evoke fond memories. Hopefully they also hold up really well by the time we're adults so we're still able to enjoy them and want to share them with our children. For me it's films like 'The Goonies,' 'Labyrinth,' and 'E.T.' When my generation's parents were young it was ones like 'Star Wars,' which is one of the most beloved and influential films in cinema history. They introduced us to these films so that we could know the pleasure of experiencing them. Some films, despite the time they came out, are timeless and never seem to date or at least not so much as to tarnish the film. George Lucas's first 'Star Wars' film is one of these.Pros: Excellent performances from a cast of then unknowns and seasoned veterans. Fantastic and fun script. Exciting and memorable score. Impressive production and ship designs. Fast-paced. Make-up and special effects that have aged beautifully. Neat creatures, unlike anything seen before. Plenty of exciting and unforgettable sequences. Obviously made with a lot of heart. Great cinematography.Cons: Some dated visuals.Final thoughts: What some thought was a failure waiting to happen, turned out to be one of the greatest movie going experiences ever. And the film hasn't and isn't likely to ever lose it's magic. In a day and age when so many epic scale films are made with little to no heart it's so nice to go back and watch ones that were.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Hope - for the movie industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a landmark movie made by an independently minded film maker that ultimately created a blueprint for studio driven, manufactured summer blockbusters.However, very, very few subsequent blockbusters have come close to this. Thirty years on, it is still fresh, and the digital extras and clean up in the special edition work very well. Populist films nowadays do move at a relatively faster pace, but if you are willing to be just a touch patient and absorb the story it's a superb combination of fantasy, mythology and sci-fi, with a thrilling and absorbing climax.Performances are not really the point of this film, but Lucas's penchant for naturalistic acting seen in both THX and American Graffiti is very much present. The young cast works well, with the sparring between Harrison Ford and a young Carrie Fisher particularly notable. In fact Harrison Ford's roguish character plays off very well with all the characters he interacts with. Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing both bring gravitas to their roles and add contrast to the younger actors with a subtly more theatrical style to their performances. James Earl Jones's vocal performance is excellent and really makes Darth Vader work.Lucas's style of directing, which meshes classical composition with a more reality based European verite style of film making, actually works very well and gave the film a freshness when it was first released, supported by Gilbert Taylor's gritty photography . Even now, with some effective digital embellishments, it holds up against today's releases remarkably well. This was helped by the tremendous design work by production designer John Barry, mechanical effects maestro John Stears, and customer designer John Mollo, the former two being Bond movie veterans of the time. This was of course based upon Lucas's fantastic imagination. Lucas's nascent visual effects outfit, ILM produced ground breaking work that was brilliantly edited into the film by Lucas and his editorial team of Richard Chew, Paul Hirsch and some part time help from his wife at the time, Marcia Lucas. They got the right balance of real location footage with excellent production design with miniature optical effects. While the added digital effects are noticeable, (though some blend with the film flawlessly) their modest number added allows the film to maintain this reality based quality, something that the subsequent prequels lost sight of to some extent.Deservingly the film won 7 Oscars, for Art Direction John Barry and his Art Directors Les Dilley , Norman Reynolds and Roger Christian, the former 2 went on to be outstanding production designers in their own right, the latter becoming a film director as well.The landmark visual effects and special effects artists contribution was led by John Dykstra, who was the overall supervisor. He went to work on many more films including Star Trek ? The Motion Picture, 2 Batman films (the Joel Schumacher directed ones), and 2 Spiderman films, winning his second Oscar for his work on Spiderman 2. John Stears won an Oscar for his on-set effects. Richard Edlund was the main effects cameraman, and would go on and win 3 more Oscars for his work on Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Return of the Jedi while at ILM and would later run his own effects studio. Grant McCune, a miniature specialist, also runs his own effects company. Robert Blalack won for his optical compositing work and would go on to win an Emmy Award for his work on the famous TV movie The Day After.Building on Lucas's pioneering sound design work on THX 1138, the sound effects team contributed fantastic work in giving this film a reality based feel, with the use of real life sounds. The sound team was Don McDougall, Ray West (who would go on to win 2 Emmy awards for his sound work), Bob Minkler and Derek Ball. Ben Burtt won a special technical achievement award for his sound effects work and would go on to be a regular contributor on many high profile films, winning Academy awards for his sound work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.However, for me the stalwart technical contribution has to come from film composer John Williams, with a truly landmark, Oscar winning score ? it was his third Oscar at the time and for me has gone on to produce a magnificent body of film score work ? present day included. The subsequent Star Wars prequel certainly owed a lot to him, as his magnificent work on these films went a long way to hiding some significant flaws that were largely absent from the original trilogy.Finally, huge credit has to go to Mr Lucas for having the imagination to put this together, and the tenacity to see the production through to completion despite many challenges, which included: a storm which damaged sets and held up shooting on location in Tunisia; some of the actors and film crew sceptical of what they were working on; some difficulties with the camera crew; a cynical studio; a rush to finish the film be a rigid deadline and challenges with getting ILM to finish the visual effects. While I know that the experience meant that Lucas stayed away from directing for some twenty years, he nevertheless became a hugely successful figure in Hollywood as post production guru and pioneer of digital technology, yet maintaining his independence outside of the studio system.A landmark achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but Undeniably Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is an undeniably great film. It, perhaps more than any other movie before or since, truly defined the word "epic". What do we mean by "epic"? We mean engrossing, inviting, and just plain real. Action movies nowadays never seem to be possible. They just seem to show technologies advances and provide us with plain eye-candy. Star Wars doesn't have that edge. Its special effects has stood the test of time, but it doesn't grip us anymore with the same effect it used to. And its other elements: its acting, its screenplay, its plot, are all rather ordinary. Sure, you may wish it was the most perfect a film could get. You may wish that it had the pure awe-inspiring qualities of the undeniably great films such as Citizen Kane and Casablanca. It's not. That improves it, oddly enough. It brings it down to our level, makes us enjoy with for the sheer fun and joy it inspires in us. To try to improve the flaws would ruin the entire film. So what if the acting isn't sheer nirvana (though that is debatable), its characters are so endearing. So what if the screenplay is average, the story is timeless. So what if the action isn't the crash-bang of today's action films, it just gives it such a classic atmosphere. We love it for its flaws. We love it for the sheer impact it had on the film industry. We love it because it just appeals to us, the audience, and because it gives us a hell of a fun ride on the way. Why is it so great? It just is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a long time ago when I first saw Star Wars, I watched it as part of the trilogy in the early eighties, on TV and then as Lucas' CGI altered edits.There's not much I can add that isn't already littered on the, internet, countless books and so on. It has become ingrained in popular culture and it is impossible for me to watch it with fresh eyes. It was great to see my son watch it for the first time and no doubt his children will enjoy it too.The story is that dreamer Luke Skywalker must try to save Princess Leia from the evil clutches of Darth Vader. It could have been an awful b-movie but its strength is a great bold script, memorial characters, fantastic effects, costumes and John Williams timeless orchestral score. It has a princess, lasers, alien creatures, spaceships, and more. It's a good old fashioned tale of good versus evil and there really isn't much not to like.It has inspired filmmakers and has been parodied, imitated in numerous films, books and games. It has changed the way Sci-fi is made and will remain a timeless charming classic.If you only ever see five films in your lifetime, this is one of them.</fullReview>

Everything about it, the characters, the special effects, the cinematography - everything about it is spot-on. The world George Lucas has created with Star Wars has become engraved into modern pop culture in such a way that no other film ever has, and in the process, reaffirmed the fact that Lucas is truly a legendary filmmaker - a master of his medium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood is rich in mismatched buddy acts, and none more so than the Laurel and Hardy of cybernetics, C-3PO and R2-D2: one short and stout, the other tall and, to all intents, 'English'. Being a protocol droid, or butler, and butlers being stereotypically British, it was probably inevitable that C-3PO should be camper than a rowe of tents. There's no getting around this. Threepio is quite, quite gay. And considering their odd relationship, R2 - the Swiss Army knife of droids - is fiercely loyal. R2 could mosey along fine without old Goldenrod, who usually depends on others, including his gutsier companion, to get him out of scrapes.American in origin they may be, but there's nevertheless something innately English about their set up. C-3PO and R2-D2 resemble the barflies you often see down your local, supping side by side. Wildly different, yet thrown together by circumstance. And perhaps some strange, subconscious need to flesh out buried aspects of themselves. The first, neurotic, fussy, camp, forever wittering on about that pain in his diodes - the other, blokey, grizzled, occasionally grunting in agreement or dissent. There's an odd mutual respect. R2 might take the mickey out of the silly old dear, but if anyone else tried it on, they'd have to deal with him first. And don't you bleeping well know it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that changed everything...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several ways to look at this film. One is "I'm 40 years old" and it reminds me of my youth, the days before all the super crazy CGI and all the rip offs of this film and can remember a time when there was really nothing great out then as far as Sci-Fi was concerned (just look at Logan's Run today). The other is "I'm 20 years old" and have no conception of the history of film making and have to give SW a one star rating because the effects are old or I'm just jealous that my generation does not have a film event like this and probably never will. Younger people need to realize that in 1977 there were no computers, video stores, big screen TV's, DVD's or bluray. Heck there was barely video games (were talking Pong) or VCR's and cable TV was in it's infancy. This is why kids went to see it multiple times because in 1977 movies were the big thing and we had few other ways of feeding our need for cool stuff like SW. That and the fact that the film created a new very believable world that was a great escape from the bad taste of Watergate and Vietnam, both of which were still very much in the news.I happen to fall in the 1st category I spoke of having been 10 when SW came out. I have never been a super huge fan of anything like SW or ST although I can appreciate them a lot and have seen them all but I won't be going to conventions any time soon.That said, this still has to be one of the most entertaining films ever made, it has everything you would want in a Saturday matinée cliffhanger which was what it was based on. Iconic characters, great music and action and for it's time some of the best special effects ever made. DO NOT watch the horrible redos by Lucas where he added unnecessary effects and totally ruined the feel of the film. I loved ROTJ but this one will forever be my favorite of the series.</fullReview>

Although it has its problems, I love this film.The cast is pretty good with old pros Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing the stand-outs while Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford play the very opposite but steadfast friends Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. I also must give special credit to my favorite actress, the spunky Carrie Fisher, giving one of her best performances as the so-called "damsel in distress" Princess Leia. They all drive this story home.The film is not without its flaws. The pace is fairly slow and some of the action scenes are surprisingly dull with the exception of the Death Star climax which is a knock-out.All in all, this is one of the best and will likely inspire audiences and filmmakers alike forevermore.</fullReview>

Episode II was great in some scenes; the ending is awesome. But it had a poorly illustrated love affair which detracted a lot from the film. Not really George Lucas's area. Oh well, he did fantastic with the first three. Episode III was kind of depressing, good action scenes though. If you are reading this and have not seen this great movie what are you waiting for?!

		<shortDescription>the great cinematic appropriation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on the 1973 SF book by British SF writer Edmund Cooper called The Cloud Walker, Star Wars stands out as the movie with the most appropriations from SF novels in the history of film. It's not that it's a bad movie, quite the contrary, it is a great film, and it should be, the film maker borrowed ideas from about 50 different SF writers. Anyway, there is some very good visual work based on some very good conceptual SF artwork. Personally, I never liked the sound the Wookie kept making in the film-I think since it was done about 50 times, and I didn't care much for CV3PO and I thought R2D2 needed some work to be more than just a talking garbage can, just like Hewy and Dewy from Bruce Dern's SF film Silent Running made in the early 1970s-yet another appropriation, that time from an earlier American SF film no less. If I was George Lucas I would feel a very embarrassed to have used so much of other peoples work to complete a 'masterpiece.'Not recognized to have spawned mediocre television SF show Battlestar Galactica in 1978-despite the repetition of key word 'Battlestar'. I guess one rip off deserved another. I gave it a seven because I liked it when I saw it as a young person, but in truth it probably deserves only a one for its high number of appropriations, and its coy character names that are really nothing more than cheap sex jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is nothing short of breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot recall when I saw this film for the first time but what I do remember is how captivated I was by it. I had not seen anything like it before even though I had seen most of the original Star Trek episodes. This film set the standard which other films had to try and equal, emulate and improve on and from what I have seen of the films that have been made since very few come close for the overall effect this film had on me. For me Like all great films is has no flaws it is just nothing short of breathtaking. It is over thirty years since it was made and it could have been made last week. Technology has moved on apace from 1977 but this film is more than just a series of special effects and good acting. The story is told in only two hours a fact which still amazes me when I watch it again. I know there are people out there who don't like films set in space but I suspect if you give it a chance like a friend of mine did and watch it all you may well have a change of heart as she did. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is where it all began...the saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Star Wars movie is simply a revolutionary Sci-Fi flick. It created the Star Wars universe and expanded our imagination. The battle between the evil Empire and the Rebel Alliance is an iconic example of Good. vs. Evil.It introduced new actors, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and even Harrison Ford, and propelled them into their movie careers. George Lucas, the creator of the saga, spent several years on writing and then making the movie. His efforts were not in vain.A very important part of the movie is the energy that exists throughout the universe - the Force, and the ones who know how to use it - the Jedi.The antagonist, Darth Vader, became one of the most well known villains in cinema history. And how could he not have become,with such a voice, such attitude and frightening appearance.A New Hope has special effects that were amazing at that time, great action scenes, a good plot and terrific actors. Even though this is episode 4 (despite it actually being the first movie), any newcomer to the series should start with this one. It is a spectacular experience.Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dad saw Star Wars back in '77 and remembered it pretty well. He introduced me to the wonderful world of Star Wars, narrating to me parts of the story. Unfortunately he forgot one scene was pivotal and gave it away (spoiling the movie, but I was a kid back then so I didn't care). Sometime around 1997 ( I was eight), it was re-released in theaters and my dad had a chance to show me the masterpiece he had seen a couple of decades ago. Just like any good father would do, he brought me to the theater to watch the first of the epic trilogy. It was an unforgettable experience, especially when KFC was promoting the movie through their "Chuckie" meals. Wow and yum.I couldn't really describe how I felt back then except being excited and free from anything unpleasant (I'm an escapist).I've seen a lot of good movies and occasionally, I got hooked into them but when I got back to my senses, I always go back to Star Wars. Star Wars has helped shape my view on movies.I'm not going to be dramatically cliché and say that this is "more than a movie". I'm gonna go with Star Wars having a great impact on my childhood and the culture, which it really did. That was still cliché wasn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I began watching all the Star Wars movies again. I decided to begin with this one and go 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3. About 30 minutes into this movie I decided I needed to stop and post a comment about how amazing this movie is.First off, for this movie being over 30 years old, boy has it become timeless. The special effects, although fall short in comparison to 1, 2, and 3 are absolutely amazing for its time and don't even seem bad by today's standards.Secondly, the the plot. The complexity is overwhelming. I first saw these Star Wars movies before the prequel trilogy came into existence, and most of the dialogue and such went over my head. As I was watching the movie again I began to realize the incredible amount of detail put into the plot. IT ALL FITS. Nothing overlaps or contradicts itself- the talk of the "old republic," the "clone wars" etc is all referenced in this first movie. This amount of detail is amazing for this being the first movie- it's like the first three movies had already been made and they were just continuing the storyline. I just found it so amazing that they were able to make all these connections to movies that they would make 30 years later- and have it ALL fit together.If you have never seen any of these movies...watch them right now. And then watch them again. And again. They will never get old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, I'm a Star Wars geek so my opinion is jaded, but when I'm asked "what is your favorite movie of all time" there is no hesitation.. STAR WARS !!! The original. None of this "New Hope" or Han Solo shoots first, Boba Fett with Jabba in hanger deal. I'm talking the original 1977 release with all the bad editing, Han blasting Greedo before he can finish his sentence, and just choppy filming. It's great... will always be great.There may have been some better later on (The Empire Strikes Back) but nothing compares to the original in terms of WOW factor. For me, I have watched Star Wars maybe 400 times, Empire about 200... the rest only a handful. Star Wars is the only movie I can see whenever I flip the remote and happen come on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Start To Something Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars (A New Hope) was the first Star Wars film ever made. It is truly a great film and does a great job laying the foundation for future Star Wars Films.Princess Leia has hidden tapes that display plans to the Empires ultimate Weopon, the Death Star. She is captured by Darth Vader but manages to get the tapes into R2D2 and he escapes to the planet Tatooine. There he is bought by Luke Skywalker who learns about Leia being captured after meeting up with Obi Wan Kenobi, whom Princess Leia had hoped R2 would run into. Luke decides to go with Obi Wan to rescue the Princess. In Mos Eisley's spaceport they hire a vessel consisting of Han Solo and Chewbacca and thus begin on an adventure that will change all of their lives.This is a great start to the Star Wars franchise. Star Wars does a great job of introducing all of the characters that are so important to the Star Wars films. Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and Han Solo. They all are great. Also it establishes the main conflict of the film right off the get go. Because of how great they do of establishing characters and conflict it allowed the sequels to succeed as well and further continue from this film.Also the story is awesome in this film. Luke Skywalker, a farmer, becoming a jedi knight and going on an adventure to help rescue the princess. This is a great story about how someone who thought they were nothing becomes something that is truly needed.The action is legendary. There is plenty of laser fire in this film and who could forget the epic attack of the death star towards the end of this film. Films like this show that you do not need constant action through the whole film at every part. There is great setting up of events prior to much of the action taking place. This helps establish the conflict and allows for the audience to understand the situation and why the action must take place.Music is awesome as well. Star Wars always had the best music of any film. However Star Wars does not have nearly as good of Music as "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". Or even as good of music as was in the three new Star Wars films.A few minor complaints can be attributed to the films budget probably. I do not think that Darth Vader looks nearly as good as he does in the other films. Do not get me wrong though he is great though, just not as cool looking as in the other films. Also at times the blasting back and forth causes problems visually but nothing major.A great start to something great. A legendary film that helped spawn the greatest movie series ever. Highly recommended and it will leave you wanting to see the sequels as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The patriarch of Science Fiction space masterpieces...begins the greatest series of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know when I first saw Star Wars but I know I never tire of seeing it again and again. I usually hate reviewing films that have this aura of absolute majesty around them with a fan base that is insane!! But I have no worries reviewing this and the subsequent sequels because this is one of my favorite movie series of all times. I am not a HUGE sci-fi fan but this film can appeal to every genre watcher in the world. Star Wars was so simply made, and carefully crafted, and gingerly put together by a man who had such deep passion for the story and everything he built from the ground up. The "special effects" they used, the story, the characters, everything about it is the definition of timeless because it is as good now as it was more than three decades ago. The characters come to life, each and every one of them and the story leaves you riveted to every moment and throws this mysterious force of good against one of, if not thee, greatest villain in movie history. The film, I believe, has this deeper meaning, something that could actually be translated into modern day religion of belief systems and created one of the greatest pop culture references in the world.Who to start with in this cast...Mark Hamill IS Luke Skywalker. Now I will say openly Hamill is not a great actor. In fact his performance as Skywalker in the first film is a little cheesy and weak and even amateur. And yet still you become enamored with the young, naive Skywalker. Harrison Ford became a star and for good reason playing Space adventurer Han Solo. Ford exudes confidence and snide sarcasm and is the perfect hero. He has always been one of my favorite characters and subsequently one of my favorite actors. Carrie Fisher creates one of the greatest female heroines in film history. Her portrayal of sexy feisty Princess Leia is timeless. She is strong willed, and just as tough as the other male heroes but still exudes this terrific feminine sexy character. Her and Solo and their banter are fantastic. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew are just brilliant as their respective sidekick roles as C-3P0, R2D2, and Chewbacca. Baker and Mayhew do have a single English line in the film and create these lovable fantastic character and Daniels is a master at the comedy, sarcasm, and scared C3P0. The three of them become like a fantastic trio that is a must have in the film. David Prowse and James Earl Jones (as the infamous voice) play the evil Darth Vader. Vader doesn't really come full circle evil in this film but he is still one of the best villains in film history. This is only a small dip into Vader's character.George Lucas, the master and leader of all modern day nerds geeks and sci-fi lovers created this film with every ounce of his being. His labor of love shows through because the film is so delicately constructed. Even though the first film is not even the most epic, it has this feel of being so much bigger than what anyone could have dreamed. We know now what Star Wars and the world around it is all about but in 1977 this was all new and just the timeless, magic, immense feeling makes it all worth while. If there is any living person left who hasn't experienced Star Wars then you are missing out. It doesn't matter what your film likes or dislikes are...there is something for everyone in this film and there will inevitably be a character you fall in love with!! If only I could experience the film again in a theater. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas' achievements as a director, writer, and visionary will be discussed for generations to come. Had he never released another film, his place in history was made with this film.A sweeping, epic story where good is good, evil is evil, and things are exactly as they seem. A story made up of memorable characters, quotable quotes, and a thunderous musical score. A story born of the most basic elements of story telling, and masterfully weaved together. Visual effects that changed movie making and audience expectations forever.Beyond question, the most important movie of the 1970s, and still a lot of fun in the 2000s.</fullReview>

In one battle one droid called R2-D2 is sent on a secret mission with the stolen plans of the Death Star. With his friend C3-PO they escape the battle and go to the planet Tatooine. They then meet Luke Skywalker and little does Luke know that his life will change for ever.I found this film very entertaining and I think it always will be. George Lucas must have a big imagination to have been able to put this film together. I think that this film is an all time classic and is one of the best films in the world and the Star Wars saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's obvious why this movie was so big at the time it was released and is still popular nowadays. What I liked the most about this film was lots of colorful characters. Actually Star Wars is like a mix of all sorts of movies like westerns, war or samurai movies (I know it's funny but Jabba kinda reminded me of Vito Corleone from Gotfather). The special effects were so realistic that even most of the nowadays Sci-Fi movies haven't overcome it. The action was good, though those sword fights were a little to slow and even looked funny sometimes, but the shoot-out scenes and chase scenes were very impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest blockbuster ever and Best of 1977</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why Academy Don't Give it Pest Picture of 1977 This is a very great movie, its got everything: action, love, humor, it is really a top-point movie I recently purchased this movie and decided to watch it again yesterday and was once again hit with realisation that this movie, even though it is lacking in special effects and gimmicks, is excellent I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint.Overall, Star wars is a remarkable example of screen entertainment; it has the proper sweep of a real space opera, it has confidence, imagination, beauty, humour, excitement and a truly brilliant story. It may very well be the best blockbuster movie of all time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still recall the feelings I experienced when I saw this movie for the first time. The opening title sequence grabbed my attention. When the text began scrolling across the screen, I remembered how a number of older films used that technique to explain the setting and the situation at the beginning of the movie. But, this was very different. The older movies had the words moving slowly and evenly from the bottom of the screen to the top. This film moved the words from front to back, using perspective to make it appear that they were disappearing into space, like a space ship flying away. The opening scene appeared to be earth, but I soon realized that there were two suns, not one. Then, I heard laser firing sounds and a large spaceship came across the screen. I thought that was really cool. But, following that ship was another that dwarfed the first one. In fact, the second one completely filled the screen as it moved past. I was in awe, along with the rest of the audience. From that moment on, I was hooked.This film set new standards for special effects in movies and for making a science fiction movie fun and interesting. It was the first movie I saw with Harrison Ford in a major role, and he became a favorite of mine. Using James Earl Jones for Darth Vader's voice was a stroke of genius.I still get great enjoyment out of watching this film, as well as great emotional memories. I will watch it often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one that saw Star Wars when it first came out in the theater will ever forget the opening credits and the low flying Imperial Cruiser that roars over the audiences head at the beginning of a film that would set an unprecedented benchmark for sci-fi. George Lucas took his space/action film to a place above all others at the time, without benefit of CGI technology, overpriced actors, and DVD sales to count on. He did it with the most simple of ideas - good guys defeat bad guys; he did it with humor; he did it with feeling; he did it with excitement and fun. A film with no gore, no sex, no swearing and it made more money than any other film in history at the time. You'd think other film companies would get a clue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It captured our imaginations, then our hearts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may have been a long time ago and in a galaxy far, far away, but "Star Wars" became an instant classic by feeling so close to home, so human, despite that. In all the intricacies of its universe that fans and not fans everywhere can indulge in to whatever level they choose, it's really the basic story, the longing for adventure and the never-ending quest to discover one's destiny that makes "Star Wars" more than just the first real intergalactic science fiction film.Of course it all starts with the science-fiction. We are captivated by the world that creator George Lucas begins forming around us as the film progresses and we are instantly curious about all the lore that surrounds it. From the origin of the mysterious Darth Vader, lord of the Galactic Empire, to the stories of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Clone Wars, there is so much we want to know about. In addition, the special effects, stylized space crafts, lavish costumes, and excessive rubber that make up for a galaxy's worth of creatures all expand our imagination beyond what we thought was possible.Most importantly, we see it all through the eyes of a naive, baby- faced farmboy named Luke Skywalker, a soon-to-be hero in the making, a boy ready to be whisked into a world that we all wish we could be whisked into. Luke is our access point to learning about this world that we are awed by but do not yet understand. It is his character and his journey that makes "Star Wars" universal, and not just in the intergalactic sense.Topping it all off is a score by John Williams that simply redefined the role of music in film. His various themes and variations help draw yet another bridge from the film to our emotions. Though what we see in "Star Wars" is foreign, what we hear is somewhat familiar and comforting in a way."A New Hope" is far from perfect, seeing as George Lucas can't write anything but plot-driven and emotionally bland dialogue, but the "Star Wars" universe and the colorful cast of characters he put in it is something so special that some of those generally elemental things can be excused for the sheer creative genius. While what truly makes "A New Hope" special are the films that follow it, the seeds of brilliance were planted and well-cared for.</fullReview>

I can still actually remember the first time i saw it, i was about seven and i was bored at one of my parents friends' houses. Noticing that i was, one of their much older children put this on for me he simply said "You will like this. Watch out for the star destroyer!" And i can tell you, the moment that small spaceship whizzes past you go wow! but then when that mass of grey foreboding blots out the entire screen, you are no longer in a living room of people you barely know. you are unaware of where you are and the only thing you can say is WOW! the world changes becomes a much larger and more interesting place.The best advice i can give you is every time you watch this film watch it with a clear mind and re live your childhood imagination in all its glory. Needless to say, i was no longer bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Science-Fiction Epic To Date...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This coming from a hardcore fan of fantasy, I must say that when it comes to certain films coming out in the top spot of a certain genre, Star Wars (Episode IV - A New Hope) is at the number two spot for me in science-fiction (behind, of course, The Empire Strikes Back).The acting is all slightly wooden. Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford, and James Earl Jones are the three with the best performances, and truly deserve any credit to making this film both serious for adults, and for a young audience.Industrial Light and Magic has actually made magic happen with the special-effects. While I'm disappointed by the numerous re-releases, and the add-ons that were introduced, the original stuff is a sight to behold.John Williams' score is without a doubt in my top-10 list of film scores. The few themes interweave to give an explosive and classic masterpiece.The story, and how George Lucas molded elements from other tales, is just incredible. There's so much symbolism from the various good-vs-evil stories, that the one of Star Wars is amazingly deep and rich.Overall, Star Wars deserves to be celebrated for its innovative technological advancements in film, to its ever-growing popularity amongst fans young and old. Simply put, it's the best science-fiction epic to date (though Empire is my favorite). Definitely see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always in my top five, "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope" is what sci-fi, action, and movies in general are all about. Even after two great sequels and three good prequels, this is still the best "Star Wars" film. I love the simple plot of this film that gets an entire saga going. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) needs help in her rebellion against the galactic empire and sends her droids R2-D2 and C-3P0 (probably the two best non-human characters in film history) to get Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to help her. Along the way, they become property of and friends of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Eventually they all meet up and begin their battle against the empire. I don't know if it's the greatness of the characters, the plot, or the visuals of this film that make it such a classic, but it is. I can't explain why, but it still tops all of the other "Star Wars" films for me. It's truly a perfect movie. The best film of 1977 (in my opinion) and one of the best films of all time. I doubt anyone reading this hasn't seen the film, but if you haven't, you're missing out on something wonderful.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie was re-released in theatres about 10 years ago I went to see it with my family and was disappointed. I definitely preferred the sequel The Empire Strikes Back. Star Wars (by which I mean Episode IV) seemed to lack energy in comparison. Recently I rented it, however, and my opinion of it has changed. This is a candidate for being the best movie in the series. I watched it three times. Although you wouldn't think you'd need to mature to appreciate an action movie, this is a smart movie and the action actually is good. It would probably be thrilling had I not known that the Death Star would be destroyed- just as it was about to destroy another planet! There are times, admittedly, where you can tell this is from the same guy (George Lucas) who wrote the appalling dialogue from Episodes I and II. Episode III was better because Lucas sought help. But Episode IV is mostly fine because Lucas keeps it simple and to the point. The biggest redundancy is a later addition; the new scene with Jabba the Hutt is awful. It adds no information to what we got with the scene with Greedo. But as this is an added scene, I won't hold that against the original movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas created the Star Wars universe and wrote the script from this first movie over the course of two and a half years - and as Hollywood's second Golden Age featured great directors as Steven Spielberg, Francis Coppola, William Friedkin and Martin Scorsese coming through the surface, Lucas created a cosmic Western, writing with the spirit of ancient mythology. And the movie's timeless appeal lies in its easily identifying universe - whether it's R2-D2 delivering signature beeps, Darth Vader oozing through his mask and Harrison Ford dressed up as a space-pirate it's so iconic that cinema would never be the same again after this enormous hit in '77. And it's epic, fairy-tale nature is combined with memorable characters and enchanting thrills. STAR WARS is a movie as important as anything, and well - we all know that by now.</fullReview>

I think this my favorite SW flick because it was the first Star Wars picture I ever saw. So it will always have very, very, very special place in my heart. I first saw this film in 2002, when I was 5 years old. I will never forget that day as long as I live. This is my 2nd favorite film of all time. Anyone who has never seen this must watch this film right now. It has unforgettable characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Darth Vader, and many more. Everything what a Sci-Fi film should be. It spawned countless spoofs, and flat out knock offs. 10 out of 10. Great movie. Almost everyone has seen this. If you have never heard of this, then where do you live, on a desert island? Because everyone has heard of this. I am so looking forward to Star Wars episode VII, VIII, and IX which will be released in the 2020s according to supershadow.com, I love this movie because I am a big fan of Sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that no other film in the history of cinema has profoundly changed the way we look at movies like Star Wars. Star Wars was the epitome of awesome innovative creation masterpiece film making wearing its most revered qualities oh so proudly on its sleeve. Inspired by adventure serials of years past, what makes it come together is sheer imagination and wonder of wildest dreams; enlightening that adventurous spirit and childhood joy experienced by millions who watched and experienced it for the first time. This film is like having the taste of a restaurant-quality delicious, mouth-watering steak and leaves you coming back for more. Lovable, memorable characters, terrific worlds, classic good vs evil, and marvelous adventure abound in one of the most beloved movies of all time. The first of its kind and one of the best. Nothing beats the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the absolute best sci-fi film ever made. I cannot believe its impact on the world of science fiction, and it is a stupendous testament to the power of one man's vision and his dream, no matter how many movie studios turn him down. I'll bet all of those movie studios are feeling REALLY sorry right about now, eh? And Fox is just laughing in their bathtubs of money and gold and Rupert Murdoch. George Lucas has created one of the greatest film epics of all time. Anyone who disagrees must be shot by both Han Solo and Greedo while being Jabba the Hutt's sex slave on lease by Emperor Palpatine. This movie is insanely awesome. May the force be with you....homes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most likable film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the over 400 movies that I have watched, I've never heard of one that was ever disliked by so few people despite being watched by so many. And yet, everything seemed to have conspired AGAINST it - George Lucas had to make it using his own money; it didn't have a popular series to be the movie version of, such as The Lord of the Rings; it was made with some of the leading roles being played by virtually unknown actors - and yet, it succeeded wildly beyond anything that anyone could possibly have imagined. It spawned 5 other episodes as well as many novels and comic books, canon and not, plus hundreds of action figures and other paraphernalia. From nothing, its heroes took their place among cult icons like Sherlock Holmes and James Bond. Audiences enjoyed it in 1977 and they enjoy it today.May the Force be with you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may of seen this movie 100 times over the past 10 years and to this day I still find it to be really mind-blowing. It's a movie that you can watch over and over again.It has everything you need for a classic movie: great characters:Darth Vader is my favourite villain of all time, he is down right evil. C3PO and R2D2 provide some humour. Music from John Williams is what makes it so good. Phenomenal special effects(keep in mind that this was made in the 70's,nobody had seen anything like that before)and has a fascinating story.This is not my favourite episode but it is still really brilliant and I give it 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hold on to your music as symphonic poetry will echo in your mind as this epic unravels. This is the first of a tri-cyclical trilogy: the first of three which ends in -The Return of the Jedi-. CH? You will love the score, the atmosphere and you will cry also with the story and situation: in a remote galaxy, an unbalanced force has intent to destroy the Empire. From the -Death Star- Darth Vader as President of Commands directs his people with the armies of a "Lady of Iron": the Troy-Horses used during the Middle Ages to contain revolt of masses and that were expanded to the public with what History have come to know up the Twetieth Century, chambers of torture: in one episode, Luke escapes with his armies -regal- from a compressor of junk! The cinematography is excellent yet close to the end of the movie when SS Luke is about to destroy the Star of Death and hears the voice of O.B. 1 murmur to him to trust his instincts that a choral voice-over interrupts the final act to announce: "We did it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can anyone say about Star Wars? It's amazing, well written, box office hit? Yes to all the above, but why? Because of the imagination behind it all. The spaceships, the robots, the light-sabers, Darth Vader...How can it not be awesome? Right now , you're thinking " Hey, he only gave it a nine. What's up?" I gave it a nine because though I personally loved the movie, others will hate it. Those will find it boring through most of the movie, because it doesn't have a person getting shot every two minutes...maybe every 15 minutes but not every 2. But for those who can enjoy it, this is one of the best movies in history, and you'd be a fool not to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is easily the biggest series of all time, no doubt about it. What started out as just a little story on a yellow legal pad revolutionized the globe and set off a new era in movie making.Star Wars starts out with the now world-known "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...", and that music that gets people all hyped up. The scroll, as in each Star Wars following film, details what has happened which provides the story of the film.The movie starts on a brilliant note, combining suspense, humor, and action. We meet Darth Vader, who is voiced to perfection by James Earl Jones, and he is definitely the model of any and all villains.However, I think the hype of this film is just a little too high. The first 20 or so minutes are absolutely perfect, and almost everything Darth Vader does is just spectacular (my favorite scene is when he Force-chokes a guy).But at times, the story does not become as memorable, such as the club scene (I personally found this scene just average.) And Mark Hamill is an over-the-top actor. But because he is surrounded by brilliant actors (Sir Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford), any unbelievability he provides is canceled out.The only other thing I didn't like was the space battle after the sword fight; I almost always turn it off when it starts because I find it very long and boring, and even though it is a key part of the story, I don't find the battle very excellent. This should've been placed simultaneously with Obi-Wan vs. Darth Vader, so more suspense would be added.Aside from that, the film is great. There's not much to say about the film that hasn't already been said. I think they could've included slight changes in the format of the film and cast a better actor for Luke Skywalker, but other than that, the film is everything you've heard it is; thrilling, spectacular, epic, a masterpiece, and the best of its time. 9.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of "Star Wars" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn't it? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise, never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully. The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6.0 rating. It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy, and your two best friends seem alright. Something to think about.Anyway, there's no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once, even my wife. My son, who was born in 1977, has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies, kind of a record in itself I would think, allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie. Such is the compelling nature of true Star Wars fans, who while watching, find themselves in a galaxy far, far away.</fullReview>

As a kid I watched this film so often (on our old Betamax video) that, like everyone, I could quote the whole script, word perfect. I have literally seen this film hundreds of times, and still get goosebumps when Luke switches off his targeting computer. I watched it again in honour of the 30th anniversary (the original theatrical cut on DVD, with, importantly, Greedo not getting a shot off!) and it was, as ever, great entertainment. Best film ever? No (for myriad reasons). Favourite film ever? Unquestionably!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The forces wit be with you, always"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Edited on 2/5/12- I might not have had the chance to experience this movie in 1977 like most of the fans did in the theater. However, when I first saw this movie I liked it a lot. Although, I was born in the late 80's, so, I had watched it on T.V. Despite the movie being on T.V., it kept my attention, until the very end. This movie had it all. Robots, spaceships, a Dark suited villain, lazier guns, swords that light up, and make noise, crafts that hover over land, Aliens, etc, etc. At that time, those where everything that I was into. And, the special effects at that time was suburb. So, I watched the whole movie and loved it all. "Star Wars," is a well written SCI-Fi film that had cool, and interesting Characters that you can relate to, or identify with. It takes you on a epic journey through space, inside spaceships, and on planets. An excellent film for anyone looking for good old fashioned entertainment. It is a film that you can watch time, and time again. The story is about a farm boy named Luke Skywalker. Luke, joins forces with a old Jedi night named Ben(Obi-Won)Kenobi. Luke and Ben hitch a space flight ride with Hon Solo, Chewbacca, the droids Artoon Detoo, and C-3PO, to rescue Princess Leia, from the evil clutches of The Galactic Empire. After rescuing Princess Leia, Luke joins the Rebellion, and helps them in their attach on The Empires weapon, The Death Star. Join Luke and his friends as they take on The Empire by watching the epic movie, that started the whole Star Wars Saga, "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope." And, remember, "The forces wit be with you, always".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my favourite out of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do find the plot hard to follow at times. I suppose what really matters is that the film is about good versus evil which most films have that theme running through them where two forces fight against one another and it is always good that triumphs as audiences prefer it that way so it is very much a moral tale.This film was totally different to the other Science Fiction films coming out at the time and before, the space scenes was grand scale and impressive, it didn't look tacky like the other films I had seen up to that point. It shows how hard George Lucas worked, to achieve special effects that in this day can be done with CGI but in the time the film came out, Lucas had to be very imaginative and be able to come up with new techniques to give the film the quality it has.I must admit, out of the trilogy, this is my least favourite. Don't ask me why but I just can't get into it like The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.I think the casting helps the film because the actors give a convincing performance and it is not easy with some of the dialogue they have to say.I like the fact Princess Leia is a feisty character who can pick up a gun and defend herself without needing to turn to a man to help her. It was also interesting to have a character like Han Solo who was cared more about what he could get out of the situation then how he could help people who needed him but at the end, we see there is a positive side to him because he comes to help Luke when he didn't have to. It was good to have such acting legends in the film, Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing. Vader is very sinister especially with James Earl Jones voicing him, he gives the character a menacing quality which wouldn't have worked without someone with a powerful voice to portray him.It is shocking when Guinness dies but it was a brilliant idea George Lucas had in keeping the character in the other films by bringing him back as a type of spirit.The music is amazing and just fits with the whole mood of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to ramble on about how good Star Wars is, it has reached a point now where mere words just cant do it justice. I just love it, it is like a drug, a few seconds with it and i'm somewhere else, it just makes your mind take flight, so on that level it is like a kind of intoxication. It forces you to imagine and wonder, like any well told story, it demands audience participation on some level. This kid in 1977 didn't stand a chance, after 2 hrs i was in for life, even though my Dad called it "daft". I love all of it, the films, YES all the films. Just cannot understand the whining about the prequels, all i could think of when watching them was "Yaaaay we're back in the Star Wars universe". The merchandise, all of it, to me it all boils down to 3 letters F U N.Its a shared experience, i saw the re-release in Manchester in 97 with my friends and about 300+ students, when the logo came up the screaming and shouting was deafening. When you consider that most of those students would have been just born or not even with us yet, on the films original run, it just shows how truly unique its lasting effect is.So heres to 30 years of Star Wars, thanks for all the F U N and heres to another 30. ( get cracking with those TV shows George !) Sorry i did ramble a bit, but hey ,how often does the 30th anniversary roll around, as Woody from Cheers would say "dont ask me, i'm not a fan!"</fullReview>

This movie is the most talked about space adventure of all time. It is one of the most groundbreaking sagas in Hollywood history. It didn't just change the way we look at movies. It changed the way movies are made. This movie is truly amazing. quote another member of IMDb when I say this, "A kid's fantasy. An adults memory." You can remember this movie for the rest of your lives. The special effects were great for back then and the score of John Williams for this movie is the best ever. This movie was the biggest box office bust back then of all time. This movie should have won all the awards it was nominated for. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that shook the world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of cinema has never been the same since George Lucas brought this film to the screen. It has had more impact on the world than any movie. It has become a living icon of story-telling to an entire generation and since it's release it has been the standard by which all epic blockbuster movies are measured.The original three films - most often referred to as the "original trilogy" - "Star Wars", "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" introduced us to a world - "far, far away" but it became the very human element that millions identified with through the classic myth motif. Its images and symbols have bridged across cultures, its characters become house-hold words. I will never forget the first time I saw the opening frame of the spaceships crossing the screen in the first film and I will never experience another moment in the theatre like I did when in ROTJ, one of cinema's most recognized villains gave up his lust for power, discarded his evil past and once again found compassion through the love of his son who refused to abandon faith in him, to sacrifice himself to save his son and the galaxy. When Vader picked up the Emperor and threw him to his doom to save Luke - the entire theatre that I was sitting in that day, erupted with applause - the sound was deafening and like I have never before since experienced. George Lucas has given the world of cinema a great gift with his ground-breaking special effects technology and has set free imaginations and inspired countless film-makers since. His company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) have broaden the scope of film-making to enormous heights, making nothing impossible to be seen on the screen; the boundaries, if any, are limited to only our imaginations.The Star Wars film saga may be over now, but it will live forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born long after this film came out, so I never got to see it in the theaters.This is one of those movies, that everyone has to see before they die. While the special effects by todays standards are very dated, they are still fun to watch. Basically the story is about a war between the Galatic Empire and the Rebel forces, who are trying to over throw the Empire.The acting is well done, and the script is done very well also. While yes this film has a lot of mistakes, they are easily overlooked as the film goes on.I would advised not seeing the 1997 remake, as I feel that wasn't a good choice for George Lucas to do by adding certain things in and thus sorta ruining the movie all together. The 2005 (or 2004 I don't quite remember) release was a small improvement, I would suggest finding a copy of the original which was released on DVD last year and watching that.Overall, this is a great movie to watch, and you have not lived life, until you have watched the original Star Wars Trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chivalric Romance in a New Setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years after the 1977 release of Star Wars, a science fiction fan who grew up in the 1940's and 1950's related to me an interesting observation upon his first viewing of this movie. He felt the scene in which a young and melancholy Luke Skywalker looks out upon the two suns from his home on a distant planet was a direct homage to the science fiction fans who essentially created interest in the genre from its beginnings in pulp novels, comic books, and Saturday matinée movies. When he saw this scene, he immediately decided that the filmmakers understood the spirit of science fiction and had made this movie for the hardcore science fiction fans. However, before its first release, rumors were spreading among studio execs that the 20th Century Fox Science Fiction epic called "Star Wars" by the director of American Graffiti would bankrupt the studio. Their reasoning: science fiction was only for a very select audience and not mainstream. What the studios did not recognize was that the young-adult crowd that made up much of the movie-going public were the same people that had been children in the 1940's and 1950's who grew up with the likes of comics, pulp novels, and Saturday matinees, much like the fan I had met. These were the first readers and viewers of such classics as Superman, Flash Gordon, the Lensmen, and Robert Heinlein. And these people came in droves and waited in long lines to see a new spin on what they had read and saw when they were children.Strangely, Star Wars was aimed at the same crowd that George Lucas appealed to in American Graffiti. However, instead of reminding his audience of their coming-of-age as 18-to-20-year-olds in 1959, he reminded them of the comic books they read and the movies they saw when they were between the ages of 8 and 14 in the 1940's and 1950's. Lucas had, in fact, updated the sophistication and reputation of the science fiction genre that had been marginalized, to some degree, in the 1950's. And it appealed to their children, a new younger audience who were not as aware of the earlier pulp and comic years of pop culture. Star Wars not only exceeded all expectation, but redefined science fiction as a marketable genre to larger audiences. In truth, Star Wars was a hit for a host of subtle reasons that have its roots in human mythology. Star Wars is essentially a chivalric romance of the Arthurian variety in a new setting. The entire trilogy is the coming-of-age of Luke Skywalker as a knight, much like Sir Gawain in the Arthurian legends. The themes that appear in Star Wars are some of the same themes that characterize countless myth tales, from the tales of Odysseus to the voyages of Sinbad.Here are a few of the different mythological subjects that appear in the original Star Wars movie: the cryptic message asking for help from a princess imprisoned by a black knight; the old but wise knight who befriends the novice and becomes his teacher and mentor; the black knight in the black castle; the mercenary who is met at a bar; the young knight who tries to save the princess and liberate her from the castle of the black knight.But instead of these subjects being literal, their forms are changed. The knights use light sabers instead of swords. A large space station that destroys planets is the black castle. Instead of horses, the knights and heroes fly in x-wing fighters. The mercenary's "ship" is a complex spaceship capable of going into light speed. And the kingdom being fought for is not a forest but a large expanse of space. The theme of "The Force", whose central idea is very Buddhist, hearkens back to earlier mythology in which God or the gods are present--not always seen but do influence the outcome.It may be that movie studio executives are the ones that finance and green-light certain films, however, thank God they are not the ones who decide which films capture audiences' imaginations. Part of the challenge of science fiction films is partially due to the name of the genre. "The Planet of the Apes" is also regarded as a science fiction film, but its theme and purpose is so different from "Star Wars" that it is like classifying "The Ten Commandments" and "Oh God!" as both being religious movies.The magic of "Star Wars" does not rely exclusively on its being a science fiction movie. Certainly, the new era of film effects helped its cause. Its characters also brought a higher level of complexity to the story, as well as comic relief. Simultaneously, it is about old sagas and myths being cast in a new updated landscape in which the story that has been told and re-told countless times for countless millennia appears new and fresh. This will still be Lucas' greatest triumph. Unfortunately, the third installment (part VI) and the prequel trilogy failed to capture the mythological magic of this first movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you look in the 1970s era of films, you will probably notice that the '70s were the golden age of movies. Just look--The Godfather (I &amp; II), One Flew Over The Cukoo's Nest, Chinatown, Alien, etc. And, of course, Star Wars.I wish that I was born in the seventies. That way I could experience the cultural shock and phenomenon that was Star Wars. Alas, I was not, so thank goodness for DVDs.Star Wars starts out in the middle of a six-part saga about, ultimately, defeating evil. This part, dubbed "Episode IV: A New Hope", focuses on a young man by the name of Luke Skywalker. He is a simple boy who works on a moisture farm on the planet of Tatooine. But when two droids being pursued by the Evil Empire take residence with Luke, he is swept off into an epic and spectacular journey across the Galaxy to defeat the Evil Empire.It is an amazing film that deals with a young man and his destiny. He does not want to go do the things that he is chosen to do, but the murder of his family by Imperial Troops forces (no pun intended) his hand.Made in 1977, the special effects are (or "were") breathtaking. Breathtaking, at least, for the time period and amount of resources available. Packed with excitement and emotion, it still stands the test of time, even today.So, in closing, I can't really find a word to use that can sum up my feelings for this film. I can't say "perfect" because nothing is flawless. But this movie comes very, VERY close.</fullReview>

I was born in 76 so I was a year old when Star Wars was released to theatres and had not seen A New Hope in theatres but watched Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in theatres and I was hooked. I have an extensive collection of Star Wars items and have been collecting ever since they have come out.It was great to see some of the most memorable characters Yoda, Palpatine, Fett, Han Solo and Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3PO and Luke Skywalker and Vader...Who could ever forget that breathing after you saw it for the first time oh it was AWESOME!!! The ships Slave I and an X-wing I wanted to fly those it was an awesome thing to be part of and I hope that generations to come are as entertained by Star Wars and its prequels as I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>by all means If you've never seen this movie, see it on the Betamax or Selectivision CED or Laserdisc formats first because George Lucas' subsequent remixes are awful and will really will ruin the experience for you.I'm fortunate enough to have the original Trilogy on Betamax cassette as well as having the modern DVD series. All I can say is Lucas got it right the first time. Every "new" sequence goes on too long and stops the story dead.No...Really...Lucas tries to justify the "new" material as being "what he wanted but couldn't afford or get" in 1977. Well, Stephen Spielberg wanted a whole lot more shark in his "Jaws" movie but circumstances (his mechanical fish didn't work too great) prevented that and Jaws was all the better for it. Sometimes you have to let serendipity work for you.The spectacular success of the 1977 print should be proof that you got it right the first time. At the least Lucas should've allowed us to chose between the original and remix since DVD technology allows such a choice.In the meantime I'm going to have to get around to dubbing my Betamax tapes to DVD so I can keep them on a more permanent format.And let me add - Han Solo shot first, dammit! &lt;- that was the spoiler...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but there are those films that come close.Seeing it now with the perspective of today's movie-making abilities, including CGI and advances in blue-screen techniques might make one wonder what it was all about. But seeing it through the eyes of a 12 year old in 1977 Star Wars beat absolutely everything I had seen up until that point, and the rolling update that has started each of the six episodes committed to film so far always bring back the sensation I remember having the first time I saw it.Combat in outer space, aliens of all shapes, and Meco's disco-fied version of the title theme - Mr Lucas has certainly let down his loyal fan base with the prequels, but those of us who were there at the beginning will forgive him that on the basis of how we felt back then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The revolution in film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars was the one film that changed movie making forever. This was not only because of the non-cheesy acting, which had never before been seen in a sci-fi. This movie had it all. THX sound, ILM SFX, incredible plot and the best all-together write i've ever seen, hands down.This movie revolutionized special effects, and high quality sound. Most movies today owe their success to the Star Wars films.I'd also have to say, this movie has the BEST SFX of any movie before it, and to-date. Not even the latest installments of Star Wars can compete. All modern movies look terrible, and I find it incredibly strange of people to say, "wow, those special effects are awesome, Scooby-doo looks so real!" Modern SFX are cheesier than those used in 1930. I remember my first time watching a movie with computer graphics. Everyone kept saying, "Look, you can't tell what's real and what's not." But I could, and it was obvious what was not real. Star Wars is so incredible, when I first watched it as a child, I asked my grandmother, "how did they fly those in space, and make those ships so big?" It's quite sad that a 1970's cereal beats todays movies.Overall, Star Wars is the epitome of film, and there will never be another film to challenge it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars episode four was an excellent movie. It had a lot of action in it. It did not have as much as the new trilogy did, but still, it had just the right amount of action. There were definitely a lot of good parts in this movie, and it was a great way to start out the Star Wars series. But still, how did it start out? You'll have to see it all in the new trilogy that George Lucas is coming out with. It won't be as good, but it will explain everything well. This episode actually had pretty good graphics. Outer Space actually looked like outer space. Also, if you like sci-fi movies (fantasy), then this is for you. It takes place millions of years ago in a different galaxy with advanced technology and a power known as the force that controls what happens. Well, that's about it. I would recommend this movie to anyone at all. I don't see how anyone could dislike this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best Star Wars movie out of the six. The original movie introduces the characters and the amazing storyline and it does it superbly. Although the lack of Yoda in this episode, it remains a classic. Ordinary Farm boy of Tatooine, 'Luke Skywalker' comes across two droids, C3-P0 and R2-D2, and a Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi, and finds out that his father, Anakin, was a Jedi and is thrust into the Rebellion with the Captain of the 'Millenium Falcon' Han Solo, Chewbacca the Wookie and Princess Leia. Together they give hope that the Rebellion can defeat the Evil Empire and The Sith Lord 'Darth Vader', who from What Luke has heard, killed his father and helped the Sith's rise to power, but we know different. If you're looking for a good film watch this for maximum entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure excellence. From the mind blowing battle scene at the start to the mind blowing space fight at the end. Star Wars is truly out of this world. If you want to see a film (not to analyse it), with believable characters and a plot that will grab you by the shirt from start to finish, Star Wars is for you.It has everything, Religion, the outsider, a young man trying to make his way in life and, obviously, the tremendous tyranny of Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire.The special effects of the time WERE mind blowing, that first scene when you grasp the sheer scale at which this film is trying to achieve, the effects of the massive Death Star, the special effects in the space battles. The visual effects of the aliens in the cantina and the Jawa Sand Crawler with the robots.This film was perfect for it's time and still holds relevance today, it defined a generation, the vision of George Lucas was spectacular, each scene was perfect.The special thing about Star Wars is that it's so tangible, the backgrounds with the people going about their day-to-day lives is believable, each time you watch it, you find something, see something new, that you missed previously. That is what makes it special.Star wars, in two words, is pure excellence.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Star Wars movie ever made, and the best one in the series by far. This movie introduced us to breakthrough special effects, amazing and interesting aliens, memorable characters, and an excellent story line. I remember watching it over and over again as a kid and just totally being amazed and captivated by this film. It truly makes one's imagination run wild. The battle scenes are exciting and get the viewer involved. The tension during the attack of the Death Star is so intense that you can almost cut it with a knife. To anyone who has, for whatever reason, never seen this movie, I suggest you pick up the trilogy and watch all three of them back to back. 10/10 for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Synopsis for beginners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a fictional galaxy consisting of many specifically-themed planets and alien lifeforms that are oppressed coldly by the Galactic Empire, a sinister administration ruled by an unseen Emperor and a towering supernatural agent cloaked in fearsome darkness and masked by a sharply crafted breathing apparatus that resonates harsh breathing sounds amid which his voice booms its ominous commands, but is still not without its heroes, 'Star Wars' is perhaps one of the finest accomplishments in film and technological history.This science fiction fantasy epic takes place in the middle of a Galactic civil war where a band of lifeforms rebelling against the unsympathising Galactic Empire have managed to attain holographic blueprints of the Empire's 'ultimate weapon', a vast spherical space station known as the DEATH STAR that generates enough power to destroy an entire planet with laser-weaponry. The Empire, believing, just as the rebels are, that the blueprints hold information on the weaknesses of the Death Star, which could be easily used against it and its sinister living counterparts, hunt down the rebels in order to prevent any threat against their 'ultimate weapon'. The cold-hearted and mechanical representative of the Empire for the assignment is the notorious Darth Vader who initially fails to attain the plans that are jettisoned, along with a comical duo of robots to a nearby desert planet called Tatooine, but who destroys the rebels except for a valuable Princess of the rebel planet, Alderraan whom he detains within the Death Star.The plans, however, are intercepted by a simple farmboy with great aspirations because of his father's legendary exploits as a Jedi knight (a member of a defeated society of peace-loving religious lifeforms that harness the mythical omnipotent being known as The Force to maintain peace throughout the galaxy, that was destroyed by the Galactic Empire driven by the evil clan of the Sith that harness The Force for self-gain). Upon reading a message from the captive Princess Leia, the simple farmboy Luke Skywalker meets up with a long-unseen surviving Jedi knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi (who was apparently a good friend of Luke's father), who each proceed to acquire the services of a cynical tough space pirate, Han Solo and his bear-like alien ship-mate Chewbacca to rescue her.During this period of realisation of the Empire's work and Luke's coming of age with the death of his sole guardians at the cold hands of the Empire, Princess Leia learns of the true power of the Death Star battle station as it obliterates an entire planet.Luke, Obi-Wan, the two robots, Han Solo and his companion Chewbacca are, during their mission, unwillingly lured into the Death Star and successfully attain the Princess, a transaction during which Obi-Wan is killed by his nemesis, Darth Vader, after which they triumphantly defeat a pursuing band of fighter-shuttles (TIEs) before joining the rebel army to mobilise against the Empire's 'ultimate weapon'.In an intense battle sequence, Luke Skywalker is contacted telepathically by the dead Obi-Wan's continuing spirit who inspires him to hit the target and destroy the dread Death Star with the in-the-nick-of-time help of the reluctant hero, Han Solo, despite which the evil Darth Vader manages to escape the debris.A classic piece of astonishingly colourful escapism that is supported by an eternally appealing cast of characters and a story ending with a feel-good resolution and a thrilling cliffhanger. Completely unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Space Adventure with Colorful Characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is filled with so much imagination. It is a child's fantasy of monsters and ghouls as well as princesses and knights. The characters are impressive from the Black Dark Knight, Darth Vader to the bear yelling Furry Chewbacca. It is a ride in space. The film lifts you along as if a long time ago this did happen.The film's edgy editing actually works for some reason. It is film about the dark side of life and the light side of life. Who will prevail? It will be an eternal war with those two.The images with C3PO and R2d2 in the desert were beautiful and felt far away in a land somewhere else. Then the black hooded dwarfs appear with their menacing red glowing eyes. Fun! Darth Vaders entrance is well captured.Carrie Fisher breaths life into Princess Leia. Harrison Ford is the fun free spirited captain of the fastest piece of junk in space. Mark Hamill plays Luke Skywalker with a natural boyish look of amazement. Alec Guiness is mystical as Obi Wan Kenobi. The Death Star is luminous.The story is a classic example of a Protagonist's journey. There is a quest and there is the journey to that quest with the obstacles in the way.The Empire Strikes Back takes the series to a whole new level and continues to dazzle the senses. The Return of The Jedi matures into a beautiful film ending the generational attachment.It's difficult to understand what happened to the latest Star War films. It's as if to say that we grew into one dimensional beings. Lucas should have went back to the technology used on the first films to shoot the latest trilogy. It would have had continuity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What has been difficult for me to understand is why someone would give Star Wars a 1 out of 10. For this and movies in general, why would someone give it a 1 and STILL say the words that it was good or even great in their reviews. The only reason they rate it a 1 so people can filter out the worst reviews, or they believe they have to give it a 1 because they believe it to be 'overrated'.If you really, really, hate this film (I mean on the level where you think Batman and Robin, Baby Geniuses 2, Glitter, Son of the Mask, or Leonard Part 6 are vastly superior films) then thats fine. But do would you really honestly think that those films are better or equal to Star Wars? I mean lets be honest, the majority of most regular Star Wars fans are embarrassed by the prototypical geeky hardcore fan. People DO take it too far, but that doesn't mean you have to hate the film itself. Its not Lucas's fault. Maybe it even goes to show how powerful a singular film can be.If you really hate this film and think it is the worst or one of the worst films out of hundreds of thousands EVER made then thats fine. But to think you are creating a certain backlash against a film's popularity and rate this film a 1 because YOU believe YOUR opinion is is SO much greater than anyone else then fine.Just do me and everyone else a favor. Watch some of the top 100 worst films on the IMDb. If you think any or all of those films are equal to Star Wars... Then OK, its fine to have an opinion thats different from everyone else.</fullReview>

This one truly begins to tell the story of Anakin and his eventual fall. 5. Clone Wars Vols I and II. These are must sees.6. Episode III. This is the fall of Anakin and the rise of the Empire. 7. Episode VI. The Redemption. Concludes the Skywalkers' story with a beautiful ending. This episode brings both trilogies together.

		<fullReview>Not only is this a unique Sci-fi Series, but it also changed the way movies are made. And it's one of the biggest Box Office hits at it's time.It has everything you'd find in an average Sci-fi film. including Robots, machines, aliens, different planets, advance technology, and cool looking spaceships.This is taken place in the middle of a war between this Rebel Group and the Empire(A communist/dictator like organization). Their Leader: Darth Vadar, who everyone fears throughout the Galaxy. The Rebels attend to defeat the Empire and restore peace to the Galaxy.Our story focuses on 2 Droids who travel to find a New Hope for the Rebel's struggle on winning the war. Till they find this young lad who might be the galaxy's key to peace and freedom....This movie has action, adventure, danger, and a grand cine max. The characters are memorable, this is unlike anything you'd experience from a movie. Star Wars: A New Hope is something to see again and again.And if you want to see what happened before this movie, you can always check out Star Wars Episodes 1,2 and 3. To know more about Darth Vadar's past.Anyways if you like Sci-fi, adventure, smart/strong women characters, funny droids, action, aliens, and cool technology then you'll love Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, by those words, one of the most adored and loved trilogy started. In my opinion it is the second best trilogy after the Lord Of The Rings trilogy of course. When Star Wars, was out in the theater's the movie world changed. Star Wars is one of the first movies to have good special effects, after Star Wars other movies with good special effects came out. Like Terminator and other movies.I think Episode IV is better then Episide V, other people say that Episode Vis the best of all the six movies, but i don't agree with that.***1/2(out of ****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments are twofold, so please bear with me while I discuss my viewpoints, both past and present.I think that from now on, with the advent of the newer STAR WARS prequels, this once 'sensational' groundbreaking film is destined to forever be relegated to a lower "STAR WARS ... PART 4" status. Although I was a kid of 15 back in 1977 when George Lucas' original film took the world by storm, I somehow was never as mesmerized by this science fiction classic as my friends seemed to be back in the day. At the time, I felt it was overrated and that it single handedly managed to change the comfortable horror and science fiction universe as I had always known it. I was a die-hard PLANET OF THE APES fan and collector in the '70s, but before long everything became STAR WARS, STAR WARS, STAR WARS -- and even my once-popular action figures of APES characters like Cornelius and Dr. Zaius bit the dust in favor of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Magazines like FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND transformed overnight in order to dedicate the content of all their new issues to this new phenomenon, cover to cover.Well, times have changed and I've finally come to really like the original STAR WARS film. It's odd that I didn't really appreciate it until I grew up, whereas the reverse is usually the case in most people's lives! But unlike so many very dedicated lifelong STAR WARS followers, I'm relatively a newer fan; and therefore I am viewing it from a somewhat different perspective. I have no qualms with the changes that George Lucas made, simply because I don't "know" the difference. I'm positive I would NOT have liked him tampering with my favorite childhood movie, but you have to understand that I wasn't a fan at the time of this original premiere. And since I have pretty much stepped into this later in the history, re-discovering this classic after having just watched Episodes I, II and III -- I can see why Lucas felt some desire to try and "match" the effects and "new-ness" of the current prequels.Of course, STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE introduces us to Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), the "elder" Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Together they set out to defeat the evil Empire headed by Grand Moff Tarkin (the great veteran Peter Cushing) and his villainous henchman, the ultimate bad guy - Darth Vader. The effects were out of this world (no joke intended) in 1977, but seem kind of dated when seen after the more recent prequels. But it's still a thrilling space ride from start to finish, with a great performance from Alec Guiness and some contrasting characterizations in Luke, Han and Leia. It's got a good plot, the strong central them of good against evil, and some delightful non-human side characters in personable droids R2D2 and C3P0, as well as that large and hirsute wookie, Chewbacca.STAR WARS is a great if not flawless movie, but it doesn't really need to be perfect, as it remains an exciting and satisfying experience. The only flaws I would note (aside from it feeling slightly outdated) would be that Hamill, Ford and Fisher don't seem to be that seasoned; all the same, it's their characters which are varied enough to keep us interested in them (the young and adventurous Luke, the selfish and greedy Han Solo, the feisty and bossy princess). Also, it's a little underwhelming to see the formerly ruthless Darth Vader now come off as more of a "Yes Man" to Cushing's leader. Quibbles aside, STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE (as I prefer to call it as a relative latecomer to this saga) remains a wonderful science fiction/fantasy, done in the spirit of the old 1930s serials and swashbucklers. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street might have had more to do with the making of this film than we know!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would never have seen this movie in a theater if a reporter for The Wall Street Journal hadn't personally approached me and insisted that I must see it because the wise men on Wall Street were convinced that it was the wave of the future. The advertising hadn't appealed to me nor did the ordinary word of mouth, which said that it was lightweight intellectually compared for instance to "Star Trek" (the television series) or "2001." I wasn't pleasantly surprised when I saw the film because I didn't think the kinetic gimmickry or elaborate production design were a reasonable substitute for the strong characters and emotional themes that I had come to expect from the great action and adventure TV serials. Also, I felt the acting and dialogue were both substandard, except in the case of the robot characters. Some have said that the approach George Lucas used was intentionally "camp," but these are the same people who think that "The Lone Ranger" is dated and only for kids. There's an art to making the audience sympathize with the characters in adventure tales, which seems to be way beyond the film maker's capabilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperishable, changes or no changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like millions of people, I've bought the DVD boxed set of the "original" trilogy (of course, these are the 1997 "Special Edition" versions, with additional modifications for the DVD set). I don't need to tell you that George Lucas' decision (for now) to issue only the updated versions on digital video has caused quite a stir.While I can understand the viewpoint of the purists who have clamored for the original cuts and are now incensed that these are not available on DVD, this longtime "Star Wars" fan thinks they're throwing the baby out with the bathwater by dwelling on the revisions Lucas has made."Star Wars," the first and lowest-budget of the 1977-83 trilogy, has been subjected to the most extensive cosmetic surgery, some of which enhances the movie (the more turbulent motions of the Rebel X-wings in the climactic battle, the restored exchange between Luke and his friend Biggs just before that battle), some of which detracts from the flow (the clumsily inserted confrontation between Han and Jabba the Hut--although Jabba himself looks more convincing than he did in the "Special Edition" release), and some which is neither here nor there (a CGI panorama of the desert outside Obi-Wan's home, the X-wings taking off from the base on Yavin in the foreground now rather than in the distance as they did in 1977). But to my mind, none of this detracts from the movie's essential appeal, or alters the story that it tells. Luke is still a callow farmboy who "take[s] [his] first step into a larger world," Darth Vader is still a (literally) towering figure of evil, John Williams' heraldic score remains that way, and so on.Lucas is not the first creator to revise his works after they've been seen by the public, and he won't be the last. Just to cite the DVD situation with three Steven Spielberg blockbusters that are roughly contemporary with the '77-'83 "Star Wars" trilogy: "Jaws" now has a new surround-sound mix with some cheesy sound effects that weren't in the '75 original, "E.T." got the "special edition" treatment with updated special effects (although the DVD also contains the original cut), and as far as I know, the version of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" that became a worldwide smash six months after "Star Wars" has never made it to home video in any format. What's on DVD now is a composite of at least three different cuts. Funny, but Spielberg hasn't been subjected to anywhere near the level of name-calling that Lucas has incurred.Nor should either filmmaker be raked over the coals for his post-release second thoughts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I shelled out the dough for the DVD versions of the original trilogy and wanted to comment on them. I'll stick to A New Hope, since that's the movie I'm reviewing. Overall, I love it. Looks great, and they really did a good job on making use of the 5.1 audio - spaceships flying from behind your head to the front, from side to side, etc; atmospheric sounds from all directions.Since, everyone mentions it, I'll also comment on the added scenes. They don't really bother me, it's just that they fall under the rule "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." I don't feel the additional scenes add anything important to the film. Did we really need to see the panoramic view of Tatooine? I was able to suspend my disbelief when I originally saw the film without that shot and believed Luke lived on a planet other than earth. Was the scene with Jabba necessary? Didn't add anything we didn't already know or learn in the later films. The extra creature shots for atmosphere. Okay, so they're nice, but, again, don't really add to the believability or the plot. Why put them in? To repeat, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it.". I know Lucas said that the way it is, is the way he envisioned it, but seeing as it was such a big hit, obviously lots of people were perfectly happy with it the way it was, which is why he should have just left it as is. Again, for the amount of time those extras last on screen, it doesn't really bother me. I just feel they were completely unnecessary and didn't add anything worthwhile to the story.If you're thinking of buying them, I say go for it even if you don't like the extra scenes (if you've seen them before on the VHS versions or on TV). The quality of the DVD transfer is awesome and you won't be disappointed with that aspect of the films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars IV DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this as a review of the new release of this film on DVD. By now most people know that Lucas has refined a few things other than what was done with the 97 Special Edition. I love this movie and I always have no matter in what form but I have got to say that Lucas has become a bit obsessive. The DVD changes in the next two episodes are much more apparent but I'm sticking to Episode IV for now. Its good the series is on DVD but the changes on this DVD are distracting and distance you from what you see on screen because they are so obviously added. Lucas has more shots of the surface of Yavin and Tatooine (to set the scene I guess) as well as changing the special effect for the Millennium Falcon jumping to hyper speed and seems to have shortened the explosion of the Death Star for the climax. Very Nip/Tuck but also quite obsessive. Perhaps Francis Coppola's modern views on his own works (Apocalypse Now Redux) have rubbed off on Lucas but I truly wonder what is the point to the new additions/changes on this particular movie. Change for the sake of change. It is his right to change his film around in anyway he may see fit the question however is why?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it remains a classic of its genre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars, despite the butchering of the film in the late 90s remains a classic example of what Hollywood does best....great entertainment.Although highly derivative of just about every fairytale and comic serial, the film is so well put together that once you are on board for the ride it doesn't matter.Lucas has a very grand vision and the visual effects, whilst not quite up to 21st century digital effects certainly are effective.This film ushered in the modern era of use of sound which had languished since the early days of stereo soundtracks in the 1950s.Who can deny the impact of the opening sequence, especially in the cinema, of the starship zooming over the audience. It is one of the most brilliant beginnings to a film ever.(Even if the film unions despised not having opening titles!)It is a pity that DVD release does not have the original versions of the Star Wars trilogy. The bastardised digital updates from the late 1990s are simply not as good. Sorry Mr Lucas you are wrong to think they are better. The few extra special effects don't work and are very obvious.The new Star Wars movies simply do not have the magic of this film and its companion originals. The overuse of digital effects and the annoying JarJar simply emphasise this.But Star Wars is THE original and it is a must have in any film buff collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why would they include him in the final shot as a ghost with Yoda and Ben... I know the last time we see Anakin will be as Hayden Christiansen...but wouldn't he still age into an old man as time goes on, and when he dies stay in his older man form, just as Ben does....or maybe they should replace Alec Guiness with Ewan (thats sarcastic, i don't think they should replace Alec with Ewan).... I really feel bad for the people who worked sohard to make the original movies the masterpieces they were and still are today... the constant digital updates the original trilogy receives continue to devalue them... its a shame, especially at a time when people yearn for the original series and their quailty more and more as the new prequels disappoint fans at every turn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like to rate movies based on hype or box office receipts, so I'll stick to the movie itself. In case you live under a rock, the movie is about a young man, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil), who becomes involved in a quest to become a Jedi knight and rescue Princess Lea who has been kidnapped by Darth Vader. Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) becomes his mentor and they employ Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick, Chewbaca (Peter Meyhew) to take them to Alderon. Along for the ride are two androids, C3PO and R2D2, to add comic relief. When they discover that Alderon has been destroyed, they find their way to the Death Star - an Imperial weapon capable of wiping out a whole planet in one blast - and, after rescuing Princess Lea, join in the battle to destroy the Death Star.The movie is very well done, with amazing special effects that still stand up quite well even today. There are very good spaceship battles reminicent of world war I dog fights, as well as sword fighting using light sabers ( the traditional weapon of the Jedi Knights ). The idea for the movie is quite original, combining sci-fi with tales of camelot and world war I fighter combat. The plot is engaging, if somewhat predictable and the acting is top notch considering most of the cast were unknowns at the time.It's one of those movies that doesn't show its age and continues to gain young fans who's PARENTS weren't even born when it was originally released.I'm glad to hear it will finally be available on DVD soon and I'll definitely be adding it to my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Note the first line...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... These words compose the first line of every StarWars movie. Why is this? I have done no case study or in depth research but in my deepest sense of self I feel these words create a parallel sense of being to that of the viewer. This is not us now, this is not us in a possible future. This is something that happened far from here and a long time ago and is told for our own future benefit. It relates to us in the same sense old tales of chivalry and legend do. Such myth comes along with many generations worth of real and useful meaning being woven into a story. Generally however, these stories are only loosely based on fact. They use stretched and exaggerated truth to get across their point. The first line of Star Wars relates it to this sort of story telling. It prepares us for the Space Fantasy that follows. For, you see, Star Wars isn't about Science fiction. It's about telling an epic story. The space setting is a trivial detail in this respect though it is this very setting that breathes new life in an old tradition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no such a movie that compares with this in it's genre. George Lucas should be proud of this film, which is more than could be said for his most recent movies. The older star wars films were better because the new ones just focus on special effects and computer generated monsters. The first installment in the star wars saga(a new hope) introduces us to the characters of Luke sky walker, darth vader and obi-wan canobi as well as the brutal empire and the heroic rebellion.the movie that began it all is one of the best films i have seen in this genre. I also enjoyed the empire strikes back and return of the jedi, but these did not compare with the original. It reminds us why we go to the movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Star Wars movies are something of a movie universe. But you already know that. They completely transport you to another place. And that is enough really to say, because by that you enjoy every character and every happening. No wonder that that generation is still at some point living that as my generation has The Lord of the Rings. Star wars is really a landmark achievement from director Lucas and this one is the best of the five yet(if you can even include episodes 1 &amp; 2). I won't have to say watch it cause everyone has seen this. If not... WATCH IT! The movie of course represents the landmark of 1970's visual effects too. Superbly entertaining and even more... But well, the new ones...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars was one of the greatest movies of all time in my humble opinion. As a 13 year old I saw the movie 9 times while it was in the theater and I have watched it over 250 times since it came out on video. It was the film that made me fall in love with science fiction films. The story was an old one. Unknown boy saves damsel in distress and must face impossible odds to do so. George Lucas is obviously a fan of mythology because there is so much of it throughout this film. The characters are well developed and believable. The special effects are top notch and the soundtrack is awesome. There is really nothing bad I can say about this film. For anyone who has not seen this film it is a must see if you like good movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Star Wars in 77. I was 11 years old then. I also remember being totally memorized the whole time I was watching it. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The ships and lasers moved so fast. Star Wars was way ahead of its time back then, with the special effects and all. I remember coming out of the movie walking back to the car saying that it was the best movie I had ever seen. I was right. Love it or hate it, Star Wars is and will always be a part of 20 century pop culture. I am hoping for an original release on DVD. I don't really care for the new enhanced stuff. It takes away the authenticity of the whole thing. To me, it looses its vintage vibe....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no doubt one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Thecreatures, the planets, the characters, the ships are all coolydesigned. The plot is hard to explain, it starts of with 2 robots (or droids)being caught in a battle on the starship they are on, so just think ofthis as an adventure which goes on from there. Star wars looks at all types of themes and issues. War,Gangsters, Lowlifes, Country life, Politics, Religion, Love, Comedy,Action, which is really cool.It is strictly a love it/hate it film. That's what "overrated" should reallybe. People hate it and think it's overrated but there are people wholove it.</fullReview>

My son who is now 31, can not even relate to the latest version.The charactors have no depth..and you feel no connection with any of them. This is truly one of the greatest movies ever for children and even their parents, as I enjoyed it as much as my son did way back when. I await the release of the 77 version on DVD.

		<shortDescription>George Lucas RUINED the original Star Wars trilogy in 1997</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what sucks? George Lucas let his fame go to his head. A Director should be punished if he/she goes back, after the theatrical and numerous VHS releases, and changes the damn film. That is just plain retarded. Unless there is something horribly wrong with the original cut (which there WASN'T), you shouldn't go back and change it. ESPECIALLY 20 years LATER!! That is just plain bad-logic. Of course, the scenes you go change are gonna stick out like a sore thumb, like they do.You know what else? The new computer graphics stuck into the 1977 Star Wars are terrible!! They look sooo fake, even faker than the so called "bad" special effects they were trying to cover up. And the NEW song at the end of Return of the Jedi? Oh MY GOD, what was that? It hurt me to watch that in the theater. It even hurt me more that the new DVD release of the trilogy will not include, EVEN AS A BONUS, the original, untouched scenes.In the words of a Lucas rep: "The official definitive versions are the 1997 special editions. That's the version the artist, in this case George Lucas (news), intended to be seen,"I'm now glad I kept an original Star Wars trilogy VHS set, sealed and unplayed.I understand that he created the films and therefore has the final decision, but he forgot that MILLIONS of kids grew up on those original films for over 20 years now. And now, to have some screwed up version of the film as our ONLY choice to watch?? It's like Lucas sold us out to make a few bucks in 1997. Hey, I love technology as much as the next, but when you go back and screw with a piece of historic nostalgia like that, you are screwing with all the fans too.But, the great thing is, his newest Star Wars movies (episode 1 and 2) have both sucked, big time. This is his karma for screwing with the original films. The computer graphics are so cheesy that most of the time it looks like a cartoon and the story lines have lost their original glory. The Lord of The Rings trilogy has far exceeded the new Star Wars films in terms of quality, special effects, acting, casting, just about everything.If Lucas has any ounce of a brain, he completely re-filmed his upcoming Star Wars film, re-casted the entire cast, re-written the script (with much needed help), and hired WETA digital instead of ILM to do the graphics. But, I highly doubt that. Chances are, the final installment of Star Wars will suck too.Thanks George Lucas, for ruining what was once a beautiful thing.</fullReview>

An wise and powerfulold man, with the company of a farm boy who just joined his company must take classified data to a rebel base before they are attacked and blasted into oblivion by the galaxy's most deadly space station.I don't know whether to believe if Lucas already knew the ENTIRE plot for the trilogy when writing A NEW HOPE, but I like the foreshadowing when Owen says "That's what I'm afraid of" as a response to what Beru told her. And I also like how Obi-Wan tells Luke the truth about his father from "certain points of view."Very entertaining. Don't let the influence of modern cinema and SFX bias you against the cheese factor in this one.10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas combines comicbooks, oldfashioned cliffhangers and swashbuckling elements to come up with the ultimate adventure a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.The story of Tatooine farm boy Luke Skywalker joining forces with a mysterious, powerful old man named Obi Wan "Ben" Kenobi to rescue a princess and to transport the classified information that can determine the difference between the redemption of the galaxy or the destruction of the Rebel Alliance - which will ultimately cause the permament enslavement of it.George Lucas took his major influences as a filmmaker and put it into one film, taking all those things he liked and filming all the things he would have wanted to see. Though anyone might want to see the movies that inspired Lucas to make this classic, I doubt those films do have the charm that made Star Wars famous.This became an instant classic in American pop culture, and I'd imagine so because its a lot of fun to watch. And its memorable. There are also some basic screenwriting techniques employed by Lucas (with the aid of Francis Ford Coppola, I assume?) that add to the greatness of the picture. And something that screenwriters might unconsciously use as an example due to this film's being influencial and popularity in general. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing how much one recollects from their childhood. Like their first pair of shoes (quote, Forrest Gump). Their first birthday party. And their very first day of school. Now I'm only a teen, but already I have many fond memories of when I was that age. One of my fondest would have to be Easter '97, when I went for a holiday to the Gold Coast. Now it wasn't anything extraordinarily fun, but for one reason it will be something that I will remember for the rest of my life.This is that reason. While I was down there, my uncle took me and my brother to the cinema to see the Special Edition Re-release of STAR WARS. And that day, something magical happened. I saw a film, a work of movie magic unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was mesmerizing, it was amazing. And on top of that it was absolutely positively unforgettable. Then, for my 10th b-day a year later I got the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition VHS box set. Since then I have lost count of how so many thousands of times I have watched and enjoyed both SW, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.But I better stop blabbering on about this and get to the point.Star Wars is one of those movies that just doesn't have even the smallest fault about it; it is just PERFECT in every aspect. The SFX - although no match for some of today's flicks - are awe-inspiring for ones in a film of it's age. They'd have to be about 10-15 years ahead of their time. The performances are all marvellous, in particular Sir Alec Guinness as the wise and philosophical elderly Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and to a larger extent Harrison Ford as the hilariously cocky and arrogant starfighter pilot Han Solo. And The great Mr. George Lucas achieves the definitive achievement of his career here. His smooth direction is brilliantly executed and makes for a very well-spent two hours of Saturday matinee fun, and his exceptionally well-written screenplay just oozes classic quotes like:Obi-Wan: I sense a great disturbance in the Force. As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror.Princess Leia: Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.Darth Vader: I find your lack of faith disturbing.Han Solo: Boy do I hate being right all the time!IF ONLY he could've made the prequels with all the darkness and sheer greatness of this one.One of the main reasons why STAR WARS is one of the most praised movies of all time is because it was one of the first true pioneers of special effects. George Lucas paid for it's production mostly out of his own pocket, and during filming he set up his own effects company called Industrial Light &amp; Magic. Their revolutionary work on the movie would later make Star Wars a inspiration to filmmakers everywhere. And ILM were also responsible for dozens of other widely successful and popular movies, like E.T, Terminator 2, the other SW-es, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Jurassic Park (and countless other Spielberg efforts!). All considered classics by many - with the exception of the SW prequels! -, but if it weren't for Lucas and his idea of a galaxy with a good and bad race and controlled by, in the words of Han Solo, "an all-powerful Force controling everything", none of these films may have ever been possible to make. People should thank him for that.This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time, and totally deserving in it's IMDb user vote title as the #1 Science-Fiction film of all time. Forget The Matrix Trilogy, they're good but this, this is the stuff dreams are made of.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I begin. Let's start off with the slightest bit of flattery, AN OUTSTANDING FILM, GREAT ON ALL LEVELS, AND PULLS EVERYTHING OFF WITH AN AMAZING GRACE!!!!!! There, just had to get that out of the way. Now onto the review. George Lucas a writer and director with some nice critical praise for his film American Grafitti and some pretty big dreams/visions, comes along to Hollywood and this big company named 20th Century Fox and says he has written a script that he would like to direct into a film. They read the script and say sure go ahead and give him a modest budget and a nice huge crew to create this film. It takes at least a year and he finishes it and lets everyone that made it and they are satisfied with it. BAM!!, it hits the world on May 25th, 1977 and it instantly becomes the biggest block-buster/money-maker this country/world has seen. In America it grosses a record 460 Million and worldwide a record 797 Million and it stays that way for many years. The film also won five Academy Awards and was nominated for Best Picture. It sparked a generation that to this day is known as the birth of sci-fi/fantasy film and basically just film. So what do I say to the film that has withstood it all. I say, "You deserve it and I honor your name."Star Wars starts with a young boy Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamil) living on his ranch-like home on a desert planet called Tatooine with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. It tells of how this young boy and his uncle buy these two droids(C-3PO and R2-D2) that end up changing Luke's life forever. When R2-D2 "runs" off in search of a man named Obi-Wan-Kenobi, Luke and C-3PO go looking for him. Saving the droid they run into non other than Obi-Wan himself. Obi-Wan convinces Luke that he is the son of a Jedi and destined to be one himself and that he must go with him to the planet Alderaan. Luke is reluctant to agree until his Aunt and Uncle are killed and he orphaned. It then tells of their journey through space with two pilots, one a human named Han-Solo and the other a furry alien named Chewbacca to Alderaan which is destroyed by the Evil Empire in an attempt to rule the Galaxy. In the end they are captured by the Empire and must fight to escape. Obi-Wan dies at the hand of his pupil Darth Vader and the others escape to freedom with a new Princess Leia. They regroup with the Intergalactic Rebellion Against the Empire and all but Han and Chewbacca are present in a humongous interstellar space battle against the Empire's Death Star to save the Rebellion and bring them one Step Closer to victory. Thanks to a surprise visit from Han they win and destroy the Death Star. Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan is relevatory and beautifying along with a maybe a little over-the-top performance from Mark Hamil and Harisson Ford, but a right on key performance from Carrie Fisher helps balance it all out. The script is the whole key because without it some of the most memorable lines in movie history would not be here, and many things that were seen for the first time in this film are now parodied almost every day due to existence in Star Wars.Star Wars is a grand and bold epic film which cannot be rivaled even till the end of time, and it sure was a start for cinema. It created the modern day block-buster. So in the end all I have to say is that the very limited few that havn't seen Star Wars yet see it. Your missing out on an American Pastime. I love how it used to be that this film used to always come on at five on a Sunday and then be followed by The Phantom Menace(even though a lesser sequel still great).

		<shortDescription>An American Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of the cinema. However, it is more than a a science fiction film. This film has elements from westerns, historical epics, Saturday morning serials and, due to the scenes with C3PO an R2D2, Laurel and Hardy films. The main thing that makes this film a classic is the fact that, when it comes right down to it, this film is nothing more than a old fashioned fable that all ages can enjoy. No wonder it has gotten the near religious standing that it has achieved over the years. This film is definitely one of the classic films of the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas has entered the Hollywood scene with the blockbuster "Star Wars." All of us, at one time or another, loved this film. The, then, state-of-the-art special effects mastered by Lucas began the saga for the Sci-fi good vs. evil that left us all standing and cheering in theaters all over the world (and I know you were standing there, because I saw this movie in 18 different cinemas).Lucas did something else no one else has, either. On its twentieth anniversary, he re-mastered it, adding some scenes and cleaning it up to match the original version, even adding a short out take on some of the things he did at the beginning of the re-release of the 20th anniversary edition. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. (come on, George, don't make us wait much longer!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this film, a far-away, long-ago Galaxy is under the rule of a Galactic Empire, enforced by the evil Darth Vader(David Prowse, James Earl Jones). However, a small amount of freedom fighters have rebelled against the Empire and stolen the plans to the Empire's secret weapon-a Moon-sized planet-destroying superweapon called the "Death Star". When Rebel sympathizer Senator Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) is forced to hide the plans in a "Droid" robot(Kenny Baker), the droid finds itself into the hands of young farmboy Luke Skywalker(Mark Hammil). Seeking the aid of exiled Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi(Alec Quiness) and space pirates Han Solo(Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) Luke becomes involves in a quest to rescue the princess and destroy the Death Star. The film is a fun roller coaster ride from start to finish. The film's acting is pretty good;although the performances of Mark Hammil and Carrie Fisher can be occassionally whiny, they still have good chemistry together. Harrison Ford, Alec Quiness, and Peter Cushing all give great performances. Many of the special effects still hold up today, even without the "Special Edition" releases. In 1997, a "Special Edition" was released with new special effects and some new scenes. While the SE fixed many of the film's dated Landspeeder and X-wing FX, it also added unecessary additions, mainly to the Mos Eisley section of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Act One in the Art of Entertainment ? Rise of the rebellion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put this trilogy into perspective, it should be compared to another of great success. The one that I am referring to is of course ?The Godfather'. An appropriate analogy for comparison would be that of a family visiting an art gallery. They come to the ?The Godfather' display and the parents take a step back and seriously consider the portrait. The children take a look but soon loose interest and start to nag their parents ushering them to move along. The father has his hand on his chin ? the customary body language of a man in deep thought and looking intellectually satisfied moves on the next display. A big hurrah for the young ones for the next artistic offering is that of ?Star Wars'. They go 'Wow' and the parents attention is also drawn in ? the child within touched. They all move along with a facial display of joyful appreciation.?Star Wars' was pure entertainment ? an example of the art in entertainment in its purest form. It appealed to all, no matter what colour, creed or gender. The imagination is emotionally hauled away on a journey relieving the traveller from reality. There was no sophisticated effort at delivering a message or any subliminal images necessary of interpretation. This is the epitome of big movie entertainment ? screaming Hollywood, but without the big name actors. An aspect of Hollywood which if used would have detracted from the audience's attention to the engulfing story and adversely affected its ability to transport the audience to an unknown world. The other aspects were well included. Firstly, it is loud, it has dazzling special effects, and there are glamorous actors. A reflection of the style of American culture and the movies success is indicative of the worldwide acceptance of this culture. Hollywood is indeed the hub for the exporting of American culture to the world. Although lacking the artistic sophistication of ?The Godfather', it will entertain even the most discerning members of the audience. One need only ask ?How many people do you know who have not seen this movie?' to gauge the magnitude of the applicability of the preceding statement.The attributing of the success of this movie to any single element would be wholly incorrect. No element of the movie steals the show entirely as it is the seamless combination of these elements which flow together throughout the movie, one stealing a scene here or there, but each delivering significantly when the movie is reviewed overall. It would be more practical to identify the weakest element rather than the strongest one. The elements that will be discussed are the acting, the music, the story, and the special effects.The acting is the element that is the weakest here. I believe this is due to the fact that Lucas is not a natural director. Writers are asocial by nature and directing is social. This is a natural consequence of each artists make ? up and is therefore a strength when this natural consequence is applied to the appropriate trade. All the actors are good but in certain scenes, especially Hamill often had contrived expressions. Given the fact that Lucas never did many retakes or communicated to any great extent with his cast, it is hard to lay the blame at their feet. Ford and of course Guinness rendered sublime performances. Guinness utilising to its full extent the suspension of disbelief necessary for his lines, gave them credibility and life. He was ideally cast as the old Jedi who would pass on his knowledge and experience in order to prepare the young Skywalker for his battle against the Emperor and his dark forces, most notably Darth Vader.The music is my affectionate choice as the number one contributor, but in an attempt to be objective, I have to put my personal sentiments aside as I am aware that a movie of this grand scale needs to have all the elements giving great contribution. This is indeed the case here. The opening scene jolts you awake and you are whisked away by the triumphant orchestra to the world of ?Star Wars'. It booms away salvo after salvo and your imagination capitulates to the unrelenting attack. As the introductory storyline brings light to bear on the ensnared audience, the music gives the story a sense of grandeur and a spirit of adventure. The words and images are given an elevated status ? one which could not have been achieved alone. Memories of this composition will linger for the audience, so powerful it is almost ungraceful, but it never crosses the line. The story is a testimony to the creative writing. The story flows through all the acts and we are transported between them without noticing the start or exit signs. The characters are all different each playing a part in the life of our hero, Skywalker. Many of them are met by Skywalker as embarks on his quest and not only do they add value to his adventure, they all entertain. The obvious choice for the best character must be Darth Vader. He is the complete caricature of evil. His life support system makes him inhuman and therefore seemingly devoid of any righteous emotions. Like the cover of the video indicates, he is the face of ?Star Wars'. Our hero is given a grand task and many obstacles are encountered along the way before the satisfying conclusion is reached. With great imagination came great craftsmanship and everyone, especially the audience, wins with this one.The special effects also deserve special mention. Any inclusion herein of the impact the special effects of ?Star Wars' on cinematic history made would add to value to anyone and will probably bore all and sundry. This has been documented exhaustibly. My own experience all those years ago, as I am sure was the experience of many members of the audience, was to go ?Wow', then ?Wow' again. They gave authenticity to the storyline and bought the world of the galactic battlefield to life. The opening sequence showed a craft being chased by a gigantic pursuer and the camera rolls by closely thus emphasising its enormity. This effect would have been simplistic in comparison to what we further to witness, but it set the tone. By today's standards, the effects are a little dated, but besides thrilling older viewers reminiscing about the enjoyment felt in their youth during their first experience of the movie, it will still provide enjoyment for the young audiences of today.Lucas has taken an age ? old convention and combined it within a relatively new genre and created one of the great stories. Knights battling against forces of evil and rescuing a damsel in distress have always captured the imagination generation after generation. Wizards used their white magic to counter the black magic of the dark forces. They mustered their power from an all powerful source which could only be accessed by the gifted few. It was stories like this that adventurers told their sweethearts and became a part of folklore as a source of inspiration for the weak and helpless. When all this folklore, as well as elements from great stories of old is transposed into the futuristic world of sci - fi, it deepens the fantasy. The timeless appeal of Knights and the fantasy world of the future when used together in a well crafted story will enthral audiences giving them a unique experience and the rolling of the final credits will serve to ease their return to reality from a galaxy far, far away. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie ever yeah yeah yeah of course we know we know......!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...now sure, STAR WARS is arguably the greatest film ever made. It's pure magic from start to finish. But seriously, what can I say here that hasn't been said a countless millions of times since 1977? (Not to mention in all the reviews for it right here at the IMDB, in all due respect to the reviewers?)So I'll just throw in a few random thoughts.... ...All the spaceships are cool (all the ones in the prequels suck). The Falcon is the best. ...Leia is hot but she's the only chick in the flick. ...I saw it in the theater during the first run which ruled, and also before all this silly "Episode 4" stuff began. ...a few more re-releases and it should overtake "Titanic" for the #1 box office gross spot. ...Considering this film is the #2 grossing film ever made, and ticket prices averaged what, $2.50 in 1977? And whatever in it's re-releases, should give some idea of just how many people saw this movie. The "adjusted for inflation" box office list is much better than the money-gross list.Ok, let me say a few more things.Give me the original version, the "Special Edition" sucks. Sorry computer geeks, but I think computer-generated "CGI" FX are the fakest looking crap one can add to a film. For a space flick, or a flick where there's aliens, a model/miniature or a guy in a suit looks so much more real. (Say with you want about "Horror of Party Beach" - those costumes looked more real than Jar-Jar in Ep.1.) I can understand a little bit if Lucas wanted to use a computer to "touch up" a few things, like say, when the Falcon got sucked into the Death Star, they cleaned up the pole holding up the Falcon model, that kind of thing. But to totally put new FX in the place of the original, that sucks.I mean c'mon, just one "for instance," who is gonna say that those creatures added all around Mos Eisley look anything close to real? It looks like a joke. And all those added people walking around going nowhere just looks silly.Not to mention revising history. I know this is one of the oft-repeated things, but the fact that Lucas made Greedo shoot at Han first in the cantina is a complete joke in itself. It only shows what a wuss George Lucas is.The one bright spot in the Special Edition was the added scene with Luke and Biggs, because any "new" Star Wars footage is a great thing. A "working print" was found recently with 30 additional minutes - who wouldn't do almost anything to view that?Of course, Lucas says the original version of Star Wars won't ever be on DVD. Anyone who believes that is a fool. You really don't think that the original versions of the first three films are ever gonna come out after the Special Editions have been out on DVD for a few years? I'd love to see the Star Wars opening sequence without the "Episode 4" on it because all the talk about Lucas having this big master plan early on is a bunch of crapola. He may have had some ideas, but he definitely winged a lot of it, folks.When the DVD does come out, there better be some juicy extras, because the thousandth documentary with a name like "The Making of Star Wars" just ain't gonna cut it, unless there's 7 hours of other stuff too.Oh well, either way, my advice to anyone who hasn't seen the original movie in the original version, is to get a used widescreen VHS or laserdisc of it and check that out.</fullReview>

The characters are timeless, charming, deep and emotional. The plot mixes religion, mysticism, politics, human drama, etc on a vast scale and can be considered the ultimate film battle of good and evil. Star Wars never lets up from beginning to end and has a deadly seriousness to it. One of the best mixes of effects, shock, emotion and intensity ever put on film. Essentially a reproduction of old movie serials, updated for the times with a space opera format.</fullReview>

George Lucas made this movie on a shoestring budget (by todays standards) and had a no name cast at the time it was made except for a couple of British veterans. Anyway, this is check-your-brains-at-the-door escapist entertainment at its best. By the way, the bantha that the Tusken raiders were riding was actually an elephant in disguise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before special effects movies like "Jurassic Park," "The Lord of the Rings," and "The Matrix" sagas become something of a phenomenon where their works were in CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery), George Lucas introduced us to something never done before in the history of cinema. Though I wasn't born in May of 1977 when the film first premiered, twenty years later when I was in the seventh grade, I forced my older brother to take me out with his girlfriend and her brother and sister and see a movie together, and the Star Wars Trilogy were the movies indeed at Northwest Theater."Star Wars" is something out of the ordinary where after the 20th Century Fox logo, we see the movie logo appear on screen before us with the music of John Williams blasting its way to the screen and reading the situation of what's happening in the film. The film begins with a ship of rebels carrying Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) on their way to Alderine where a ship behind them is attacking them with lasers; a duel laser fight as the rebel ship is being invaded with storm troopers killing off the soldiers as Darth Vader, (David Prowse in costume with James Earl Jones's voice) a man with a black helmet and overalls for which his presence is meant to scare all of us (and yet he remains a classic with people of all ages and personalities). He wants the plans to Alderine as he holds Princess Leia hostage while her two droids C-3PO and R2-D2 have escaped on the pod taking them to another planet called Tatooine where they are slaves to Jawa's (aliens who own a pawn shop full of robots) until a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his Uncle Owen decide to buy the droids and use them.With great ambitions, Luke wants to train in the fleet academy where many rebel pilots are trained and fly X-Wing's. But his Uncle and Aunt refuse because there aren't enough people to work on the farm, leaving Luke in disappointment. He has heard rumors about Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Jedi Knights who protected the galaxy at one point, but Kenobi has never came out of his shell and is tired of hearing stories, even about his father who served as a Jedi Knight.Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) shows himself when spies attack Luke and C-3PO after losing R2-D2. Obi-Wan tells Luke about the Jedi Knights and how they protected most of the galaxies in the world; even shows Luke a light saber, an energy sword with a light as the blade that can cut through any objects from walls to human flesh. Luke even finds out about his father being in the Jedi before he turned to the dark side.Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids return to Uncle Owen's house where his uncle, aunt, the townspeople and the Jawa's are dead and is revealed that anybody who talked to R2 and C-3PO were eliminated. With nobody left in his family, Luke and the droids join Obi-Wan where they head into the town of Tatooine where it's full of gamblers, mercenaries, everything people consider 'evil.' But in order to get out of Tatooine and make it to Alderine, Luke and Obi-Wan must confront a mercenary by the name of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) in which Luke has to sell his speeder to get the money; so now as all of them go to Han's Millennium Falcon, the storm troopers and other spies have a head out for Solo for which they leave the city of Tatooine and escape into outer space for which where they were heading doesn't exist anymore as Darth Vader's ship, the Death Star, is the only thing in space where the Falcon automatically goes in.It is where they catch up with Princess Leia and rescue her while they try to escape as Obi-Wan duels with Vader in which Obi-Wan dies as he disappears leaving Luke abandoned. It is now up to Luke, Han, and the Princess to join the rebel scouts in order to defeat the Death Star and save the planets from destruction."Star Wars" is one of the greatest adventures ever made with a hero destined with dreams, a mercenary with a chip on his shoulder and great characters to which people will always make references about them and talk about the greatest moments of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Casablanca" of action films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...well, not quite.Casablanca (my all-time favorite film) was a near-perfect movie, with almost picture perfect dialogue (ironic, when you consider the dilapidated way in which the Casablanca script was assembled) that expressed just about every uplifting emotion in cinema all in one film. This movie doesn't reach that dizzying height, but nonetheless is one of those films that succeeds at being a fun ride a lot better than most modern movies. The presence of the "force" adds a dimension to this film, and helps to engross us in the struggles of the adolescent boy, Luke Skywalker.The other side to this film's success is the groundbreaking special effects and the classic Williams score. While many people are looking for a "new" Star Wars film, the only thing we can do is utilize technology to stretch farther in the same direction that the Star Wars movie already took us.I could bash the prequels now, but I won't. I'll just say that it has the special effects element is present aplenty, but the former element just isn't there at all.A note on film ErasOF course, this movie also helped to define the era of the latter 70s-early 80s blockbuster filmmaking (Along with Jaws, Indiana Jones, and Alien). The early-mid 90's had several blockbusters that defined it, too (Silence of the Lambs, Jurrassic Park, and Independence Day). If I had to pick three movies that have defined this era so far, I'd say the Matrix, the Lord of the Rings, and, well, I can't find a thriller strong enough and thrillers have been a part of each era since Hitchcock, so I'll name the Hitchcock of this era: Shyamalan. I think Speilberg lost out on his chance to create a movie that defined this era like he did for the last two, but he's a good filmmaker, and there's always next era, if he lives that long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reason why I write comments like this on IMDB.......WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been 25 years since I first walked into a cinema to watch this classic film. Be it the sequels or the more recent prequels, with the third and final one to follow in two years time, I have never tired of watching it.Although the recent 1997 SPECIAL EDITION beefed up and improved the fx in part, which admittedly is where the 1977 film needed to be done, I recently watched my old VHS copy of the original version and in all fairness didn't really find it any less enjoyable. The newer version did give a couple of pleasures in the sequences redone involving Han and Jabba and a long-lost sequence in which Luke meets up with Biggs before the battle on the DEATH STAR and my regret is that Lucas didn't show the earlier sequences on Tatooine, only touched upon in the original novelization.One sequence that doesn't deserve to be improved is the opening space shot in which the Star Destroyer flies over the heads of the audience. I doubt if Lucas will ever better an opening like that in any shape or form and none of the prequels have that kind of excitement in that sense.A film that needs to be seen on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie with much more than just special effects...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin. This is one of the great movies of all time. Why? Some of the many reasons include:1) The special effects were way ahead of their time.2) Some of the greatest heroes and villains ever created are introduced in this movie.3) The plot is excellent. Many people see Star Wars as a special effects film, but it is so much more. To only watch one movie is like picking up a novel and then throwing it away after only finishing one-third of the book. You need to watch all three and see it as a whole. This is not a story about cool effects, but rather it is the story of a boy and his father. It is a personal story that is cleverly concealed within a bigger plot. Think about it... "I am your father Luke" is still one of the most famous lines in movie history.And the characters. How many villains can you name that are more well known than Darth Vader? And what about the heroes of Luke, Han, R2D2, C3PO and Yoda? Oh yeah, and what about one of the coolest weapons every to grace the silver screen... the lightsaber.A bit of trivia... ever wonder how the main character got his name? Luke Skywalker or "Luke S." as in George "Lucas." :)Anyway, this is a must see movie that should be watched as the first chapter of a three chapter story. 10 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Taken form some of my previous comments under a former name)This film set a standard of Sci-Fi from 1977 onwards. Sadly it brought us really bad rip-offs that only the die-hard nerds like!I don't think it's the best darn thing in the history of cinema, but it is enjoyable, like most of the sagaAnd doesn't that bit when the Stormtrooper hits his head in the background the funniest thing ever!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars. Wow, well, there's not that much I can say really. It was the first film I can remember seeing and truly loving. I must have been about 6. Since then I must have spent over ?2000 on memorabilia related to these classics and even though i'm older now and more economical with my money I still love these films every bit as much as when I first saw them.Star Wars: A New Hope is of course the opening chapter where we are introduced to many of the characters. The sheer presence of them is fantastic. You'll never beat this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of all time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie created a literal monster in my house. My parents will tell you to this day, nearly 30 years after the films release, that their biggest mistake in raising me was to take a 3 yr old to see this movie. It is also the only time my parents can ever remember that I was absolutely quiet and awake for over 2 consecutive hours. The genius of George Lucas is obvious from the beginning of the film. No other movie in history has ever spawned the creativeness of so many people. All other movies made after Star Wars have that movie to thank for the effects made possible through that movie. The characters are easily distinguished, have room for a lot of growth, and it is and absolutely perfect way to introduce kids to mythology, and the compexities of storytelling. George borrowed from Kirosawa, The Wizard of Oz, The Lone Ranger, King Arthur, Flash Gordon, and many other sources to bring this movie to life. He did an exemplary job. He inspired a new generation of Sience buffs, movie buffs, and best of all he created a film the ENTIRE family could comfortably see together. Keep it up George!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that Lucas was releasing a special edition of Star Wars in 1997 with footage that was taken out to be put back I was excited..Finally the missing Biggs scenes that I had heard about but only knew from the original storybook and comics that I had bought during the original release was going to be shown...Imagine my disappointment when once again I was robbed...Instead I got a lame Jabba the Hutt sequence that is a dialogue repeat of the equally lame new cantina sequence....This is why I never fretted over the lost Jabba sequence...Everything I needed to know was explained in the much better original cantina sequence...Why Han needed the money and so on...But the Biggs footage explains a whole character including Luke's and gives part of the reason why he's so frustrated about his life...Unless you had known like I did before hand,when Luke mentions Biggs and Tank you ask yourself who are these guys that he's talking about and what is Tosche Station?All that would have been explained in the Biggs footage...If Lucas wasn't going to put those back in then he should've cut those lines referring to them out...Even the restored hangar scene leaves you wondering who Biggs is and what his relation to Luke is....Bottom line-If the Biggs footage had been restored it would have put the special in the special editions and would have given the fans a chance to see what they'd been missing but as Lucas has said in interviews pleasing the fans is not his priority..In some cases this is true but not in this case...Not when the unseen footage would've provided new insight and development to a character...But then character and story development were never Lucas' strong points...No,the special edition was a chance for Lucas to test run his new toys...Toys which he apparently now totally fallen in love with....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I wouldn't give to erase my memory of Star Wars and see it again for the first time. So much has been said, so I will concentrate on some specific aspects of a great film. Alec Guiness's performance is peculiar. He does not fit the typical role that we have come to expect in Sci Fi. Look at the twinkle in his eye as he says to Luke: "You must come to me to Aalderan if you are to learn the ways of the force." You can tell that he knows more than he is letting on. Maybe his running into Luke was not chance but planned. Perhaps he has known about young Luke living just a few miles down the road for some time and he was just waiting for the right time to introduce himself. Also look how confident he is that he will win against Vader in the duel. Here is a character that has a long and great history that has gone into exile.Also, want a different way to view the film? Spice it up a little, try this. Watch the film and assume that the Rebels are the bad guys and the Empire are the good guys. Afterall the empire is the established government and the rebels are the terrorists. Try it, it will allow you to view the story from a different point of view instead the same old way you grew up with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but no classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantWARNING *MINOR SPOILERS*I like so many other people grew up with the Star Wars trilogy.So I feel a great sense of nostalgia when I watch this and it's two sequels. The movies influence are still seen today.Pop culture references about the movies have been made in the likes of the movies of Kevin Smith or on television shows like 'The Simpsons','South Park' and 'That 70's Show'.It was also spoofed in the funny Mel Brook's comedy, 'Spaceballs' in the late eighties. It's story and premise which were the brainchild of one George Lucas was a stroke of genius.It's simply a story set in a far away galaxy where the Jedi Knights who were the keepers of peace in the universe have been all but wiped out.The galaxy is now ruled over by the evil empire.However, Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) an agent for the rebel alliance has the plans to Empires ultimate weapon, the Death Star.A space station with the power to destroy entire planets.While trying to get to her home planet of Alderaan the space cruiser carrying her is attacked by Imperial soldiers lead by the evil Darth Vader.In an act of desperation she store the plans in a droid named R2-D2(Kenny Baker) and leaves a message to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.The droid and fellow droid C3-PO(Anthony Daniels) manage to escape to the planet of Tatooine where they are found by farm boy Luke Skywalker(Mark Hammil), who on discovering the message sets out to find the mysterious hermit named Ben Kenobi(Alec Guiness) who may know the where about's of Obi-wan.Star Wars or Episode IV-A New Hope as it should be better known is a good two hour movie of pure escapism.It certainly a credit to the imagination of George Lucas.But having said this I can't help but think the movie is over rated.The fact that on more than one occasion it has been voted the best film of all time is something I find hard to swallow.Lets face it.There have been films a good deal better in my opinion that this.The Fellowship of the Ring,Groundhog Day,LA Confidential and Raiders of the Lost Ark are all better movies as far as i'm concerned.Where the film fails to start with is that it takes some time to really get going.Seeing as there is a fair bit of back story and explanations to go through the first hour or so of the movie is mainly all talk.This is made up though when the pace quickens once the movies heroes eventually reach the Death Star.From then on it's action all the way.Most of the acting is fairly average.Mark Hammil is capable enough as the idealist free spirited Luke Skywalker.But his performance is simply acceptable.Carrie Fisher doesn't live up to full expectations and is a bit miscast.She is not the beautiful woman that Princess Leia is described as by Luke in the film.I personally can't understand what all those young prepubescent boys saw in her.Nathalie Portman as Padme in the prequels is a far more attractive woman.The performances that do work well are those of old master Alec Guiness as the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and Harrison Ford as the space scoundrel Han Solo. Ford is perfect in the roll as the cynical smart arse.You can't help but love his roguish charm and pure cynacism. It's what makes him the best character in the movie.Guiness lends the right amount of wisdom and sincerity that makes Obi-Wan an endearing and memorable character.He adds the serious weight to what is otherwise a fairly light weight movie.It's a shame though that this is the film that he only ever seems to remembered for.Especially when you consider his incredible body of work that spanned an amazing career in film.The script though is no as tight and well written as it could of been. The dialogue is fun but cheesy and no where near as good as the likes of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film's.Sure the dialogue in LOTR is cheesy but it is so well written that you don't really notice it. It's dialogue is brilliantly delivered by an amazing cast of ensemble actors.On the plus side there are great and genuinely lovable supporting characters.R2-D2 and the stuffy,cowardly C3-PO are great and would appeal to the under fives.Chewbacca is a brilliant character in his simplicity.A creature called a wookie, he looks like a cross between a gorilla and an old skanky carpet.He is certainly less irritating than the misjudged Jar-Jar Binks in the Star Wars prequels.Over all Star Wars Episode IV is an entertaining time waster.The movie certainly isn't as good as some would have you believe.It's a damn sight better than the latest eforts that Lucas has given us. But considering the fortune Lucas has made I don't think he'll care what people such as my self think.Robs Ratings:* * * *</fullReview>

Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher perform very well.

		<fullReview>I'm sure there is a billion comments on this film,and most (as they should be) are good ones. I wanted to touch on a lesser talked about use of the wonder that is "Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope". This film has actually helped me recover when I have been sick. No lie. Here is my get well formula for everything from stomach flu to the common cold. One you obviously need to have the movie ready to watch on your television. Two have a warm bowl of chicken noodle soup (crackers are optional). Three you must drink a lemon-lime flavored soft drink (I'm avoiding using name brands here). After the soup and soft drink are prepared begin the movie and immerse yourself into the soup the soda and the spirit that is "Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope". By the end of the film you will probably be feeling at least 50 to 80% better than you were. Well, it works for me.</fullReview>

"I thought I recognized your fouls stench" "Who's more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows" etc. The characters have little depth (except what the actors brought to them). The "ideas" are real lowest common denominator stuff. "The Empire". "The Force". "The Dark Side of the Force". Ouch.And the "Science" doesn't make a lick of sense. Space battles that take place at distances which would be conservative in WWI? And why can't the stormtroopers shoot straight? They can't seem to hit anything more than 6 feet away (But remember Ben saying "only stormtroopers shoot so precisely":) Why do they bother to wear armor that doesn't do anything?Mr. Lucas, shame on you for some of the lines! "It made the Kessel run in 2 parsecs"...a parsec is a measure of space, not of time. All that said, I still love the film. It's a part of my childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in every sense of the word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of Star Wars. It was a trailer shown on tv. I knew nothing about the movie at that point; and, thus, got many wrong ideas. There was a quick cut between Luke and Leia swinging across the chasm in the Death Star and an extreme closeup of Darth Vader's face, from the cell interrogation scene. Also, there were shots of stormtroopers falling into a pit. I thought Vader was a giant and Luke and Leia were swinging away from him and the stormtroopers were fighting in some city and fell off a ledge. Boy did I have a lot to learn! Now, you must understand; this was the era of Sinbad films and Star Trek in syndication only. The closest thing to sci-fi in the movies were films like The Land That Time Forgot. 2001 was shown when I was a baby and Silent Running was unknown to me.I didn't get to see the film right away. First, I saw the three issues of the comic book that Marvel Comics released before the film. Unfortunately, they waited a while to release the other three. Next, I read the novel. Then, I saw a "making of" special on tv. I was now champing at the bit to see this film. All of my friends had seen it, there were pictures everywhere. When, Lord? When will it be my turn? Finally, my parents took my siblings and I to see it.I sat there with wide eyes as the opening title crawl stretched across the screen. Then, my jaw dropped as the Star Destroyer flew across the screen and kept growing and growing. I had chills down my spine when Darth Vader entered Leia's ship. I smiled as Ben Kenobi dispatched troublemakers and Han shot Geedo under the table. Man, this movie has everything! The Death Star was awe-inspiring. The actors went from one cliffhanger to the next. The ligthsabre battle was thrilling and the escape breathtaking. My heart was pounding through the dog fights just waiting for that shot; and then........ BOOM! Bye-bye Death Star. The audience was cheering, the cast was cheering, the producers were cheering! I had to see this again, and again,.....and again.No amount of criticism will ever dampen this movie for me. No changes in special effects or addition of scenes, or ill-conceived prequels will change the experiences this film gave me the first time. It was magical, mythical, wonderful, exciting, creative, and just plain fun. To a large number of my generation, this was THE film. It was a shared experience. It tapped into something primordial in us. It was hard to articulate. Was it the fairy tale story; the battle of good and evil? The cool effects and space battles? The great characters? The cheesy, but sincere dialogue? Was it the optimism it brought in a dark time (post-Vietnam and Watergate)? Or was it just, so cool? It was all of these, none of these, and so much more. It was our myth, our saga; it was ours. And the rest of the world joined in.I saw the Special Editions and the prequels; but the changes are artificial. The original version is the reality. I know Lucas says that the Special Editions will be the only versions available, and there are rumors of scenes to be retrofitted in the fabled DVD release, but I would like to just have the original film, warts and all, as it was. Maybe with the deleted scenes on a supplemental disc and commentary from Lucas and the cast. OK, George; we're waiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that changed the way movies are made! A bold statement but nevertheless this is one of the few that by their creation made a difference. Talking pictures, color, cinema-scope and then Star Wars, computer integrated film. I remember standing in line at a Century 21 theater in San Jose for the third showing with some friends (I had to work for a living so I wasn't at the first). There we listened to a teenager who had seen the first and second showing and was going for the third. The enthusiasm was overwhelming. I had seen the previews on a local Saturday night movie program, Creature Features, and the host, Bob Wilkins, claimed this was the movie of the decade. He was right. Now don't get me wrong, there have been better movies before and after, some with more action, some with better acting, some with better plots. This one was a turning point. The proof is George Lucas's fifth entry in this series - a fully digital movie, another first. Truly the dawn of another age of movies. Jim</fullReview>

Before this film, Sci-Fi space films were very hoaky, and let's face it, ridicuously stupid! Space films before 1977 also made space look clean and more sterilized than a dental office. But in Star Wars, they actually showed space trash!They didn't try to make the future look clean and beautiful, they potrayed it as being a dirty, scary place, which it probably will be. The plot was very interesting for it's time, and still is today. I really like this film, and I would reccomend it to other people (80% of the people in the country have already seen it though). I really like the George Lucas digitally remastered special edition version though. It was re-created a little, and more scenes were put it. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars.... so simple a name, yet so appropriate, so meaningful, so attractive. This ultimate venture in imagination can not be, and should not be compared with any of other popular sci-fi movies. I don't believe there were any other movies before this where events took place totally outside earth or without its inhabitants. In that sense Lucas created an entirely new world of his own. Got a fine story, containing detailed descriptions of lifestyle, politics (these two things ordinary sci-fi ones lack) and of course, action. Creation of characters are excellent, as they never seemed impossible. As a director and writer, Lucas excels in many ways, such as in cinematography, plot-twist etc. But probably the best thing about this movie is its special effects. so perfect, they hardly seem possible in 1977! To tell the truth, this movie is probably the best in the whole saga, followed closely by "Attack of the Clones".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few Movies can compete with The Godfather as the greatest of them all. This movie is as close as you can get in beating Godfather. Undoubtedly, the best of the Five released so far(episode 5 and 1 come close), it takes you to a journey beyond imagination, beyond your wildest dreams. George Lucas succeeds in making a superb masterpiece and I believe that this is the second best movie of all time, after The Godfather(Ninth is a little too low). So you are led into the world of the rebels led by jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker, Han Solo(a young Harrison Ford) and Princess Liea who are trying to over throw the dark empire whose Darth Vader has become the greatest villain of all time. Each and every scene is beautifully executed and the lightsaber scenes are totally breathtaking. When Darth Vader comes into the frame you can actually feel the fear he generates, such is Lucas's direction. As I said before this is as good as a masterpiece can get. A rare one, that too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of those fans of the 'Star Wars' movies that continues to enjoy the "prequels". I know that our numbers are dwindling, but I still stick by my reviews of 'Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones'. (Click my name to see those other reviews)At the same time, I can't help but watch those two movies and think that Lucas did more in the original trilogy with little sets and little toy spaceships than he has done with computer systems.Even while watching the 'Special Edition' original Trilogy, I think Lucas messed up putting all that new computer generated effects in it. The movies were basically perfect, why mess with them?I hope that Lucas follows the example of Disney with 'Beauty &amp; The Beast' or Spielberg with 'E.T.', in the sense that when I purchase the original Trilogy on DVD in 2006 or so, I have the choice to watch the original releases or the special editions. I doubt that will happen, but I keep my hopes up just in case.I was five when 'Star Wars' came out. I am not a big 'Sci-Fi' fan. Never have been, but there was something extremely special about this movie. Yes, I contribute some of it to the special effects. I contribute some of it to Han Solo and Darth Vader. I even contribute some of it to my crush on Princess Leia, but I think the real reason that I, along with millions of other fans in the world, absolutely love this film is because we had never seen anything like it before 1977.By the way, don't give me that "'Star Trek' was on TV blah blah blah cannot even match the talent blah blah sang 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' blah" bull. I'm aware of the Sci-Fi TV shows and movies that we had prior to 1977, and I still stand by my statement. There was nothing like 'Star Wars' and to be honest with you, there really has been nothing like it since.It is a movie that deserves to include the word "Classic" in every review given about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatness soured......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen the Two Towers, so I thought I should come and give this movie a ten while it is still in me to give it one. Star Wars, A new hope, was once great. It should still be a great movie. But it is not. As I watch and read the Lord of the Rings, I realize that George Lucas has been a lucky hack. He has borrowed (I am being nice here) from other great works (RIngs being only the most obvious example), Dune, Kurosawa's works and on and on. The original release of Star Wars was absolutely perfect. Everything that hit the cutting room floor needed to be there. Han should have shot first. Not Greedo. Tatooine does not need giant dinosaurian creatures that no desert ecosystem could support. It does not need goofy little robots flying to and fro for absolutely no other reason than the fact that Lucas owns ILM. Special effects that do not further the story simply distract.George Lucas proves that he does not know what was good about his films by the fact that he thought he needed to "fix" them. The things that he contributed to the movies was the basic story shell. Better writers than he are responsible for making hi stories utterly enjoyable. And better directors than he are responsible for making "Lucas" films watchable (as his new films aptly demonstrate). What I find most annoying about this is that I can not now go and purchase the original theatrical release of Star Wars, Empire or Jedi. Now I am stuck with the version's Lucas deems worthy.Worse yet, the beautiful mythology that so inspired me as a kid is now being stamped out by the silly thoughtless prequels. The idea of them was awesome. The story of Anakin's rise and fall. It is the execution that has failed fans. We knew enough about the story ourselves and that, I think, was the magic. We knew enough, the rest was, appropriately, shrouded in mystery. Anakin was tragic because he was good, and kind and Obi Wan' s dear friend.The Anakin presented in Clones is whiney, selfish brat, utterly unlikable, and un-approachable. This Anakin can go nowhere but to the dark side. At any rate, these were once great movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most revolutionary movies ever made. It's not often Hollywood has to invent new technology and techniques to film a movie. I can still remember seeing it as a kid on my parents' tiny little black and white TV when it aired on CBC. Even then it was one of the coolest things I'd ever seen. And it stands the test of time. The opening sequence from the 20th Century Fox fanfare to the Corellian Corvette being pursued relentlessly by Vader's dreaded Star Destroyer is now one of the most memorable in the history of film, and it still gives me chills every time I see it (upwards of fifty by now I'm sure--I think the only movie I've seen more is Batman). Though Lucas did borrow a lot from The Lord of the Rings, The Wizard of Oz, and Akira Kurosawa's movies, he blended them together in a really unique way, along with the tried and true elements that made westerns and Saturday afternoon serials so popular. At its core, Star Wars is just a fun adventure movie. It wasn't made to win Oscars, but to simply entertain. And it does that like not many other films can. Out of the original trilogy, this was by far the most improved upon with the release of its Special Edition. Though the extra scene with Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt was completely unnecessary, and of course Greedo shooting first ranks up there with Jar Jar Binks as one of the worst ideas Lucas ever conceived, the movie as a whole seems so much more alive and enjoyable to watch. Too bad the same can't be said for the other two movies' Special Editions. What happened? It's like they stopped trying once they got to Jedi; it's barely improved at all. The Rancor scene still looks horrible. Guess they spent too much money on that slappy-ass musical number. Anyway, I give the original Star Wars 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bookmark of childhood we all need...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars defines "fantasy" for all children who exist as men and women. None so more evident in any Star Wars cinema premier or special.The old Saturday morning serial, under the tutoridge of the great Akira Kurosawa, has provided now 2 generations of stellar bound dreamers of adventure a fantastic platform for release from 9-to-5, with Lucas as the pilot, to a distant galaxy far, far away where even modern politics play a role in this very appropriate, very entertaining serial mimics not only the Skywalker within each other, but the statis quo. Fiction or non-fiction, Star Wars removes the reality element from the status quo and returns us all to the child we want to be, whether it be playing with ewoks in our front garden or standing up to the local bully in the name of the Jedi.May the force be with you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original space opera.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977 George Lucas started a franchise that will ever remain as a milestone in popular culture. Yes this is the original, maybe the best, the only STAR WARS. That name has been associated with so much during the past 25 years. Now that the prequels are in full swing we view the classic trilogy as the untouchables. The film had the perfect cast of characters and actors. Mark Hamill as the young and eager Luke Skywalker. A then almost unknown Harrison Ford as the smug Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as the rebel princess Leia Organa. Everything here was so new and refreshing. This is one of those rare sci-fi adventures that has heart and soul. Alec Guiness was mysterious as Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi. James Earl Jones was perfect as the personality of Darth vader. Everything came together on this Star Wars film like it never has since.C-3P0 and R2-D2 are classic and original.A New hope isn't without it's flaws though. George Lucas's script is a little full cliches, but it's still classic. I don't believe this is the best Star Wars movie, but it's the first. It's a good swashbuckling adventure that the prequels are striving for and may never reach. After 25 years it's set to stay as a part of movie history.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent 1977 film - not so excellent 1997 tinkering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Star Wars" is a brilliant film. It was awesome in 1977. It's still awesome now. It's a simple story. It's a lively mix of film genres. The actors work well together and the action sequences are thrilling. So why is it not available on pukka DVD? You can get it on video and (defunct) laser disc, but not DVD. This is a glaring mistake.So Mr Lucas is tied up with producing Episodes I to III and will look at Episode IV, but on the evidence of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (yeah, right!) and from what I hear, Episode II (I was so disgusted with Episode I, I didn't even bother with Episode II), I don't know why he's bothering.Episode IV is a complete package. It has a beginning, a middle and a proper ending. Although Episode V developed the characters and Episode VI rounded them off, they just can't compare with the 'original' film.And then there was the tinkering in 1997. Okay, so the film stock was on the verge of disintegrating and there's no denying that bringing the film up to THX standards and adding some sympathetic digital effects has produced a film that is even better than the original production, but WHY OH WHY include the 'Solo meets Jabba' scene. It adds nothing to the film; it looks clumsy (the digital Jabba looks digital) and it should've remained on the cutting room floor. When Mr Lucas finally comes around to overseeing the release of Episode IV on DVD, perhaps he can delete this scene.Star Wars (1977) - 9/10 Star Wars (1997) - 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a gem to behold.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this movie for the first time, I thought it was going to be another so-so movie. Boy what I ever wrong!!! Everything about this movie is nothing short of amazing. Heck, on my favorite movies of all time list that I've made right now comes in at #2 {second being next to movie #1, The Empire Strikes back}.Perhaps my favorite character is Han solo, who played masterfully by Harrison Ford. Everything about him, from his attitude to his grin, sounds like the person I am. And I like that.I also believe that it marks the beginning of Mark Hamil's movie career because I've never heard of him before until I watched this movie {The only movie stars that I only knew were Harrison Ford, Sir Alec Guinness, and James Earl Jones}. Speaking of James Earl Jones, the guy who does the voice for Darth Vader, I also believe that Darth Vader is probably the most evil and vile villain in the universe. All Vader would have to do compared to other villains like the scorpion from Spider-Man or Mr. Freeze from Batman is to literally use his mind and they're both dead.I Can't find any complaints about this movie other than the fact that I wish it was longer. Even if you're nowhere close to being a sci-fi fan {science fiction], just try and check and see who's proven wrong. Speaking of sci-fi, any sci-fi fan who doesn't have this movie should be ashamed of themselves because this movie pretty much made sci-fi the way it is, which by the way is also responsible for making me the sci-fi fan that I am now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first made, but 4th of the saga.This film is my least favourite of the Star Wars saga, but is still brilliant. It is my least favourite because of the time it was made (1977) e.g. it has the worst special effects and the worst lightsabre duel of the saga.Before I'd watched 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' (AotC) I loved this film, but now that I've seen them, I love this film even more. The characters we see already have depth because of the prequels. A great example as to why I enjoy it more is: I did not like the lightsabre duel between Ben Kenobi and Darth Vader, but now that I have seen the way they acted towards each other when they were younger (in AotC), I get tingles down my spine when they fight.I am sure my opinion of this film will improve even more after I've seen Episode III, everything will fit into position, it will be like one long story. The only thing I am concerned about is, when watching Episodes I-VI, the special effects after Episode III will drop dramatically, there'll be a 28 year gap difference, 'A New Hope' just might not be able to compete with Episode III in my opinion. I'm sure it will though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best movie ever. But I'd rather call it Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope than just Star Wars, because it ties up Episodes I-III and V-VI together.In this movie, young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) meets Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness), droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his assistant Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). They set off to rescue the rebel leader Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the evil clutches of the Empire. Unfortunately, Obi-Wan is killed by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) in the Empire's ultimate weapon the Death Star. In the end, Luke finally takes revenge on Vader by blasting the Death Star with the help of Han Solo.The movie is the first Star Wars ever, though it is Episode IV in the saga. Its sequels "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" and prequels "The Phantom Menace", "Attack of the Clones" are very well done too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grade: *** (out of *****)The year: 1977. 20th century Fox, a very popular studio nowadays, was about to go downhill with some other productions that didn't make `enough' money on the USA box-offices. The instrument of salvation: the very own `Star Wars', that actually saved Fox. The director: George Lucas, who hadn't had much experience with movies, except for another science fiction, `THX 1138'. The budget: only 11 million dolars! However, as soon as it hit the movies, it was critically acclaimed and a big success. The question: was this success really deserved? The answer: yes and no. The truth is: it's an ok movie, with poor actings and bad script but what made Star Wars really Star Wars it's its magic, the thought of actually being in `a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..' while watching it.Its advanced (for the time) special effects also made Star Wars more believable, as well as the absolutely stunning soundtrack, by the powerful John Willians (who also made some other famous theme songs, such as ET, Jaws, Indiana Jones, etc.). Of course, who can't remember that famous song who became a big classic? Also, the characters are really well developed, such as Yoda, the Jedis, Han Solo (played by Harrisson Ford), Luke Skywalker (played by the silly Mark Hammil), Princess Leia, etc. In fact, they're so nice that the Jedi fights really seem real. Now that all the positive aspects of the movie have been shown, you'll see why this isn't a 5 stars movie. It's because beneath the magic and the jedis, it just ain't a cult, intelligent movie: it's just a regular story about the good guys and the bad guys, about love on its silliest shape, etc.Star Wars was also one of the first roles of the famous (today) Harrisson Ford , who later on made characters on movies just like Han Solo: good guys who'll many times (?) save the world, who'll fall in love in the middle of the movie for an adorable rich `princess' and will rescue her in the end, from the hands of the bad guys. However, people in general really seem to like characters like this. After all, Indiana Jones, Star Wars and its follow-ups were really big hits, weren't they? Episode IV storyline is about a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy. It looks like it's smart, doesn't it? Well, but it is not! To sum up, when watching `Star Wars', just realise that the magic is not enough without its fantasy, that tries to hide the stupid plot: you'll travel, but once you think well about the movie, you'll land again...</fullReview>

Entertaining, Ok graphics for it's time and decent plot. This is not a groundbreaking movie. And it's #9 on the IMDB 250 best?!? COME ON!!! This is just good, but no great. Why?!? Star Trek is way worse, so stick to this rather than star trek. I'm noit saying this is bad, It's very, Very Entertaining and all the sequels were good (Except Empire Strikes Back, That was SOO Boring). Don't join fan clubs and worship this movie. Watch it on a Friday night if you have nothing better to do, But Don't excpect an Amazing Movie. Rating: 6.5/10 P.S.

		<fullReview>...until last Tuesday. Which usually results in one of two things.1. A once-thought-good film wil turn into a pile of poop.2. It'll feel like I'm watching it for the first time and though I'll remember some scenes, there will be other things that will seemingly come about of the blue - thus the film retains it's quality.With Star Wars, it was definatly the latter. The most forgotten scene was the Millenium Falcon turning up at the last minute to take down the Dark Star. Sounds dumb given that Han Solo was going to return for the other films anyway but...I just remembered the final scene slightly differently.Anyway - the start of this recently reived franchise definately still has some life in it.P.S To the guy talking about 'light speed'. I suspect 'light speed' = what is generically known in scifi as 'hyperdrive' therefore 'light speed' light speed x X with X being pretty high. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly, pretty crappy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of it, this movie isn't that great - in fact, the whole series sucks. It seems that Lucas relies only on the special effects to pull a story across, as is evident in Episode II. The script is horendous, the acting was pretty okay (I wish Skywalker showed some more emotion), and their are so many plotholes. For example, if hyperspace is light-speed, as they say, how can they cross the galaxy? Is it that small?The music was amazing ON ITS OWN, but when attached to the movie (with the only exeption the beginning and end credits) it sounds to corny. Maybe Williams could have mellowed it down? He made the same mistake for Harry Potter.The plot is straight forward, and I give it a good mark for that. But it could have had more depth in the characters - Han Solo and Luke Skywalker seemed too 2-d.Please don't hurt me, you die hard Star Wars fans. Am I allowed to state my opinion? I thought this series was very crappy, that's all</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally think that Star Wars is one of those films that you could watch over and over and over and over and still enjoy every minute of it just like it was the first time you saw it. Now I was completely impressed by this movie, not just because of the awesome action and acting, but because it had the best special effects of any movie I'd ever seen up to that time. It includes many TIE scenes which I've learned to love as the movies went on (the battle at the end was PERFECT) and I thought the story was fantastic. The problem that I saw with the movie was that I had no idea what was going on in the opening scene, where the Rebels try to escape from the Star Destroyer. I didn't know what the 'Empire' or 'Rebels' were, and I didn't know what the 'plans' were for. I think they should have shown scenes describing all that stuff before the movie was finished. But believe me (and if you don't believe me believe every other breathing object in this world) this movie was GREAT, AWE-INSPIRING...every single descriptive adjective in the book that's a synonym for the word "good".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best out of the origional trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was this week that I finally watched the original Star Wars trilogy again, the first time in maybe 5 to 6 years. My only real recollection of Star Wars were of the two prequels, which I love. Upon watching Episodes 4-6 I can say this is the best of the three.The number one reason this film is the best is because you do not need to have seen any Star Wars film before it (much like Episode I). Nothing about it's pop culture status sways me to think that this is the best one, heck, it's pop culture status sure doesn't stop me from ignoring the flaws in this movie."Everybody's a comedian." This must have been the motto Lucas had in mind, because everybody in this film is wise cracking. Han Solo wise cracks, Princess Leia wise cracks, C-3PO wise cracks, even Chewbacca and R2-D2 wise crack, and we don't know what they are saying. All the comedy makes it hard to figure out what genre this film is supposed to be in. The acting in the film is a half/half venture, some of the actors are great (Han, Vader, C-3PO) and some needed to take a few more acting lessons (Luke, Leia). Put all that with a simple yet fun plot and you have an inventive, light Sci-Fi adventure,.The two reasons to see this movie, that it is horribly fun and the universe that Mr. Lucas has created is full of originally designed ships, creatures, and comedians, I mean characters.So if you are one of the few people who have never seen Star Wars, you have nothing to fear from a TV, it is not a box full of trapped souls. So get over your fear of TV and see this darn good sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

They also are friends with this blond guy who gets mad at his uncle because he can't do fun stuff with his friends in the desert. His uncle wants him to do chores but the blond guy wants to do space stuff and be a super fighter like his father. The Golden robot and his little friend who rolls around make their way to the desert where the blond guy buys them from some monks who are only like 4 feet tall and squeak at eachother. A lot of space stuff happens after this. They all get thrown into a garbage compactor and snakes attack the blond man. At the end, the blond man shoots rockets into this little hole that is on a large plastic planet. The planet blows up and the robots stand with the blond man and look at the stars.

		<fullReview>This film is was a turning point and its lasting appeal is built around one character, Luke Skywalker. Skywalker is a name that all movie fans know and this is due to a great script and a terrific performance by Branscombe Richmond. The scene where he steals the camels has gone down in history and i was astonished to learn Richmond didnt win an oscar for his fine performance in the lead role here. That said, not even a performance as great as Richmonds could have made this film what it is alone. Credit must also go to Brian Blessed who brought great appeal in the role of Han Solo and also to George Harrison for backing the film with his Beatles money. The only downside is that James Earl Jones doesnt get enough screen time. Perhaps allowing his character to turn into a snake as he did in Conan would have rendered the film flawless.</fullReview>

I firmly believe that the Star Wars saga is the modern mythology of our time. It follows the journey of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker to fulfill their eventual destinies. All the elements of classic storytelling are evident in the series. The story of a young hero who fell from grace and finds redemption in the end with the help of his son is a timeless one and will remain engraved in our pop culture for all time. While some say that George Lucas is a capitalist pig out to show flashy special effects with a "look what I can do" attitude, I disagree. He utilized all the elements of old storytelling and merged them all brilliantly. The idea that good prevails over evil is a great parable in today's world where we need old-fashioned morality tales in an age of cynicism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst thing I can say about this film is that the droids were better actors than the humans. The best thing I can say about it is that it seemed to end rather quickly, I hardly noticed I had wasted two hours of my life. With that in mind, it's necessary to watch Star Wars: A New Hope so you can enjoy the greatly superior sequels, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Don't let this film put you off Star Wars forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...and thus begins the science fiction era !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first, the original, the only ...STAR WARS ! This is where it all began, when the Science Fiction concept was finally accepted among the broad audience. And what a beginning - the ultimate adventure, a story of good versus evil, and the scene set in outer space... does it get any better ? No ! The only reason I don't give it a perfect 10 is because that should be a privilege for true perfection only. When you have watched Star Wars as many times as I have, you begin to see the little flaws. Granted, for 1977 the flaws are pretty meaningless, still - they are there.But Star Wars should be watched as an important piece of movie history as well as a damn great science fiction/adventure experience ! If you have not seen it yet, which I find hard to believe, do so. You will NOT be disappointed !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best movie of the original Star Wars trilogy always gets better with me everytime i see it. The best thing about "Star Wars" is that, although its over 20 years old, it still does not fail to entertain. I can watch this for weeks and still not get tired of it. The whole cast and crew did a magnificent job and there really is no flaws in this movie despite the lightsaber sequence between Obi Wan and Darth Vader, which really if you have a good eye, just ain't lightsabers. :) This movie is the same thing to movies to Sci-Fi as Muhammed Ali to Boxing... it made it soooooo much better. Sci-Fi had been given a bad name before with the outrageously silly Star Trek and finally it had found its savior in Star Wars. Without a doubt, the best Sci-Fi film ever made has to be "Star Wars". I mean, it has everything what you need for a great film; comedy (R2-D2 and C3PO), intense action, drama, suspense, and contains unbelievable special effects for its time that no one had ever seen before. Even today if this film was released, there would be no problems. I actually like the hard-work artisan technology in the old films than I do with the new Star Wars films. Funny, isn't it? Kudos to Harrison Ford for his arrogant laughable self as Han Solo (which people actually credit him more than Indy), Mark Hamil, Carrie Fisher, and most especially Sir Alec Guiness who if Ewan McGregor aged, I could picture him looking exactly like that. Unbelievable film that should be ranked #1 in Imdb Top 250 without question. If you want quality, entertainment, durability, and fun... check out Star Wars and you won't be disappointed. Out of 10 stars, an easy 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest sci-fi film of all time. Well written an directed by George Lucas. A great sci-fi fairy tale, it starts with farm boy Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) who teams up with aging Jedi master Obi-Wan Keonbi(Alec Guinness) and stubborn pilot Han Solo(Harrison Ford) to help rescue Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher), and destroy the space station known has the death star, but Darth Vader has a plan of his own. One terrific film,followed by two terrific sequels. It's well acted by everyone in the film. The whole cast had great chemistry. Including the two droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. A great story, and great special effects. Truly a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up Star Wars was one of my favorite films and even asan adult I'm still in awe of it. The film is far from perfect, the performances are uneven, the dialogue is cheesy and Lucas' direction is not particularly good. However, even with all these flaws the movie is a lot of fun. Unlike The Phantom Menace orAttack of the Clones, the original Star Wars has a larger than life feel to it. The movie unfolds like a genuine epic and despite Mark Hamill's bad performance, it's easy to relate to the character of Luke Skywalker. Not to mention that Peter Cushing makes for one terrific villain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Sci-Fi Epic Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have one word to say about this movie-wow! Twenty five years since it was released and it can still thrill an audience. Star Wars is great!I'm not overstating things when I say that Star Wars is truly an epic just like the age old stories of King Arthur and Excalibur. An epic has to have everything-action, adventure, romance, intrigue, deception, betrayal, the lot.The characters in Star Wars are the greatest characters ever invented for a sci-fi epic. Who can forget the likes of Han Solo and his friend Chewbacca the wookie? What about those two droids C-3PO and R2-D2? What about Darth Vader-a being who became evil purely through circumstances?I am afraid that words simply cannot do justice to Star Wars. I actually think Star Wars was ahead of it's time-back in 1977 we were not ready for such an epic. It blew our minds. We simply could not comprehend the sheer adventure nor could we foresee the impact Star Wars would have. Even today in 2002 there are fans talking about Star Wars and attending conventions the world over.If there are any youngsters out there who have not seen Star Wars then I recommend they stop whatever they are doing, head to the nearest video store and buy-not rent-but buy Star Wars and be whisked away to another galaxy for an epic adventure.Truly amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun sci-fi film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the recent two Star Wars this is a very fun and entertaining film. I won't go into any more detail about how bad I think the newest two are so I will leave it at that. This film is very entertaining though Empire is by far my favorite (suprises me this is ranked ahead of Empire). The only problem with this flick is that it doesn't really get going till they go to the bar where they meet Han. Also, the light saber isn't used much in this one. The only duel is between Obi-Wan and Vader and Obi-Wan throws the fight. Other than that though it is a very solid movie. The escape from the Death Star, the battle of the death star, and the likeable characters make this a movie worth experiencing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the Star Wars trilogy since I was a kid and I never get tired of the movies. It's by far the most fun of the Star Wars films (although Empire is the best) and has become a classic. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are perfectly cast as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia and their chemistry is what makes the movie work. Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing are excellent in their roles.Although the special effects in this film are now considered outdated (in 1977 they were groundbreaking) I actually feel that the effects look more realistic than the ones in the new movies. I prefer the actors in costumes (Chewbacca, C3PO, R2D2 and Darth Vader) and puppets to the computer generated characters that are currently being used. I like the way the special effects are used sparingly.The dialogue in this film is also excellent. I especially love the lines spoken by Ben Kenobi, Han and Leia. The editing in the film is excellent and John William's score also contributes to this classic film. I'd recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine: You're George Lucas. Your last movie American Graffiti had one of the largest profit margins in history. You go back to Universal, to your mentor, and he passes on the film. Then you go to every studio in town and every genius says "No". Finally, Alan Ladd Jr. gives you your shot and it nearly kills you. You wind up in the hospital basically suffering from chronic anxiety and over work. You kill yourself to finish the film on time. There's a budget crisis that nearly keeps the Cantina scene from being shot. Then on opening night you're having dinner with your wife across the street from Grauman's Chinese Theater and the lines are around the block.Forget the corny Flash Gordon dialog and the campy acting. That's what made the film work. Now for those of you who didn't exist in the 70's and think the SPFX look terrible, remember this, John Dykstra had to invent a motion control camera or they couldn't have made the picture.So everybody who turned down the movie is hiding their shame, maybe a few were fired. And George Lucas owns one of the most profitable motion picture franchises in the world.Please don't annoy me with nit picking the film to death. It set the standard for every tent pole summer movie that followed. Knowing Lucas, if he could have used CGI in '77 he would have - it wasn't available.Funny, I've seen every film in the series, but I've never had such a good time as seeing SW4 when it was first released. My cousin bought some action figures for $1.95, kept them in their shrink wrap, and recently sold them on eBay for $12,000. Is it a classic? Let me put it this way: it defines its own dimension.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the film that made George Lucas famous. The movie had excellent visual effects for a movie in the 70s. It did deserve the award it got for the effects. The effects do not compare to the Menace and the Clones, but they are still good.I find the movie a little slow at times. That is why it is not my favorite Star Wars. It has some great acting at times but Harrison Ford shows that he does not care for the movie in some scenes. But overall the acting is good. The movie is the third best in the series. It is not as boring as the Empire Strikes Back and does not have some of the bad acting displayed in Clones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros: Special effects, directing, sets, script, score, acting.Cons: A bit slow at times, pacing problems.There is probably a million reviews of Star Wars floating on the web so one more isn't going to make a difference. Still, I'll add my little insignificant bitof o[inion of this movie. It is a classic movie, no doubt but surprisingly not the best in the series. Most fans seem to think the title belongs to The Empire Strikes Back and I agree with them. The film starts with a rebel ship trying to escape a epublic battleship to to no success. Princess Leia is onboard and she has structural plans of the infamous Death Star. Fearing capture, she transmits her info to R2-D2, a droid and also a message to Ben Kenobi. R2-D2 and along with C-3P0 escape through the use of an escape pod and they land on Tatooine, a desert planet. From there an epic journey begins involving different characters of all sorts. The robots provide much of the comic relief and Han Solo's biting sarcastic remarks are a riot to witness. His interactions with Chewbacca and Princess Leia provide for the funniest parts of the movie. The movie ultimately suffers because it seems a bit slow at times. For example, a lot of time is spent on the capture of the droids by the sandpeople and the eventual selling of them to Owen Lars. I felt this could be sped up a bit. The film finishes epic in scale and equally impressive with the use of digital effects. It is easy to see why this film became a landmark to its generation. Premise: A rebellion threatens to knock out the Death Star, the most powerful weapon in the universe.Star Wars Episode 1: A New Hope was nominated for eleven Academy awards and won seven.Grade: 9.5/10 (One of the best Science Fiction films ever made).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie alone is a huge reason why sci-fi survived the 70s. Thank god George Lucas saved a genre that otherwise usually brought cheesy crapo movies. Star Trek had been out for about a decade by the time this movie came out, and it saved the genre. Star Wars serves something for everyone from the hijinx of C-3PO and R2-D2, to the mystical powers and introduction of the force, this movie has it all. Sir Alec Guiness, although he didnt intend to do so, will always live on as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Many people feel the same for other performers in this movie, and the rest of the Star Wars Saga. I call this the "James T. Kirk" sydrome. (of course named after William Shatner's role in ST years eariler, one of the first actors to forever be immortalized into a single role). Without Star Wars this world would be a different place, for no movie has touched so many people and nosaga is as timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars ? Episode IV ? a new hope, would have to be one of the world's most popular movies, withstanding the test of time and coming up against some great competition. This might be a video-game that has come to life, but what is the problem with that, it was a well made movie, considering it was done way back in 1977. Luke Skywalker, an impulsive but goodhearted young man receives a distressing message from Princess Leia in one of his androids, R2-D2, which sends him out to find Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi, a mysterious old hermit with incredible powers. On his journey, Luke is aided by the roguish, sarcastic mercenary Han Solo and his towering furry sidekick Chewbacca, as they run into a host of perilous situations while trying to rescue the princess, and the entire galaxy from the fearsome character of the eternally frightful Darth Vader.This movie has some terrific scenes in it. I think the best scene would have to be the Light saver fighting between Obi-wan Kenobi and Darth Vader, which was an exciting scene. However there are other scenes, including the ship fighting between the Rebels and the Dark side, which are great, as is the destruction of the Death Star. In addition all the amazing creatures that are used in this movie make it all the better and more enjoyable.The cast of Star Wars is first class. Luke Skywalker is played the now famous Mark Hamill. He was a refreshing young actor in this role and he only gets better and better in the following movies. The role of Princess Leia was portrayed by the beautiful Carrie Fisher. I enjoyed her minor role in the comedy film HEARTbreakers. Han Solo is a very aggressive character and is well acted by movie legend Harrison Ford. He was excellent in the movies that sort of off-set stars wars, that being the Indiana Jones series. Obiwan Kenobi was a performed by Alec Guinness. I enjoyed his small role, with his character having much knowledge and experience to pass on to a young Luke Skywalker. The mechanical side of Star wars is a very enjoyable part of this film. R2D2 and C3PO are very simple characters, yet they also have a very complex side. I love how the audience can laugh at the antics of the two droids, but can also be hoping that the two can help save the day. The evil character of Darth Vader was also great, with the heavy breathing evil leader an obvious favourite for some die hard Star Wars fans. I must also mention the good work of composer John Williams. His impressive musical composition for Star Wars is very well known and helps make it all the more memorable. It is easy to see why he went on to compose for movies like Superman, ET ? The Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, Stepmom and the scary theme for 'Jaws'. I feel he made the score for this movie just right.So with all that in mind, Star Wars is one of the great movies of our time, I can not praise it enough. With many films and TV shows trying to cash on its success, it still beats them hands down. I am not sure whether this film is the best of the trilogy, but not to matter, it is still a great opportunity to sit down, relax and enjoy a science?fiction classic.May the force be with youCMRS gives 'Star Wars: A New Hope': 5 (Brilliant Film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To all who read or write these comments:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several points have I to make.1) Star Wars is not essentially Science fiction, and judging by today's standards, it simply is not Sci-Fi. It's an escapist fantasy, a "space opera," as George liked to call it. It's a story.2) Action is not all there is to movies. Star Wars was about a space-based fairy tale. WITH action, to be sure, but not BASED solely around it. Those who think the Matrix is better because it's not based on action and special effects need their heads examined.3) An escapist fantasy is a GOOD thing. It allows viewers to recover their lost childhood and become amazed and awed. If you shun the film because of its fantastic story, you are denying yourself a good tale. Chances are you're a teen in the stage of life in which you despise anything that links you with your earlier childhood, and it makes you feel "cool" to mock anything you find "immature."4) Why do I get the feeling most of the critics are simply trying to disagree for the sake of disagreeing? Fellow fans, don't mind the trolls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childlike vs. childish...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently some of the reviewers here have mixed up the two concepts, and "Star Wars" definitely falls into the former category.Someone (I forget who) once said "The man (woman/person) who has lost the ability to feel a sense of awe or wonder is dead inside." Someone else (a well known figure) is reputed to have said, "Lest you become like a little child, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven." In 1977, the kingdom of heaven was at hand for the lucky ones who got to see this in the theater. After waiting hours in a line that stretched 4 or 5 blocks (still the longest theater line I've ever seen), the lights dimmed, and after the words scrolled across the screen (which made sense to few... episode IV?), Darth Vader walked onscreen. There still hasn't been anything to equal that cinematic moment (I was 13), and probably never will be.Yes, the formula has been copied numerous times... "Star Wars" (and a few other films both before and after) ushered in a new cinematic era. Yes, it's somewhat campy and there are cheesy moments... aren't these the films we love the most? "The Sound Of Music" was immensely popular with the moviegoing public, panned by the critics -- and a paragon of cheesiness viewed with the jaundiced eye of the early 00's. But "Star Wars" also has many moments of childlike wonder, from the days when Lucas still had "beginner's mind," those days when even Spielberg was willing to take chances... and movies were still movies, not computer-generated fake looking 2-hour commercials for Hollywood (and other products).If you haven't seen "Star Wars" (or you have, and didn't like it), try to watch it with an empty, fresh mind. Do you remember the concept... do you remember what it was like to be a child? If not, you are the walking dead.10/10</fullReview>

This one is really introducing characters, but it's done in a longer film giving more time for story, special effects and other various delights. This is one movie that has never really gone to stupidity or craziness and keeps everything in a well balanced show.</fullReview>

This is the one that started the whole SW phenomenon that took the world by storm, basically it's about a Farmboy ( Mark Hamil) who becomes a Pilot to join in the great war.10/10 ( cinematic Perfection and Classic plain and simple.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars has many tremendous elements. Great music, fantastic action, memorable characters, and a great plot. Star Wars was unique for it's day and justifiably seeped into people's imaginations as a sci-fi classic. The plot is, of course, the story of Luke Skywalker's maturity in the Force while pressed by Darth Vader and surrounded by the conflict between Rebel and Empire. The concept of good and evil is put on such a grand scale that the audience's attention is riveted on the action, which is substantial. The space battle scenes are some of the best and most dramatic sequences put on film. The characters are beyond legend. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is charismatic and demonstrative, the perfect lovable scoundrel. Mark Hamill as Skywalker plays the character with whining immaturity which was no doubt called for in the role. Carrie Fisher plays Leia with a furious upper crust impatience and intensity. Darth Vader is no doubt the most famous and popular villain in film history and the Death Star is a near mythical prop. George Lucas hit big time and created a wondrous adventure.8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one teensy-weensy quibble (or 2).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;Spoiler warning!&gt;While it is now generally regarded as an all-time time classic, I would just like to point out the one very tiny teensy-weensy quibble I have with this movie. (I still gave it a 10!!!)It's about the scene when Luke comes back to Ben after finding his homestead destroyed and Owen &amp; Beru dead. You'll know Ben does the "There's nothing you could have done" speech, then Luke does this bit about "I want to come with you to Alderan" speech. To me, this speech seems a bit too forced and formal for the situation. The guy has just lost his primary care-givers and virtually everything he has owned in the world. I hate to say it, but you would expect him to be a little bit more choked up by the situation. It sounds like something Princess Leia would say rather than Luke. I just think this is the one time where the dialogue is pushing the themes at the expense of the believability of the storyline. (It's the one reason I rank certain other movies a tiny bit better than this one.)Other than that, this is an all time great! Concerning the special edition; I would like to say that the take-off of the Millenium Falcon from Tatooine is absolutely magnificent; but I'm a bit of a purist and I actually like the original Death Star explosion better than the revamped one. It just seems a bit TOO flashy (and just why does the shock wave go vertically anyway?).The only other thing to wonder why most critics didn't recognise this as a great (or at least half-decent) story to begin with. The official explanation that they didn't pick up on the cultural impact is a tad unfair (they could hardly have known that at the films release). But Gearge Lucas has always stated he was making a modern-day fairy-tale and a Flash Gordon-style story, and you'd think they would have least acknowledged the mastery of the plot at that level. I can only surmise that they were so used to the standard 70-style self-conscious angst-ridden stories where the characters are heavily overtly thematic, that when a dynamic entertaining story came along they dismissed it purely at face-value; and assumed it couldn't have any artistic merit. They failed to realise that a great story has interesting themes INSIDE a good plotline, not INSTEAD of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever wondered where Star Wars came from?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) Origins of Star Wars2) Summary for Star Wars (1977)3) Summary of Episodes 1, 2 and 31) ORIGINS OF STAR WARS:Star Wars is really the best film series of all time. As if Star Wars (1977) wasn't enough, we get a total number of 6 Star Wars movies which are all great by themselves but even more incredible if you watch the whole series. It's kind of a modern myth set `a long time ago in a galaxy far away'.Star Wars I one of the most important films in history. The story is kind of old fashioned, but it is set in space, it is told through two less important characters. George and his team invented a lot of new special effects to get this working. It brought science-fiction to main stream audiences again. It redefined the blockbuster. And it broke all box office records. It's an adventurous epic for young and old.I've just seen `Episode IV - A New Hope' for the first time after seeing `Episode I ? The Phantom Menace'. Before that I've also (re)seen some other movies which influenced George Lucas. For example `The Hidden Fortress' (1958) by Akira Kurosawa and `The Searchers' (1956) by John Ford.Akira Kurosawa is a talented Japanese director. His best known film is `The Seven Samourai' which inspired John Sturges to make `The Magnificent Seven' later in 1960. He often used wipes to go from one scene to another, so now you know where George Lucas got that idea.Another idea George took from Kurosawa was to tell the story through the two droids. Just have a look at `The Hidden Fortress'!I heard he was also inspired by the original Flash Gordon serials and the original `Planet of the Apes' (1968) by Franklin J. Schaffner.George also used the works of Joseph Campbell, in particular `The hero with a thousand faces'.2) SUMMARY FOR EPISODE 4: A New Hope:The Empire intercepts and boards a rebel ship with princess Leia on board. A moment before the Empire Stormtroopers capture her inside the ship she sends two droids R2-D2 and C3PO away with the plans to a new secret weapon of the Empire. They land on a planet called Tatooine and are captured by Jawa's who sell droids. Luke Skywalker, son of Anakin Skywalker lives with his uncle Owen and aunt Beru on a farm on Tatooine. When he purchases the droids R2-D2 and C3PO from the Jawa's, he accidentally discovers part of a distress message from Princess Leia, his sister, for the old Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi who lives a single existence at the edge of the desert. When Lukes aunt and uncle die, he joins Obi-Wan to get RD-D2 back to Alderaan. The little droid carries the plans to a very powerful space station called the Death Star inside him. They find two mercenaries called Han Solo and Chewbacca to take them to Alderaan. But by the time they get there Alderaan is completely destroyed by the Death Star. Their ship, the Millennium Falcon gets pulled in by its tractor beam. They find out princess Leia is on board and go rescue her while Obi-Wan turns off the gravity pull. While everyone is heading back to the Millennium Falcon Obi-Wan faces his former apprentice Darth Vader. He lets Vader kill him and becomes more powerful than ever. The others flee to a moon called Dantooine where the other rebels are. The Empire follows them and when the Death Star approaches the rebels send out figher ships to destroy it. Luke and Han are the ones who finally pull it off. Darth Vader escapes in a small Empire Tie-Fighter.3) SUMMARY FOR EPISODE 1, 2 and 3:Shortly after the first Star Wars film became a phenomenal success director George Lucas announced his intension to make a total of nine films in the series. But he only finished episodes 5 and 6. After twenty years he finally announced that he would finally make episodes 1, 2 and 3.In these first three episodes we learn how the Jedi found Anakin Skywalker, the father of Luke Skywalker. For ages the Republic has ruled the galaxy. But now it is old, tired and corrupt and the Sith are rising. Senator Palpatine becomes the head of the Senate thanks to an evil conspiracy. When his apprentice Darth Maul is killed he chooses count Dooku to become his new apprentice. The Clone Wars sound in the beginning of the end of democracy in the republic. Anakin Skywalker, who is becoming the most powerful Jedi ever, has to begin dealing with some of his more intense emotions like anger, hatred, sense of loss, possessiveness and jealousy. He defeats the new Sith, but is seduced to the Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader. Vader hunts down and destroys almost all of the Jedi so Palpatine can make himself Emperor of the galaxy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess it's quite pointless to write a review for Star Wars when there's lot's and lot's of other geeks that has written all there is to know about it (if you haven't seen it, your'e probably alone in the universe of it) but I guess I can give you some pointer's.Darth Vader is the coolest badguy persona EVER! Together with the Emperor (who isn't in this movie) they form the perfect dark alliance. These two together can give anyone the shivers. James Earl Jones do Vader's voice to a frightening and powerful melodic and metallic eerie sound that is ever to haunt you when you turn the movie off.The interaction between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi is priceless. Actually, after seeing Star Wars, ten times or so, this is what I wait for every time now. "Now I am the Master."I give Star Wars a roaring 9. Topped by it's sequels, only, actually. (This alone makes it a damn good movie.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Star Wars, I was blown away. The movement of the spaceships, the laser guns, the lightsabers, the classic battle of good versus evil, all was just a spectacle to see. The acting is great for this type of movie; Han Solo is by far the coolest character. The free-motion cameras give the spaceships amazing movements, and the aliens in the cantina scene are amazingly weird. It is just feast for the eyes and mind. A beautiful movie with a simple but engaging plot line, based off of the Hero's Journey, it is all just a ride that won't end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much has been written, spoken, said and even posted in cyberspace about Star Wars (particularly this, its fourth episode, also known as "A New Hope") that it is difficult to even do the Legend justice even with my own words. Yet now, as we continue to count down to the release date of the fateful Episode II --- Attack of the Clones, we begin to realize that there is more to the Saga than even most of us dare to perceive. That it all started with one motion picture does not really say much about the Legend. That only happens when you dig deeper into the tales that have been told to date. And that's not just the movies. There are the two Ewok TV movies, Nelvana's Star Wars toons, every known Star Wars book from Ballantine/Del Rey Publishing and Dark Horse Comics, and even Smith-Hemion's infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. All have contributed in one way or another to the vast chapters of the Legend. As an example, consider what become of little Cindel Towani, the young girl befriended by Wicket and his fellow Ewoks in the 2 Ewok TV films. The Star Wars Encyclopedia tells us that Cindel eventually grew up to become one of the leading investigative journalists on Coruscant. This, naturally, makes me wonder about her further adventures involving that aspect of her life; but, again, I may just leave that to the Dark Horse folks. My point, folks, is this: perhaps, especially in the wake of September 11th, we are indeed, as George Lucas himself called us of old, "a generation growing up without fairy tales." Is the Star Wars Saga, then, the ultimate fairy tale adventure of the post-nuclear age? Some have said yes, others no. In the end, as always, the real answer is up to us. By digging deeper into the various legends spawned by the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, we can perhaps see something greater within ourselves. I once called the Star Wars Saga our generation's version of The Lord of the Rings. "Luke Skywalker may have set out to save the galaxy," I remember saying at the time, "but now that the galaxy has indeed been saved, for whom and from whom has it been truly been rescued, and at what cost?" Even now, so many years later, I am struggling to answer those same questions. That a mere motion picture lies buried under the surface is no longer an issue. If it were, we would not have websites like starwars.com and theforce.net. Then again, the Force was probably within us all from the very first. What do YOU think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, when I read peoples' comments about how Star Wars "sucked" and how they "don't understand its success," I just want to slap them. Hard. So that teeth fall out.Then sanity returns, and I begin typing.One thing I must find agreement with a few naysayers is that the effects have not held up to the test of time. That's one of the reasons Lucas revisited it and the other two with the Special Editions. Even there, the effects in some of the shots aren't quite up to today's standards. That being said, this is a fun film. It's entertainment done extremely well. Anyone who goes looking for deep meaning and an emotional revelation is going to be disappointed by this movie. Star Wars is an action rollercoaster set in space. It's not "high art."Now, a lot of people get more out of Star Wars than just a good entertainment buzz. They see symbolism, imagery, archetypal themes that speak to the human soul. They are the ones who raise this film above its station and call Lucas a genius. They hear the theme and call John Williams a god. And what they've done to Mark Hamill, well, that poor, poor man.If you haven't seen Star Wars, see it. Form your own opinion. Don't believe the hype. When I saw it (lo, these many moons ago), I knew nothing of hype. I was just swept up in the film and wasn't let back down until many years later. I'd like to think that this film can still have that effect on kids.Notice I said "kids." If you're over 30, see this film for the first time, and start going out to buy the action figures, get some help, for the love of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE GREATEST SCI-FI MOVIES OF ALL TIME!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Star Wars" is, to this day, one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time! When it was released in 1977, no other sci-fi film could come close in comparison to the quality and advancement in special effects technology that this movie presented. "Star Wars" set the standard by which all other sci-fi films are judged to this day.As for the plot, many critics like to say that people continue to watch and enjoy "Star Wars" to recapture lost youth. They're wrong. Because we remain young at heart and idealistic about the future, we love movies such as "Star Wars" that promote the hope of a better tomorrow when so many other things in real life have failed. Movies such as "Star Wars" ignite the imagination and encourage mankind to reach for the stars! Maybe it's the critics who need to recapture their youth and idealism, both of which appear to be dead and forgotten.My thanks to George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guiness and the many other cast and crew that brought this remarkable film to life for countless generations to enjoy!P.S. George, when are you going to release the original trilogy on DVD?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are three possible reasons why people would like this movie--#1]They saw it when it was first released and it reminds them of their youth #2]They have only recently became interested in Science Fiction and are unable to differentiate between good and bad #3] They are of the modern "short attention span" generation who require constant action and cannot be bothered to deal with difficult or challenging concepts. Star Wars is NOT Science Fiction; it is at best Space Pantomime, and at worst Science Parody The plot [?] can be written on the back of a bus ticket; Princess is kidnapped by evil aliens and is rescued by mixed bag of freaks the villain [boo hiss he"s behind you!] is a tall geezer with asthma who wears a crash helmet. Contrast this with "The War Of The Worlds" [better acting,stunning effects,better story]or "The Terminator" [ditto,and it was truly HARD sci-fi] and you will get my drift!

		<shortDescription>THE ORIGINAL AND BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a force present in the first film of this saga that is absent in the others- humour. A New Hope is a film made in the tradition of the greatest 70s' films- casual, leisurely and stylish. Note the scene when Han Solo is disguised as a Storm Trooper, and when contacted by one of the security guards over something resembling a transmitter, Solo says- ?situation is great, everything is fine, I'm fine thankyou. How are you?' The security guard replies- ?who the hell is this?' Solo blows up the transmitter, then concludes in the subtlest of ways (to himself) ?boring conversation anyway'. An obviousley improvised scene (and who'd have thought that in an episode of the Star Wars saga?) there are no moments of this spontaniety in the other films. Its' with this humour, a subtle level of camp, and the sense of Joi De Vivre you get from witnessing something truelly spectacular unfolding before your eyes with the perfect sensibility of avoiding over ambition that makes this easily the best film of the saga. The characterisation is clearly spot on (Han solo is easily way cooler here than in the other episodes) and there is not a dull moment in sight. It's easy to see why this makes everyone's top ten lists of greatest films of all time 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK...I've looked over some of the reviews that are posted here. Some people didn't appreciate this film when it first came out, one guy didn't "get it" and others thought it was stupid, long and boring. Now, I am not about to say that this is the best film ever made, but for sheer entertainment value, this film does it. Consider this - in 1977, there was no CGI, no $175 million dollar budgets, but on a budget of around 5 mil, and a handful of unknown actors (short of Cushing and Guinness) George Lucas managed to put together a space-borne fairy tale. You have the good guys (Luke and Han), bad guys (Vader and Tarkin) and an assortment of characters nobody had ever seen on film before. This film was ahead of it's time in many ways. Considering the fact that Lucas took most of the money and invested it into creating ILM and other companies, Hollywood should thank him for reinventing the medium of the fantasy film. People who trash the film or call it childish, seem to me like people who are simply envious of the good fortune that Lucas had with this trilogy...Let's face it - we ALL reaped the good fortune of this film. Think about it - What would Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Terminator, etc etc be like without the advent of the effects pioneered by this film? Next time you watch Star Wars, remember one thing - Suspension of Disbelief. Don't try to pick it apart and spot all the things you think were done wrong. Simply enjoy the film for what it is - pure fantasy. Better yet. Watch the film with some small kids. Nothing beats the look on my nephew's faces while they watch these films; eyes lit up with awe and wonder....These films are what movies are supposed to be about...No harsh language or naked women prancing about, but a honest story of good vs evil that will last for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Respected Action/Sci-Fiction Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars brought respect to the action and science fiction movie genre. It was monumentally innovative, while providing an excellent example of a movie succinctly telling the story. The only thing lacking in the story is there are not enough dull moments and humorless comments compared to todays films.This is by far the best movie ever produced with such a small budget and the sequels did not improve dramatically with increased budgets (although the special effects did improve). The cast was excellent, believable and sympathetic. Even Vader was a very likeable villain. The treatment of Darth Vader set the standard for powerful, unapproachable, and awe/fear inspiring villains. Luke played the confused teenager well while conveying a real sense of naivete. At the same time you could see his confidence and latent abilities grow throughout the movie. Harrison Ford provided humor and the loose cannon to keep things interesting. (Gueedo discovered that loose cannon early in the film).The droids R2-D2 and C3PO were terrific. The were Bert and Ernie, Laurel and Hardy, the odd couple, grumpy old droids. If you just crawled out from under your rock, or recently landed on this planet go see it. It is a classic and will be remembered decades, maybe even centuries from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rest Writes Itself...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have spent some time commenting on lesser movies and it suddenly occurred to me... hey, I could comment on Star Wars! It's like playing football at your local park and then suddenly being picked for England. People might even read my comments, as you are doing now...To get to the point, in 1977 my pal invited me along with his kid sister to see this movie. I'm 18 years old, I'm not expecting much, I hadn't paid much attention to the hype, but we did make the extra effort to go to see it at The Odeon in Leicester Square, a big cinema in the centre of London which I had never visited before.In we went and I'm already taken aback by the sheer size of the theatre and the screen... we are quite close to the front. I'm already very impressed. Then the opening titles spring up, the huge sound system bursts to life, John Williams unparalleled orchestral masterpiece.And then the sound, shaking the whole theatre, rumbling, you can feel it in your diaphragm. The gigantic star ship looms majestically into view from the top of the screen, it is huge, you are there in space looking at it...It took me about two minutes to draw a breath and the rest writes itself.I saw the movie again only last week on one of the movie channels on Sky satellite and it was as big and bold as ever. Still 100 percent watchable.The sequels... at time of writing The Empire Strikes Back is a very creditable number 17 in the IMDB voters chart and Return of the Jedi at 117. Phantom Menace is not in the top 250. Clearly the echoes are growing fainter so let's hope Mr. Lucas can maybe give us one more really good one from the remaining two?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't improve on the heaps of praise for this film, one of my favorites ever, so I have to ask questions. 1)During the meeting of some of the top-brass aboard the Death Star, a skeptical minion questions Vader's Jedi powers and the lack of re-acquiring the stolen data tapes. Vader's response was to choke his critic and utter a strange rebuttal. "The Death Star is insignificant next to the power of the Force". Excuse me, but can't the Death Star blow up planets ? And what does Lord Vader use the Force for ? To choke insubordinate officers who question him ! During the whole Star Wars filmography, the Force is used to: cloud men's minds, to choke and physically hurt others, to levitate people and objects, sense other Force-users, etc... Vader can't blow up planets or even come close to it.2)When the Death Star arrives in the Yavin system, they wait until the moon with the rebel base appears in the targeting cross-hairs. This of course, helps the rebel pilots organize , attack and defeat the Death Star. So I ask : Why didn't the Death Star blow up the big planet in front of the moon upon which the rebel base sits ? Then they would not have had to wait until the orbit was aligned properly. Perhaps I can answer my own question.Maybe the Death Star needs to recharge the old batteries after a big hit. Of course, they have no problems hitting multiple targets in 'Return of the Jedi'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Star Wars the single best movie ever? No, but then again, I don't think that the holy trilogy should be reviewed individually. They must be taken as a whole. On that scale, the Star Wars trilogy is the most influential set of movies ever made.Lucas created modern FX with these movies. CGI and full length computer animated features would not exist, except for the moneys that Lucas put into it following the successes of SW, Empire, and Jedi. The Matrix would never have made any money were it not for Star Wars twenty years earlier.I cannot wait for the DVDs to come out on these movies, I will be going to the store that day to purchase them. Please George, let me experience the sights and sounds of these movies how they should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part of the best movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion the six hour plus epic of episode IV through VI of Star Wars are the best movies of all time. To separate them would not give them justice because it really is one incredible story. I find the acting to be surprisingly good from mostly relative unknowns and they make the story so much better. The feeling of depth to this story is what really sets it apart and it is so incredibly entertaining. The special effects are mind boggling for their time and are still great today. I love this movie because it made me want to be part of this universe and dream about being there. The score has to be by the best I have ever had the pleasure to hear and the visuals are amazing. For entertainment I can't find any better movie than these.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This is the reason movies exist. This two hours of brilliance and magic is two hours well spent. I have loved this movie for more than have my life, and it never gets old. When two droids escape a Reble cruiser that was under attack by the evil Empire land on a remote planet calle Tatoninne the adventure begins. One of these two droids, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), carries the technical read-outs of the planet-sized Death Star which has the fireing capibilities to destroy a planet. R2 must get the planes to Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness), and then get safley to Aldrean. Along the way R2 and his counter-part C3P-0 (Anthony Daneiels) get capitured by scavengers called Jawas, and then sold to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammiel) and his uncle Owen. Eventualy Luke, 3P-O, and R2 find Obi-Wan, and discover that Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is being held capitive by the empire and the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse) aboard the Death Star. The four hire Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and his co-piolet Chewbaca (Peter Mahew) to take them to Alderan in Solo's star ship the Mellinum Falcon. When they reach Alderan they see it's been completly obliterated by the Death Star. The 6 are then captured and then go about the space station to find Leia. If I say much more I'll spoil the ending, altough if you haven't already seen it you haven't been on this planet. The acting , story-telling, directing, score, and suspense is superb. Sir Alec Guiness is great as the wise old jedi-knight, Mark Hammiel is exelent as a winey young farm boy, Harrison Ford is superb as a daring scounderl, and Carrie Fisher un-beatible as a sort of bratish princess who is in charge of the Rebelion against the Empire. George Lucus is a wizard, or magigician who casts a spell on veiwers. This movie is the best one in history. I give Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope 11/10</fullReview>

Droids C-3PO and R2-D2 escape in an escape pod, while the Imperials kidnap Princess Leia. The droids land on the desert word of Tatooine. They go their separate ways and eventually meet up again when being sold by Jawas. Luke Skywalker and his Uncle Owen purchase Artoo and Threepio; Luke is bored at farm life and dreams of a better one. He uncovers part of a message from Artoo that's of Princess Leia requesting the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi; soon, R2-D2 disappears so Luke and Threepio go to look for him. They find him and witness some Tusken Raiders. But it's Ben Kenobi to the rescue, and he claims he was once Obi Wan Kenobi. He sees the whole message and must go to Alderaan to deliver the plans to the Death Star the Rebels have obtained. Luke volunteers to go because he wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like his father. They need a pilot to get them to Alderaan. They meet Han Solo who will do the deed for $$. Han's ship is the Millennium Falcon. "She'll make .5 past light speed". (Whatever that means); when they arrive at Alderaan, they find it's been blown away and they get pulled towards the Death Star. It apparently blew up the planet. Obi-Wan goes to search for the tractor beam controls while Han and Luke dress as Stormtroopers, find the princess and rescue her, nearly avoid being squashed in the trash compactor, and manage to leave safely. Obi Wan didn't make it because he got engaged in a lightsaber fight with Darth Vader and lost; Next, our heroes go to the planet Yavin and prepare for an attack on the Death Star, and it goes good! The Death Star is blown away! It's a good film! Lot's of action and stuff! See it if you haven't already! I recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that will never be forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Star Wars I truly realized I was watching one of the greatest films of all time. The twinkle in my lifeful eye and the giddish smile on my face could only fortell my amazement for this film. "A true masterpiece" is all that can be said for this timeless classic.This movie, for its time, had special effects that truly shattered any other films hope for superiority. The film convinced thousands of young boys and girls that what they saw was for real, like Santa Clause it was like a religion to all of us. The way the no-name actors (other than Ford, Guiness, and Jones) made the characters come to life and engulf the screen with richness that filled our minds of hopes and dreams. Then the plot took over.If you're looking for a movie that will send you away like an illegal drug and will show you something like you've never seen before than I strongly recommend (saying it lightly) that you catch this movie. I'm giving this advice for all those people out there who've had their head stuck in the sand for the last 25 years. Or who've dismissed this movie for a kids film that would only be suitable for a 2 year old.I would like to sincerely thank George Lucas and the staff who brought us Star Wars on screen and brought it to life.Rating = 9.999999999999999 (I never give 10's but we'll round up for this one)/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just a little tiny girl when I first was introduced to star wars, and I didn't like it one bit. It was loud and long and I didn't understand it. However, after a few years I developed a deep nostalgia for this movie and everything it represents. My heart swells everytime Luke looks up at the starry sky on tattoine and the music just helps carry the mood- that you know something great is going to happen. I kick myself for being so unapprieciative when I was younger, since If i had payed attention I would have bought right into it and had some valuable collector toys to go along with some fantastic childhood memories of this classic, timeless fairy tale about a poor boy, who grows up underprivledged only to find out he's a prince who's destined to be a jedi knight. So pretty much this review is like most everyone elses on here- Thrilling Movie and well worth your time. Watch the whole series in one setting for a fatastic, intergalatic epic that will transport you to a galaxy... far.. far away. 10/10 of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say? This is the movie the ol' "silver screen" was made for...planet-breaking effects, incredible music, good vs. evil, the total package. I was lucky enough for it to be one of the first movies I ever saw and still enjoy watching it. You really can't understand or argue it's effects on the movie industry unless you lived through it--even if you hate it--if you like one single sci-fi, western, action, adventure, fantasy, or epic movie that has come out since it's debut, then you need to tip your helmet to "Star Wars". I won't argue it's validity, it's place in history, it's "borrowing", etc., etc.--it speaks for itself in all those aspects. I just want to give it my 10/10 and say 3 things: 1) The "special editions" are not as good as the originals (Empire is the only one that has any real improvement) 2) They are still as good as they were 20 years ago and 3) Seeing it on the "big screen" is so different, it's almost like seeing a different movie. I'm glad they put them back in, even if it was with the new effects (which I don't hate, I just don't think are as good as the originals), so a whole new generation of kids (of all ages) could enjoy them in the way they were intended. There should be a theatre somewhere that only shows the Star Wars movies...all day...every day. May the force be with you...always...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Response to critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok! We've all seen it (if not here's a hammer to hit yourself with) and loved it. Now I've read the anti-Star Wars comments here and feel as though I should respond with a fair point of view rather than gush about the movie itself (been done already).First off,this movie is not a western. Yes it's got a western type story to it,but it obviously is not one. I would aim more toward it being a cross between sci-fi with western underpinnings which is why it wasn't so hokey like most previous sci-fi (hence,a big reason why this movie made such a splash). Calling it uninteresting is just plain bluster considering what was valued as 'good' sci-fi at the time. As for the Storm Trooper's not being able to shoot....what else is new? Every action movie I've ever seen with firefight scene in it has the bad guys blind as bats. Remember;it's fantasy!The decline of Hollywood certainly didn't start with Star Wars. I'm sure we could all discuss this one for a very long time,but I assure you,Lucas isn't to blame for Hollywood's recent poor flicks. Paranoia at it's best! Praising Jaws above Star Wars? Well,everyone's got a right to an opinion however Jaws is nothing more than a simple monster movie such as Godzilla. :)Boring? I guess you 'could' say that,but I'd have to say you didn't really pay attention to the story and are the type who must have a fight scene every 3 minutes to keep you entertained. Sort of like the kid who rushes past the intro to a video game so you can hit buttons as fast as possible.The below posting,'Episode IV: Leia Rules, Star Wars sucks' is so ridiculous it doesn't deserve response. I'll hazard a guess and say that anyone with this much hate in their words is the type of person who simply hates a movie (or song) simply because so many others like it.I quote:'The films shortcomings in terms of the technology, detail and positioning, whilst revolutionary for its time, must be examined compared to today's standards for the movie to be considered great.' Answer: No,it doesn't. I have a friend who thinks because a movie has some years on it,that it somehow makes the film no longer good. This is ridiculous. Film is art,just like music and paint. When they're good,you judge them on their own merit and not contrasted against other works. If it's good,it's good. The film's effects were certainly not poorly done and you've got to remember when the film was created. I was four years old when I saw this and was certainly not confused about the plot. The movie is a visual adventure in the sense that although the dialogue and plot was great,even if you missed something,you'd be able to pick it up with the visuals that give you the story anyway. Anyone who gets lost in the story should stick to pro wrestling. As for the 'laws of physics sound travelling through space' argument:I've heard this one several times taken up against ALL sci-fi films. What exactly would these viewers have us listen to? NOTHING? I'm certain that we can all suspend belief as we sit through a FANTASY movie during these times. If certain viewers can't swallow that,they should quit watching movies altogether (as there are always things happening in film that NEVER happens in real life) and stick to 'more realistic' documentaries.In short,through all of the anti-Star Wars folks that I've talked with, they've never had any real objection to the movie that rendered the film a poor movie but more of a 'teen-angst' ridden review that showed they only wanted to 'stick it to the man' and wearing their hate of the movie like a medal for not 'being fooled' like the rest of us. Thanks but I've enjoyed the movie with most everyone else and plan to do so for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I Never Got It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will never forget the hoopla associated with this movie. Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek, my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing "Star Wars" (boy have times changed!). There were local news stations, reporters, models, everywhere. How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets, I don't know, but we did. I still have my blue button with "May the Force be With You" emblazoned on it. I'm told it's pretty valuable. A reporter approached us and asked my friend, "What do you expect." He responded in his sort of wise ass way, "A sprawling intergalactic epic."That was all very interesting, but when we finally sat down and the movie began, I found it was less than I had hoped for. Part of my problem was that at that time, most of what I read was science fiction. As I watched the events unfold, I realized that this movie wasn't really science fiction--it was a Western. It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged. Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn't very interesting. I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn't for me. I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie. As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don't get me wrong, I still think that there are amazing things to watch, but I can't get past the fact that the storm troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post. Where did these guys get their training? How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read "Dune" years before this film came out, I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn't get sued for stealing from that book, I'll never know. I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic. The aliens are wonderful (although, I thought the second and third movies were much better), especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it's an adventure movie. Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I'm going to watch a Western, I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simply the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, the original 1977 version of Star Wars is the single greatest feature film ever made. It combines the five elements any movie should have: spectacle, humor, suspense, drama, and memorable characters. It is almost perfect.The opening is perfect - a quick pan across a sea of stars, then a small rebel ship, and then the huge Imperial star destroyer fills the screen, its engines roaring. That shot is incredible, and does exactly what a movie opening should - it sets the tone and atmosphere of the movie visually and aurally, without a word of dialogue.My only criticism of the movie is that it gets a little bogged down in 3PO and R2's journey to meet up with Luke Skywalker. Luke is the protagonist of the movie, and he should be on screen a little sooner. Lucas should have trimmed a few bits with R2 and 3PO on Tatooine - especially involving the Jawas - not because the scenes aren't well done, but because a first-time viewer (if there is such a person) might be wondering where the story is going. Of course, it is worth remembering that in the 70s movies tended to start more gradually than they do now.Once Luke is in the picture, the movie starts to move and just builds and builds to the incredible climax. We add Obi-Wan, Han and Chewie, and Leia to the team, and the battles grow faster and more intense (to borrow Lucas's notorious line of direction to the actors). Contrary to what some have said, this is the best screenplay ever written, with many great lines that appropriately bring humor and wit to the remarkable situations on screen. The special effects and production design bring this incredible story to life in a way that should have surpassed even Lucas's high expectations.The final attack on the Death Star is without a doubt the most exciting action sequence ever filmed, and it ends perfectly. What an incredible achievement. Thank God the suits at Fox didn't cut it from the budget, as they threatened in pre-production! And the "throne room" coda (which apparently borrows from Leni Refinstahl's Triumph of the Will) is a remarkable capper (again, without dialogue). Did I mention John Williams's inspiring score?I have a feeling that the single greatest movie-going experience of all time must have been the preview of this film a few weeks before it opened in May 1977 at the Northpoint theater in San Francisco. According to published accounts, the audience went crazy from the first appearance of the star destroyer and cheered wildly when the Falcon made the jump to hyperspace. And when Han Solo blasted Darth Vader's wingman at the end, the crowd leapt to its feet and cheered as if their team had just won the seventh game of the World Series. It was then, that Lucas and Fox began to realize they might have a hit on their hands.By the way, I think this movie has to rate as the greatest personal accomplishment of any filmmaker in Hollywood history - rivaled only by Titanic for James Cameron. In both cases, the filmmaker spent years developing and writing a script that many thought was a fool's errand. Both directors were extremely hands-on, taking a very active role in cinematography and editing. In Cameron's case, however, he was at least working from the facts of a true story, whereas Lucas completely invented the vivid Star Wars universe himself - with compliments to Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Joseph Campbell, and many others, of course.My one request is that Lucas release this movie on DVD in its true original form - without "EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE" in the crawl (that godawful title was only added in 1980 when Empire came out) and without the ridiculous Han Solo-Jabba the Hutt scene and other CGI tweaks added to the film in the 1997 "Special Edition." I want to see the movie the way it was when released, not with anachronistic effects tacked on. Lucas has started a trend (although I suppose it really began with Spielberg's travesty of a "special edition" for Close Encounters in 1980) that now has continued with the Exorcist, Star Trek the Movie, and E.T.'s scheduled re-release next year. What will they do next - use CGI to smooth out King Kong's movements on the Empire State Building, or make the Wicked Witch of the West fly more realistically? Let us see the movies the way they were originally shown! Don't mug our memories, to borrow a phrase from Pauline Kael.Bottom line: in its original form, this is the best movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I possibly say about this film that hasnt already been stated previously. Nothing I could write or say about this film will bring its proper justice or illustrate the greatness of this film.No matter how many times I have seen this movie, and believe me it is several. I am still riveted with the brilliance of this classic. Think about life in 1977 from a technical standpoint and think about life in 2001. Computer enhancements, bigger budgets and all of Hollywoods latest toys failed to improve this movie much at all upon the re-release. Only a few cosmetic strokes were applied and the original is left safely intact. George Lucas is the master of his destiny and has never cheapened his reputation by following up his vision by directing anything other than the Star Wars Series. He is the Phil Jackson of Hollywood as he only deals with winners.Darth Vader is the epitomy of what a villian should be in a movie. Intriguing, dark and potent enough that his presence is felt at every point in the movie. He steals every scene he is in. The mentor relationship between Skywalker&amp;Kenobi is one for the ages. Carrie Fisher at the age of 19 illustrates grace and beauty beyond her years. Han Solo is the maverick &amp; slightly bad boy that females cant resist. There is never been a movie that had such a wide variety of minor characters that are as memorable as Boba Fett, Jabba the Hut, the Jawas, the Sandraiders, Chewbacca, Greedo, the Stormtroopers, and finally C3P0 and R2D2. A pairing of robots whose one sided dialogue is innovative and witty.This is your classic movie pitting good vs evil and boy becoming a man. There will never be a sci-fi movie as good as Star Wars, and simply put to all of those who have tried and failed. One simply can not re-invent the wheel.10 out of 10!!!!</fullReview>

Then it gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger...and I realised this was a film on a different scale to anything I had seen before.It's true - there's more action, more hammed-up acting, more special effects, and a great new take on the ol' good versus evil story. Let's face it, Star Wars is basically a fairy tale - it just has more than its fair share of butt-ugly characters in it.I guess the proof of any movie is how it stands the test of time; with its 20th anniversary re-release it proved just as entertaining as when it first hit the screens.

		<shortDescription>The beginning of my favorite movie trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But not my favorite movie, which is still The Matrix, but it comes very, very close, and in some ways this even surpasses The Matrix. For example the opening scene and the theme music (Da-da, da-la-da, da-da...). It's fantastic old-fashioned entertainment that after more than twenty years, still manages to make a teenager of the 21st century very happy : )The most amazing thing about the movie is the simplicity of the story -- it's so simple it can be summed up in just one sentence: farm boy rescues princess and saves the day. And then George Lucas threw in lots of action with special effects--I don't really mind that they are outdated--plus humor and romance into a cheesy script actually capable of holding it all together without going over the top: how genius is that?Some people may say that it's just a kids' movie, but it's one hell of a kids' movie! Although the beginning was a bit slow, everything afterwards is full of tension and excitement. Spacecrafts! Explosions! More spacecrafts and loads and loads of Imperial Stormtroopers in white armors, blasting at our heroes and heroine! And between the howling and blasting, comic reliefs are inserted which produce an odd but pleasant effect. There are severed arms and laser weapons for the boys, big bun hairdo and romantic moments for the girls (but beware: watch the whole trilogy and when you think back, some become rather disturbing moments. You'll see what I mean.) , and all of the above for the grownups. Parents don't have to worry about violence and/or sex-- it has a perfect PG rating. Whether you are nine years young or nine hundred years old like Master Yoda, you can always enjoy the wondrous space spectacular and the colorful characters who lead us through it.Speaking of characters--which I think, besides the story, is the most important aspect of a film--I loved all of them! Especially Princess Leia and Darth Vader (the sound of heavy breathing will never be the same! ). And I thought the casting was perfect too. There are also lots of weird and wonderful creatures who are not only interesting to look at, they all possess some distinctive quirkiness which makes them, well, alien, while C-3PO and R2-D2 made the funniest pair of robots I've seen! Returning to our kind, Mr. Vader was *the* perfect villain in black; Leia is super-cool for a princess, and Han the "stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerve-herder" gave some extra edge to the movie. And last but definitely not least, Luke Skywalker. Luke is not the conventional hero, but I don't care that some people think he's just a whiny kid, come on, he's only human! And he gets my sympathy. Most people should be able to find something in what Luke goes through to related to. This and the religious undertone of the Force should be reason enough to put 'Star Wars' under the definition of 'universal appeal' in your dictionary.And of course there's the legendary lightsaber...who doesn't know about the lightsaber? It's so famous that I knew about it even before I heard about the movie itself. The lightsabers, along with the X-wing fighters, the AT-AT walkers (in "Empire") and the Death Star are involved in some of the most visually stunning sequences in the trilogy. The floating sandspeeder and the little lightsaber training ball still bring a smile to my face and I'm sure that they will do that for my children as well, just as they did to the children twenty years ago.To be honest, this is a pretty mediocre film, and I agree that it has been praised and worshiped to some ridiculous degree, but it does have so much more than your other 'average' movies. It's a classic Good vs. Evil story wrapped in modern special effect, it has hi-tech inventions and interesting characters who are surprisingly believable, but most of all it was that extraordinary sense of fun that has swept me to that galaxy far, far away. Every time it feels like a new adventure, and I cannot recall many movies which has done that for me. It's like...magic. If you have already seen it, there's no harm in seeing it again. If you haven't, you know you have the guarantee of millions of fans worldwide, but you need to experience it to decide for yourself. All I have to say before you do is: it won't disappoint you.May the Force be with Star Wars forever!</fullReview>

The characters and the world in which George Lucas created formed the solid foundation of a masterpiece of sci-fi movie history.Star Wars is a movie which will never be surpassed in terms of pure entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you think of movies that transcended time you think of "Guess who's Coming To Dinner", or "2001: A Space Odyssey". Star Wars fits this bill to a T. Nothing like Star Wars, with the exception of maybe "2001: A Space Odyssey", had ever been seen up to that point. This movie has influenced more pop culture then any movie up to that time (with the possible exception of "Planet of the Apes"). To have any movie influence a new set of movies (or prequels), is unheard of in movie making. It really says something to see Star Wars more popular now then when it was at it's height in the late seventies and early eighties.An age-old, myth-like story, in a setting that had never really been explored in movie making. If you are impressed with the space movies of today, see the one that started the space movie genre.Plus this gave Harrison Ford (Han Solo), his first real big break. What move needs to be said? If this isn't a classic tell me what is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best picture ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars. There is no doubt in my mind that this is arguably the best motion picture in the history of cinema. It has all the elements and rewards of a great film. It has the premise of classical mythology translated into Jedis, The Force, and The Empire. It has memorable characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2, and the infamous Darth Vader. It is literally a phenomenon by which we can cherish our childhoods and enrich our adult minds. No other film has had the magic touch on audiences that Star Wars had, and no other film ever will. Thirty years from now who will remember the movies of today? But fifty years from now everyone will look back at Star Wars. It is the perfect mixture of vivid storytelling, detailed directing, great characters, and visually stunning action sequences that have yet to be outdone. Star Wars capitalized on everything that a good classic should be, and for that it deserves the highest place on any list of great films. Whether it's #15 by the American Film Institute, #2 all time box office, #7 by IMDB, or #1 by me, it undoubtedly will hold a place in everyone's hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I first saw this movie (you guessed it, as a kid), I've been a huge fan of it and the series. I own it in four different versions, and I have stopped counting how many times I've seen it. To give any description which comes anywhere close to the truth on how completely fantastic it is, you would have to make another movie about it, or draw a painting or something. The story, the characters, the music, the special effects, everything is perfect. I could go on, but I think you get the point. And for you who say the Matrix is better, you are way off. They simply cannot be mentioned in the same sentence. Period.To sum it up, the best movie of all time, way ahead of its time, there will never be any better. This movie changed my life and made me get into movies. If you haven't seen this film you should not count as a human being. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction at its BEST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a devout movie freak, I often stumble upon the question just what exactly is my favorite movie. Without a doubt, I would have to vote for this first installment of my favorite film trilogy ever.I first saw "Star Wars" on video when I was about 10 years old, barely a decade when it was first released, and since then, I have never grown tired of watching it! Seriously, I can watch the entire saga trilogy a thousand times and each time is like a new adventure for me. I first watched "Star Wars" on a very poor quality VCR, but the interesting characters, colorful aliens and awesome starships keeped me glued to the TV set.Nowadays, I've asked people what is it about this movie that they love so much? Some people told me they loved it because of the set designs, others told me they admired the special effects. For all its entertainment value, I have to agree with all those points. But the legacy of "Star Wars" for me goes beyond mere cinematic breakthroughs in technology and visual effects. Yes, American cinema was never the same again because of this classic, and its not just because it successfully resurrected the sci-fi genre, it was able to convey an epic story of good versus evil on a grand scale through a combination of many symbolic elements borrowed from such classic legends as King Arthur and the ancient Greek heroes, something which all of us in one way or another can relate to. I don't think any space movie which came out before this flick was released could ever match its magic as an American cinematic saga.All of us at one point or another have felt a need to find out what is our true destiny and purpose in life, and the story of Luke Skywalker's quest to travel beyond the stars to become a Jedi has a universal appeal in this sense. And that is exactly why I love this film and its sequels so much, its symbolic message to all of us to find our purpose and belonging in this world is a message of eternal relevance. Being an admirer of Luke Skywalker, I feel even now that I am on a destined quest to find out my true destiny in life and to do good to make a difference in this world, just like Luke made a difference to help save the galaxy. Whenever I've had moments where I've felt confused or hopeless as to which path I should take in my life, whether it be personal or professional, I've always looked to "Star Wars" as an inspirational guide. Because if Luke Skywalker could determine his destiny, then so could I.For any of you who would like to be educated and entertained at the same time, you gotta watch "Star Wars" because it is science fiction at its very best. Believe me, the experience of this movie saga will stay with you for a lifetime!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Summer of '77. A Movie Fan is Born.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars? What can I say about this flick? Plenty. This is the film that made me a die-hard movie buff. I was 10 when this was released in '77 and it changed my whole outlook on going to the movies. Until Star Wars, I mostly saw movies at home on TV, edited and with commercials, mind you. This was during the dark ages before VCR's and Cable TV. Sure, we would go to the movies every once in a while, but my folks weren't real big on checking the local listings or reading movie reviews, so we'd usually end up seeing whatever happened to be playing at the local theatre. As a result, I ended up seeing a lot of bad Kung Fu and B Horror films, which is probably why I didn't care if I went to the movies or not. But seeing this movie on a large movie screen with an audience made me want to go to the movies EVERY weekend! I didn't want to wait until they were shown on TV anymore. I thought everything would be as amazing as Star Wars (It wasn't). The characters (Vader is still my favorite!), the cool story, the Special FX, the spacecraft, the aliens! It was almost too much for my 10 year old mind. Almost. To this day I still collect SW memorabilia, but more importantly, I still love going to the movies. Nowadays we get a movie that wants to be "SW for a new generation" on an almost weekly basis. But nothing can compare to the summer of '77 when we got the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ok. Look at Star Wars. It is extremely hokey, and for the whole time, the stormtroopers for some reason can't hit the good guys. For the average viewer today, its just another ho-hum sci-fi flick. But Star Wars is #7 at the top 100. Why? Why is a film that is so cheesy in the top 100? Because of the monumental amount of creativity involved. Take a look at the Mos Eisley Cantina. There are probably dozens of different looking creatures, they all look weird, but are memoriable enough to leave their image in your head. Check out this new phenomenon called "the force". Truly, this is Star War's biggest and most creative idea that has not been taken from any movie...but it is spawned from George Lucas alone. All the characters in Star Wars have such distinct looks and personalities, especially the ever omnimous Darth Vader, that nowadays there are references to them(e.g."the force will be with you, always").So what if its bad acting? so what if its cheesy? Star Wars more than compensates that with the extremely innovative ideas, the unique looking creatures, the cool machines like the lightsabre and the X-Wings, that nobody but George Lucas could think of. Set in a truly creative and vividly imagined universe, Star Wars is a milestone in Science Fiction film making. The persons who gave this movie a 5 or less deserve to be fried just like poor Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen were.</fullReview>

I left the theater in an overjoyed daze. I saw this movie for the first time when I was seven years old. I don't know if it would have had the same impact if I had first seen it at the age I am now.

		<fullReview>Star Wars is absolute genius.The characters, scenery, action, pacing, and rich mythological symbolism combine to create a story so compelling that few are not swept away. I saw Star Wars when I was seven years old, and have seen it at least once a year since then. (Some years many, many, more times than that, but lets not get started.)One of the things that is so brilliant about this movie is that it works on every conceivable level. At seven, I didn't even fully understand the plot, but was still in awe. At seventeen I began to understand the movie on a deeper level. At 23 I had read "The Hero with 1000 faces by Joseph Campbell, and I understood that Star Wars was nothing less than the "Proto-Cultutral Myth." Star wars is the communal dream made glorious reality by the genius of its creator, George Lucas.Today, as a writer, I am constantly awed buy this film. The way the plot subtly hooks the audience in from the very first instant is undeniable. The way the film makes the audience care about characters within minutes of their introduction should be studied by every future writer.Star Wars is the Prolegomena to any Future Film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of "those" people that has seen this movie more times than I can count. I first saw it in 1977 as a six year-old with my parents and we waited in line for 1 1/2 hours to get in. I don't remember my first time and I don't remember my last time seeing this movie...but I do remember this movie. And that is what makes it so great.I've easily seen more than 700 movies but how many do I truly remember, or care to remember? Not many. I've not seen some of the older classics, but Star Wars is definitely a modern classic. It's story may be a patchwork of other great stories, but that does not make it any less of a film.The actors ALL play their roles well and act within their limits. There is humor, action, suspense, and romance, as well as special effects. Even today these effects are impressive. That is another thing that makes this movie so special... it does not date itself. There is nothing that gives away it was made in the 70s. Generations old and new love this movie and the next generations will love this movie and the sequels.Seen together the three movies, Star Wars (1997), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983), are by far the best set of movies made. Oh, they have flaws, but nothing can be perfect, although movies should strive for excellence. And that is what Star Wars delivers, excellence. A terrific blend of mythology, philosophy, action, and adventure. A movie suitable for all ages.I am very picky about how I rate movies, and I give this movie a 9/10. Only one movie gets a 10 in my book, and this is not it. But then, only a select handful of movies get a 9 or better and this is one. Watch this movie and enjoy, it's not the most dramatic or thrilling, but it is one of the most entertaining, and that is what movies should deliver.</fullReview>

Oh...My...GAWD! To see a 70's movie only at the age of twelve that completely blew me away is only a one in a million experience. The special effects are still amazing by today's standards. everything done today is using CGI, but Star Wars manages to still be the one film that has the most jaw-dropping and groundbreaking visuals for any movie to date. there is more to the movie than the Visual Effects. Star Wars is still good enough to set the standards in today's filmmaking. It has an incredible sense of character, with enough in it to keep a person captivated after the tenth time watching it. The acting is exquisite, particularly Alec Guinness, playing the mysterious Obi-Wan Kenobi (he got an Oscar nomination for that role). Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fischer have great chemistry together. The true heroes in this tiny phenomenon are C-3PO and R2-D2, who provide the comic relief that every good movie must have. they are certainly more lovable than a certain blundering Gungan. Oh! And who can forget the deep, bone-chilling voice of James Earl Jones as the fearsome Darth Vader? Brimming with intensity from beginning to its climactic end, it isn't hard to see why this movie is loved by so many. Sorry everybody, but there is no way you will see another movie quite like this. To those who haven't seen it, see it. After that see the next installments to the most popular film series in movie history!</fullReview>

Believe me it dosn't happen very often. When I first saw Titanic there was some applause at the end but nothing like Star Wars. At the time Star Wars was released no one had seen anything like the special effects it contained. This was the Granddaddy of all the Sci-Fi movies that came after it.

Plus, George Lucas is a genius. The storyline impresses me too...for awhile I started to actually think there WAS a "Force"...I still do, in a way.

		<fullReview>Episode 4 is the entry that audiences saw first. Many a child has had Star Wars as a part of their childhood. There is a reason for this, the series was quality entertainment and still holds up to this day. After a rebel cruiser is invaded by the Imperials, Princess Leia stores the Death Star plans into the droid R2-D2 and soon R2 and C3PO are jettisoned off to the desert planet Tatooine. The droids are them captured by Jawas and sold to moisture farmers ( The Lars and their "nephew" Luke Skywalker). Luke discovers a message in the droid and that takes him to old Jedi Knight, Obi Wan Kenobi. Obi Wan tells him that they must deliver the message to the Alderan system and before they know it, the Imperials are on their tracks and destroy Luke's home, which makes him go off on his great adventure and desire to become a Jedi Knight. They meet Han Solo and Chewbacca and need them to take them to Alderan. Darth Vader is one of the greatest villains of all time and the creatures in this flick are very memorable. This movie has it all from memorable lines to unforgettable scenes. The special edition is great too. Many people think the acting is whining but I disagree. This is an American classic and has conceived the epic space films. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of cinema's magical gems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema is full of magic moments, and as a cinephile your mind drifts away just thinking about them. Thus all reflections over those moments will become purely subjective; who can say if the mirage sequence from "Lawrence of Arabia" is better than Dorothy opening the door to Oz. But in my book, the most magical moment is to see the Millennium Falcon coming towards the screen with the sun behind it, right after Han Solo hit one of Darth Vader's wingmen during the final assult on the death star."Star Wars" is far from original. The main plot is very close to Kurosawa's "Hidden Fortress", the final assult on the death star brings up memories from "Dambusters", and Luke returning to see his family burned is a clear copy from "The Searchers". So its not wrong at all, to see "Star Wars" as a hypotext of classic iconographic scenes. But does that make a classic ? The answer to that is no.To me the secret to "Star Wars" is its characters. Pure two dimensional, but so clearly drawn, that it gives them personality. The corrupted evilness of Darth Vader, the charming scroundelness of Han Solo, the humble power of Obi Wan and not to be forgotten C3PO and R2D2, who adds comic relief as well as function as indirect narrating linkers. Its the presence of these characters that drives the movie. Like the characters of Milne's "Winnie the Pooh", the characters of "Star Wars" represent a side of human nature. Crude, simple, but very effective.To top it all off, Lucas chose to make it a modern faery tale. "Star Wars" opens with "In a galaxy, far, far away", which is the same as our childhood stories that opend "Once upon a time". To read the structure of "Star Wars" is as reading Propp's structures of faery tales.All in all, "Star Wars" is a gem of cinema, and it is as valuable to our culture, as the stories collected by the Grimm Brothers. Its not just science fiction, its a collage of visual imagery and archtypes on which we build our own imagination.May the force be with you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands the test of time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in the cinema when it was first released. It was one of the first few films I had ever seen in that environment. I was the right age, and it sparked off an interest in all things sci-fi. I had been a fan of TV series rival Star Trek. Ironic that a film which didn't over-indulge in scientific terms (a parsec is a measurement of distance, not of time!) sparked the true beginning of my interest in technology. This film is superior to the others in the sequel due to its freshness. An epic tale of morality and struggle against oppression set against a seamless background of space and unfamiliar technologies and alien beings. A film which transcends technophobia. A fantasy-adventure movie of which Gene Roddenberry might have been proud. While it is said that Harrison Ford hated the series, no one could have played the part of Han Solo better. No outstanding acting performances, but the sum of its parts add up to an all-time classic, enjoyed by young and old. If you haven't seen this film, you can NOT go wrong with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can still remember watching this movie everyday over and over again with the same level of enthusiasm. This was the movie that made me realize as a 5 year old that movies could be pretty damn cool. The story of Star Wars was very easy to follow even as a kid. The special effects were groundbreaking for that time (I might add they still hold up well to this era of CG visuals). John William's score is still one of my all time favorites and really was the first sci-fi movie to use orchestrated composed music that was completely original. That brings my next point about Star Wars, I never considered it being an actual sci-fi movie. It may take place in space, but the story and characters made it more of an adventure that just happened to be in another galaxy.I don't think another movie will ever capture the imagination as much as Star Wars did for me. This is one of those movies that I will with-out-a-doubt want to view with my children. It's rare for movies to appeal to kids and adults the way this movie does. The first installment was simpler, yes. It was not as advanced, yes. The story wasnt as interesting as Empire, yes. BUT!! Star Wars is still my personal favorite in the original trilogy. (And Darth Vader is still one of the greatest vilains in movie history)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, this one is a classic (1977 version).It was great when the re-mastered, re-released version came out a few years ago, to be seen once again on the big screen. Fine, that it may have been how George Lucas wanted the film to be originally seen, but in 1977 at only 6 years old, it was that version that knocked me for six.I can't remember having seen anything at the cinema before that, so if it was the first ever film I'd seen, that fact, along with seeing the film on a huge screen, those opening credits, that fantastic music, the Star Destroyer sweeping overhead, and that was just the first few minutes.No film will ever surpass the effect that Star Wars had on me. Star Wars was my childhood, It has been a big part of my life, and maybe the reason I like to go to see movies at the cinema rather than wait for a video/DVD release.And to hear a few years back John Williams play the Star Wars theme at a concert in London, seemed just incredible.Star Wars doesn't need to be justified for being a top movie. It just is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why is this movie called a classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>how can people still worship this movie I can't understand. Classics are movies that stand the test of time. This one doesn't. The special effects are dated, the acting is nauseating, and the whole movie is just boring. The only thing that this movie has is the music. John Williams is one great musician. But the movie doesn't hold up now. If you look at the two sequels, they are much more entertaining. Somehow I find them soooo much better. At least they have some story and some character development. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is súch a superior movie to this one. I think the reason why this movie is being rated so high is because people remember how they experienced it as kids or teenagers. I'm sure they had quite a lot of fun when they first saw it, because the SFX were so good, and the story was simple and uncomplicated. But this movie is no longer entertaining today. I was bored silly when I first saw it a few years ago. Then I rented the sequels and found out they were much better. This movies had much more interesting stories and better dialogue. Maybe George Lucas is to blame. He certainly broke new ground when he made this movie, I got to give him that, but the superior sequels were directed and written by others (not many people know this). A while ago, George returned to directing with the prequel, EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE, which in my eyes was a complete disaster. That movie made me even more dubious of Lucas' writing and directing talents. BUT, getting back to this movie, today watching it is a waste of time. Trust me, you'll be bored to death if you rent this movie today for curiosity purposes, like I did. G'day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that forever changed filmmaking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't already been said? Star Wars is the most influential film of the 20th century. It took a dying genre (science fiction) that after 2001 A Space Odyssey, was reduced to low budget horror films with creepy organ music and made it hip again with it's "larger than life" sights and sounds. By borrowing elements from fairy tale stories and western movies, George Lucas created a universe that none of us had ever seen before! Star Wars changed the way movies are made. Most of the special effects were experimental and created just for the film by FX guys Who had just came out of film school. Those same FX have now become the standard way of doing things in films and TV. Feeling that sound is 50 percent of the movie experience, Lucas also changed the way movies are heard by creating the surround sound system that puts the audience right in the middle of the action. This movie must be seen in the theater in it's full 2.35:1 widescreen ratio to fully feel the magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is so embedded in pop culture that reviewing it like any other movie would be to undermine its impact. It's a science fiction spectacular in the tradition of old Saturday morning serials, but with amazing special effects that revolutionized film as we know it. It's character list reads like a pop cultural glossary: Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan Kenobi... These aren't just characters, they're institutions. We hear these names and immediately remember the magic that Star Wars brought to an entire generation. It's bigger than creator George Lucas and star Harrison Ford combined; and it has spawned the largest fan base since Elvis or the Beatles. The film's qualities, the wonderfully imaginative people and places, the lightsaber duels, starfights and cryptic "force", all contribute to a movie and a phenomenon so popular that it can never really live up to its own hype, but comes darn close.</fullReview>

(the kind of opinion that makes you grit your teeth and smile) However, I think that we often forget after seeing the film the thousandth time over, that it is a masterpiece in writing and film making. This is a film that brought mythology to a modern form and defied the concept of what futuristic or otherworldly was. It is not science fiction, though most would jump to categorize it as such- it is fantasy. It is mythology. It is tragedy, drama, comedy and romance. It is human- though often presented as alien- and human at its best.Star Wars has transformed many of our lives, if only by introducing us as children to creativity- or by introducing us as adults to what entertainment should be. ANH was a writers dream and a filmmaker's inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STAR WARS: SPECIAL EDITION (1997)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The impact of STAR WARS on those who are writing about movies today can be measured by the number of reviews or articles of the past few months which began as follows: "I was x years old in 1977..." The release of George Lucas' seminal blockbuster 20 years ago was the kind of happening which affected a generation of movie-goers, and I include myself in that generation. I was 10 years old in 1977, and when you were 10 years old in 1977 you were not judged by whether you had seen STAR WARS; you were judged by how many _times_ you had seen STAR WARS. It awed us, it delighted us...and yes, hyperbolic though it might seem to say so, it changed us.As much as it changed the people who watched movies, however, it changed the people who made movies even more. Hollywood heads were sent spinning by the success of STAR WARS, a film with no stars, a simplistic story-line out of old Westerns and some nifty special effects. It was not long before studio executives realized that two fundamental lessons of STAR WARS could be translated to other films: 1) If you made a special effects-laden adventure with a modicum of skill and dropped it into your summer release schedule, when young potential movie-goers had summer job money burning holes in their pockets, they would come and come again, story be damned; 2) One successful film could turn into one or two more, plus action figures, lunchboxes and T-shirts (the twin goddesses of Franchising and Merchandising). And thus STAR WARS begat the "event film," which begat BATMAN, which begat TWISTER and INDEPENDENCE DAY. And they slew the medium-budget film, and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth.You can't really blame Lucas for what has happened to American film-making, though, because there is no way he intended for crass commercial concerns to become so dominant. There is no way STAR WARS could have worked if he _had_ had such an intention. Lost in all the ink spilled with references to Joseph Campbell, back-brain mythopoetics and anti-technological humanism is the fact that STAR WARS was not a great movie. The most surprising thing a viewer might find in the SPECIAL EDITION has nothing to do with with the dozens of critters tossed into the backgrounds, but rather how restless he might get waiting through the first half. For nearly an hour, STAR WARS is characterized by the fussy quarrelsomeness of C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels), the intergalactic Leo Buscaglia sermonizing of Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the laughably petulant plea by Luke (Mark Hamill) to "go to Tashi Station and pick up some power converters. STAR WARS wasn't a great movie; it was, however, an extraordinary movie-going experience. You sat in a theater with a few hundred other people and for two hours you were utterly transported, because it was innocent in a way no film can ever be innocent again. You felt as though you were part of something joyous, a celebration of cinema as fantasy and a celebration of good triumphing over evil. In an era when you can see the veins bulging on big-budget action films as they strain to impress you, STAR WARS was effortless in its enchantment.That movie-going experience is what this re-release is all about. The difference between STAR WARS on the big screen and STAR WARS on the small screen is the difference between Mount Rushmore and a picture of Mount Rushmore, between Wagner on a cassette deck and Wagner played by a symphony orchestra. If there is an element of not-inconsequential element of nostalgia in the way crowds will flock to this re-release, that is understandable; many will be hoping to re-capture a youthful moment when they fell in love with movies for the first time. STAR WARS: SPECIAL EDITION may end up disappointing those who come to it as though on a pilgrimage, but the dazzling editing of the climactic trench run will certainly remind anyone who has seen what passes for a "spectacular" in the last few years how exciting a science-fiction adventure film can be.There has been some consternation over the idea of Lucas fiddling with such a cherished film, but frankly, I don't understand all the fuss. This isn't a case of someone whose only connection with a film is ownership of its rights deciding to colorize it; this is a director's attempt to realize the vision he always had for his film, a fairly common practice in an era of "Director's Cut" video and laserdisc releases. Some of the new additions are merely window dressing, including Han Solo's (Harrison Ford) encounter with Jabba the Hutt; others, like a scene between Luke and his friend Biggs (Garrick Hagon) help set up later scenes more effectively. But if anything Lucas has done threatens someone's memories of a first experience of STAR WARS, I can only suggest that the experience couldn't have been terribly profound. In terms of the details, this is a different STAR WARS, but it is the spirit of this story which has moved people for twenty years. Now they have the opportunity to come once again -- some with their children -- and visit that galaxy far, far away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Star Wars" is the best movie that I've ever seen. It's been my favorite ever since I saw it when I was a kid. And it still is today. This is the ultimate sci-fi classic that takes place "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away." I love everything about "Star Wars". It has some of the most memorable characters for a motion picture. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones), and my personal favorites: C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 (Kenny Baker) are characters in the grand tradition of great movies. I'll never forget these characters for as long as I live. The story is excellent, which focuses primarily on a young man (Luke Skywalker) who becomes an interplanetary hero with the help of a wise old man (Obi-Wan Kenobi), a beautiful princess (Princess Leia), a cocky spaceship pilot (Han Solo) along with his wookie sidekick (Chewbacca), and a pair of robot friends (C-3PO and R2D2) as they do outer space battle against a powerful force (and a powerful villain in Darth Vader). The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. This movie features some of the most astonishing special effects that I've ever seen. "Star Wars" broke new grounds in special effects technology when it was made back in the mid-1970s, and the effects got an advancement 20 years later when new footage turned up in the 1997 re-release of the film. The new special effects featured in the 20th anniversary "special edition" could not be done in the 1970s because the effects technology wasn't as advanced back then as it is now.Writer-Director George Lucas thought that the effects would be more advanced in the future so he shot some extra scenes, then he would put the new effects into the mix as soon as the special effects technology became more advanced. The "special edition" was more brilliant than ever. And the sound was more improved. This movie won 7 Oscars and to my knowledge it deserved every one of them. I think this is the greatest movie of all-time. It's sequels ("The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi") and prequels ("The Phantom Menace" and the upcoming Episodes II and III), as good as they are, can never top this one. No other motion picture can top it. "Star Wars" will always be hands down my favorite movie.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

Although it's not as brilliantly watchable as the Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. It is one of the most influencial films ever made. The acting is superb Alec Guiness is amazing as Obi Wan and Darth Vador is Probably the best movie bad guy EVER. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are also perfectly cast. Unfortunately there is no Yoda yet but not every film can be perfect. George Lucas shows what a genius he is by creating an entire universe and the film is accompanied by John Williams brilliant musical score. The special effects are amazing. I don't agree with people who say that Star Wars influenced film to rely too much on special effects as Star wars actually does have a brilliant story, the special effects just help the story to be told in a more convincing way. Also I think many people who think that Star Wars is a childrens film don't understand that it is meant to give us something different to what we experience in every day life this is why it is so 'way out there'. So I conlude by saying that Star Wars is a brilliant Fantasy, Adventure and anybody who says that adults who like it are immature should consider that many adults read Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are these people immature to?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas' most influential film is often considered a science fiction film. I completely disagree with this. A science fiction film, in my opinion, is storytelling which tries to make us feel like things are out of the ordinary. Aliens and spaceships don't automatically certify the film as sci fi. I would consider Star Wars a fantasy, because it takes us out of our world and into another. Star Wars is pure entertainment, fulfilling one of the key purposes of cinema. One of the reasons Star Wars has been so successful is because it is like a cure for everyday life, you can just leave to another galaxy far far way.RATING: 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The popularity of Star Wars has been slipping somewhat lately-there was this tremendous build up to "Phantom", but now things have fizzled somewhat as people have walked out of the film either enthralled or really dissiapointed. There's still quiet hype for "Episode II" though. The original-Episode IV-still holds up well, and the revelations in Episode I help enhance the movie somewhat, and raises a few questions. It's especially shocking to see Vader and Obi-Wan duel, after their first meeting in Episode I, and also it's interesting to think that the villanous Darth Vader was a young kid who raced in pods. Weird! The acting of Hammil and Fisher isn't exactly Oscar caliber, and the Imperial soldiers sound for the most part like their voices haven't broke yet-but there are some superb persomances by Harrison Ford, Alec Quinness and Peter Cushing. The film is a roller-coaster ride from beginning to end, although it drags in the rather unnecessary first half of the Trash compacter sequence, which is also the most annoying part of the film. The "Special Edition" enhances some of the dated effects, and adds some unnecessary new ones(Jabba and the Greedo shot), but it failed to fix the most obvious mistake, when Obi-Wan's saber suddenly shrinks during his battle with Vader. Overall, a fun and exhilirating film, enhanced by the revelations in Episode I, but those looking for more serious fare should look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Ebert used this quote in his review of the re-release of the Star Wars Special Edition trilogy. I must say that this quote is one I completely agree with. Kubrick created 2001: A Space Odyssey and George Lucas created Star Wars; both excellent cinematic experiences. When Kubrick's 2001 was released in 1968, it was unlike anything ever before. Lucas saw what a science fiction film could be and made Star Wars, one of the most original, fantastic pictures of all-time. Several differences contrast the two works, but visually, both are appealing and, as films, both are cinematic benchmarks. What Kubrick did in 2001 was absorbed by Lucas and utilized in Star Wars.That's not to say either work is better than the other. It really doesn't matter which one is better, they are both unmatched in their own ways.Star Wars is an amazing story with fantastic acting, superb music, flawless direction and dreamlike visual effects.*****/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Star Wars" is really a Movie. It's impossible to hate this story of adventure and myth in a galaxy far far away... George Lucas sends us in a world of strange aliens, funny robots and Jedi knights since the beginning helped by the famous and beautiful theme by John Williams. The story of Luke Skywalker, son of the fallen Jedi Anakin, which has to rescue Princess Leia Organa (chief of the rebels) from the evil Empire of Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader is famous around the world. The special effects are fantastic (thanks to John Dykstra, John Stears and all the others...) and the cast is wonderful. The good idea has been the one to choose the cast. the three principal roles are assigned to three unknown actors (in 1977 Harrison Ford wasn't still Harrison Ford) and to place two great stars of English cinema as supporting actors: Peter Cushing is exceptional as the evil Tarkin (he played the movie with slippers at his feet, because the boots were little) and Alec Guinness gives to Obi Wan Kenobi a mythic air. Dennis Lawson (Wedge Antilles) is the uncle of Ewan McGregor. this is a movie which will remain forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gone with the Wind of blockbuster films.An epic that still holds up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May 25,1977.The seventies were coming to an end.Disco was becoming popular.The eight track was a hot item.Drive in theaters still existed.The seventies were also a decade when movies were really moving on.Before May 25,1977,the most popular film of all time was "Jaws".Then,on May 25,1977,a film was released to theaters in the nation and over the next several months,became the most popular epic ever filmed.Nominated for 10 Academy Awards,"Star Wars" became the "2001" of science fiction/fantasy films that set a whole new meaning to the art of Hollywood film-making.The movie is presented on screen with a vision of a large comic book with cliffhangers,heroes and villains that we love to cheer or boo at.George Lucas,who was the director for such films as "THX 1138" and "American Graffiti" shows his genius and gave it to audiences when this film was released.A talented cast is helped by it's great story and screenplay.Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker represents the boy who wants to grow up quickly to be the hero.Harrison Ford as Han Solo represents the hotshot rebel.Carrie Fisher is charming as Princess Lea and Alec Guinness is masterful as Ben Obi Wan Kenobi."Star Wars" was the first film that I had seen.During that time,I knew this would not be the last film I would see.John Williams excellent score won him an Academy Award,a category in which he competed against himself with "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"."Star Wars" is my favorite because it made me discover how much of an imagination that I had.It was such a treat when my nephew saw the film nearly 25 years later.The effect it had on him reminded me how effective and wonderful a movie can be."Star Wars" is a movie that I respect."Star Wars" is definitely the real "Titanic" of movie entertainment.A spectacular epic that should be seen again and again.Make no mistake,"Star Wars" is the true king of epic films and I think this film is also one of the most respected in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic behind Star Wars Trilogy is......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear readersi am not here to say that the movie is great or bad .... nor i am going to say anything about its story. i am sure all of u have seen this movie. If u haven't, then following are the reasons why u should see this movie:1)it creates a sense of imagination in your mind.It takes u away from your everyday life and makes u realise that there is something else then just this planet. The movie makes you feel happy .2) The movie spreads the most important message in life : "there is always a temptation to follow the easiest route in life ,but one must make sure that the route u follow should not harm the life of anyone else. I mean lets be honest, every person has a dark side .But one must overcome his/her greed .Its true that are many people out there who don't have what they want the most, but it doesn't give u the right to blame others for it.Sometimes the luck isn't on our side.But remember that if u escape the dark side of life then u will die happily, without any regrets.3)Star Wars instills the faith that there is something supernatural in this world and the bad guys will always lose in the end.The movie encourages you to be on the good side of life.4)One of the good things about the "star wars trilogy" is, that it gets you involved in the story and that makes it easier for u to understand the difference between the dark side and the good side.The movie is like a story that fires your imagination.5)It also says that unity is important for survival.Most modern movies are based on a super hero saving the world or rescuing a hijacked plane ,bus etc , BUT in Star Wars its Different. After u see the movie u will realise that although Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan Kanobi had the supernatural powers , they couldn't save the people single handedly.They needed the help of normal guys like Hansolo ,the rebel members etc.6) one of the best things of star wars is, that its background music relates to the story in a brilliant manner.The movie is well made and well acted.The characters are well portrayed.In the end ,the answer to the question"how good the movie is?" depends on how well u understand it.Mean while , May the Force be with U , Always....khabc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars the corner stone of Modern SC/FI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have some of the comments and negative views about Star Wars why though very funny and entertaining I sincerely hope the writers were just joking. Star Wars without a doubt is the movie that bought sc/fi back to Big Screen, better it bought "A New Hope" to big budget movies and sequels in general. When as a kid first time going to movies, seeing Star Wars blew my mind. Of course the movie starts off in an abrupt war, this is in fact episode Four, not One. Events are 30+ years in motion. Which add's to the dynamics of it. Why I will say Star Wars is not the best movie of all time, and maybe not even the best sc/fi of all time. Which reminds me in sc/fi they all are good and great movies and narrowing one movie down to being great is impossible. However no can say Star Wars is not the best sequel and trilogy series of all time's.Cash Cow not withstanding the movie is famous in all corners of the world and what George Lucas has done with story telling is like what MJ did with basketball.So yes Star Wars was Great, good and better than the norm of any 70's movie. The low budget even by Lucases own admission was cause this was a B Movie and more so "fun to make."In retrospect it can be taken for it was a good movie and a trend setter for the like's of movies to come including Battle Star Galactica, and beyund.**Special Note**** Dune the movie would have never recieved the go ahead for production if not for the success of Star Wars. Star Trek as well********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Star Wars' is a definate contender for the best film ever. It has everything a good film needs and more... Story: Classic formula of young boy realising his potential under the mystical tutelage of a hero from a forgotten age, set against a backdrop of a universe which has lost its way and is falling into decay and tyranny. Characters: A likeable if melodramatic hero in Luke Skywalker, a cool and loveable rogue in Han Solo (with hairy sidekick), a mysterious old man with strange powers in Obi Wan Kenobi, a spoilt but very attractive heroine who becomes more sympathetic as the film progresses (Princess Leia), a comic duo of robots (C3PO and R2D2) and possibly the best villains ever in Darth Vader and Governor Tarkin. Action: Varied and almost continuous, and of the best quality, with shoot-outs, bar-room brawls, muggings in the desert, space battles, and samurai-like lightsabre duels. Script: Some of the best lines in any film are in 'Star Wars', containing a mixture of witty repartee, mystic preachings and outright intimidation all delivered with impeccable timing and flair. Here are some of my favourites: "You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor - take her away!" Darth Vader to Princess Leia "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The power to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force." Darth Vader to cheeky Imperial councillor "I've got a bad feeling about this..." various characters say this at one point or another. "What a wonderful smell you've discovered!" Han Solo to Princess Leia "Your powers are weak, old man." Darth Vader to Obi Wan "You can't win Darth - if you strike me down I will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine." Obi Wan to Darth Vader "The force is strong in this one." Darth Vader about Luke Skywalker "The force will be with you - always." Obi Wan to Luke Skywalker</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars(1977) has been adored by audiences from its opening night in 1977 to its special edition release in 1997. Star Wars is the film that changed the cinema and ushered in a new era of mega blockbuster features. The only negative aspect is that Star Wars(1977) as with Jaws(1975) brought about the end of creative and risk taking filmmaking that was essential to films of the early 1970's(thus ending the last golden period in film history to date{1967-1977}). This unfortunately brought upon an era of greed in which studios are more interested in piling in loads of cash then in creating bold and great works of film.Star Wars(1977) is superior to Episode one because in a way the characters are more fully realized. Another reason the film is better then Episode one is there is a fresh appoarch to the material with a sense of wonder that's missing from the latest film. Also, The Phantom Menance does not have a character like Han Solo to contrast some of the main characters. Finally, The Phantom Menance seems like a soulless machine while Star Wars(1977) is filled with energy and wisdom.Like other filmmakers, George Lucus was influenced by John Ford's The Searchers(1956). Another film that influenced the director is Akira Kurosawa's Kakushi Toride no Sanakunin/The Hidden Fortress(1958). This is the director's masterpiece of his short director filmography. The battle scenes leading up to the descruction of the Death Star are breath taking.Harrison Ford is both cocky and dashing as the smuggler, Han Solo. Star Wars(1977) is an entertaining movie to view. Its amazing that George Lucus had trouble getting funding to make the first Star Wars film. Alex Guiness and Peter Cushing act professionally in their prospective roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"No words to describe it!" "A masterpiece!" "Dazzling" "The greatest movie ever made!" There is something very strange about these words because, if you ask me, no other movie stuffed up Hollywood more. I do, however, agree with all the above comments used by IMDb users, except one..."Star Wars" is not the greatest film of all time. "Star Wars: Special Edition" is one of them. I believe it has the potential to be the greatest film of all time, but we must wait for another update. I think there is more in "Star Wars" to be said tan any other film, but to actually say it would be doing it injustice. This is a film that you analyse to the nth degree but always come back to the same circuit of analysis.I can understand why some IMDb users didn't like this film. It is corny, predictable, slow-moving and more of a space opera than an action-adventure. But when you think about it, these are the things that make it so great, because we know what to expect and we are able to view it a million times over.To explain the storyline would also be injustice. There is an attention to detail so strong in this filom and all the others that takes our attention off the story and allows us to focus on the journey. Another reason is because it creates a world of such infinite possibilities, myths and legends that even a simple domestic dispute would make it interesting. This film tells the story in the most simple way, focusing mainly on the journey and letting the rest speak for itself (in some of the corniest one-liners ever).This is a gem. A real original film. It is unlike any film made before. It is inspired by the old "Flash Gordon" adventure serials but does not satirise them like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". It does not even pay much homage to them. It just uses them as the basis for what unfolds - an epic, dramatic, operatic and elaborate masterpiece.Variety is another word I use to describe this film. There are more types of actors in this film than any other, from stage actors to character actors, traditional actors to method actors, puppets to computer generated...things. This movie has - and is - everything! It is traditional, yet before its time. It is original yet contrived. It is slow yet entertaining. It is objective yet subjective. How can anyone not like this film?No review of "Star Wars" would be complete without mentioning John Williams' musical score. That, to me, is what holds the film together. Without THAT music, it would have been a disaster. Yes, the special effects are superb. Not everything revolves around special effects, you know!I said at the beginning that this film stuffed up Hollywood more than any other. To be honest, I think that was a good thing. After a few decades, it took the attention off the place, which is what I think George Lucas would have wanted ("I was never in Hollywood geographically"). This was not the "epitome" of moviemaking. Hollywood just thought it was and has tried to make something better ever since.Critic Roger Ebert once said in an essay that Hollywood has given us three kinds of film genres: the Western, the musical and film noir. In a strange way, "Star Wars" is all three of them and so are the other films. Yes, I think the other films are great. Yes, I thought "The Phantom Menace" was underrated. To be honest, I don't think George Lucas could go wrong and I think the updated versions of all SIX of the films will be superb. Maybe "Star Wars" will end up being the best film of all time! What about that?</fullReview>

Being absolutely terrified of Darth Vader and his stormtroopers and being excited by the sheer pace of the film.I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this film and even though I probably know every word of the script, I can never get bored because it takes me back to a place a long time ago when I was an eight year old boy totally enthralled by this fantastic tale of good and evil.Movies don't come much better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no other movie that has affected popular culture quite like Star Wars. I was 10 when Star Wars came out and upon seeing it I was immediately hooked.I was reading the comments and decided to throw my two cents in. But while writing this, I discovered that I find it difficult to rate this movie as I rate other movies - I realize that I donâ??t look at Star Wars the same as other movies. For example, some IMDB users say the acting is superb and some say it is flat and childish. And even though Iâ??ve seen this movie many, many times I had to ask myself what _I_ though of the acting. I realize now that I donâ??t judge Star Wars on terms of acting, plot, special effects, etcâ?¦ Every time I see it, I allow myself to be transported back to that 10 year old, wide-eyed boy and simply marvel at the events that transpired in this galaxy far, far away. Star Wars has the power for many of us in my generation to truly and completely suspend our disbelief like no other movie does.I feel sorry for those out there that donâ??t â??get itâ?? - and not form a rabid, egotistical fanboy viewpoint. Rather, I feel that this movie only has the power to touch those who are open to itâ??s simple, innocent magic. And I feel blessed that I saw this movie for the first time when I was so young. As I now realize after seeing Episode I - The Phantom Menace, I can no longer give myself completely over to a movie like I could then.But at least I can still experience that magic every time I watch the original.</fullReview>

What is easier to do is to compare it with Phantom menace and basically say what is better about it than its well........pretty woeful counterpart. Story, acting etc.....The problem with making a star wars film nowadays, apart from the ludicrous expectations being put upon Lucas and co, is the fact that any actor, especially those in minor roles, will be trying to make as much an attempt as possible to highlight the fact that they are in a Star Wars film. It was obvious with the pod race scene in Phantom menace, the crowd members were practically cheering TO THE CAMERA!!!!!!! And dont get me started on Samuel L Jackson.............even Yoda wanted to make sure he got his fair share inBasically you cant say anything about this film expect that it is possibly THE greatest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day I am going to have children, and I will read to them every night. I will read to them all the greatest stories ever told: King Arthur, Robin Hood, the Wizard of Oz. I'll read stories about knights, cowboys, sorcery and love. And I will read Star Wars. The original trilogy first, then the prequels, then all the other books written about that faraway galaxy. And here's where it gets interesting: I'll read Star Wars to my children when they are 4 or 5...but I won't let them watch the movies until they are thirteen. Then I will ask them if the films were anything at all like how they imagined the stories, and if they say yes, then Star Wars must truly be the greatest movie ever made.That's all it is really. It's a fairy tale for the modern age. I'm sure plenty of people have said that before, but it's true. It has everything a fairy tale should have: strong but unlikely heroes, evil bad guys, magic, romance, swordfighting, chases, suspense, treachery, and Jawas. It should be listed among the great stories of history; in fact, it's only flaw is that it's a movie: you can see and hear it, so it takes a lot away from your imagination. There are no King Arthur movies (at least no really great or popular ones) so you can picture Arthur and Launcelot any way you wish, but Han Solo will always be Harrison Ford, and vice versa.But as a movie, it becomes the greatest story ever told on film, especially when you add in all the sequels that enrich the original film so much. My favorite shot in Star Wars is in the beginning when you first see Darth Vader as he boards Leia's ship and steps over fallen rebels and stormtroopers. After watching the whole trilogy over and over again all my life, that shot is incredible: the first time you see it, Vader looks cold and ruthless, as though he were born and bred for evil. But put it in context with the rest of the story, and you remember that Vader is not really the bad guy, he was once a bright-eyed young boy, he would become a father and a hero but become seduced and made a pawn of the true evil.Lucas is neither a genius nor a god. But he created a world for us that no one had ever seen before except in our hearts and imaginations. What Star Wars is, really, is the closest any movie has ever come to showing pure Imagination. I think my kids are gonna love it.</fullReview>

It has all the classic trimmings of a fairytale and all the excitement of a real adventure movie. George Lucas made it so easy for us to fall in love with the characters and this is one of the movies main strong points. The character interaction is simply classic from the rugged sarcastic Han to the bitter sweet Princess Leah. If you have not seen this movie you have never seen a movie in your life.

		<shortDescription>an epic that stands the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars are the movies I grew up with. I wasn't even born when it came out, but I have two older brothers--so I definitely didn't miss it! I don't even remember the first time I watched it, I imagine I was still in the womb! :) In any case, this series of movies shall be remembered for generations to come as one of the greatest events in cinematic history. It has everything for everyone. Adventure, drama, comedy, sci-fi, fantasy, and even romance. It's an enchanting and sweeping saga that pulls the viewer into a fantastical world with a multitude of characters that one can never forget. The charming Hans Solo who's rough, dangerous attitude is turned around when he meets the beautiful and independent Princess Leia; the innocent Luke Skywalker who always dreamed of bigger things and soon became an honored Jedi Knight and a peoples' hero; the dark and brooding Darth Vader, who seems to be all-encompassed in evil until his son finds the good in him; these and many more are the characters that come to life in this treasured epic. So I don't understand when people scoff at these movies when they've never even seen them. There IS a reason there is such a fuss about Star Wars, and it's because it's good. People that over-analyze too much get lost in the critiquing of a movie, to the point where they can't experience the joy, exhilaration, and wonder movies like this bring about. Now, I'm no big time movie critic. In fact, it's very easy to please me with movies. But maybe that's the difference between me and other reviewers. I watch a movie for fun and for relaxation and for the trip it takes you on from reality into imagination, but they watch it so they can search for something they might never find. Just once, try getting lost in the moment. There is no feeling like it--you'll get chills and goosebumps and whatever--because you'll be feeling in the sublime. That's what movies mean to me. That's what Star Wars means to me. When that perfect musical score by John Williams comes on and the stars brighten in that immense spacescape, I feel it and I know what a movie can do for the soul. When you see it, immerse yourself in it, and maybe you'll know too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't see the retouched 'Star Wars' film with the so called extra footage for anything other than curiosity. The stuff they added was just a bunch of cheesy state of the art CGI images that just clutter up the scenery. The 1977 original version is the only TRUE version. Lucas even wimped out and toned down the great scene where Solo blows away Greedo in the nightclub! What a wuss. Still a great film and a great filmmaker but don't waste your time on the re-released version.'Star Wars' was more than a film, it was an event. It changed movies forever with the single opening shot of the starship zooming over the audiences' head at the beginning. No other epic sci fi film since has been able to show spaceship dogfight battles with as much energy as 'Star Wars' and probably no film ever will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our generation's Flash Gordon; this, the 1st film of the saga, is still the best one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars, now one of our classic science-fantasy melodramas, having been criticized for some valid reasons (too much tawdry merchandising) also takes a lot of unnecessary flack from critics who fail to recognize that they are criticizing elements inherent to the adventure-melodrama. Probably the most significant feature of this film, Lucas' great space-fantasy epic, is that it gave baby-boomers &amp; later generations a chance to have our very own Flash Gordon styled film series. To understand the quality of episodic, Wagnerian opera and to realize how rarely this excellent dramatic form has been attempted through the last 12 decades, is to begin to understand the value of this gift. There are obvious similarities, such as how the musical themes are boldly attached to the characters' entrances. But a lesser recognized relation between Wagnerian opera and adventure-melodrama films is the simple-minded character studies (i.e. under-developed characters) and the accompanying simple-minded sentimentality that in both genres is enhanced by highly sentimental music.The extreme popularity of such films as the Flash Gordon and Star Wars series is manifest in how melodramatic &amp; otherwise sentimental scenes are utilized effectively within an adventurous environment. This reveals an improtant psychological factor in popular adventure films: melodrama &amp; its inherent sentimentality sells. This fact may appear to be at odds with the current "tough love" styled psychological climate &amp; the hard-edged adventure films that are currently popular. Nevertheless, sentimentality is integral to many films as it enhances emotional elements. It should not be underestimated. Some commented that Star Wars is nothing more than a kid's movie. Well, maybe it's time we grown-ups took a lesson from the little folks.Star Wars is a veritable test of the filmgoing public's ability to innocently appreciate a movie, to play dumb and allow ourselves to re-experience the awe that is missing in today's jaded environment. All four films of the saga so far have equally tempted us to experience this element of human frailty so necessary in retaining our humaneness. And of course, many viewers have passed these tests with flying colors. But this original Star Wars film is by far the most operatic in style, thus it is the most innocent &amp; sentimental. This stands to reason - the relative innocence of the film makers &amp; their corporations before high success set in, less merchandising chutzpah intimidating the magic etc.Though all four films have marvelous Wagnerian styled operatic music, with John Williams' themes playing timely and subtly upon each character's entrance etc., this first film introduces the characters' musical themes most dramatically and with the most sentimentality. The Princess's theme, Luke's theme, Obi-Wan Kenobi's theme, the theme of the Force are all extremely sentimental and moving, while the Empire's theme is dastardly and ominous. These musical elements, and other dramatic elements, are what serve to make this one of the most innocently sentimental films in the last 30 years. This sentimentality supersedes any dramatic weakpoints in the film, and there are many, at least as many as one may easily find in earlier melodramas. But it's the audience's responsibility, while viewing a melodrama, to overlook them and groove on the simple, sentimental moment at hand. Critics that overlook this point are foolish, indeed.If, however, the viewer is having difficulty finding the warm sentiment in such melodramatic entertainment, I might offer a bit of advice on locating one's inner sentimentality. That is, perhaps the viewer might try to reach inside and find a place of vulnerable frailty. For example, as a person who lost his father at a young age, I am susceptible to warm father figures on film, such as Robert Young in TVs "Father Knows Best" &amp; Hugh Beaumont in "Leave it to Beaver." That's why Alec Guinness, who plays Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi, is my favorite part. I have a young son and have therefore watched Star Wars dozens of times on our VCR, not to mention the several times I saw it in the theater when I was 21 years old. But I could watch this movie a thousand times, and each &amp; every time I would get choked up, as I still do, over the Ben Kenobi scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie of all time.. I think not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes Star Wars did change the face of movies forever, with the way it showed that big epic blockbusters make money, special effects do as much for the movie as the plot or the acting.I have a hard time believing that anyone can concider this one of the greatest movies of all time, this movie does nothing but blow things up and move at breakneck speeds, and ignores a good script, good acting, and good charactors, it is chock-full-a corny one liners, puppets that Kermit the Frog laugh at, and one dimensional villains, Darth vader for example is one of the worst villians I have ever seen, what was Lucas thinking when he put a mask on the guy? Half the time you couldn't tell what he was thinking because he had the same expression one (the mask), although that shouldn't have been a problem if Lucas was half the director Kurbick was, HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey conveyed more emotion and was much more menacing and all he was, was a ball with lights!Mark Hammill's acting was more like a boy having trouble getting through puberty, Fisher was there to bounce up and down, and Ford's a pretty boy.On the plus side of things the special effects were quite good but seeing it now it looks pretty unbelievable but it's understandable, although Space Odyssey still has much more believable special effects and it's an even older movie.I don't know maybe I'm just ignorant, or there's actually a story going on here. If there is someone please explain it to me, but before you do that just promise to me you won't say "Use the force".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dad got me into the Star Wars Universe and I am glad he did. I love this movie, it is one of my favorite movies ever. First off it is the first movie with it's great effects for the 70's and that's what got alot of movies today having the effects they have. But also the cast was great and the storyline. And you know that there would have to be a great storyline because if you saw this movie when no other Star Wars movies were out, you would notice at the beginning Episode 4, no 1 but 4. So there would definatly be other Star Wars movies to follow with a great storyline to all the movies connecting each one together. If you are a Star Wars Fan you know what I mean. See this movie tonite!9/10 Rated PG for action/violence Also Recommended: The Star Wars Universe and Star Trek Movies/Shows</fullReview>

Star Wars IS fun, that is true...however, I was completely amazed to see it was ranked among the 10 best movies of all time. Those who voted Star Wars as such, have they ever heard of Federico Fellini, Luis Bunuel, Kenji Mizoguchi, Jean Renoir or Sergei Einsenstein? I'm sure they haven't. Please, make a vote if you know a little bit about cinema history, and not about american popular culture or the last Blockbuster hits. You cannot have a good point of view on movie-making if you just know Spielberg, Lucas and Cameron , can you? Geesh, either people don't know anything about movie history or humankind is growing every day more and more stupid and childish. (For Christ's sake!

Best of all: the greatest villain ever to appear on the big screen! (If you don't know who that is then you must see this film!)Perhaps it is simple; it may be a "kid's" film; the acting may not demonstrate great depth, but who cares?This film did not make a great social statement, but it is a great time at the movies (the only way to see it)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would not be fair to talk about this film and say that it changed my life; it wouldn't be accurate. It actually defined what I wanted to be (and no, I don't attend Star Wars meetings or anything like that; in fact, I kinda feel sorry for the guys that actually dress like their favorite characters from the movie).I have been a fencer for quite some time now. I am also an electromechanical engineer with a master's degree in computer science. I am still surprised to think that maybe Star Wars had a lot to do with it. All I know is that this is the only movie I remember watching when I was a young child (3 years old, to be precise), and that the excitement I felt hasn't worn off. Oh no, not the least.This movie has to be my favourite one of all time. The premise is so simple, the acting is straightforward and the plot is coherent. But most important of it, you actually care about everyone in the film. Maybe because character development is so strong throughout the film, or because it is a very well told story. A simple tale of good versus evil, told in the best of ways.And so I am sitting here in front of my computer, wondering if how is it possible that a 2 hour story helped me find out what I wanted to be. I am not sure, but there is one thing I know: the best movie I will ever see is this one. Star Wars.(Sadly, George Lucas decided to destroy the trilogy by issuing a shame of a movie as a prequel: The Phantom Menace. I guess nobody is perfect.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im a HUGE Star Wars fan, so this is the best film ever made. I can remember when I used to watch the films repeatedly, not thinking of anything else. Really nothing as changed. I still watch them all the time. Currently the count is about 500-600 times for each film. What does that tell you, these films are AMAZING! Its not just me, there are millions of fans in the world that love these films. These films are universal, you cant say anything bad about them, and if you do, you have NO imagination or heart.Okay, Im going to attepmt to explain SW to you.Star Wars is for many reasons the greatest of all films because:1.Its a mythological story set against the biggest backdrop we know of, Space! Its a story of heroes and villians, princesses and wizards. The film is just full of mysticism.2.It makes you feel purefied after watching one, you feel as if you dont want to leave this place, you want to stay and see what happens. You cant seem to let it go. You cant help but feel good about yourself after watching one of the SW films. If you dont understand this, you have no heart. I dont care what you say, but thats the truth.3.The Special Effects in this film hold up to even The Phantom Menace. It set new boundaries for how stories can be told and as allowed people to fully express there ideas by creating new F/X technologies.4.George Lucas is the greatest storyteller of all time. Yes, he is. You know it. He's got to be the only person to fully captivate the world with his vision. No other work of art as ever done that.5.This is what films are about. Epic storytelling, inspiring your imagination, and making you feel good.By the way, if anyone wants to see a new addition to the greatest saga of all time, see The Phantom Menace. Its the first part of the new trilogy. Lucas is doing what he does best on the new Trilogy, being the greatest Storyteller of all time.I am trying to wait for Ep2, but its hard. I'll be first in line in 2002! OH YEAH!Until then:"May the Force be with you."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who could have guessed that back in 1977 one movie would change the way movies would be made forever. Star Wars is a magical film that came along at the right time and revolutionized the movie and merchandising business (thanks for all those wonderful toys!). Noted as "Episode IV" - A New Hope stands alone as a perfect beginning to the original trilogy and introduced characters that have become pop cultural icons. The story is simple, but the story-telling is complex. George Lucas invented modern day special effects, directed a then un-known cast, and ultimately spins a fairy-tale about good vs. evil in a galaxy far, far away. A fantastic movie that truly was a sign of things to come.</fullReview>

Not all movies have to have some underlying, artistic meaning that leaves people scratching their heads. Some movies just plain old ENTERTAIN!! You go into a theater and get carried away to another place and have FUN!! My Dad took me to see this movie and I've taken my kids to see it and I'm sure that they will take their kids as well! Of course it has been commercialized and that does take away from it! But, the MOVIE is a great FAMILY film that's FUN &amp; ENTERTAINING!! It should be listed as one of the best movies of all time (regardless of who George Lucas is) for it's popularity thru family entertainment and fun, NOT commercialism. As far as Special Effects are concerned I agree that too much of it can get annoying, but sometimes if done right, can create an entertaining film. It sounds like you want people to open their minds, but it's you that needs too. This movie was never meant to be scrutinized, JUST ENJOYED!! -ROLAND</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fastest film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made (and makes) Star Wars such a unique and powerful film? There has been a lot made of the 'Mythology,' but many other films have a background myth, yet remain unexceptional. Star Wars is perhaps the first and certainly the most successful film to exploit its "Filmness." It tells a story that could not be told as powerfully or convincingly in any other medium. From the brilliantly mixed sound, to the monumental style of shot composition, to Williams' Royal score, Lucas pushes each element of film as far as he can. The editing alone is an unprecedented tour-de-force as this story flies by so fast, you're afraid to blink. Yet the story is simple enough that even at this pace, a six-year-old child can keep up with every element of the story. Star Wars so overwhelms the senses (it's impressive now on TV, so multiply that effect for the mid-70s theatre-goer), one is hardly able to notice the craft that holds it together. Maybe that's why all we've talked about for 22 years is the story. During the theatrical re-release a couple years ago, I noticed what a uniquely constructed film it is, and how each element contributes to the experience. Anyone interested in discussing the series intelligently needs to look closely at the glue of this film, otherwise we're just comparing plot and character, which are in actuality, probably two of the weaker points of these films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On terms of sheer entertainment, the best movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two main things that I base all movies on: Quality and Entertainment. On terms of quality Star Wars is second only to The Godfather, but entertainment-wise, Star Wars is by far the best movie ever made. If you want to see movie with action, suspense, drama, comedy, and basically anything else that movies can offer, see Star Wars by all means.Here are what I consider the ten best things about Star Wars:1: The Story- Lucas's screenplay will always be one of the best in movie history. Star Wars definately should have won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay! The story is utterly flawless and I will forever be in envy of Lucas.2: The Charactors- In writing a brilliant story, Lucas also created some very colorful and memoriable charactors. Charactors that we can really relate to because they act so human (though several of them are not).3: The Directing- Lucas is truely a great director as he showed with this and American Graffiti. In this film he successfully makes a movie that ultimately appeals to kids but still doesn't talk down to adults. He is also very capable of making the dramatic scenes dramatic, the comical scenes comical, and the suspensful scenes suspensful.4: The Cast- Star Wars has one of the most unforgetable casts ever. The actors seem to work very well together and they have to in order to make their charactors work. The naive, heroic farmboy, the egotistical, gung-ho pilot, and the snobby, stuck-up princess, three people who have nothing in common must fight together to survive. The actors work with this very well.5: The Music- JOHN WILLIAMS IS A MASTER!!! The music to this and all other Star Wars films is absolutely perfect! It truely captures the magic of the films and they would be lost without it.6: The Special Effects- Like all effects-ladden extravagandas, Star Wars tries to have the most realistic looking special effects. But unlike some of the newer ones, Star Wars still focuses on story and doesn't just bombard us with one special effect after another.7: The Sound Effects- Brilliant!8: The Editing- Top-Notch!9: The Droids- C-3PO is still the funniest charactor in the Star Wars universe.10: The Outerspace Dogfight Finale- A great conclusion to a great movie.Star Wars is truely a great example of a perfect movie. It's well-made and it's the best source of pure entertainment your ever likely to find.I give 4 and a half stars out of 5 (Only one movie gets 5 stars and that's The Godfather. But Star Wars comes pretty damn close)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tastes great AND less filling!I've loved Star Wars since my youth (who didn't) and even to this day I can't find a movie that is near as fun to watch. However, Star Wars lacks substance. It has love, honor, Zen philosophy and even comments on the human condition, but they are all the "lite" versions, toned down for easy consumption.Many people have leveled claims that Lucas slipped up on his "Episode I", but the original Star Wars wasn't really much different. They're both a lot of fun, both suffer from lack of good acting (with a few exceptions), and both are made for your kid brother to understand.Star Wars is a great flick, and I recommend it highly, but it doesn't hold a candle to other action movies with substance like The Maltese Falcon, The Seven Samurai, or even Blade Runner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies ever. This is my absolute favorite movie. This is the beginning of one of the best trilogy ever. 23 years later this movie is still popular. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Alec Guinness are excellent in this movie. The special effects in this movie are awesome, for an old movie. There's not much I can say about this movie. Only that it brought us three more excellent movies, Empire Strikes back, Return of the Jedi, and Phantom Menace. I hope this movie will be remembered for 23 more years. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes an excellent Sci-Fi movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost flawless movie, absolutely magnificent masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this comment now thinking no matter what I write here, I can not sum up all its glory.This is truly a great movie. It was dynamite in 1977 and when I watch it now its still dynamite. George Lucas has produced this movie with the highest of standards. He employs artistic shots for every scene. Close-ups, long shots, high/low angle shots, dolly track shots, follow focus moving shots. The special effects are great even now by our standards. Fantastic direction, continuity is well kept. Despite the mistakes you'll find in the goofs section, the movies awesomeness out weighs it completely.Given the technology they had back then, excellent blue screen matting was achieved, special effects were spectacular. The lightsabre scenes were great, excellent photographic effects to accomplish that, again Lucas and his team's ingenuity self-demonstrates.The musical track and sound effects were extremely well done.The elaborate sets and locations for filming were well built and very well made. Along with the futuristic props, R2 D2, blasters, C 3PO etc. A glimpse of Lucas' imagination.The actors portrayals of the character were extremely good. Han Solo(my favorite), Chewbacca(what ever it may be), Luke, Leia, and the famous Obi Wan Kenobi, played by Alec Guiness.The perseverance of George Lucas lead to his Special Edition refits of the film. This already high standard film has been face-lifted to a higher standard. This includes a complete new pigmentation film negative been clean up, thus producing a very good picture quality. Sound mixes, dissolves, wipes, and even new scenes have been added an also on old footage, new things have been added on top. Note the new Mos Eisley additions, creatures etc. Death star explosion, battle scenes added too.This is movie which I expect you've all scene, if you haven't, something's wrong with you. All the others in the Star Wars movies are'must see' movies aswell!This movie is the best of the trilogy plus the 'Phantom Menace' I give it a 9.5-10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars Ep IV was amazing. The special effects were eye-popping and the story was simple but powerful. The story was based upon the legends and fables of previous times, and this film was a great way of making these moral values relevant to the youth of today. George Lucas mastered the use of symbols and technical codes to make this story meaningful when read between the lines. In short, Star Wars was a simple, moral story that will appeal to young and old alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No words can do it justice, so I won't say a lot about it.I never watched it in the theaters back in 1977 because I wasn't born until six years later. I didn't grow with all the Star Wars craze, as many Star Wars fans did. I knew the movies existed, but I didn't take much notice of them.But all that changed...One day I noticed that "Star Wars" was on TV, so I sat down and watched it.All though this was on television, it was one of the biggest movie experiences I ever had.The movie is pure perfection, with a great story, incredible effects (at least for that time) and some of the best music ever written for a movie. But what really got me impressed was the incredible attention to detail Lucas had. Every little being, alien, starship you name it, has some kind of history.I later watched the two other movies and got even more impressed, when I saw the whole story unfold.Now, I can't wait for the prequels (although "Episode I" was a little disappointing...) too see the entire story.Quite simply the best movie ever made.I rate "Star Wars" 11 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview> STAR WARS and THE GODFATHER is the god of movies.  This movie didn't really turn me into a super duper star wars fan. But I sure must admit that ''Star Wars'', ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and ''Return Of The Jedi'' ( or in another way the ''Star Wars Trilogy'' ) is by far the greatest movie(s) ever created. George Lucas rocks! The actors where good, the effects was ( in the 70:s ) incredible, and the directing very good. It's an adventure beyond everything else. And the other 2 movies were at least as perfect.  In the ''first'' Star Wars-movie princess Leia is captured by the evil Space Empire, lead by the even more evil Darth Vader, from their gigantic space station, The Death Star. The rescuers are Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewie, but let's not bore you. We all know that. The best thing about this movie is that it combines so many kinds of genres. Star Wars is filled with action, adventure and absolutly fantastic space scenes. But in the same time the movie is human, sad and the romance is not as flat as in all the 80's action movies. The movie is also a saga. The farmerboy finds the eremite, they take help from the raw cowboy and his sidekicks, and the mission is to rescue a princess. That message was strongest in Episode IV.  It is a classic battle between good and evil. And not in a Evil Dead-way nor in a Exorcist-way. It is the Star Wars-way. The best example of the longtime battle.  Once again, I can't say that I'm a Star Wars-freak, but this is the greatest movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So everything else has been said about.......there's nothing more to say. This film WILL last forever. Everything about it lasts: the characters, the music, the story and the name. You can watch this film time and time again and still marvel at the scenery, laugh along with the banter between the characters C-3PO and R2-D2, cry when Obi-Wan was sliced by Darth Vader and rejoiced when the Death Star blew up. The special edition may have taken some of the original feel away from it but in the same time it has given it the updated 90s look which will keep it going for another 30 years. Maybe in 300 years time when all the parts are finally added to it then we'll get a full 24-hour film!</fullReview>

The story is very good, it includes many interesting aliens, locations, and spaceships. There is a wide range of incredible characters. Alec Guinness delivers a fantastic performance as the veteran Jedi Knight, Obi Wan Kenobi. This film also introduces one of cinema's greatest villains, Darth Vader, The Dark Lord of the Sith. The special effects are fair by today's standards. The music lives up to what you come to expect from John Williams. The score gives the movie that old fashioned, golden feel.

		<fullReview>Well when George Lucas took his shot at this movie he may not have known it would turn out to be one in a million but this film went way beyond that. He may not have known that all sci-fi movies would be measured by it. But as it stands today this is the best sci-fi movie ever made and all future sci-fi movies will be compared to it!! I remember when this movie first came out, i was about 7 years old and it was so fascinating to me to see Luke Skywalker with his light saber and the millennium falcon zipping through space at light speed, and the other colorful characters that make up this remarkable film were great too. Another good thing about this movie is you don`t have to be a kid to enjoy it. This movie is a classic and will go down in history as one of the best movies ever made. As far as the sequels go i don`t think their as good as this one but they are very good. rating (best of 5 stars).....5.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film...but take it eeeasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is a very good movie.This is often a dangerous thing to say, as there are very few admirers of Star Wars who -- well, I suppose it must be said -- do not go off the deep end with respect to this film. And so I will proceed with caution, but also with honesty.For those three people who have been lost on an Antarctic expedition since 1977, Star Wars is the story of how young Luke Skywalker is recruited to help fight the evil Galactic Empire and its humanoid incarnation of evil, Darth Vader.The excitement begins within the first few seconds of the movie and almost never lets up. The characters are fun and easily accessible: a naive young boy with a talent for flying speeders and shooting, a princess, a smuggler, a friendly giant from a strange planet, a wise old man, an evil knight, and a couple of robots thrown in for comic relief. There are spaceships and shoot-outs and gigantic space stations and even a Tarzan-like move or two. The plot is clearly laid out and the ending leaves little room for confusion.Yet, despite my admiration, I can still think of a couple dozen movies I would rather see. Many people have been lost to the brainwashing that Star Wars is the greatest film ever made and that its "mythology" is unsurpassed in all of world literature. Neither is true. Star Wars is a good fantasy and a fine film, but somehow celebrating that, for many, isn't enough. It does what it is supposed to do and does it very well, but a tremendous burden has been placed on George Lucas's shoulders by salivating fans. I will admit that I am not as well-read as I'd like to be, but I can still boldly state that, for great mythology, thousands of other works (including films) are at fans' disposal which are more intriguing, yet just as much fun as Star Wars.Come back into the light, my children, come back into the light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars,quite simply, is one of the great film spectacles of all time. Watching this movie reminds me of precisely what makes the cinematic experience so wonderful. Some people go one way and talk about the poor acting or the stock characters, but what they forget or ignore is that this is possible the most purely, thoroughly entertaining film ever. And that it certainly is- it's an escapist movie. From the opening shot of the Imperial ship looming overhead, to the supreme adrenaline rush of a climax in the Death Star trenches, this film is completely absorbing in its escapism. Truly one of the great adventures of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mysterious Greatness of Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Note*** This is a review for the entire quartet taken as a whole.I am the type of person who generally likes darker, more, serious films; often with tragic and rather unhappy endings. I also enjoy straight forward action flicks. Comedies suck in general, unless they are completely absurd or quite dark (Airplane, The , Ace Ventura, Naked Gun, Suicide Kings etc.). So it is strange that of all the films I have seen none come close to being a rival for Star Wars.Yes I know all about the mythological references, the Jungian archetypes. I also know George Lucas has created an amazing universe that seems remarkably real and complete; that has its own life and personality if you will. Yes the special effects are tremendous. More than the effects themselves, it was George's ability to make something interesting from the effects that contributed to the film's success. The effects weren't just well done, but were actually interesting creations and beautiful pieces of art. The Phantom Menace actually is the best for this; I'll never forget the spires of Coruscant, the Gungan city, or the Pod Races and their pilots.But I'm getting of topic. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great for all the reasons above. What other reasons are there? Well the simple plight of Luke is a very powerful one. It is a factor that I feel is often overlooked, just like the good job Hamill does with Luke in Return of the Jedi. I really felt he communicates Luke's deep need to try and save his father, and I don't usually praise any actors performance. Harrison Ford's performance was totally devoid of any charisma and inspiration in ROJ; especially compared to his previous efforts.Once again though I'm getting away from the point, which is this. I really don't know what this series of films has that make me ENJOY them so much. Enjoyment. That's the real crux of the matter. I see other films that I know are good. The actings good, the script original and unique, the action sequences are top notch. Yet so many of these films do nothing for me. No amazement, no sense of wonder, no interest in what happens to the characters. I feel nothing.Star Wars has that something that makes me excited, that makes me feel some involvment. What happens in those films becomes important to me. I care about how it ends, and not just a little bit. Other fans know what I'm talking about I think. They remember that feeling they had when they first saw the films. No other films made me feel like that. It was as if Lucas read my own mind and no one elses and then made a movie just for me; that satisfies some strange need or desire on my part. It is this personal aspect of the films that makes them so precious. Whoa, precious? Yes, precious. I actually cherish these films. In the end Star Wars seem to be about me and for me. I can't actually imagine what it would be like if they were never made.10/10 (all films)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film that almost wasn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few people realize just how close STAR WARS, came to not being completed. Only ALAN LADD JR.'s faith in George Lucas kept the project from getting shelved before principle photography had been completed. George Lucas had huge problems to contend with, an ever shrinking budget, problems with Junior Exec's wanting to cancel the film, and not knowing how the special effects would turn out. During the film's production some corners had to be cut.....existing firearms were remodified to look like future space weapons and FULL FLASH blanks were used (The lazer beam effects were added on later), some of the clothing and gear were left over from previous FOX projects including WW2 movies. There was also another added problem....the film's space combat dogfights and TRENCH sequence. For these a new camera system was needed to meet Lucas's vision, but none was in existence. JOHN DYKSTRA solved the problem by inventing his own computer controlled camera system called THE DYKSTRAFLEX. This 35mm system proved pivotal in filming the outer space battles and DEATH STAR assault. Had Dykstra not improvised this camera system the dogfight scenes and trench chase might not have worked or looked good on film. Despite all these problems the film was a huge hit. Lucas had a sweet deal: he owned the film's prints, merchandising rights, and controlled all future sequels...however, 20th Century Fox had the rights to release all future sequels in the original trilogy. The merchandising rights giveaway was FOX's biggest mistake. However, it was originally believed this film would not be that big of a hit....hindsight is 20-20 I guess. All future sequels were financed by Lucas himself and released by 20TH Century Fox making them independent films of sort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What sort of bad thing can you say about a movie like this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I ever heard anything about Star Wars was in the fifth grade. My uncle is definitely a crazed fan, so he bought it for me immediately when he heard I never saw it. I can easily say one of the best movies of all time. The story was incredibly good and the acting was terrific. Very believable (unlike a certain episode 1 that we all know about). This was a great start for the trilogy and shouldn't have been messed with in 1999. Oh, and I was equally impressed when I got the last ones too. A must see above all others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the bests(except for The Empire Strikes Back!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is a masterpiece. No science-fiction movie(except for its own sequel, The Empire Strikes Back) has the power of Star Wars. It is well written, funny, action-packed, intelligent,well... it is everything! Name a quality, Star Wars probably has it. It features the legendary special effects that this serie is well known for... but it has more(unlike the disappointing Phantom Menace). It is packed with fantastic characters that are impossible to forget. The story is perfectly developed and the dialogue is always good(unlike most actions/science-fiction movies). In fact, why am I talking to you about this movie? You have almost certainly seen it(probably a couple of times) and if you don't agree with me, you probably don't care about my opinion. I am movie fan, but I am also a Star Wars fan. 10 out of 10 is too low for this one! It is a fantastic voyage and if you haven't seen it already, you should stop reading this and run to your video store!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars. Well, as you can probably tell from my name, I'm a big fan. But I think it's impossible to capture the essence of this movie or my feelings for it in a review. Here goes.Star Wars was released in 1977. At that time, sci-fi movies were usually low-budget, bad effects jobs. Star Wars was reasonably low-budget, but thats as far as the similarities went. But then again, Star Wars isn't really sci-fi at all. Star Wars is a genre of it's own. It is set a long time ago, but also in a galaxy far, far away. Many of the situations and characters are based on myths and legends, unlike normal sci-fi works. How many people can empathise with Luke, looking over the twin-sunned horizon, looking for something more in life?The Music. What can I say? John Williams has to be THE greatest film music composer of all time. I'll never forget the Star Wars main theme, or any more of the Star Wars pieces. Music played a huge factor in Star Wars-I don't think any fan can think of Darth Vader without thinking of the booming tones of Imperial March.The special effects are amazing. Even though some of todays computer generated effects are better, can anyone who saw Star Wars in 1977 really say they weren't amazed by the explosions, the ships, and the aliens?Star Wars-thats as good as I can describe it-if you haven't seen it, get down to your video shop right now and rent it. If you have, see it again. Relive the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and all the other characters! This is the best movie of all time!!!</fullReview>

When I say ''My favorite movie is Citizen Kane'', it's true. The reason why I dont say Star Wars is because it should be on everyone's top list. This film is so great, that I consider it obvious to have it on top of your favorite movie list. It's that normal, that I dont even feel the need to answer Star Wars. All kinds of things have been said about the movie, good characters, exciting plot, stunning FX, but what really makes this movie shines, is that its not only a film, its an UNIVERSE. If you are one of the two people on the planet that did not see this movie, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do I have to say about Star Wars? Well, I've prepared a list of some of the outstanding mentionables acheived by this incredible film. -The most popular movie ever. Star Wars has maintained it's status as one of this century's recognition stamps. When people look back on show biz in the 20th century, they will think of Star Wars. -George Lucas has created an Empire of his own, what with all the merchandising.(Star Wars began the merchandising fad that all blockbuster movies have since followed.) -Star Wars has taken the science fiction genre to a whole new level. Before, it was dominated by B-movie campiness with the occasional hit, such as Planet of the Apes,The Day the Earth Stood Still and 2001:A Space Odyssey. But since Star Wars, the genre has seen such sophisticated classics as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, The Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, The Fly, Independence Day, and of course The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Phantom Menace. -The movie itself was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director(George Lucas), and Best Supporting Actor(Alec Guiness). Out of the 10 awards, the film won 6. -The movie was placed at number 15 on AFI's top 100 movies ever made. -The way this franchise has captured the imagination of 2 generations can be explained like this; I remember skipping school with 30 other schoolmates on Thursday, May 20th 1999 to catch the premiere of Star Wars Episode I. We had been waiting 2 years for this moment, and when the day finally came, we could barely contain ourselves. Several of us had brought toy lightsabres, and were playing with it in the theatre lobby, an hour before the movie actually started. We had purchased our tickets a full week in advance. When the familiar scrolling text appeared on the screen, we started cheering hysterically, and we gave the film a standing ovation at the end credits. I personally thought the movie was great, but not standing-ovation great. But it didn't matter, because I was already on the bandwagon as I'm sure most of us are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope, is an excellent film. In fact it is probably one of the best films ever made. This film is the fourth of six movies (two of which have not yet been released), and it tells the story of Luke Skywalker who wants to become a Jedi Knight just like his dad, who he does not yet know is the evil Sith apprentice Darth Vader. The acting is excellent, the story is great and the special effects (especially in the special edition) are the best you will see. 10/10.</fullReview>

I say, if you want to think, read a friggin' book! If you want entertainment, go to the movies!Many people try to say that 2001: Space Odyssey is the better movie in the sci-fi genre. I don't know about you, but the only thing enteraining in the movie is when the apes beat up the fire ape. I can't remember the rest of the movie. I fell asleep through the rest of it.Star wars is criticized for being too kiddy. That is the best part about it. It makes you feel like you were young, with no responsibilities or cares in the world. It lets you escape to a place that you hold special in you're heart.This holds the same for other greats like Willy Wonka, Indiana Jones, and any other movie where John Williams composes the music.SO the next time any of you star wars bashers out there try to say that star wars isn't the greatest of all time, remember when you were a kid and what a movie ment to you back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope is the best movie ever made.Although only the great Sir Alec Guinnness out of all the actors was nominated an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor;and did'nt win;he came home with a Honorary Oscar in 1980.Ok so here starts my review.The movie starts with two droids,C-3P0 and R2-D2 talking about nothing.We then saw the gruesome looking Lord Darth Vader,the commander of the Imperial Star Destroyer Devistator.He boards the small Corillian Corvette,where R2 and 3PO are on and kills all of the soldiers of the Rebel Alliance,who are fighting against the Empire,what Vader belongs to. Then,we find out that the solders are really members of the Alderan Defense Force.Alderan supports the Rebellion.After this scene,we were supposed to see a farmboy called Luke Skywalker;going to Toshi Station on the planet below.Finally;the Princess Leia Organa of Alderan puts data concering the the Empire's new Death Star weapon.She wants the droids to find the General Obi-Wan(Ben)Kenobi;a Jedi Knight.Then Vader finds Leia on the ship;captures her;the droids leave the ship wind up on Tatooine the planet below;they get captured by Jawa's;who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars;who are Lukes guardians;and then the movie really starts.Out of **** stars this movie is rated **** stars</fullReview>

With the heroic Luke Skywalker, the beautiful Princess Leia, the space pirate Han Solo, and not to mention the two helpful robot droids, R2-D2 &amp; C-3PO...there are no other characters in the film world today that can make you feel as if the world (or should I say, their world) was in good hands! And Lord Darth Vader, enemy of Luke and his friends, was sure to be a household name by the late 70's. 'Star Wars' to me was way ahead of it's time and there's no other fantasy/sci-fi film, in my opinion, that can ever come close to what George Lucas has unleashed on us in the 1970's!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is and excellent movie without a doubt. I think it's the 2nd best out of the 4 Star Wars movies. Although the plot maybe kind of old by now. It changed the way we saw movies over 20 years ago, I still wonder sometimes that people might only think it's great because of the special effects. Maybe not us interesting as TESB, but without a doubt a great movie. It has an excellent soundtrack. Listen too the bit where Luke looks at the Sunset on Tatooine. Although I am disappointed that the Biggs Darklighter scenes were cut. After viewing them on the behind the magic cd. I think it would of added a bit more of a human touch too it. I think the Special edition scenes were ok. But the scene where Greedo shoots at Han is just silly. How can a bounty hunter miss from a metre away. It might seem like I am being very negative with this movie, but there just little things I think would of made the movie just that little bit better. Star Wars shows us new worlds, different aliens, technology and it's really interesting too watch. If anybody has not seen Star Wars, I strongly recommend it. 5/5 Stars but not as good as Empire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although alternately panned and hailed for many of the same reasons (cast, pace, story, acting) the truth is that Star Wars brought audiences back into the theaters at a time when they needed to escape and to cheer. It's easy to be cynical and blase about it 22 years later, but it will always rank as one of the best of Hollywood(and non-Hollywood), whether others want it to or not. The line in the trailer for Lucas' American Graffiti reads 'Where Were You in '62?...'. Now people ask 'Where were you in '77?', when it became fun to go to the movies again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some movies that are over rated. Star Wars is one of those movies. Yes, I like the movie. Yes, it is fun to watch. But the dialogue, the plot and even the characters are all fairly standard. So this begs the question: Why is this one of the all time great movies?Simply put, this movie was a landmark film. Star Wars changed the way movies were made and viewed. And, oh yes. Star Wars brought back fun and adventure to the big screen. What this film did for movie-goers and hollywood film makers is the reason this movie is an all-time classic. Movies of the sixties were fancy free, yet to me, very dull. Movies of the seventies were poorly made and dreary. Star Wars brought many things back; the pagentry, the fun, the adventure, the spills, the thrills...etc.This movie also took us to new worlds we had never been to before. This movie also showed us what imagination could do, and without drugs. Life was fun again after you saw this movie. No, the movie isn't great. The experience was great. Star Wars was a movie which the audience lived. We participated in this movie. Front row seat in an X-Wing fighter. There was nothing greater for a thirteen year-old kid like me back in 1977. That's what makes this movie great.Oh, by the way. I still think The Empire Strikes Back is a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not a great deal more praise a first-generation Star Wars fan can give to this film, so I'll just say that I too know how life-changing (and Hollywood-changing) this film was.I think it's appropriate, now that The Phantom Menace has (undeservedly) successfully exploded into the world, that we all take a few minutes to go back and see why this dated 70s blockbuster works, and its late-90s, CGI-heavy prequel doesn't.I never thought I'd say it, but I hope like crazy that TPM doesn't overtake the original Star Wars and Titanic in the grosses.When you're sitting home alone one night, hopping channels as only the MTV generation does (and must), take a step back and try to endure this film uninterrupted. Try to cope with it's three-minute-plus scenes, it's caricatured but distinct characters, it's models-on-wires effects and the 'ooh-look-another-CGI-enhanced-shot-done-in-1997' bits, and I think we'll all agree that THIS film is a classic. Don't curse the critics just because they hated The Phantom Menace, try to see WHY they hated it.Phantom Menace is awful, Jedi isn't a whole lot better, Empire rules, and Star Wars, well, Star Wars is the only reason George Lucas is still anybody.

The cast fits the characters so well, Peter Cushing was never more chilling than as the Evil Grand Moff Tarkin. with his menacing glances and his Bull dog, Vader he keeps the outer rim sector in his tight grasp.Harrison Ford gave us an anti hero a la bogart and created an icon for young boys everywhere. Alec Guiness . like the force, binds the film together, emotionally and in terms of the plot. a great actor in a great role. Carrie Fisher gave the girls someone to look up to, a pretty but gutsy heroine quite capable of handling herself ( and a blaster!) its impossible to sum up in this paragraph the films allure, mystque and staying power ,so lets just sit back relax and let Mr. Lucas take us back along time ago to a galaxy far, far, away....</fullReview>

These elements formed a mythos whose impact cannot be described to anyone older than 21...but there is no one, but no one, born after 1977 who doesn't get tensed up, and feel a shiver in their spine of anticipation for the huge horn crescendo that comes next at the mere mention of the phrase "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."</fullReview>

There they meet Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan, and Han Solo. With their new friends ,they leave to get the data on one of the robots is carrying to a safe location. But they get diverted, instead they arrive on a huge planetoid. It is a really a giant space station. They rescue a kind,beautiful young woman. After they save her, they have a series of adventures trying to leave the space station. They eventually leave the space station. The rebel forces and the empire have all out war outside the space station. Luke and the rebels save the day ,along with Han Solo's help. This movie started the careers of some todays hottest stars. Harrison Ford went on to do the "Indy Jones" movies,the Tom Clancy Thrillers "Partiot Games","Clear and Present Danger""Air Force One", and many others. Carrie Fischer has starred in many movies since this . Her most recent "Austin Powers". Mark Hamill has starred in other things,but most of them seem like b grade sci- fi. This movie is one of my favorite science fiction . It has great special effects and a fairly decent story line. This movie would have two sequels made.

		<fullReview>This has to be the greatest movie ever made. I noticed this the minute the movie ended. It was way ahead of it's time and it still could be today. I loved the simple story, the likeable characters, and the outstanding special effects. When the Special Editions were released I saw it a number of times. No movie will ever capture my imagination like this one did.The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace were awesome sequels and were the only movies that could be compared to the first. "The Force is strong with this one." I couldn't agree more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is incredible to me that something that was as low budget as this movie was can turn out to be so incredible. George Lucas has geniously combined mythology and theology to create a fantastical sci-fi adventure story with plenty of extra treats. I never cease to be amazed at the connections with the two other films in the trilogy and now with Episode I as well. I think this is a brilliantly made film, and it is one that will forever be part of my life. I feel that the actors made the Star Wars universe real and believable, a characteristic of good movies that is sometimes so lacking. I would recommend this to anyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a few movies in cinema's 100-plus year history have become immortal in the way that this movie has, and even then there are few films that have captured the imagination with such élan. People all over the world have said in so many different ways what makes STAR WARS so great, but the greatest thing that can be said about it is that there will never be anything like it for all time. The story resonates for people in every culture and of every generation. George Lucas can proudly take his place among such literary titans as Homer, Shakespeare, and Dickens. His 1977 movie is a myth not just for the 20th century, but for all perpetuity. May STAR WARS live forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very great film, of the 4 that have been made, this one is the one that acts as a self-contained unit the best; you don't need to see the others to know what is going on, and to appreciate the experience. I saw it back in '77 when I was 11, loved it then and still do now.To my thinking the acting is fine for what it is, though you can see that both Hamill and Fisher are rookies, sod it-they get the job done well. This was a Buck Rogers/Western update, not Casablanca, after all.Lucas does a marvelous job soaking us inside this films world, the dunes of Tatooine, the grease and dents of the droids and machines, the rattley ships and the Imperial Perfectoes...letting us know that real people use these things, made them and repair them.(Unlike, say, in Star Trek where everything works perfectly.....how antiseptic can you get?!)The attacks on the Big Castle (and that is what the Death Star is, of course...)first by our entrapped heroes and then by the Rebel force are handled perfectly; with derring do and panache. Lucas spent 10M(today's equivalent about 30M) on this movie, and every cent shoes through nicely. And he obviously loved what he was doing, treating the genres he cribbed so well with tons of respect. That is what helps make the thing work even now, why it made 140M on its re-release in early '97, and why it is easily one of the top 10 films of all time.People go to see films to be entertained; the great director Howard Hawks(Red River, the Big Sleep, Rio Bravo, etc. etc.) said that a great film has 'Three Great scenes, with no bad scenes in between them'--and he wasn't kidding. Those films didn't and neither does this one.**** outta ****, of course. Easily the best of the series, though all 4 are fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what made this movie so great?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Star Wars first came out, we didn't bother to go see it. Very little that was popular at the time appealed to my wife or me. But when all sorts of people, including one of Sharon's sisters who *hated* science fiction, kept raving about it, we went to see it.We took Sharon's baby sister the next night, partly because we knew she'd like it, and partly as an excuse to go back.I have no use for this on TV, but would happily buy a theater if I could afford it just to be sure I could watch this movie any time I felt like it.Why?First off, this is one of those movies that was never meant to be seen on TV. If you aren't in a decent theater, with a good sound system, swiveling your head to follow the space battles, forget it. The movie is larger than life, and needs a big screen.The casting is perfect. From the lead characters to the chemistry between them, to the bad guys, I don't believe there could be a more perfect group. The interaction between Chewbacca, who speaks no English, is pretty amazing.Swashbuckling action - Cynthia told us it wasn't really a space movie, but "Errol Flynn in outer space". She was right. And I think that was part of the magic.As far as effects go, things may look dated today, but at the time they were top notch. Go back and look at any other movie of that era - Star Wars is among the best. Everything is believable - the only way you are likely to find fault is if you are looking for it. If you just watch the movie, it's great.Finally, I think that a lot of the appeal was that it was both a classic, "simple story of good and evil" *and* just great, escapist entertainment. The late 70s were not the happiest of times in the US. Inflation was rampant, everyone seemed to hate us, disco wasn't dead yet, and most of the movies and books being turned out were depressing or boring. Star Wars not only picked up the science fiction baton where Star Trek had left off, it not only filled a void left by the fact that most "adults" missed comic books but wouldn't admit it, but it brought joy back to the arts, and it had a *happy ending* - despite the loss early on of a key character.The sequels were fine, too, but neither had the impact Star Wars did. And half of what made them so great was building on the foundation of that first movie.</fullReview>

They tend to just focus on the sets and special effects and overlook the story and characters. George Lucas took great care on all three.

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie as a teenager on the big screen, I was impressed. But now, as an adult, I feel it is quite over-rated, and not that interesting. The dialogue is corny, the characters are not that compelling, and if seen on the small screen where the special effects(the best part of the movie) don't come through, it can be very disappointing. I've seen it a number of times, and I get bored very quickly. I just can't understand why everyone seems to love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Star Trek the first time around from 1966 to 1968. Then poof. Low ratings. No more Star Trek. Every now and then an oasis (such as 2001 or Soylent Green) would pop up and temporarily satiate my apetite for good sci-fi.Then...Star Wars!!! Man, was my adreneline pumping! I went to the theatre, plucked down my money and was blown away by the special effects, the story, the FORCE!!!Well...it's 30 years later and I realize it takes about an hour and a half for Star Wars to start. The effects are still great (I judge movies by when they were produced, not by today's standards) but the script is drawn out (how many sand dunes do I REALLY want to see), the dialog is not quite as witty as I remember (though some of the quips between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are still quite amusing) and the space battles are very badly editted.Yes, Harrison Ford became a mega-star which I do not at all attribute to Star Wars because Mark Hamill's career went absolutley nowhere and Carrie Fisher only managed to pop up in a Woody Allen film (sorry, can't remember which one).All in all, it's not Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane or 12 Angry Men. It's just an average movie that was produced when the genre was considered too risky for studios to pump money into it's production.See Return Of The Jedi or Phantom Menace; they're more fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I started putting my comments on the IMDb, I just wanted to share with other movie fans my love for the celluoid image. I told myself I wouldn't comment on the great films because I figured evrything was already said about those films. After seeing The Phantom Menace though I realized what a real masterpiece of film making the original Star Wars has become in my eyes. The feelings I have for these characters is one of complete love and affection. You can't watch Star Wars and not care about the main characters in the film. When Obi-Wan sacrfices himself it is still gut wrenching and more effective than 45 minutes of The Phantom Menace. It is true when Star Wars hit the screen in 1977 it changed movies forever. Only a handful of films will ever achieve that amazing feat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've seen it, you know how good it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, people write reviews to tell the ups and downs of a movie so another person can decide whether or not it is their type of film that they would enjoy. I'm sure, if you're reading this, that you have seen this movie, whether it be on T.V., Video, or on the big screen. So I don't know why anyone now would want to write a review of Star Wars. But I'll try. No, I'll do, or do not there is no try. This film revolutionized movies, some say for the worse. But can anyone blame the stupidity and god-awfulness of Batman and Robin on the coolness of this movie? Star Wars is an old pulp-inspired serial treated with respect. Those old films were never given something as original as a lightsaber. George Lucas dosen't treat this anything more than it is, but at the same time, there is an underlying religious and mythic aspect to the film. Luke goes through the same transformation as Bilbo Baggins and other epic characters have gone through. He is reluctant to go on his mission at first, but through a series of events he is thrust into the center of action. He mets the guardian father-like figure in Ben Kenobi, the doubter in Han Solo, and the evil personified character in Darth Vader. In this particular film, he is whiney and naive, in the second film he is the learner, and in the third film he, finally becomes a hero and is a Jedi master. But I've already gotten too preachy. This may be a theological and mythic film, but it also is fast paced and fum from the get-go. What I'm trying to say is that it is the link between classic and summer action blockbuster. If you haven't seen it...oh...never mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw STAR WARS, way back in 1977. I was 7 at the time and of course i was totally blown away by the experience. Needless to say that i watched it again during the years everytime i got the chance. Then video appeared. By now i must have watched this at least 50 or 60 times. I still love it, but of course i just don´t get to feel the magic the same way anymore. And i realy miss that.One of the things that contributed to my disappointment with STAR WARS, was when i read a series of "forggoten" books writen by an american sci-fi writer called E.E.DOC.SMITH. This guy for those of you who don´t know, was the man who invented the whole concept of the genre, in wich STAR WARS is included, an area of sci-fi, known as Space-Opera. Giant space battle cruisers, lazers, light swords, young heroes, space mercenaries, robots ,evil cyborg villains and space battles the way we know them. ALL these were invented by E.E.DOC.SMITH way back in the early 30´s up untill late 40´s, when he created a series called "LENSMAN", that you might even heard of because there is a Manga movie made out of them. Anyway this guy, was the TOLKIEN of sci-fi, Space-Opera. Every cliché we now know, because of the STAR WARS movies, was invented by E.E.DOC.SMITH in the 1930´s. He created everything !Among his books writen in the 30´s, there is a particular serie called "LORD TEDRIC". This was one of his "forgotten" works, because at the time of writing, it was no more than pulp fiction and nobody took it seriously because nobody except kids read science fiction these days. And so it got forgotten during the years. What is so amazing about "LORD TEDRIC" books, is that, we find, a young farm boy who becomes a hero, a space mercenary who becomes his friend, an alien cantina, two robots, a giant battlestation the size of a planet which is a sphere and blasts planets with a giant ray gun, an old mystic master, a frisky courageous princess, a villain which rules the sphere and he´s half man half machine, dresses in black and wears a mask and a cape, called FRA-VILLION (two names. ring a bell ?) and most impressive of all a strange FORCE wich is the basis of the story, (only this one is artificial and scientific). Anyway, there is much more but i guess everybody gets the point by now. Read the "LORD TEDRIC-THE BLACK KNIGHT" by E.E.DOC.SMITH for example if anybody is doubting this.This was what disappoints me in STAR WARS this days. Are all these things in "LORD TEDRIC" books just an incredible coincidence ?! Even the trading politics from the new Star Wars movie is present in those books.And George Lucas sued BATTLESTAR GALACTICA for imitating STAR WARS ?!!!I still love STAR WARS, and im glad they keep doing some more movies, but i just don´t think much about the imagination of George Lucas anymore. My first disappointment was with WILLOW, which followed exactly the same formula of STAR WARS, then i read "LORD TEDRIC" and i couldn´t believe what i was reading. Anyway, i still think STAR WARS is a very good movie, which everybody should see at least once. And despite all this years it still isn´t dated. Only the good movies are like that. So i don´t think it´s that terrible as some people think.But i would love for someone to ask George Lucas, about DOC SMITH´s books.Coincidence or not, but im very curious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite all-time films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's to say that hasn't already been said? I love this film. I love practically everything about it. Of course, I grew up with this movie, so it represents a lot of my childhood and the fun that I had with it. The characters are like old friends to me, and the story has always been one of my favorites.What I like most about the movie are the characters. A lot of people have criticized some of the actor's abilities, but looking back on it, I don't think the movie would have been as memorable without the character dynamic that it had. No one else could have been Luke Skywalker. No one else could have been Han Solo or Princess Leia or C-3PO. The music is both gorgeous and rousing at the times that it needs to be. John Williams is by far one of the best cinema composers, and this remains one of his finest works.The sets are great, giving a sense of the alien worlds that Lucas wanted to convey, and this film has its share of moments that work so well. My favorite scene of this movie features Luke watching at the twin suns of Tatooine set, frustrated that he's not going anywhere or doing anything with his life after yet another argument with his Uncle. This small, quiet scene, accompanied only by Williams' score speaks worlds in those few moments than most movies do. It's testament that special effects and CG can't replace the powerful simplicity of human emotion.All of the elements of Star Wars work so well together that it's hard to point out just one positive thing about this movie. It's a film that if you haven't seen (if so, how has living on that deserted island been), you need to. This is one of Lucas' finest achievements without compare.I have to rate this movie twice. The 1977 version is easily a 9. The 1997 re-release loses points because I think the new CG effects actually take away from the story. I absolutely loathe the revised Han Solo/Greedo shoot-out scene. It looks cheap and unrealistic, and Greedo must be pathetic if he can't kill someone from across a small table. This version gets a 7 based on overall blasphemy of a movie that had nothing wrong with it in the first place. It should have been cleaned up and nothing more.Well, at least Jar Jar Binks wasn't added to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the greatest movie ever....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a sophomore in middle school, and Star Wars was still on modified to fit your screen, no THX mastered, VHS tape, I watched the Star Wars trilogy repeatedly. Before then, I had never really been a Star Wars fan. I had only been old enough to see Return of the Jedi in a theater, and it really didn't catch on for me. However, since my sophomore year I have been a fanatic. Why? Because Star Wars actually helped me through one of the more difficult parts of my life by giving me a positive message a feeling every time I viewed the trilogy.A New Hope, the first in the Star Wars saga, is perhaps the best of the trilogy (although I think Empire is a better motion picture) because it was a visionary breakthrough. The kind of storytelling in A New Hope had never been seen before. "I long time ago in a galaxy far, far away" has become our generation's "once upon a time." Star Wars really gave us a much-needed fairy tale (a sci-fi fairy tale). The way the special effects were done was new, the kind of machinery and creatures had never really been thought of before. All of this is layered in with a classic story of a simple boy who rescues a princess with the aid of a pirate and a wizard. The Force, a sort of stand in for different religions became almost a religion of its own. George Lucas created a living, breathing universe while telling his story, giving others a chance to play around in it. All of these traits give A New Hope the title of one of the greatest movies ever made.The acting in A New Hope is adequate. I admit that some lines of dialogue are cheesy, but I have never encountered a movie that has had perfect dialogue. Mark Hamill got better as time went on, but he did a good job as a wide eyed farm boy. Harrison Ford did a good job as a nervous, but seemingly self-assured smuggler. Carrie Fisher was good as a strong princess. Alec Guinness, well, his acting is always excellent. David Prowse and James Earl Jones create a menacing Darth Vader. Other supporting characters also did a good job.However, I think the best parts of A New Hope come from the story, the aliens, the machines, special effects, and the music! The special effects help tell the story in A New Hope, and they do the same thing in all the other Star Wars movies. All of the machines and aliens were things that I had never seen before, yet seemed familiar. They help to create the illusion of a living, breathing universe, with things happening elsewhere. Also, the music for A New Hope is top notch, and John Williams led me into the world of classical music. If you can get the Star Wars: Special Edition soundtracks, do so and treat yourself!As a devoted fan to the Star Wars saga, I have read most of the books and comic books that have come out, I've played all the games, I have seen the Star Wars trilogy on the big screen, more times than I can count on VHS, and I have seen The Phantom Menace seven times! Because I am such a fan, I probably will not see anything wrong with any of the stuff that comes out on Star Wars that some outsiders do. However, I think A New Hope is the closest a movie can come to being perfect. See it now, if you have already seen it a million times or if it is your first time. ***** stars (out of *****.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is absolutely the best of the "original" trilogy and better than The Phantom Menace. It introduces the characters that us fans have grown to love and sets the pace for the next two films that follow. The plot is relatively simple: Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) steals plans to the Empire's Death Star, an armored battle station with so much power it can destroy a whole planet. While seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness), her ship is attacked and she is captured by Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) and held hostage on the Death Star. She hides the plans in R2-D2 and him, along with his counterpart C-3PO meet up with Luke Skywalker, who joins forces with Obi-Wan, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to rescue the Princess and destroy the Death Star. Although this is the best of the trilogy, some of the dialogue is rather bland, but the performances are top notch. The interaction between Han and Leia forshadows their love in the next installments, and Obi-Wan starts to teach Luke about the Force. Darth Vader is excellent but he isn't as evil as he is in the other two films, that honor goes to Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, commander of the Death Star that orders Princess Leia's home planet destroyed. The effects are also good, the battle at the end of the film is exciting and suspenseful plus you get to see Vader pilot his own Tie fighter! This film is outstanding and I think with each viewing it gets better and better and better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the Greatest movie of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not imagine there will ever be anything like Star Wars again. Maybe other movie will make more money, or win more awards, but no movie will ever become such a part of our culture as Star Wars. It is hard to believe anything will inspire the kind of craze Star Wars has, and spawn the other industries the way this movie did.As for the movie itself, I was too young to see it in 1977. But as a second generation fan, I must say that I cannot think of any greater experience I have had as a moviegoer, not even as I sat in the theatre waiting for a brand new Episode 1 to begin. There will never be another movie quite like "Star Wars", a movie that has truly become bigger than just what's on the screen.It is hard to go further into superlatives in order to describe this movie, but even on the TV screen, there is nothing quite like seeing the quintessential archetypical story unfold, the amazing special effects, still impressive in this day and age. This movie is the ultimate movie experience. It is at the same time well-acted, visually enticing, and has an earnest, almost believable quality to it. Star Wars is the zenith of the movie industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars: A New Hope is one of the best movies ever made. Not since 2001: A Space Odyssey have audiences been astonished by fantastic special effects and a terrific storyline. The plot is relatively simple: Princess Leia, working for the Rebellion, is kidnapped and held hostage by the Empire on their armored battle station Death Star. Luke Skywalker lives on Tatooine, a desert planet, when he encounters a message from the Princess that she put into R2-D2. He teams up with Ben Kenobi, Han Solo, Chewbacca and the 2 droids, R2 and C-3PO to help rescue her. This is the best in the trilogy in my opinion. The acting is a little raw in stages, especially coming from Luke, but the interaction between Han and Leia is entertaining, as it fortells their eventual relationship in the other 2 films. Alec Guinness is great as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he has the best line in the film (The Force will be with you....always." and his fight with Vader was good too, but it's boring when you think of how Luke and Vader fought. Darth Vader wasn't as evil in this film as he was in ESB, that trait fell to Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, commander of the Death Star. Prime example: when he orders Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan, destroyed to show the Death Star's capabilities. The battle scene at the end is awesome, lots of special effects and Vader even pilots his own special TIE fighter! As you know, the Death Star gets blown to bits and the good guys win, that is until ESB. This film is a lot lighter compared to the darkness the next installment has, but it has some of the best scenes, best acting and best music to make this the best of the trilogy. If you haven't seen it, rent it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lucas goes soft with his "Special Edition."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'new' version version, I guess, primarily exists to fill the Lucas coffers, helping to fund the second trilogy. Most of the 4.5 minutes of new footage works for the better of the film - only one sad moment works against it ("Star Wars" non-aficionados bear with me here): Greedo has been made to fire first at Solo - point bank! - and HE MISSES BY TWO FEET.Obviously, Greedo's 'new' poor marksmanship would've had him dead as a bounty hunter way back in bounty hunter training. Lucas, in his graying years, has apparently gone soft, and doesn't want any of his world famous characters to do anything icky, like kill anyone without decent provocation. As far as I'm concerned, this new action ruins Solo's entire pirate-like characterization. And it's ridiculous, to boot.That '70's movie brat grit is all gone, replaced with a plasticity more damaging than anything else George is trying to protect us from. I can just imagine other "Special Edition" moments some sensible person talked him out of: the interrogation droid tickling Leia instead of drugging her, Tarkin flustered because he was "only bluffing" when he told Leia he would destro y Alderaan, and parachutes coming out of all those destroyed fighters.I still gave it a ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Episode 1 opening in Britain on July 16th I decided to take a wander down memory lane. Now I wished I hadn't. Mark Hammill has to be one of the worst actors ever!. I squirmed every time he gave a line - he ruins the entire film. The only redeeming factor is Harrison Ford who knows he's making a kids movie and manages to save face. Hell, even Chewbacca puts in a good performance. Another irritating aspect of this movie is those damn droids - if Lucas was taking the mickey out of the audience then he succeeded. Enough said about them the better. Dialogue is another aspect that really highlights the problems with Star Wars - at times you think Lucas is really making strides then bam - another 'Power convertors' line pops up.I can remember as a young teenager thinking this movie was superb, but in order to enjoy the movie now would require accepting that mark hammill can act - something that can never really be done!5/10.</fullReview>

Because the public is the only critic that matters.Another amazing thing about star wars is it's longevity. It was released over 20 years ago and it still has a huge fan base. This really says something, because in 20 years Titanic will be all but forgotten.Another cool thing about Star Wars is the fact that, unlike most films, it can spawn several sequels and Prequels without people getting bored with it. The Star Trek movies are pratically forgotton a few weeks after hitting theaters. But Star Wars keeps strong.So, is Star Wars the perfect film? Yes, undoubtably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only released in 350 theaters across the nation in May 1977, Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope soon became the highest grossing movie of all time. But, there was a bumpy start for the space drama, now revered by millions as a type of quasi-religion. It took five studios for George Lucas to have his screenplay, "The Adventures of Luke Skywalker" picked up by 20th Century Fox. Soon, changed to Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope (and formally called Star Wars), it changed the face of movie viewing, and made "nobodys" Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford known world wide. It made words like "Wookie" and "Obi-Wan Kenobi" household names. By 1997, when re-released so a new generation, my generation, could see it on the big screen with the technology it was intended. While still holding the ever-famous, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..." the only changes in the re-release, on video, is a few scenes, including one with Jabba the Hutt. And, by skyrocketing to #1 money grosser of all time again, Star Wars proved it has everlasting appeal to generations to come.

		<fullReview>The first of Lucas's greatest. From the first famous lines to the last battle, not a dull moment. When it first came out in 1977 it was a hit with great special effects, now, over two decades later, it is a legend with great special effects. After finding a message from Leia hidden in his new droid, R2D2, Luke follows Obi - Wan Kenobie, aka Old Ben, to Mos Espa, where they hire Han Solo to take them in his ship, the Millennium Falcon, to Alderaan to find Leia who is now Darth Vader's captive. In an attempt to get info out of her, he destroys her home planet of Alderaan. From there Luke, Leia, Han, and Ben go to the aid of the rebellion beginning the story that is known by heart to people of every race, age, and culture. It was one of the first film scores to take people captive, one of John William best. It set the expectations for future special effects and sound as well as sci - fi plots. The acting was none less than any other genre of film. The directing was that of a legend. It took the usual, and made it fantastically surreal. Box office earnings and critics are a over emphasized. Only the movie counts, the plot, the acting, music, effects, cinematography, its all there and thats what matters.Go ahead, watch it. I dare you not to like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantasy that can improve reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much can be said about the Star Wars movies and it's probably been said with greater eloquence than I can put forward.The best thing I can say is the philosophy put forward in these movies can better people lives, if they would only take it to heart.Just this week (mid-May 1999) a co-worker, annoyed with the negative criticism towards Episode One, remarked "What can they expect, it's just an effects fantasy; you're just supposed to look at it and be dazzled!"When I remarked that the philosophy within it was as equally compelling (anger, fear, aggression, are the dark side...) he scoffed, "Oh that, it's so obvious!"Obvious yes, but how often do you take it to heart I asked. "Oh. . . yeah," he finally said.Maybe this series hit me at just the right time (I was 5 in '77), but I've constantly found ways to use examples Lucas has demonstrated in fantastic ways as a grounder in reality. It's really hit me lately, with hype surrounding the sequel, how as adults we lose sight of these simple principles. Now I'm an adult with adult problems, yet this "kid's" movie, both provides escapism AND helps me put perspective on life's problems. Anger and aggression are easy ones to find examples for; confronting your fears is the big one for me. It's easy to let it get the best of you. I've learned from the path Luke Skywalker tread that when I've had to confront my dark side (professors, then employers, then clients) I must prepare myself for the resistance and temptation that would come my way (I certainly didn't want my hand cut off).Perhaps I'm reading too much into what I've seen, but the fact is I saw it and it helped me and I believe it can help anyone open enough to accept it. And what's more, it's just a really cool flik!When's the last time a movie gave you all that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly say that my serious obsession with Star Wars has only started recently. I am anticipating the new Star Wars with awe and this one, so far, is one of my favourite movies! After my first viewing of the film, I just thought to myself, "Is that it?", thinking that there surely must be more. I had already seen Episodes 5 and 6 and when I saw this one I still felt that it was missing something. I can say now that people should not be considering this to be a movie. Sure, it's filmed as a movie, it is shown at a movie theatre and it was intended to be a movie-that was George Lucas' intention-but it isn't a movie. It's the fourth chapter of a myth, a myth that is almost complete.After so many years of Star Wars and with the obsession becoming so vast that absolutely everything has been translated from it, I don't think George Lucas realises what he has done. He has invented the modern day myth! He has created something that will go down in history as world-wide culture and yet he is still saying; "It's only a movie." It puzzles me that after so long, Mr. Lucas has still failed to realise what he has done. I think there should be a temple with a golden statue of him in it, but hey, if he continues to make this myth then we're happy!This movie is what it is thanks to the creative genius that is George Lucas. Certainly, the special effects were what pulled people into movie theatres to watch this, but they got so much more than what they bargained for. Every type of emotion, character, culture, religion and more is in this chapter, providing creative and inventive genius. The plot is simple yet becomes far more complex when it continues and unfolds more and more stories as it goes along.Perhaps this movie was considered classic because it was made by a Hollywood studio. Hollywood was breathing down Lucas' neck for a while and I believe that it was 20th Century Fox themselves that gave this movie a bit of class and a feel of watching the good old films of the fifties, except with a lot more creative energy involved. I think that George Lucas still didn't get enough freedom in the past and was held back in the first one(or is that fourth one?). Episodes 5 and 6 were different. Lucasfilm financed it themselves, but they had different directors at the helm. With the upcoming chapter, Episode 1, George Lucas is given unlimited freedom and is able to do whatever he wants. It's my opinion that if Episode 1 was released back then, it would have been considered too confusing and complex, but thanks to Hollywood, George Lucas has been able to create possibly the best "movie" of the millennium, and he can now complete his vision that takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...</fullReview>

First of all, I wasn't born and raised under the Western culture so I don't know and I don't care how the Star Wars movies did became an important role in your movie history. And I am not a Star Wars fan also. But still, I would like to tell those who commented the movie as 'bad acting','unrealistic battle scenes','poor story-line' that perspectives are changing all the time. You can't judge a movie with today's point of view. Besides, the original Star Wars was made 22 years ago. With no computerize animation but with plastic model vehicles. What do you expect from that -- a 3D I-MAX version!!? And don't complain on the story-line if you haven't seen the complete trilogy. It may not be the best movie but there is no doubt that at 22 years ago Star Wars was a great achievement in the movie industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film first came out, a lot of critics were bad. But it really turned out a big hit. (for example: the same is now happening with Star Wars: The Phantom Menace) When I first saw it I just couldn't believe my eyes. Can there be even better story? I guess not.All characters are well developed, and all actors/actresses did really well. But some people still criticize them. I know they weren't some professional actors, but I think they did the best they could. They really made this tale look alive, like it could happen to all of us. For the first time I really felt like being the part of the movie. Like being in it. Fantastic feeling.I'm really sad because I missed the Special Edition in the theater. I have never seen any part of the trilogy in the theater. Well except the Return of the Jedi-Special Edition, but that was in Stereo mode not in surround. So, I'm really looking forward to own this trilogy on DVD (when it comes out - I hope soon).I think you all know what is this movie about so I won't reveal you the story.

I could go on for hours defending this movie from critics (like they actually enjoy any movie!) but all I have to say is that George Lucas has created a story that everyone loves to watch. The characters are specifically designed so you can relate to them and hope that you are the boy that saves the galaxy or the cool guy with the hot rod. It also tells us that no matter how great the odds are or how big the bad guy is, people can fight back with the dream for what is right and just. Bottom line...the little guy can make a difference. The story, musical score, special effects, and imagery makes this the pinnacle of moviemaking. George Lucas didn't follow the formula for a successful movie, he WROTE the formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, don't get me wrong. I am not a born Star Wars hater. Until very recently, I was a massive Star Wars fan.I am not a fan any more, nor could I ever be. Star Wars is an addiction that I have thankfully shaken off.What makes Star Wars such a fanatic subject for people? I'll tell you why. It's all in a carefully crafted system. Note, for instance, the way a Tie Fighter screams on the same note as the music. I'm not sure which note that would be, but I am convinced they are the same. The same goes for Chewbacca's scream and Vader's breathing. They are all carefully made to sound unique, so that people will get an overawed feeling of being in the prescence of an entirely new universal culture. The same goes for visual cues. Note the continued motif of the Hexagon - in the Tie Fighter's wings, in the Star Destroyer's silhouette, in the shape of the Death Star's corridor. This, again makes people feel they are watching a completely unique universe.Then, of course, there are the cues that are _not_ alien. For instance, the Bantha is clearly meant to be an alien version of a camel. His horns are a massive version of a sheep's horns. Again, look at the clothing of Vader, Kenobi and Leia. All are in some classical style, that makes one feel one is watching something magically significant....when in reality we are picking up visual cues that are reminiscent of something else that tugs on our memory.One further thing. This is why Star Wars will _never_ look obsolete. SO many people think it is because of some magical artistic RUBBISH. Actually it is because Lucas rose so much above 70's visual aspects, and used shapes, sounds and music from the past. For instance, the use of classical style music was a shrewd maneuver, as it is more timeless than some 70s psychedelic garbage. It makes the appeal far more likely to last.Finally, the music itself. John Williams is the true genius of the entire shebang. He was the one who made Star Wars rise above the cartoonish crap it was. Whoever saw a cartoon with a truly classical-style score played really loud? If such a cartoon existed, it would undoubtedly make greater impact. And why? Because having old-style music that is timeless (note how much it resembles 19th century patriotic music eg Elgar) makes each event seem more important than it is. How could the scene where Skywalker stares at the suns have as much impact without a somber fanfare that plays whenever he daydreams? It would not.So there we have it. I would urge all Star Wars fanatics to consider carefully what I say. Why does Star Wars "strike a chord you can't really place"? Why does it look "timeless?" Just consider my points and be more critical of Lucas's cunning ploy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the great adventures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was too young to see this movie when it originally came out but I watched it at least 50 times (probably more) on video when I was a little kid. I probably would have seen it a lot more if it hadn't been for Raiders of the Lost Ark and the first two Superman movies. I had most of the figurines and the models of the ships and buildings. I even had my own lightsaber! Of course when a movie is that ingrained into your life like that it might be hard to look at it objectively but I must say it's still a very exciting movie. It doesn't have the kind of imagination behind it like The Empire Strikes Back has; it's probably more surface than substance. But what a surface! From the tightly edited action scenes in space to the variety of creatures and robots (not to mention the variety of sounds coming from those aliens and robots), Star Wars is probably the most pleasurable of all guilty pleasures. C-3PO and R2-D2 are the most "human" of all the characters and very endearing. Alec Guinness is a true professional who brings emotional weight to his sometimes goofy lines. And of course James Earl Jones has the most foreboding voice of any villain in the movies. Darth Vader is a legendary creation. The first Star Wars may be slightly outdated now but it's still vastly superior (and still influential) to the fantasy/sci-fi/adventure movies they're making today like Independence Day, which ripped off the Star Wars trilogy left and right. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars, truly, is one of the greatest films ever made. Not because of great acting, not because of a great script, but just because it is pure fun. Everything about this movie is enjoyable; the plot is a good old adventure story, where an unlikely hero saves the galaxy. However, even with it's standard plot, Star Wars catapults itself to a higher level than most adventures. First off, it has amazing special effects for its time. Even though it was made for only $10 million (pennies compared to some of today's blockbusters), it still shines through with very well-done visuals, especially with some of the alien costumes. Needless to say, this movie inspired an incredible cult following, as well as four sequels, two Ewok T.V. movies, a horrendous Christmas Special, and too much merchandising to count. All in all, this is just one of those movies that I like to watch over and over again, one that almost grows better and better with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Best Sci-Fi Movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I chuckle when I see the Star Wars critics using their 1999 movie attitudes to disparage this movie. It was made 22 years ago, before many of them were born or were still in diapers. If they were around in 1977 when it was released they would have found that the special effects it introduced were light years ahead of anything else at the time. Others have criticized the acting, though I think many of them are most likely Star Trek fans. It was not meant to be overly serious, with a lot of comedy throughout and just enough seriousness to keep it from being a farce. It had a message that was an outgrowth of the late 60's and early 70's philosophies that mixed Eastern and Western beliefs. I know I enjoyed it thoroughly and I was an adult at the time of its release and my whole family also swear by it. I don't hesitate to show the trilogy to my Grandkids because the quality of the filming is still as good as many modern Sci-Fi films I have seen and a good deal better than most. The ideas it teaches are those I want them to learn, without the filthy language prevalent among today's pictures. There are few family pictures that exist in the world today and we need to push those that are good. This is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Version Is The Best Of Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Star Wars is one of the truly great films of all time because it manages to be space/action epic in the tradition of the epic films of the 50s and early 60s that had largely gone dormant in the 70s up to this point (save for the disaster films). But what really makes it shine is that this is the only film of the trilogy where there seems to be more emphasis on story, characters, and achieving a gritty kind of realism that starts to slip away in Empire Strikes Back and by ROTJ, with its overabundance of Muppet Show rejects in every corner, is almost eclipsed completely and everyone else from Harrison Ford on down seems to be coasting.It is because of this that I prefer the original version and not the special edition, which to me epitomizes every annoying wrong turn that took place over the next two films. The very fact that Lucas felt it was more important to spend millions of dollars putting back a very redundant and pointless Jabba scene (all Jabba and Han do is repeat the same dialogue Han had with Greedo earlier!) and changing the look of background scenery while leaving all of the Tatooine scenes involving Luke and his friend Biggs on the cutting room floor should prove once and for all that for Lucas, special effects takes precedence over character development and depth.Star Wars also stands above the sequels in that it has the best performances in the series. The dignity that Alec Guinness brings to the part of Ben Kenobi is enough to make you take seriously the idea of the Jedi and the Force. By contrast, when we heard the same ideas spring from a Muppet with Grover of Sesame Street's voice in the next two films, the whole thing just sounded silly. Also, it's high time that the late Peter Cushing get some greater recognition for the cool, slimy villainy he projects as Governor Tarkin.I continue to enjoy watching the Star Wars trilogy in their original forms, but I am definitely not a Star Wars junkie. The series reached an apex in the first film, and while subsequent films are entertaining they'll never top the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! How do I express my admiration in a few short words for a story that has so affected my life? These (for I'm talking about the trilogy here) are some of the best movies ever made. Some people call it "shallow," "cheesy," and other degrading words, but these people clearly don't understand the depth of this story. I hesitate to call it science fiction. True, it is set in a different galaxy with beings different than us, but I think the main emphasis is the story and not the setting. Lucas and the screenwriters did a fantastic job creating a believable world. The Force is the most intriguing concept. It is a religion, really. I just saw Lucas' interview on Rosie today. I knew I'd been reading the right meaning into the story! God is Love! This is a story about a conflict between genuine good and evil. It's about a fall from grace and finally, redemption. It's so inspiring! There is hope for all of us if there is good in Darth Vader!This movie has touched my life. I love it. I'm inspired by it. It is so very like my own philosophies about life! I can't watch it without weeping! I hope that Episodes I-III will live up to the original trilogy.Oh, and I just HAVE to add (even though it might lower my credibility in writing this) that the men in it, good and evil, are incredibly beautiful. Just cream on the cake!! It makes a wonderful movie even better!May the Force be with us.</fullReview>

The part of Luke Skywalker is played perfectly by Mark Hamill, and Harrison Ford is a perfect Han Solo, the role that launched his career. Look for James Earl Jones in the role that made his voice famous as the deep baritone of Darth "Anakin Skywalker" Vader. This movie contains some of the most quoted lines in history including "may the force be with you" and "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away." Lucas was denied a much deserved Academy Award for this film, one of only five he's directed. An oldie but goodie. See the original, then see the Special Edition.

		<fullReview>This is one of the best science fiction films of all time along with "Star Trek." "Star Wars" set the pace for just about every sci-fi film -- including the sequels -- in terms of special effects and story telling. I was only five-years-old when I saw the original and enjoyed it.The "Special Edition" is cool, but the story remains unchanged; only appended with 90s-style visual effects and new scenes -- some funny -- including Han Solo's (Harrison Ford) interaction with Jabba the Hut.The theme is simple. It's good versus evil. A young farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill) who obtains two obnoxious runaway droids -- R2D2 and C-3PO -- is recruited by an old hermit named Ben (Obi Wan) Kenobi (Alec Guinness) to help rescue Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the clutches of Darth Vader (David Prowse). Luke must also destroy the Death Star, a powerful weapon that's capable of destroying planets -- including Leia's home planet, Alderaan. Enough said. "May the force be with you."

One important element to a successful sci-fi film is believability.

		<fullReview>Dad didn't say where we were going. In fact, I don't even remember what he told me, but it was a surprise. As we got closer and closer to the theater, I began to suspect where we were headed. I asked my father if we were going to finally see it, and he casually responded, "Maybe." It seems my begging had paid off.My anticipation was growing with intensity. Finally we descended into the theater, through the doors and into the darkness, it felt like a big cave and I was a bit nervous and entirely excitable, feeling as though the previous six years of my life had lead to this moment.The moment that Darth Vader walked on screen, I knew this was a villainous force to be reckoned with. I was terrified.In the years to follow, my father took me to meet R2-D2 at the CN Tower, from whom I received an electric shock, despite the warning, (I just had to touch him) and later Darth Vader at some mall outside the Toronto area.Each person at the mall received an 8x10 glossy black and white photo pre-signed "Darth Vader". We were in a line to take turns meeting him, shake his hand and receive our photo. Hundreds of people were there.My father told me to get Darth to turn around so he'd be able to get a picture of us together. As my turn approached, I watched each previous kid take his hand-shake and then fall to their knees. I began to get nervous naturally.Now it was my turn, "Get Darth to turn around" repeating in my head. I took his hand and began to speak softly and timidly. He then began to squeeze my hand forcefully and push me to the ground. I had no choice but to fall on my knees like all the others. I was speechless from that moment on, took my photo and found my way to the exit line.My Dad was disappointed, having been in position for half an hour or more, and asked me why I didn't get him to turn around?"I was scared, Dad."I'm not sure if he thought that I was afraid to ask anything of anyone in general, or if I couldn't muster the courage in this one case, but needless to say, Darth Vader has proven to be the greatest villain of all time in the history of cinema.You can probably gather the impact it had on me then, and I can assure you no film has had such an impact since. It remains among my favourite life experiences, and the re-release of the Special Editions was as welcome news as the "prequel" Phantom Menace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Science-Fiction Movie Ever Made- A Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have lost track of how many times I have seen this great movie. I know I have seen it at least 50 times!! I now watch it occasionally on laserdisc (widescreen of course!!) and I NEVER get tired of it. I first saw it in 1977 a couple of months after it opened, when the world was just beginning to go Star Wars-Crazy.There is so much that is good about Star Wars. Adventure, excitement, great action, great characters, not to mention some great actors and performances (Alec Guinness steals every scene he appears in, and then some!!). The special effects were ahead of their time, and even if they look somewhat primitive today, they did set a standard and actually revolutionized visual effects in movies.Often imitated, never equaled. This is a film for the ages. The amazing thing about "Star Wars" is its endless appeal. It is equally enjoyable if you are a young kid or a senior citizen.Star Wars is without a doubt one of the all time classic films and one of the best of the 20th century, right up there with the Godfather, Citizen Cane, et. al.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I was not around when this film first came out in 1977, but I caught it the second time around (1997) and was absolutely amazed! I fell in love with it! It is definitely part of the best trilogy of the 20th Century!!!!!!Critics might argue that this movie is based on simple myths, but there is so much more to it that makes it one of the best loved films ever. The characters are now household names and are even mentioned in songs and in other films.Luke Skywalker works on his uncle's moisture farm on the desert planet of Tatooine, yet he longs to be a pilot for the rebellion. When his newly purchased droid Artoo Detoo {R2-D2} takes off to find Ben Kenobi, Luke follows with See Threepio {C-3PO} and learns that his father a Jedi who fought with the rebellion. R2-D2 contained a message to Kenobi from the beautiful Princess Leia, asking for help. I, too, could watch this movie for all eternity and never get tired of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The modern "Odyssey"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars has become what Homer's Odyssey was to generations " a long time ago..." The movie captures the true spirit of the human soul, the concept of good triumphing over evil, David versus Goliath and countless other aspects. When I first saw the film it was a cool movie. But upon enlightenment in the wonders of the world I found how Lucas takes so many classic elements of great stories and combines them to make one fantastic tale. The tale of a nobody in the middle of nowhere gaining the chance for adventure and excitement, teaming up with a wiseman and two scruffy characters to rescue a princess from an evil dark knight, an almost medieval tale by modern standards. Most of all the movie captures the ability to never grow old, in that one can watch the movie countless times, memorize the lines word by word, yet still have one's heart beat faster, bring smiles and cheers and boos and hisses at the sight of Darth Vader. How many films can do this??? The Odyssey, one of the oldest works of literature known to exist does this too, for all of those who have read it in its entirty. Just like the Odyssey, almost everyone has seen Star Wars and like the Odyssey to many, have viewed it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't deny that at one time I thought the Star Wars Trilogy was one of the greatest epics of this era. I would look back and list the greats: the epics of Gilgamesh, Odysseus, and now, Luke. That was when I was a child. Recently I saw it again and somehow I cringed at the acting, and the predictable and universal journey of the hero (Moyers and Joseph Campbell), but if it wasn't for the cool special effects I would have bolted out the door. Great for its era in the department of special FX, but rough storywise. You're better off watching American Grafitti.</fullReview>

Not every movie has to be an artsy-fartsy flick to be worth watching. Yes, maybe 2001 was a better pure sci-fi movie, but it's also the most boring 2+ hours I've ever spent in my life. Star Wars never tried to be a thinker's film - it just tried to be entertaining, and managed to do so in a way that no other film has before or since. It's a perfect example of the whole being much greater than the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie makers nowadays are too wrapped up in creating the biggest explosions and seeing who can spend the most money. I am not too sure what budget Star Wars was made on, but George Lucas has managed to pull all the important things needed to make a good film in together, and it makes for a thrilling ride.....It all begins in Tatooine. We are slowly introduced to each of the main characters in the first 45 mins or so. Then the tale begins, with a hyper-space chase involving Imperial Star Destroyers (quite awesome machines) and a small rebel band. From then on, we are treated to stunning 'blaster' fights, romantic 'light sabre' fights and a thrilling conclusion to this chapter, when the rebels finally destroy the ultimate power in the universe, the 'Death Star' - a space station so big and powerful, that we witness it destroy an entire planet (and not your small moon type either).People often ask me to choose which of the three films is my favourite. My response to them is that all three are part of one big movie, so gripping, tense and exciting that I wouldn't want to start rivalry between the three (you can't have sisters arguing now, can we!!)</fullReview>

Now fight it out.The acting is pretty good, although Alec Guiness is a horrible choice for the fight scenes. The effects are classic: while not overly done, they are realistic to a T.In short, it's a great movie to what, but don't over-analyse plots and such, this is not the point of watching a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many reasons why I like this film and its two sequels so much. First of all, I grew up with the trilogy; It has great nostalgic value. Also, it's a film you can watch as a kid, and then watch as an adult and see so much more. The main thrust behind the first film is the idea of the human spirit vs. technology. This aside, "A New Hope" is relatively lightweight, but that is what draws so many people to it. They know they're going to have fun watching it. Yes, it lifted plot elements from comic books and Saturday morning serials and (most obviously), Kurosawa's "The Hidden Fortress." However, this was the point. It blended these and other elements with a mountain of imagination to come up with something new. George Lucas has said that he originally intended "Star Wars" for a generation growing up without fairy tales. It is ironic that, although many consider this the pinnacle of science fiction cinema, it's really not science fiction at all. The technology is taken for granted, it's set in the past rather than the future, and it really is, at heart, a fantasy epic, in the truest form of the word. The only difference between the "Star Wars" trilogy and the classic epic form is that it is written in prose rather than verse. However, I don't think anyone can blame it for that. Also, I couldn't end without at least mentioning John Williams' breathtaking score. Using the "leitmotif" approach, Williams accented the rhythm and pulse, and provided insight into characters and situations. Many of the characters have identifiable themes or motifs, and this helps the audience, sometimes without their realizing it, understand certain actions the characters take and certain situations in which they are involved. I don't really know if "Star Wars" is the greatest movie ever made, but it is one of my personal favorites, and something I've watched many times. I've enjoyed it every single time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie, I am astounded. George Lucas created such a smart movie with amazing special effects for his time, for anytime. It has everything a film should have. Comedy, drama, action, adventure, romance.. I am so amazed at the way we learn so much about the characters and understand them as human beings. The way that a farm boy grew up and had to save the galaxy from his father was an ingenious plot. Having to chose from good which meant denying his father or evil which meant staying loyal to his blood. Star Wars is more than a movie, it is a cinematic event. When we see the prequels, it will make us enjoy this movie and its sequels so much more. 7 out of 7 stars for this well made motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that changed the standards of film-making forever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the mid 1970's, special visual effects weren't really made to look as real as life, because it was just commonly accepted that it was not possible, so what are you going to do. In 1975, "Jaws" was a film with better special effects overall than anyone had seen before, and when "Star Wars" was released two years later, it took these latest advancements of special effects into space, where it would change the way people looked at special effects. Obviously it wasn't exactly as real as it would look if it were actually happening, and it may have had some noticeable flaws, but it did take the first step towards the realistic special effects we see today. If not for "Star Wars", people would have continued using the special effects that were just enough to give you the gist of what was supposedly happening. Because of the fact that these effects, though cutting-edge at the time, would be dated now, the "Special Edition" was released in 1997 in order to maintain its impressiveness, with updated special effects that are as impressive by today's standards as the originals were in 1977. Although some people thought the story itself was pretty corny, I think it appealed to people with open minds. After all, that has always been the basic purpose of science fiction. The "force" is the reason for the most part that some people feel this way, but I don't think it is as "out there" as some people do. One thing the force can supposedly be made to do is telekinesis, which has obviously been thought of before because there's a word for it. Not that anyone really takes the force seriously in real life, but I doubt anyone can go out and prove conclusively that it doesn't exist in any form, so it doesn't suspend THAT much disbelief. There is some really good acting in the film, such as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), but I believe the most notable performance is Darth Vader (James Earl Jones). Vader is one of not very many movie villains that has been remembered for so long, and he is one that can really scare an audience with his presence. John Williams' music for him does a good job of representing how ruthless he is, although the famous "Imperial March" wasn't introduced until "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980). "Star Wars", although it was the first to be released in the series, is actually part four of a six chapter saga. The reason this was the first film to be released is because it is really the only one that starts out in such a way that you can get away with not already knowing the story so far, and also has a happy ending with relatively few loose ends. It was because writer/director George Lucas was not sure how well it would do in the box-office or if he'd be allowed by 20th Century Fox to complete the trilogy since it was new ground for filmmaking that he made this decision. He did, however, leave enough loose ends that could be expanded into the rest of his already conceived saga just in case the film was as successful as his friend Steven Spielberg was confident it would be. As it turned out, despite the setback of having a pretty small budget, it was more successful than Lucas imagined. I don't understand the fact that so many people are obsessed with every little detail of "Star Wars" and know every little trivial fact about these films, nor do I with all the "Star Trek" fans, but I did think the movie was great, as well as the movies that followed it. It's too bad that a science fiction movie this spectacular will never win an academy award (or be nominated, for that matter) for "best picture", but it seems no science fiction or horror film ever will just because too many people consider such films automatically unworthy just because of its genre (especially horror), but if ever a science fiction film deserved one, it would be "Star Wars: A New Hope". If you're someone who doesn't like science fiction, then this film might not make much of an impression on you but if you are one of the few sci-fi fans who hasn't seen this film, then although you may have missed it in the theater where it was much more amazing than it could be on video, you'd better see this film, then the others if you want to know what science fiction has been all about all these years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This truly has to be one of the most amazing filming endeavours till now. The special effects are barely outdone by those of overpriced and overhyped movies of the last decade. Yet they were created over 20 years ago...and the techniques used for the creation of Star Wars still form the basis of many of the modern special effects techniques. But technology and sci-fi plot aside, this movie could just as well be filmed as a medieval or modern drama and would still carry the same appeal. Rarely have I seen a movie with better rounded characters which are easily identifiable in everyday life. The entire trilogy shows an excellent introspective look at the human mind and soul. Even the 'good' characters have their flaws and struggle to overcome them, and even the 'villains' have their inner doubts. These struggles however are not pushed 'in your face' they evolve and are subtly presented to the viewers. So if you are still one of the unfortunates who still haven't seen it...DO SO! And if you don't like the sci-fi genre, try and look through the sci-fi shell and try and find the deeper underlying principle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I find interesting about Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I have taken Star Wars for granted for a long time...gimme a break, I was four years old in 1977, so for me, Star Wars is just part of me(I'm pretty sure I only know one guy my age who didn't have any Star Wars toys, lunchboxes, sheets, pajamas, Burger King collector's glasses--and I can't decide whether he's an alien or a communist). So, needless to say, it's taken quite a while for me to develop even a little bit of perspective on the actual films themselves.As I try to look at the Star Wars movies objectively, one of the things I've begun to notice about the Star Wars trilogy is that it isn't just a "space opera," and it isn't just archetypal romance...it's a synthesis of different genres. Of course there's all the space opera/folktale/romance stuff going on with long lost evil fathers, twins separated at birth and such, but Star Wars is also steeped in film; for instance, it's a western (don't laugh--Han Solo as "Shane" or Luke Skywalker as an odd commentary on "High Noon"). Incidentally, consider the possibility that the resolution of the Han/Luke/Leia love triangle is Lucas' resolution of the love triangle in Shane. It's also a war movie(duh)--watch the Death Star sequences(think "Flying Tigers", or "Midway")or the Battle for Endor("Guns of Navarone"). And despite the criticism levelled against it by hard-core SF fans, it is a sci-fi movie--is religion better than a good blaster at your hip? What about the dangers of technology(THE DEATH STAR, Darth Vader/Luke's hand)? How about those vague references to cloning--clone wars? I guess maybe we'll find out in May...In any case, while there may be less to them than many drooling Star Wars junkie(I should probably include myself in this category) might like to admit, there is certainly a lot to talk about in these movies, even leaving aside such age-old questions as "Millennium Falcon vs. USS Enterprise...who wins?" or the sorts of questions that keep popping up in Kevin Smith's movies("Clerks" and "Mallrats" for example).</fullReview>

(not to mention some of the best special effects of all time.) I believe that this movie should be number 1 for all eternity.

		<fullReview>The first movie in the Star Wars Trilogy, Star Wars, is in my mind one of the three greatest sci-fi-fantasy movies of the twentieth century. The other two are of course Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi It is my third favorite of the Trilogy, but having said that, the difference between the three is only very slight.When I first heard about the release of the Special Edition, I thought of the Trilogy as a B-grade trekkie series. I went to my local movie theater complex to see Dante's Peak(don't laugh) and learned that it wasn't opening till next week. So I said, What about Star Wars? After the movie I was amazed. How could such an awesome movie be released in 1977? Following this, I proceeded to go to the first general release showings of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in New Zealand.Since that time, I have collected two series of collectors cards for Star Wars, and Empire. And just last Saturday, I was able to purchase a boxed set of the Trilogy: Special Edition videos. Later that afternoon, I saw the Prequel trailer at the theater. My, oh, my, that looks like an awesome addition to the Trilogy.I am now a great fan of I.L.M. who did a great job on the S/FX for the Trilogy.My rating for the film: 9.95 out of 10</fullReview>

Tolkein before him, George Lucas, is one of the greatest story-telling minds of the modern age, and he proves that decisively with this, his ultimate testament.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is one of the only movies that appeals to everyone. It has a great recipe for success. They grab you with the great special effects and creative ideas, then the story keeps you there. It is a deep but simple story that is easy to grasp. Unlike other Sci-Fi films (Star Trek), you don't get lost in the hi-tech mumbo jumbo. It's there, but you get it. The characters are people you can relate to and they all serve a purpose. The droids are comic relief, Han the cool guy, Luke the golden boy hero, and Leia is the strong female that girls look up to. Everyone can take a piece of it and make it their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The" BEST movie ever made...for all ages!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very seldom does a movie appeal to the tastes of everyone. This movie is not really science fiction although some say it is the best sci-fi movie to date. It is more of a fairy tale, which is set in a galaxy far, far away. It has all the ingredients of a fairy tale: good vs. evil, the dashing prince charmings coming to the rescue of a princess, and lots of daring do along the way. It's almost like the story of King Arthur in outer space. What sells it to the audience? At that time, its special effects were considered a marvel of cinematic movie making. Today, the special effects would be considered, well, okay. The characters have become household names: Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kanobi, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO, and Princess Leia. People, as a whole, have spent a zillion dollars on Star Wars' toys, video games, etc. As a result, George Lucas became very rich and famous. The movie's score is the best masterpiece of cinematic music ever recorded on film. Lucas does a brilliant job of directing. The film won 7 Academy Awards. Harrison Ford became an international super star. This all says a lot for just one movie!!! (well, not a whole lot...I could have gone on further and wrote a book about the success of this film.) So, why not claim it as the "GREATEST MOVIE ON EARTH IN THE 20TH CENTURY...(so far)"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As pure entertainment it hasn't been surpassed, not by Jaws, not by Indiana Jones, nor by any other movie made in the twenty-one years since its release. As a "serious, profound" movie, many dismiss it. I think it has a little more redeeming value than that. It isn't a Bergman movie, which means it doesn't meditate on the issues that fuel it. But it does weave together a number of archetypal elements: the lightsaber (Excalibur), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Merlin), a prince (Arthur), a princess (Rapunzel/Snow White/Sleeping Beauty), and two quarrelling droids (Frick and Frack, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the Odd Couple). Even the father-redeemed-by-the child trope is basic. The Force derives from a number of Asian concepts, especially the non-duality of yin/yang, although Lucas makes the slight mistake of giving the Force a moral quality, which only the Force's wielders, and not the Force itself, should have. All these create a mythology for the twentieth century, something which no other movie has managed. For better or worse, Star Wars is our re-version of the Illiad and the Odyssey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw Star Wars movies to me were just a simple form of entertainment. When I first saw the re-release I became an instant fan. I saw the trailer and figured "Sure why not?" I went opening day. I was awestruck. George Lucas's Star Wars is what sparked my interest in movies and now it's more than just entertainment. I don't normally cry in movies, not even the reaallly sad ones, but I did in Return of the Jedi. Because Vader died? No. Because the Ewok died? No. It was because the magician had no more magic and I had seen the three greatest films of all time. But wait! There is hope. May 21, 1999 the Force is with me again! I am more excited than ever.

It also launched Harrison Ford's career, (the highest grossing actor of all time). It also created the largest money-making phenomenon in entertainment ever. Titanic will never beat that. Star Wars and its sequels have changed my life. There is not a minute that goes by in my life where I don't think about Star Wars.

		<fullReview>Why is Star Wars still enormously popular 20 years after its release? Is it the special effects? They're not much today, but awesome for the time. Was it the cool ships and light sabers? Of course that's part of the reason. Is it the acting? With the exception of Harrison Ford and Sir Alec Guinness, it's pretty bland. Is it just nostalgia of 20/30-somethings who were kids and teens when it was relelased? Sure, that's part of it.But above all the rest, the reason Star Wars is still at the forefront of our collective consciousness is the fact that it is a modern fairy tale. A grand, sweeping film where the good guys are good, the bad guys are really bad, and good triumphs over evil even in the face of enormous adversity. That's it! We need more movies like Star Wars today... not crap like "The Saint" or "Leaving Los Vegas"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie so many times, I know the script, I collect the books, ask me any question on Star Wars I could probably answer it.Star Wars is the best movie ever made. It has everything - plot, special effects, great script, endearing characters, one could go on and on about it. It has opened up an entire new universe in a galaxy far, far away. And the best thing about it, it can never end. As I had never seen Star Wars in the cinema it was absolutely AMAZING to see the famous opening line and the prologue disappearing into space. The best thing about it is that it is labelled Episode 4 - a promise of things to come. Of course everyone has seen this movie and its sequels (if not, you've been living in a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . . .) And everyone has to admit that its originality at least makes this one of the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beginning of A New Era In Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I can safely say in this day and age of cynicism and sardonic sarcasm, that I still believe in Star Wars. I wasn't yet alive when this film was released, and I only began to learn of Lucas' legend when Return of the Jedi, but that was enough to get hooked. Star Wars was and is a marvel of movie creation. It lambasted its way into an era of hi-tech special effects, big budgets, and simplistic storytelling. Some call it the death of cinema, but I call it the re-birth of the matinee. People easily forget what movies are and supposed to be. Not moral messages or poignant take on society. A movie is a chance, an attempt to get away from the pains and pangs of normal life. Star Wars succeeds in every way. I was fortunate to see the Special Edition of this film last year, and was pleasantly surprised that none of Lucas' touch-ups took away from the overall magical quality of the movie. Were they needed? Of course, not, but they did not detract. I saw young children who have never heard of a Wookiee come alive again, with giant smiles and sparks in their eyes. Star Wars does its job, and it did its job on me again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twenty one years ago in late August my mom took me to see Star Wars. It is the first movie that I can remember seeing in a theatre. Being four years old I didn't know what to expect, but when the lights went out and that fanfare came on, I was mesmerized. Then the movie started, and when those ships roared across the screen, I just sat there, amazed. As the film progressed I was introduced to all of the characters that populate this film. I remember being frightened when I first saw Darth Vader. I remember the battle over the Death Star, the X-Wings and TIE Fighters blowing up and Luke being chased by Vader. Then, the Death Star explodes. Needless to say, I've never forgotten that experience.Twenty years later, I was thrilled to relive the experience. I went to see Star Wars again in the theatre. It was truly magical, I felt like I was four again, and going to see my first movie. This movie will always be my favorite, sure there are other films that are arguably better. Try telling that to a four year old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Star Wars is one of the greatest films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is a relatively recent film, yet it gives you the feel of a fairy tale. Set a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away, it can be viewed on many levels. At first glance it may appear to be a children's joke fest, but upon further inspection, it reveals a more involved plot than you thought. The conflicts and confrontations involved in it are intriguing, and demand your attention. If this catches your attention, you can delve deeper, into the morals and background of the characters. You find that each person has a distinct personality, one which you can easily relate to. And, whenever you tire of the in-depth probing, you can retreat and revel in the simplicity of the films. Star Wars is a franchise which has spread far beyond the original three films. It has branched its way into books, comics, children's toys, games, and the newly developed prequels. Like an infection, it has saturated our culture, to the point where toddlers run around breathing like Darth Vader. A timeless tale, Star Wars is going to be here for a long time, especially since the additions to it have not seemed to go down in quality; if anything they have gotten better. One has to wonder just how fairy tales like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty got started, perhaps it was an interesting book which managed to worm its way into history. Is Star Wars close to that? Perhaps. It is something to think about.</fullReview>

Darn that stupid Titanic for breaking it's gross $ record! Anyway, why are these movies so popular? They can relate to anyone. From 3 year olds to 90 year olds. They have action, romance, mystery, and anything else you could ever want in a movie. So maybe they don't have the top technology, so what? I mean, neither did The Wizard of Oz, but you don't hear people knocking that. My only hope is that the new installments are as good as the classics. If they're not, I'm not going to sweat it.

		<fullReview>If you know someone who says Star Wars changed his or her life, don't laugh, because it's happened to more than a few of us. Before May 1977, sci-fi fans just didn't have that much to pick from. Sure, there were your Forbidden Planets and Logan's Runs, and of course there was Star Trek. Their effects were acceptable (okay, Forbidden Planet was gorgeous for 1954), but quality sci-fi was almost an oxymoron.Star Wars changed all that.For the first time we got an exciting plot, action, and incredible special effects in one package. The aliens looked REAL, not like actors in suits. The spacecraft looked REAL, not like models. The laser beams looked REAL, not like...well...anything before it!For all the books I've read that say 2001: A Space Odyssey was the turning point for sci-fi films, I feel that Star Wars did more to fuel the genre and bring it into the mainstream than any other movie in history. Of course that's just my opinion....</fullReview>

I think it is more important / impacting to the world culture today then any of the "culturally significant" books I read in school. Star Wars is a movie they should show in school because it is a cultural norm that people need to understand in order to interact with those around them.It is more then a fad of a movie that will be really popular for a while and then fade away (like most contemporary and popular titles), this is a movie that will be around for generations to come.For many people it defines a lot of who they are, especially those who saw Star Wars as a young child. It introduced them to new ways to dream and think. Out of all the movies in the Top 10 of the Top 250, Star Wars is the only one I have plans to show to my children when they are old enough. Star Wars plays a very important role in connecting generation together, and will for generations to come.And amazingly, I am by no means a really big Star Wars fan, nor a fanatic in any since of the word. I just know something significant when I see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie I remember seeing. I collected the toys, collectibles, and anything else that had the Star Wars name on it. George Lucas did a great job kicking off the first trilogy and the entire Star Wars genre with the best music and the best special effects. Anybody that hasn't seen at least one of the Star Wars movies has a very bad taste in movies and hasn't been around them long. When somebody says the word "movie" this is the one that should come to everyone's mind. The classic story of a princess in danger that's later rescued by her knight-er stormtrooper in shining armor, and good vs. evil is played out dramatically to make anybody like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun-filled, epic space adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is a 1977 epic space opera and space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and is possibly THE most important film of all time. Star Wars changed film forever, never before had a film become such an icon on not only the big screen but in our ways of life and society as a whole. Still to this day Star Wars merchandise dominates the shelves of stores and rules the world of pop culture. George Lucas introduces us to firstly to two droids, the mild-mannered C-3PO and his quirky companion R2-D2, before really introducing us to characters of Luke Skywalker (our hero), Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, Chewbacca and possibly the most recognised and terrifying villain in cinematic history, Darth Vader. The beautiful sets and locations really sell the idea of otherworldly planets, while having a familiar feel our own home planet. Characters are well developed with many visiting places they never thought possible and having fully developed arc's from start to end. John Williams gives us at times heart-wrenching, powerful orchestrated scores to accompany the stunningly beautiful shots and mesmerising film making. With a movie as iconic and important as Star Wars it is hard to find flaws, whoever the small flaws with the film has are mainly with the special effects which today certain shots and effects don't hold up as well today, also to mention the slow-paced duel of two 'masters' in the latter half of the film doesn't sell the idea of a fight to the death and sometimes cheesy and clichéd character dialogue and situations. Overall, Star Wars is a fun-filled epic space adventure, with edge-of-the-seat action scenes, iconic characters, beautiful landscapes, ground-breaking and revolutionary cinematography accompanied with a masterfully composed soundtrack and scores throughout with not a dull moment in sight. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe that this movie was made almost 40 years ago, because the whole original Star Wars trilogy is still some of the best science-fiction movies made to the day today. It has a good story and great deal of action scenes that include very interesting characters and more realistic visual effects made with actors, costumes, plastic ship models, alongside an actual story and good lines.I don't understand how the original Star Wars trilogy could go behind the more recently made movies, like the "Star Wars: Special Edition" remakes and the later movies like "Star Wars: Episode 1", those were just plain pathetic. Because they seem to just look more like a plain cartoon thanks to CGI effects, including a lack of logic and actual lines in the first three movies that were made later. The original movies there were simply nothing more than real-life scenes with people in costumes, actual lines, and plastic models, were done simply and were so much better.Even though the movie was made nearly 40 years ago, the original "Star Wars" movie was a great story and included great special effects that are some of the best to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a distant far away Galaxy, forces of the empire headed by Darth Vader abduct Princess Leia who is the head of the intergalactic rebellion &amp; two android robots R2D2 &amp; C-3PO. She carries with her key information about the empires seemingly invincible "Death Star" weakness. The two droids that are accompanying her manage to escape to the desert planet Tattooine, only to fall into the hands of Jawa's, midget creatures with glowing eyes who then sell them &amp; a host of other droids on the market. Both C-3PO &amp; R2D2 are sold off to a farming family, whose young farm hand Luke Skywalker, has dreams of joining the rebellion against the dark forces of the empire. While repairing R2D2, he accidentally triggers a hologram of Princess Leia, who has key information that must be passed onto Ben Kenobi (or as he is known under his Jedi Knight name Obi-Wan Kenobi) after he is attacked, Obi-wan rescues Luke &amp; the droids &amp; then informs Luke that his late father was a Jedi Knight like himself. Training Luke up in understanding the powers of the Jedi. Upon returning home, Luke discovers that Darth Vader has killed his aunt &amp; uncle. Joining forces with Obi, Luke decides to help rescue the princess, with the assistance of Han Solo &amp; his partner Chewbacca, a hairy beast. Once inside enemy territory, they attempt to rescue Princess Leia &amp; help destroy the death star, but quickly learn that planning it is easy, pulling it off will be anything but. Meanwhile Obi-wan squares off against the dastardly Darth Vader in a light sabre duel, picking up a fight they never finished many years before.STAR WARS is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the best motion picture/sci-fi action, fantasy films ever made! It's one of those very rare Hollywood successes, that can actually be said was made with heart &amp; it shows in every frame of the film. The story is very easy to get hooked into &amp; sports the feel of the old matinée serial episodes like FLASH GORDAN &amp; COMMANDO CODY, despite it's troubled production history that you could write a book on, STAR WARS shows no signs of having a troubled production, since unlike most films, there's no evidence of such here. It's a film that gets better with age &amp; while the special effects are so much more advanced in this day &amp; age, STAR WARS many special effects sequences still holds up well. The film is superbly directed by GEORGE LUCAS, who shows a ton of talent &amp; is very worthy of being one of the top name directors working in the Hollywood A game. The acting is very strong indeed &amp; the special effects, both in terms of aliens, robots &amp; other visual effects are top rate. The set design is also really cool &amp; well done on such a low budget film. There's a few suspenseful sequences on hand &amp; the light sabre duels, shoot-outs &amp; space ship fighting sequences are very exciting &amp; caught at all the right angles. The score by JOHN WILLIAMS is one of the best scores to ever grace a film &amp; is one of the best most memorable scores in film history. Make no mistake about it, STAR WARS is a winner all around. The film was such a success, it led to not only phenomenal box office returns, but as well as a blow out in merchandise, as everything from, lunch boxes, action figures, stickers, comics, posters &amp; a film that has been spoofed so many times throughout the years. A series of spin offs includes a dreadful made for TV movie - STAR WARS: HOLIDAY SPECIAL, two other made for TV movies: EWOK ADVENTURE/CARAVAN OF COURAGE, EWOKS II: THE BATTLE OF ENDOR (which played theatrically in some area's) an animated movie STAR WARS: CLONE WARS, DROIDS (1985-86), EWOKS (1986-87) three animated Television shows: STAR WARS: CLONE WARS (2003-2005) STAR WARS: CLONE WARS (2008-2014) Re-issued as STAR WARS: EPISODE IV -A NEW HOPE.

		<fullReview>It's the first one and everyone loves it. I have to admit, it is cheesy and has its faults, but that's why it's perfect, and doesn't need improving *cough* George Lucas!The practical effects in this are amazing for its time, the story is literally out of this world and no one had scene anything like it. The characters are brilliant, we get a young boy who wants more in life, an old man who use to be a Knight, a Charming Smuggler, a Princess who can kick ass, two surprisingly comic relief robots and a really tall villain which represents a Dictator and feared by all.You can't get any better than that. The Death Star Assault has to be my favourite scene in the whole film, as the Starfighters look amazing in space and you just want to be in those cockpits. And the fact that George Lucas thought it would never work, and yet it has a cult following and such a huge fan service, they have declared the 4th of May to be Star Wars Day. As in May the Force Be With You.If it wasn't for this film, we wouldn't have the inspiration as it gave us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this movie started it all, and it is the best - hands down. Those special effects were actually very special for their time and groundbreaking. Not only were they stunning for the period, they didn't take away from performers' skills. The directing, writing and scripting were all formulaically fun frolics resulting in a well-paced struggle between space-evil and space-good. I regret, I am no snotty self-loving scientific academic, so my opinion is just that, an opinion (kind of like a dis-provable theory)..nor does it have a price tag, like all them "collegiate-right conclusions" if they are what the government wants, you get another grant...wink-wink. OK - a silent dig, and now I am done with that part. Yes, this movie reminds of that 70's romp, "Flesh Gordon" ? minus the flesh. Each character (with the exception of 'The Princess') was riddled with flaws and prone to error?and that is what made them very likable and relatable. Luke is some goofy kid from the space-burbs, aching to drive any old space craft?even if it is the up-galaxy space-bus; Hans is a bombastic and roguish misfit (ending up being only a hero in his own mind) and Chewbacca is that well-trained pet of Solo, who's excellent training is reflected in a keen adherence to rules, avoiding piddling on space-carpets and not destroying the space newspaper. The galactically-challenged Princess Leia Orgasm, from the planet Spermicide, starts out as some kind of young, punk-brutish femme, whose raging hermones greatly hampers her ability to complement anyone. Of course nothing time and events expedites rapid maturity. By the end of the story, Luke gets a light-stick; Hans envies the size of Luke's light-stick; Chewbacca wants to fetch Luke's light-stick and Leia ends up being an even angrier Leia. That is not all the fun...oh no. I forgot to mention that Garth ("I am your Father") Vader and Luke end up in a very intense climax, comparing light-sticks to one-another. Now as important a scene as this might be, I wish never to witness this again. Alec Guinness plays a nice old guy (Oldy One Can-o-pea?) and junkie-master whose flaccid light-stick is no match for Vader's. Of course you can't forget General/Admiral Peter Cushing who always plays badder than bad, minus from the poison from the Bad Force. I guess while I am mentioning main characters, I should talk about the two BOTs. R2D2 and C3PO?I can't say enough. To put it mildly?the beeps and buzzes were cute for kids?but for me?irritating. With all this bad ju-ju, this is a movie I can watch over and over. Ulike the other Star War movies, this picture had some charisma, great characters and CGI struggled enough to play second-fiddle to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Children's Fairy tale in Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two major problems with this film... 1) the plot 2) the actingI think this film is so popular largely because of childhood nostalgia. It is essentially a children's film.Spoiler? The Plot: When stripped to its bare bones the plot is essentially... princess gets kidnapped by evil sorcerer. Wannabe knight is trained by wizard to rescue princess from sorcerer. Wizard is killed by sorcerer. Knight comes back and destroys sorcerer's dragon (aka death-star). With the exception of death-star = dragon, each character is referred to according to those titles. Obi Wan is called a wizard by Luke's uncle. Darth Vader is referred to as having sorcerer's ways. Luke is to train to be a Jedi Knight... and Leia is a princess. A typical children's fairy tale story... and the twist being that it is set in space. The acting at times is so wooden that it is cringe worthy. Everyone has fond memories of this film from their childhood... and the reason why people don't like Return of the Jedi or the prequels is largely because they have grown up and have forgotten that this was a children's movie and was merchandised as a child's movie. However, if you look at it again on its merits as a film... it is actually quite a poor over-rated movie. It's one saving grace other than nostalgia is the model making and special effects for the time of its release were impressive but no more so than some previous sci-fi movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At it's time of release, it was really progressive and an influential classic, but it's quite average when judging it by its enduring quality. For what it's worth it's entertaining, the costumes are well done and it's good fantasy. Technology ages fast. The script is average, the acting isn't particularly well done and the characters aren't deep, the story is simple and there aren't a lot of human emotions on this one. It did successfully introduce the franchise so that the later and better entries could build on it. But I'm calling it over-hyped on this one (sorry). Maybe I just had to see it when I was 11 years old (or have grown up in the 70's) to see what Star Wars fans adore about this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A New Hope is one of those movies that will never be forgotten and will be watched over and over again and never get old. It's beautifully shot, the use of practical effects is breathtaking and everything feels realistic. That's the best thing of the entire movie and not just entire movie, probably the best thing of the entire original trilogy. Characters are relatable, but it just feels like they are not fleshed out enough, but more of that will come in the sequels. While I really like this movie, I don't consider it a masterpiece mostly for the reason I said in the previous sentence. There are just good guys and bad guys. I know they have that charm, but it's just not enough to me. Now more about good sides, the movie isn't boring for one second. The action is very well done, the story is simple and it's perfect to relax. While some scenes are action-heavy, some of them are pure beauty (the double sunset scene is one of my favorites in the series and also one of the most iconic). And what I like the most is what a universe it establishes in just 2 hours and is yet to be expanded in the sequels. Usually big universes like this are made in books or TV shows, at least successfully, but they made such a huge one in just few movies and expanded it with animated series and comics. Back in 1977, before the release, who could expect this would become such an iconic, timeless and immortal franchise. No one took this seriously on shooting except George Lucas and few more people. The story of making this movie, inspires me very much and makes me believe that even when you're hopeless you can succeed in achieving what you want. And, just one more iconic thing that can't go unmentioned is John Williams' brilliant score and after watching a movie you will catch yourself humming one of the tracks from the score. While this movie has flaws, it's still a classic that will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not "A New Hope". Not "Episode IV". Just simply "Star Wars".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 70s was a pretty slow decade for movies. We did have greats like "Jaws" and maybe "Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory", but nothing that really took the audience for a fast paced ride. However, in 1977 this little movie called "Star Wars" hit the market and took its audience by surprise. The film became a cultural phenomenon and essentially created the "movie fanboy" overnight, becoming one of the highest grossing movies ever made.What exactly is so "great" about "Star Wars"? Some may say most people think it's great because it's a "CLASSIC MOVIE" and that it's only good because it's old or some shi- No, you're dumb. It's that simple, you're just dumb and don't know what you're talking about. The reason "Star Wars" is so great is because it, somehow after nearly 40 years, STILL holds up as a great movie. Is it perfect? No, there are flaws, but it's still an entertaining action-adventure space opera and should NOT be limited to being enjoyed by just "sci- fi dorks".What made the "Star Wars prequels" so lame was that they were slow, boring, and had a very uninteresting plot narrative that is debatably a story that did not need to be told. Why? Well, a common joke by most amateur movie goers is "oh wow, they started with Part IV instead of Part I? How dumb." It's not dumb. Why? Because Part IV is where things got good. One of the many reasons people love the original SW trilogy is because of its characters. Luke, Han, Leia, 3PO, R2, etc., they're all unique characters. You remember each of them and you are interested in what their goals are. That's what the prequels failed at doing: having an emotional connection with its audience. (Plus: The bit where Han blasts the sh*t out of Greedo is so badass and Lucas should feel ashamed of himself for tinkering it)I don't like to refer to any of the Star Wars movies by their episode number, just by their subtitle. Even then, I always call this first movie "Star Wars" since that's what it was initially called when it first came out in 1977.Another thing that helps this movie is the film score by the ever so talented John Williams, whose soundtrack for this movie won him his third Academy Award. Somehow, it's the glue that holds the movie together. Without John Williams' film score, that engaging feeling towards the end of the Death Star battle isn't the same. The music helps you get involved with what's happening, even after you've watched the movie a ba-gillion times like I have.Really, what else can be said about "Star Wars" that just hasn't already been said for decades now? The cinematography is beautiful, the music is brilliant, the characters are great, and the directing is surprisingly good. This was probably the only good "Star Wars" movie George Lucas ever directed and he had several people making suggestions for him to try new things and maybe change his mind on a couple things.It's like I always say, "One man can't make a movie."Of course in January of 1997 (the film's 20th anniversary), Lucas released his "Special Edition" of Star Wars which included a lot of (very dated) CGI, Greedo shooting before Han (which is bullsh*t and ruins such a badass moment), changed the title to "Episode IV - A New Hope", and many other changes. I don't hate the "Special Editions" as much as many SW fans do, seeing how I think at least 80% of the same movie is still in tact. However, the one thing that makes me LOATHE the Special Editions is how George Lucas (almost like a spoiled, ungrateful child) didn't bother releasing the original versions of these movies along side the SEs. This is not fair. The original cut of "Star Wars" won several awards and even won a Special Achievement Oscar for its sound effects. I don't like being forced (ha ha) to watch just one version of the movie that's heavily digitalized when the original versions hold up just fine. I may of said it's still 80% of the same movie, but the 20% that Lucas altered really does affect the movie for me? Whatever Lucas, but just know this: Those Academy Awards were given to the Original Unaltered Versions, not the Special Editions. Yes I'm aware Lucas can't affect these movies anymore because Disney took ownership of Lucasfilm from him, but it's been 3 damn years and they haven't said anything releasing the original cuts of Star Wars. Guess I'll have to rely on Harmy and his OriginalTrilogy.com team. Sigh?Despite this, I just can't describe how brilliant the original "Star Wars" is. If you could, hunt down the original version of this film (via VHS / 2006 DVD / Despecialized Edition) and enjoy 120 minutes of one of the most important and greatest movies ever made. It's not "A New Hope" and it's not "Episode IV". It's just simply "Star Wars".</fullReview>

Lately, i heard that after long time, another star wars movie is going to release and people are so crazy and every advertisement on television is related to star wars. The craze is almost like Macy's thanksgiving parade and Micheal Jackson's live performance. Finally, i decided to star watching all the movies.I kept in mind one thing while watching the movie is that the movie was made in 1977, when there was no technology, no artificial intelligence and automated robots. Movie was brilliantly made and the techniques ( i observed) used to make it visually fascinating are astonishing. Most of the effects are paints and motion blur was used to blend the multiple layers to appear as one.When it comes to the story, i was little bit confused because, the first movie was actually fourth part of the story. Still i do not know why they made in this order.But, story was considered as epic as i thought. Overall, i liked the movie and i could not wait to see the rest of them.Finally, i decided to watch all of them before the new movie is released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never seen any of the Star Wars movies (don't kill me, I just wasn't that interested) and another entry coming out in December, I decided to marathon all six of them to prepare myself for the latest chapter. Starting out with the original movie, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. I definitely enjoyed it, but I'm just hoping this isn't the best installment in the series. A New Hope focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. A farmhand named Luke Skywalker acquires droids that have the architectural plans for the Death Star. The Empire searches for the missing droids, and Luke agrees to help Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to get the plans to the Rebel Alliance and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyrannical rule. The only reason I was slightly disappointed by the movie was because the first 45 minutes or so were just plain boring. The initially slow-moving plot and cornball dialog didn't really impress me much. What kept me watching was the amazing set pieces and cinematography; it really made up for the flaws the beginning of the movie had. The last half of the movie, however, is incredibly entertaining, fun and action-packed. The climax especially was breathtaking and impossible to forget. The imaginative world also makes me excited to watch the rest of the series. There were quite a few flaws with the original Star Wars that disappointed me a bit, but once it gets going, A New Hope is an undeniably fun ride that I wish to take again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mythological</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, if you were to name films that changed culture the most or which ones defined culture the most, the original Star Wars would be there in the Top Ten, if not Top Three. A film by George Lucas, who took in influences ranging from spaghetti westerns to samurai films to classic fairy tales and crafted a film that would become the epitome of space opera genre. Since then it has inspired a following unlike almost anything we've ever seen before. Everyone raised in modern culture knows this film, knows what it's about and has probably seen it numerous times. And for a good reason.You can definitely see that while they were clearly ambitious about this film, they weren't shooting for the stars, nor did they have the best resources available. The special effects, while groundbreaking, innovative and very, very impressive, do show the limitations of the budget and would be greatly updated in the two coming sequels. For example, all the space explosions are kind of flaky, the lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader is in reality rather slow and looks cumbersome, the blaster bolts are obviously painted on the screen, and numerous other small things like that. In a way they add to the charm of the film, as do the corny dialogues, because really, it's not meant to be anything else but a pulp adventure and those need to be a bit cheesy to work.What the film does nail absolutely is the mythos. From the very first text scrawl to Obi-Wan talking about a more civilized age to all the mentions about the Jedi Order to a casual mention about the Galactic Senate, the film builds its world effortlessly and without flaws. There's a very good reason why people identify so strongly with this franchise and are so endlessly passionate about its intricacies, legends and lore. And this film is the one that started it all and laid all the groundwork for future films to utilize. I cannot in all honestly name any other film that can pull me in so quickly and have me begging more for crumbs of information.Star Wars is one of my favourite films of all time. Not because it's the perfect film by any means, but because of the way it inspires me, strengthens my imagination, allows me visions of faraway places and because it is one of the best adventure stories I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The timeless adventure that began it all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fell in love with Star Wars beginning with the original epic adventure since I was about 7. My childhood will never fade because of this masterpiece.George Lucas introduced us to the amazing galaxy far, far away in 1977 and changed the blockbuster generation forever and made movies bigger, more exciting and more ambitious. And introduced us to these unforgettable characters who we all get to care for. Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who finds himself in a bigger universe and starts a new journey for himself. Princess Leia, leader of the Rebel Alliance against the evil Galactic Empire. Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon and scoundrel and his hairy wookiee sidekick, Chewbacca "Chewie" as he calls him. C-3P0 and R2-D2 the two droids who help our heroes along the way. And of course, Obi-Wan Kenobi, the legendary Jedi Master who vows to teach Luke to become a Jedi like his father.All of these characters are forever to be remembered. The special effects changed cinematography and visual effects to a whole new level to what we all see in films today. If it weren't for Star Wars, we would never have any film love in the first place. It's why we watch movies and they don't make anything like this anymore.The epic adventure will always be the adventure of all adventures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships have won their first victory against the evil Empire run by black helmet man. During the battle, the rebels manage to steal secret plans to black helmet man's DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.Nervous Gold robot man, along with his small blue+white robot machine friend, urgently scurry about on board the DEATH STAR until a peculiar haired girl secretly gives the small blue+white robot machine a mission. Nervous Gold robot man and the blue+white robot machine soon voyage away to a sandy planet, where they soon find themselves in the ownership of a farm boy. The farm boy discovers a secret message that was recorded by the blue+white robot machine and he soon continues blue+white robot machine's mission.This is a good sequel to Star Wars: Episode III, and has some similarities, such as Nervous Gold robot man and blue+white robot machine. My only dislikes are that the protagonist, Nervous Gold robot man, kind of disappears in the third act, and the opening text is greatly unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The GREATEST blockbuster of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Jaws created the summer blockbuster, Star Wars perfected it. It transported us to a strange and diverse universe, with interesting characters, while giving an-out-of-this-world movie experience. Out of all the movies I've seen, this movie has the BEST cast. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Darth Vadar are some of my all-time favorite movie characters. Their unique and different personalities make them all memorable. The story is a blockbuster at it's finest. It follows Luke's quest to rescue Princess Leia and stop the Death Star. There is not a single dull moment, at all. The pacing is perfect and you get what's going on, easily. The only bad thing about this movie is the Special Edition version of it. Unlike the special edition of Aliens, which enhances the movie, this special edition INSULTS the movie and ruins it. The changes here are out-of-place and unnecessary, and they REALLY bother me. Other than that, this is a great movie and the best summer blockbuster in all of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest of the Franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars: Episode 4- A New Hope (1977): Dir: George Lucas / Cast: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, David Prowse: George Lucas made box office history with this film about the battles waged beyond the stars to the outer limits of the galaxy. Young Luke Skywalker is given possession of two droids but discovers an urgent message recorded within one of them in the vision of Princess Leia seeking help from Obi Wan Kenobi. Unable to fight the evil Empire on his own, he urges Luke to join him. He tells him of his father's seduction into the dark side. Leia is held captive in the Death Star where Darth Vader uses her to locate the Rebel Base. Dazzling and overwhelming visual wonder from curious droids to strange creatures to massive spaceships. Imaginative screenplay by Lucas who previously tested the genre with THX 1138. Mark Hamill plays Luke as someone seeking his destiny. Carrie Fisher displays authority and vulnerability as Leia. Harrison Ford plays hot shot pilot Han Solo of the Millennium Falcon. He owes a large debt and sees this as great financial gain. Finally there is Alec Guinness as wise Obi Wan who will pass the torch to Luke but not before one last confrontation with Vader. Body builder David Prowse provides the size and intimidation for one of the most memorable villains in cinema history. Destiny is themed within this masterpiece of visual excitement. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you not like "Star Wars"? May the force be with you if it isn't young padawon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas began somewhere like everyone else. His work with the "Star Wars"franchise was initially rejected to even start off by multiple production companies until "Dreamworks" finally bought it. "Star Wars" isn't for everyone, but it's an experience everyone needs to fulfill. Not only did this change the way films were made and give way to modern-day classics, but it started a franchise that millions of people have in their hearts to this day. The blazing originality behind Lucas' mastery is profound in perhaps the coolest way. Space ships, giant bears, light-sabers, all the funky names, and groundbreaking visuals hold the veil over almost any other cinematic advancement. The franchise became a hit due to the uniqueness and originality that no one had every dreamed of. Ironically, it gave way to about six more films after the original trilogy was created. All with one idea to the next did George Lucas make history. A franchise that has been digitally remastered and controlled the theme of a museum isn't just a film. It's a continuous story that is still appreciated by people on every continent. Is it my favorite film franchise? Not even close. I have the utmost respect for the masterminds in creating this film, because it was an important part of my childhood and has contributed more to social and economic factors that almost any work of art to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece that will live forever in cinema history. What really makes these movies are of course the characters. You have all these different types of people who combined make a fantastic cast of characters. You have the ultimate hero in Luke Skywalker, a rebel in Han Solo and the damsel in distress (although she really is a heroine) in Princess Leia. Also lets not forget perhaps the best villain ever in any franchise: Darth Vader. What makes these characters so good is the fact that they are all likable. There is not a single annoying character in the first movie. What kind of a review would this be if I didn't mention John Williams' terrific score. Like the movie it really is a classic. Everyone knows the rousing main theme even 30 years later! I won't dissect the movie any further since this movie is a must watch regardless of what I say about it. Go watch it, now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow!! Star Wars from 1977!!!To be frank, I watched this movie after seeing the trailer of Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens. I was quite surprised how people around me were talking about this upcoming Space fiction. So I decided to watch it...and here it goes...Well, I just watched 'Interstellar' last week and 'gravity' last year so I was quite prepared that this movie will not give me any surprises. But when the movie started, I was lost into the outer space. For about two hours I forgot I belong to planet Earth! Forget about todays visual effects and action sequences, this movie is quite original and probably one of the best narrated science fiction stories of all time. It will make you feel the story, the characters and their world. By this time most of the world must have watched it already, so I suggest the newbies and this generation kids out there..watch this flick to enjoy movie making of the 70's...You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many movie franchises, they all have a beginning. The Star Wars (aka A New Hope) id the best of the series for it's great humor, intense action, and great characters, my favorite was always Darth Vader. I would recommend the unaltered version of this film which is available on amazon. I say that because the original unaltered version gets the story through best without the cgi Jabba walking with Harrison Ford which is just plain embarrassing to see. The action is great mainly dealing with ships and lasers, but there is one awesome and epic light-saber fight which is kinda short but worth every minute to witness the first ever battle. The character were a blast like the cocky Han, the young and brave Luke, and the Mighty Chewbacca, again I highly recommend this space classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original "Star Wars" (you can keep calling it "Episode IV: A New Hope" all you want, I do not have to go along with it) in a theater far and away more times than any other movie (low double figures). I saw "Star Wars" as much as the films I saw the second and third most often in a movie theater, which would be, of course, "The Empire Strikes Back" and "The Return of the Jedi." I even sat through the movie twice in a row, the first time so I could pay attention to everything that happened in the lower left quadrant of the film and the second time so I could watch the lower right quadrant.Watch the film again for the first time in several years three things stuck out in my mind as to why this film got us so excited way back when. The first, as noted above, was how there was so to look at in this film. Nobody ever laughed at the alien in the sunglasses trailing after the good guys at Mois Eisley, but in addition to the all the weird looking aliens in the Cantina and throughout the film there was the way this galaxy far, far away looked like it had been lived in. The idea that the Millennium Falcon is not only the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy but actually looks like a hunk of junk mattered. Even the wacky white armor of the Storm Troopers meant something to us, even if we questioned its functionality. You could reduce Han Solo to his grin, Princess Leia to her hairdo, and Luke Skywalker to his lightsaber, because the costumes and art design were things we had never seen before. Of course, Darth Vader being able to think people to death was pretty impressive.The second is that if there is any one thing that made "Star Wars" move than a "B" movie made with an "A" budget it is the musical score by John Williams. The composer had won his first Oscar two years earlier for "Jaws" and was also nominated for "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" when he won again for "Star Wars." One of the things we did because we could not go and sit in the theater watching "Star Wars" all day was to listen to the double-album for the movie's soundtrack (yes, I probably listened to this soundtrack more than any other in history than did not require singing "The Time Warp" or any other song). I do not know how much of the movie is scored to music, but it has to be an extremely high percentage, albeit short of what you would get with a silent film. The only movie score that I find comparable is the one Ennio Morricone did for "Once Upon a Time in the West," especially in terms of have motifs associated with characters.The final thing that made this movie great was the entire final sequence where the Rebels attack the Death Star. The X-Wing fighters are still the coolest I have ever seen, despite what we have seen from "Battlestar Galactica" to "Farscape" and everything in between. I would really love to see the complete original template George Lucas put together for the special effects crew spliced together from World War II movies. Not only do we have the drama of the "Dam Busters" runs on the Death Star, but the sequences provides a number of memorable characters, most of whose names we never learn: Red Leader (Drewe Henley), Red Two (Dennis Lawson), Red Four (Jack Klaff), Red Six (William Hootkins), Gold Leader (Angus Mcinnis), Gold Two (Jeremy Sinden), and Gold Five (Graham Ashley). Everything that happened was so vivid that when listening to the lengthy "Battle of Yavin" cut on the soundtrack I swear we could recreate every shot in our minds.Perhaps the best way of describing the impact of "Star Wars" is to say that it must have been similar to what happened a generation or two earlier when Dorothy opened the door to Oz and the screen went from sepia tones to Technicolor. It was an introduction to a whole new world. Even if we never saw a Saturday morning serial we could appreciate the idea of a roller coaster type of ride where Sand People attack, the Millennium Falcon has to escape the Death Star, and the Rebel base is almost within range.In terms of the controversy over the way George Lucas has tinkered with his 1977 film, I have already bought into the idea of the director's cut, so it is hard to fault the director for having a slightly different definition of that from others. I remember how outdated the special effects looked three years later when "Empire" came out, so updating them makes sense to me. The scene with Jabba sets up what happens in the rest of the original trilogy and I think the scene with Biggs before the attack is important simply because I think the idea that the last person killed is Luke's best friend. Besides, I have the film we saw in 1977 preserved in a letterboxed edition on laser disc and can still watch it whenever I want.Actually, what surprised me the most with this "final" version of the original "Star Wars" movie was how tacky the attempts by Lucas to retroactively fix his character's flaws. To be clear that Han Solo is not a cold blooded killer Greedo now shoots first, although he is an incredible bad shot, especially from four feet away. Then there was the shock that Leia no long kisses Luke on the lips "For luck" before they swing across that chasm. Now it is a chaste little peck on the cheek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STAR WARS revolutionized how we see films of the fantasy and sci-fi genre.......Star Wars --- the Ultimate Space Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977, George Lucas directed Star Wars - a space opera of mixed fantasy and science-fiction. It ultimately, and astonishingly changed how we see fantasy and science-fiction. Intriguingly enough, it was to be called "The Star Wars" but it was dropped, and was called "Star Wars" instead. Although the film was set to be released in 1976, roughly round about the month of December, delays happened, and the film was ultimately postponed to a later date, (May, 77'), and was released to extremely overwhelming positive critical reviews, praise, and etc, and was a worldwide phenomenon - since then, it's spawned the five other fantastic films, figures, books, collectibles, games, comic books, TV shows, clothes, props, everything under the sun, basically. Star Wars was then later known as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, or even just A New Hope. True Star Wars fans call the film "Star Wars" and "Star Wars" only --- to show ultimate dedication and have it be known as what it was known firstly as, when it was released. Star Wars sees the galactic empire under attack, as the Rebel Alliance, with Princess Leia, plan to overthrow and thwart the empire - by doing so, they plan on destroying a massive space-station known as the "Death Star" and aboard the space-station is Darth Vader, the Emperor's right hand man. The Emperor doesn't appear in Star Wars, but you'll see him make an appearance, in Empire (Star Wars EP V: The Empire Strikes Back) and of course, he's a major in Jedi (Star Wars EP VI: Return of the Jedi).The freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance are the main protagonists of the film, but it revolves mainly around a young and destined boy named Luke Skywalker - whose destiny to become a Jedi is merely a small feeling that he's unaware of and has yet to sprout. ***SPOILERS: this spoiler related to Episode V too, be careful!***Luke's father, Darth Vader (announced in Empire) is the main antagonist in the film, alongside a few appearances from many other villainous creatures including the Rodian bounty hunter "Greedo", and some more. Han Solo, another co-protagonist in the film, is a bounty hunter (played by Harrison Ford) whose mission is to, well, assist and help Luke, but also provide him and Ben Kenobi with a ship - later we're introduced to the Millennium Falcon - a beauty of a ship that can make the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs. Including droids R2-D2 and C-3P0, and a few more characters and background characters, Star Wars is a major science- fiction/fantasy/space-opera phenomenon that is still, to this date, one of the greatest films in the history of professional filmmaking.Star Wars is one of my all-time favourite things and I love it so much. I know i'm a huge fan of all six films, maybe with the exception of episode two - but i do still love it, although it's my least favourite - but i definitely know my favourites are the originals. I rate Star Wars a 10/10 - with unimaginable (at the time, presumably) visuals and effects, fantastic and all-round sharp acting, fantastic directing, character creations, photography and cinematography, and much more. Star Wars is one of the greatest things ever to get into - it won't disappoint, although i'm sure most people around the world have already seen or have done something to do with this stunning space-opera, trademarked phenomenon of a thing.Something that's so great about it is the fact it's opened up to a major fan-base too - kids, teens, adults. Star Wars (77') is great for introducing us to the characters for the first time - and the background/secondary characters are great - such as: the Jawas, the Tusken Raiders, the Banthas, etc. 10/10. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an assignment for my English II Class believe it or not. Hope you enjoy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star War's Episode IV-A New Hope, holds a special place in my heart. I spent many days fantasizing and pretending to be the central hero of this film in the 1990's, and from the very first time I saw it I was hooked. Though this American classic was released in 1977, it can still be thoroughly enjoyed to this day by children and adults of all ages. Directed and written by George Lucas, A New Hope contains groundbreaking special effects and fantasy storytelling for its time. Believe it or not, these beautiful special effects that received so much praise in the space battles were done almost exclusively with small models attached to strings. It took Lucas Four years to complete this movie, from beginning the writing process, to seeing it on the big screen. The Star War's series was filmed and released out of order, this one being the first filmed, but being the fourth in chronology. The series continued in this fashion releasing the fifth, sixth, first, second, and finally the third. The all-star cast includes some of Hollywood's greats, including Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and the one and only, Harrison Ford. The movie and these actors received many awards including six Oscars, and earned a total of $220 million at the box office ($848 million in today's terms). However, this was no easy task. Director George Lucas and Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor did not see eye to eye. Constant arguments and differences plagued the entire production of this film, causing the production to fall two weeks behind schedule. Another big problem was the arrival of two large sandstorms destroying one of his sets. At one point, Lucas was even diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion from the stress of it all.The story follows Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), along with a couple of robot droids named R2D2 and CP3O, as well as a crew of friends that he makes along the way, on an adventure to save the rebel leader Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) from the grips of the Imperial forces led by Darth Vader. After she is retrieved safely by Luke and his newly found pilot, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the rebels proceed to plan a counter attack against the Imperialists and their partially completed space station, The Death Star. The Rebels suffer heavy losses in this attack, but thanks to Han's help, Luke is able to deal the finishing blow to the Death Star by firing two photon torpedoes down a vulnerable exhaust port leading to the station's main reactor. This is the climax of the movie, not to mention the most intense and over dramatic scene of the film. It is safe to say that you will be on the edge of your seat as Luke takes the final shot. At the completion of this first installment of the Star Wars series, Luke and Han are awarded for their heroism with medals of recognition from the Princess, and the credits roll, leaving the next big adventure for the following movie.The main theme of this movie is the timeless struggle between good and evil, light and dark. Throughout the story, Luke is warned not to give into "the dark side", because with great power also comes great temptation. The dark side is referred to as being the easy way to gain power. Alternatively, the Light side is recognized as being able to become just as powerful, if not more so, but more difficult to attain and harder to achieve. Overall, the main moral of this story is inspirational; good will always win over the dark, but the path the good side has to take is often much more of a struggle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How "Star Wars" changed my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977, George Lucas created one of the best and well-known films ever made, Star Wars. Even the name radiates excitement. When I hear that title I can't stop thinking about the first time I saw "A New Hope," and how much I wanted to be Luke Skywalker. I wanted to be told that I was a Jedi, and had greater power than I ever thought I did. I remember having a toy millennium falcon that shot darts out of the front of it. My brother had a tie fighter, and we would "fight" them all the time. When I was little I had to own every color of light saber. My dad bought me my first light saber for Christmas. It was green, and I loved it. I took it everywhere. The first Star Wars movie is called "A New Hope" because that what it gives to Luke Skywalker. He just wants to leave home to become a pilot, but he never thinks it will happen. Star Wars can give real people a "new hope" too. It was a about a year ago around thanksgiving break. We had gotten a new youth minister that fall, John David Crowe, and his son Noah had brain cancer. I remember just around thanksgiving Noah had a big MRI coming up. Noah was 3, almost 4, and his favorite movie was star wars. His favorite characters were the sand people. One of the adults that went to our church changed his Facebook profile picture to a picture of a sand person, and he commented on it telling everyone else to change their profile picture for Noah. I got on Facebook and changed my profile picture to R2-D2. Soon hundreds of people were changing their profile picture for Noah. But better than that, all these people were praying for Noah. I know "the force" isn't real, and I know that it wasn't Star Wars that saved Noah then, and I realize that Star Wars wasn't the only thing we had. But Star Wars brought us hope. It let all of us bind together for a cause greater than ourselves. We prayed a lot too. Noah died in May of 2012. Its hard everyday for a lot of people especially John David. I'm trying to give credit to Star Wars for having magical healing powers. I know it was God that was there during Noah's MRI during thanksgiving. But Star Wars gave us a way to band together for Noah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of all time. I was 7 when this came out, and it changed my way of thinking. I saw it eight times at the theater, and in those days(especially for a seven year old) it was something to get to the theater seven times to see a movie. Back then of course there was no VHS or DVD. The next time I saw it was on HBO and I watched it almost every time it came on. Altogether, to date, I have seen it over 150 times. I think what really drew me in was the depth of the worlds George Lucas created, and he made you care about the characters. Episodes III, IV, and V are my favorites of the series. I love what J.J. Abrams has done with Star Trek so I am looking forward to Episode VII and beyond.</fullReview>

The invention of the light saber is great in my point of view as this being more fiction then reality as I heard in other documentaries I saw about this subject. Many species of aliens make this movie a real treat and keeps it from getting boring as in my opinion humans really got bored of each other. In my opinion all of the movies in the series are equally beautiful not like other movies when seeing the second part is greatly disappointing. Everybody these days are only trying to make money.

This is one of those movies you can keep watching over and over. The special effects were successful to me even though it was oldies style. Seeing lasers bounce off the screen and watching the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader will get you very excited and especially the space ship battles. If you want to watch an awesome sci-fi movie star wars is the one. The force will be with you when you watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Images! Those Images!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was too young to see this on the big screen when it came out (at least my father thought so), so my intro to the Star Wars world was "Empire Strikes Back". But Star Wars is a very good and entertaining film too, and even if many of its themes are more fantasy than SF, the power lies in the images. They're simply magical! From the Star Destroyer entering the screen from the top to the seedy Mos Eisley bar, from the funny robots to the Millennium Falcon, from the Double Sunset to the Deathstar attack, this film is filled with fantastic images which let us gladly overlook any cheesiness ore plot holes or whatever. If you grew up with Jim Burns' and Chris Foss' covers for SF paperbacks, Star Wars is a dream come true and alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars was a great movie for its time, and people still watch it today. When this movie was made, we still exploring space, and this brought us tales of what space was like. Many of us who were unable to go to space got to dream about being Han Solo, the space pirate who got the girls. Some of us thought about being Luke Skywalker, the good guy and the good looking guy also. Others wanted to be Darth Vader, the bad guy who left destruction in his wake. While we all wanted to go to space, at least we got to live it through the adventures of Star Wars and all the sequels. Although this is the very first Star Wars, this is by far the best one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars represents everything that is great about filmmaking. George Lucas did not have resources, luck, or the technology that he needed to properly make this film, but he did anyway. Star Wars jump-started special effects and is responsible for the great work we have today in movies, some of which do it well, others not so much. Nevertheless, it is all incredible. Star Wars was one of the first great movies that both adults and kids could watch and enjoy. This film was a worldwide sensation, despite only premiering in a number of theaters in the beginning. Star Wars is the story of the ultimate underdog, both before and behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless sci-fi/fantasy adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about 'Star Wars' that hasn't been said ever since 1977? It's one of the most popular films of all time.For all two of you out there who don't know the story, 'Star Wars' is about Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who is fed up with his boring life on the desert planet of Tatooine. His life is changed forever when two robots come into his possession, one of them carrying a message for someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke is then swept into an adventure with the robots, Obi-Wan and two smugglers to rescue a princess from the evil Empire and join the rebellion to destroy their ultimate weapon, the Death Star.Taking inspiration from classic Wild West and samurai movies and combining it with science fiction and fantasy elements, 'Star Wars' is a must-see for, well, anyone really. Everyone who has ever lived really should experience the magic of 'Star Wars' at least once in their lives.The special effects are nothing short of wonderful. Each of the alien creatures all look unique and easily distinguishable through use of animatronics, costumes and prosthetics. No CGI used here. The scenes of the ships flying through space are so well done, you would swear they were real. The sets are another real spectacle to look at. You can see in the backgrounds all the little details of flashing lights and computer monitors wondering what all this stuff does.The music by John Williams, do I really need to say anything? It is some of the greatest and most memorable music, well, ever, not just in films.The characters are also extremely memorable. The lovable scoundrel Han Solo, his faithful hairy companion Chewbacca, the wise old Obi-Wan, all of them great. Although the acting is little cheesy, especially with Mark Hamill as Luke. Thankfully, he got better as the series went on.If there are any flaws with the movie, they are not worth mentioning since they are so insignificant compared to the rest of the movie.Star Wars is a masterpiece of cinema, plain and simple. If you are one of the few people who have not seen it, get it on DVD or whatever and see what it's all about. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The name of this movie is "Star Wars" period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is called Star Wars. That is the title it was given when it was released to the movie theaters in 1977. Do we change the names of other movies? What if we added digital special effects to Gone with the Wind or The Wizard of Oz then changed the name and elements of the story to fit the whim of the director? Would that be perfectly okay? George Lucas is out of his mind.That said, I thought "Star Wars" was a pretty fun movie and if you ever get a chance to see it, look for the original unedited original theatrical release (it's unbelievable how rare it is). That is the only way you can truly appreciate the movie as it was (and as it still is), as that is the only real "Star Wars".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still an Unpretentious Blast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even at the age of 45, I love how this movie makes me feel 11 years old again. The story of a princess trying to blow up a space station's easy to follow and takes a few turns on its way to a climax that features one of the classic races against time. The ending is positively uplifting and made us want to reunite with our heroes for the next 2 films.I don't care if this isn't a thought-provoking real-life drama or a love story. It's Star Wars, not Steel Magnolias. Some people complained just because this movie's "for kids," but some kids' movies rock. It's got humor, cool space battles, eye-filling production design, and another magnificent, rousing John Williams score that even stands on its own as a sometimes underrated musical soundtrack.Spoiled by the pace of today's movies, many people complain today that Star Wars is too slow. Back in the day, it was considered almost a roller-coaster ride. And either way, it's a classic! George Lucas got so much mileage out of something that is admittedly silly by definition, and constructed a masterpiece of popcorn space opera. I'm sure I could say more, bu suffice it to say, May the Force be with you!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars was the movie that tickled my interest in filmmaking when I was 9. I had not seen many movies before that and this was the first film that actually showed me how powerful cinema can be. It still has the same effect on me now and on future generations too most likely. The beauty Lucas has created for us is beyond belief, the references to Greek mythology and older Sci-fi sagas are intelligent, and the bursts of comic relief here and there are calculated. The story starts with a youth (Mark Hamill) discovering his destiny to fight against the evil galactic empire with his mentor (the always excellent Alec Guiness), a princess (Carrie Fisher), and a hotshot smuggler (Harrison Ford, who provides great comic relief). Excellent, beautiful, and full of eye popping visual effects that still look great now. No film has ever left as great of an impact on me than Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas' groundbreaking saga starts here, a epic space opera about rebels trying to save Princess Leia (Fisher) from the tyrannical Darth Vader (Jones/Prowse). Fun story with many of film history's most beloved characters; not to mention the impressiveness of its success and inspiration. However, the story-arc seems so light-weight knowing what follows in sequels "Empire" and "Jedi", and the absence of Yoda, Palpatine, Admiral Piette and Lando Calrissian certainly make you realize how dull this film is in comparison to the following two when you re-watch it. The most interesting conflicts of the series happens in the sequels, making "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope" the least intense and impressive of the original trilogy.**? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One That Started It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one that started it all, the original classic, "Star Wars". From the vivid imagination of a young teen named George Lucas comes an epic sci-fi tale that inspired millions. I am proudly one of those millions, having seen this film at the age of ten. This is probably one of the best films of all time and many can see why.Despite a lack of CGI, audiences were shown a brand new world of epic proportions unbound by the real one. The SFX were just so astonishing for their time, how could one not be amazed? That final space battle on the surface of the Death Star will leave one jaw-dropped and the cast is perfect. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, as "Blue Harvest" so eloquently put it, do have their single fleeting moment of stardom, but I guess the real star is Harrison Ford. And let's not forget Anthony Daniels as C3-PO. And of course the icon of evil himself, Darth Vader!! The almost classical tone of the score is unforgettable and the most identifiable theme music of all time is finally unveiled. John Williams really does have a knack for creating single pieces of music so timeless it seems they'll never be forgotten.In time, this original would become "Episode IV", as the prequel trilogy began, to some, destroy the reputation of the Star Wars saga. To me, despite what damage the prequel trilogy has caused, the originals, including this film in itself, will never lose their popularity or place in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old fashioned fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie first appeared. It was marketed as a throwback to the old Errol Flynn movies, and Luke Skywalker, at this juncture, was considered the main character. Instead of swinging on a mast rope on a pirate ship like Flynn would, Hamill would swing on a cable inside a vast space ship complex, carrying the princess with him.This is space adventure. Despite the hype, the other movies hadn't been formulated yet, even if the germs were in the back of the head honcho's mind. This was groundbreaking, not because of effects, but because of many other chances it took. In a decade when most heroes had to have black hair, and heroines blonde hair, and everyone else was considered unworthy of life, this film dared to go against the grain, and give us two blonde haired men for heroes. It's a wonder it wasn't censored on the drawing board.The two major stars in the picture, when it was released, were Oscar winner Alec Guiness and horror film star Peter Cushing. Guiness was a huge star. Cushing was known for playing Baron Frankenstein and the vampire killer, Von Helsing, in numerous films. He also played an assortment of British scholar characters. Here, he is a despicable bad guy.The Skywalker character was at center stage. He was the kid who must go off on adventure, and finds a mentor in Obi One Kenobe, played by Guiness. There is non stop action and adventure in a very industrialized Universe in which space travel is easier than a walk to the park. It isn't a Scientific think piece, but rather a "sit back and enjoy the story" affair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Force *is* strong in this one... it's loved for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think what makes this so rightfully popular is that it has something for everyone. It's fun, exciting, epic, with strong characters and clever lines. It manages to integrate all of the elements without anything feeling like it was just stuck in there, and doesn't talk down to anyone. There's no upper or lower age limit on enjoying this or taking it in. If you've got eyes and ears and you have spirit, you're likely to find at least one thing to care for in this, as well as be entertained. The plot is well-written and develops throughout. The pacing is pretty much spot-on, the movie never overwhelms or stands still. There are so many fantastic worlds, vehicles, creatures, languages and designs in the universe that this was the first look into, and it's clear that a lot of care and creativity was the basis for it. Also worth noting is the fact that this could easily be the only Star Wars to be made... it's self-contained, and had no others been done, this would still be a satisfying full story, albeit there would undoubtedly be a vocal demand for more. The action is entertaining and well-done, and certainly intense. The special effects broke new ground, actually inventing techniques for this. Some are dated, though new releases cover much up with CGI(but not to the point of it being obnoxious, or, really, particularly bothersome at all). The scope is amazing, and Lucas somehow pulled it off. The acting varies, but it's never too poor. My fiancée points out that Ford does seem a tad young, considering one of the main personality traits of who he portrays. The cinematography and editing are both top-notch. The score by John Williams is incredible. The sound is unique and aids in the setting of distant planets. There is a little violence, and some disturbing visuals. The DVD holds a commentary track which makes for a good listen. I recommend this to any fan of George Lucas, adventure, science fiction and the medium of film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars- My second favourite sci-fi adventure movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Second only to the sequel The Empire strikes back, I prefer the sequel only because it had a tighter plot and a shocking twist. In fact I was actually late starter when it came to Star Wars, I watched it for the first time when they re-released the trilogy in 97. It would be fair to say when I watched it I was completely spellbound, for a ten year old this was movie heaven. All the characters are legendary, Han Solo,Luke Skywalker,Princess Leia, Obi Wan Kenobi and who could forget the tyrant otherwise known as Darth Vader. The plot was pretty flimsy but Star Wars is just so much fun you probably wouldn't care. Out of all the main characters Harrison Ford had the most success,going onto Raiders of the lost ark and many more blockbusters. The John Williams score is one of my favourite movie scores along with Superman and Raiders of the lost ark. Star Wars was a monumental success, a success both sequels were going to repeat. In my opinion George Lucas should have left it at three, The Phantom menace was disappointing, Attack of the clones was no better and revenge of the sith was decent. Star Wars created the summer blockbusters and movies like POTC owe Star Wars a huge debt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is probably one of the most memorable movies of a decade. It was and always will be, epic. The story line is so in-depth. At the time, I'm sure George Lucas didn't think that he would be making more movies, and certainly not in our lifetime. Who would have known that anything so certainly amazing as Star Wars would create a world of it's own in such a short time after it appeared, and now, if you've never watched it, there is something wrong with you, because Star Wars is one of the most captivating films ever made. The film continues to enchant me even after I've watched it a zillion times. It is a magnificent movie with a wonderful storyline, that follows with the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, which are classics in their on right as well, but the movie that will be remembered forever is Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent start of an epic series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: There is turmoil in the galaxy, a rebellion has broken out against the Emperor and his dictatorship. Little of that is noticed on Tatooine though were Luke lives with his uncle and aunt on their farm. However, the fight between good and evil suddenly pays a visit when Luke and his family gets hold of two droids carrying secret plans of a powerful space station. Along with mentor and old Jedi Knight Obi-wan Kenobi Luke sets out on a quest across the galaxy to save a captured princess vital to the rebellion and join the fight against the empire.Comments: This is a terrific start to what initially was an epic trilogy, now a series of six movies. This is the first or the fourth in that series, depending on how you look at it. Anyway, the movie got it all. Most notably it is a variation on a classic theme, the young hero that sets out on quest to save the world. Only it is not set in our ordinary world but in a great galaxy with unlimited places and possibilities. And especially the special edition released two decades after the really uses the special effects to show the grandeur or horror of the entire galaxy. But one should not forget that the initial release was a break-through in special effects! But there is much more than special effects. First off there is a great story and a great plot with an excellent sense of adventure, some drama but most notably some great action. Actually Star Wars set the standard of how spacefights should be when I grew up playing, and it still holds true. Add some quick one-liners and a light sense of humor and you got what resembles a perfect mix.John Williams has left an great impression too with one of the most recognized themes ever. The music and sound alike is wonderful. And not to forget, this is a movie that contains some very good actors and actresses. It was a breakthrough for Harrison Ford but also sported established stars like Alec Guiness. Add Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones and you got a great cast. And with George Lucas at the helm nothing much can go wrong.Not only the cast is great but it sports some of the best characters ever. Luke, Han Solo, Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi and perhaps especially Darth Vader are legends. Each and every one of them are very strong and it is easy to sympathize and identify (or wish to) with them. Even the evil Vader.This is a great movie that I enjoy very much each and every time I watch it. Even knowing every twist and turn it don't reduce the experience. This is a movie that belongs among the stars, and that make me wish I could be among them too every time I watch it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars changed the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas created something huge when he made Star Wars. When people flocked to see it in 1977 they did not know how life-changing it would be. I will be as bold to say Star Wars changed the world and an entire generation of children and adults alike. What followed were two sequels, three prequels, toys, books, games, animated series, a religion and millions of dedicated fans. Unfortunately I never got to experience Star Wars in the theaters but seeing it on DVD is enough for me because Star Wars is everything I could want in a movie. My review probably will not add much to the 1,125 already on IMDb but I believe everyone should be able to express their love for movies like this.This Star Wars is still my favourite of the series and one my favourite movies of all time for many reasons. First and foremost, George Lucas' in-depth and amazing story. Lucas has created another galaxy with its own planets, its own history and boy is it good. Every planet has different creatures living on it and all these creatures are all unique. The actual plot is your basic good vs. evil battle but it is told with such flare and originality it makes it its own. All the characters are developed exceptionally well so that we all like them and care for them. Luke Skywalker (with his two android sidekicks, C-3PO and R2-D2) is the young hero of the story and Darth Vader is the menacing villain. Princess Leia is the beautiful girl they are after and Han Solo is the charming outlaw (who has a delightful companion, Chewbacca).What helps all these characters become what they are today are the talented group of actors. Mark Hamill is probably the weakest but he still puts in a heartfelt job as Skywalker, who he makes a kind, innocent boy out of. Harrison Ford is just so good as Han Solo, he has the looks and acting abilities to make Solo one of the coolest good guys in cinema history. Carrie Fisher is kick-ass as the tough and smart Princess Leia, I am confident no one could have pulled it off as good as she did. Sir Alec Guiness adds a touch of class as Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi who teaches Skywalker the ways of Jedi's and how to use The Force. Last, but definitely not least is the voice talent of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, he makes Vader a menacing and powerful villain, a great opposite to Luke Skywalker.John William's outstanding score contributes a whole lot to the success of the movie, it is a loud and beautiful score that perfectly captures the essence of Star Wars. Without it the movie would not have been as good, I say this with complete confidence. The special effects are mind-blowing, everything from the Death Star, to the aliens, to the buildings and to the spaceships, every single thing is a landmark achievement in special effects and proves that CGI is never necessary to make a convincing movie that has plenty of action set pieces. And I cannot forget George Lucas' flawless direction, without him Star Wars would never have been and let me say, the world would have been a much duller place.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie of my generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing Star Wars for the first time on the big screen way back in 1977 was the defining movie experience of my generation. At that time, I was ten, my brother was eight. We were both mesmerized, hypnotized, and captivated by a wonderfully simple yet epic story. It was a simple idea of good over evil, rescuing the helpless, discovering adventure, mammoth technology and sword and sorcery. Luke was the boy we could all identify with. Ben Kenobi was the wise leader. Han Solo was the cool, quick-witted pirate. Chewie was the faithful sidekick. The droids were great comic relief. The princess was smart and strong. And those light sabers were so cool. The movie is timeless, transcending generations. More than 30 years later, it still works magic, wonder and awe with new generations all the time. It can still be enjoyed time after time after time. It is definitely my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie will stay with you, always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Star Wars, now known as "Episode iv-A New Hope, is one of the greatest movies ever. I didn't particularly care for the technical update George Lucas made to it, was it really right to add such cheese? And why alter dialog? Example; Obi-Wan-"Mos Eisley spaceport, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy." Luke Skywalker-"I'm ready for anything." Terrific stuff, why change it! That being said, it's a fast-paced awesome sci-fi flick.Admitteldy after you're reeling from the FX in the opening shot, the movie slows to follow C-3po and R2-D2, they're cute, but its a long 30 minutes. thankfully the plot picks up when were introduced to Luke and his Aunt and Uncle, moisture farmers on the barren planet of Tatooine. Luke is my favourite character in all six films and Mark Hamill does a great job portraying his innocence and courage. Soon we met Old Ben Kenobi, a former general and Jedi Knight of the Republic, now a recluse, but he knew Luke's shadowy father and tells Luke he must fight the Empire now strangling the galaxy.Lucas uses great editing and cutting to show the Empire at work, Peter Cushing, a veteran English actor known for his work in horror movies, is the cruel Grand Moff Tarkin, and in this film, it is he who hold Darth Vader's leash, as Leia says. Vader is simply one of the most iconic villains ever on screen, black and imposing, his breathing is so alien nd mechanical that you fear him. It's clear that young Leia Organa, played by Carrie Fisher, is the leader in the rebellion and hell-bent on destroying the Empire's greatest weapon, the Death Star. And yes, it does sadly resemble a giant, gray tomato.After his Aunt and Uncle are killed by the Empire's Stormtroppers, Luke and Ob-WAn ( Ben) go to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan, LEia's home world. Here we meet Han Solo, a cynical rogue played with youthful authority by HArrison Ford. They split in his Millennium Flacon only to find Alderaan destroyed by the Death STar. Here I always felt this scene was not given the significance a planet's destruction deserves. it's too brief and too vague, we never really see any of the planet, only Leia and Darth's reactions save this from being a failure. In fact we only get the briefest glimpse of what Alderran may have been like for Leia in Episode 3.Our heroes are trapped on the Death Star but thankfully they rescue princess Leia, but Darth Vader's confronts and kills Ob-Wan in one of the biggest shocks in cinematic history. To off Alec Guiness halfway through your movie was a very ballsy movie by Lucas.Our heroes are set up by Vader to lead them to the hidden Rebel base and only a desperate attempt by Luke can destroy the Death STar and save the galaxy. This final batter is patterned after WW2 films and is visual breathtaking. Some science fiction purists object to the Force in this movie, that destroying planets and relying on technology is no match for faith, but it makes this all very emotional and Han's selfless act is a big surprise and really works. Our heroes are decorated and the film end on John Williams' rousing score.In some ways this was meant to stand alone, only brief hints are given as to a massive back story for our characters and it doesn't hinder this episode or make it lacking. Star WArs- A NEw Hope is fantastic entertainment from start to finish. Some charges levied against the film, racism, silliness and a lack of depth, are groundless, originally James Earl Jones was not the voice of DArth Vader and Han Solo was black, and the obvious tension between Luke and Han over Leia was only to make a point of interest for older viewers. The film is exciting and grand and very much worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is probably the best movie ever made. Even tough i've seen it more than 30 times, I never get tired of watching it over and over again. Sometimes when I'm feeling down, watching Star Wars is the only thing that can really cheer me up. One of my favorite things about this movie is the music!! John Williams has done a wonderful job on this movie as well as the other ones, in fact he won an Oscar for it. I don't know how George Lucas came out with something so perfect, but I'm glad he did. The acting was great, I think Harrison Ford is one of the greatest actors of all time. In this particular film of the Star Wars trilogy I think that my favorite character is Han Solo, the cool tough guy whose best friend is a walking carpet. Alec Guiness plays wonderfully his part as Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old Jedi master who trains Luke on Tatooine. In conclusion, I would like to say that this movie has changed the world and has opened my eyes to an incredible new universe. A galaxy far far away.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is totally genius. Very few movies have as many infamous shots, lines, and scenes (the godfather is the only one I can think of). Most people in the world probably know the lines "These aren't the droids your looking for" "May the force be with you" "When I lift you I was but a learner. now I am the master" etc., etc.The Music is sheer brilliance. From the opening credits through the end credits. The acting was beautiful. The set design and special effects were probably the best part of the movie. What more can be said. It is probably my favorite sci-fi movie (between this, Jurassic Park, and 2001: a space odyssey) This, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are simply brilliant. Many studios convinced themselves it would be a flop and turned them down. Worst mistake they ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film that hasn't dated in terms of style and more remarkably; modernity. Still compelling when watched now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some frown upon Star Wars, labelling it a fad and being equally unkind to that of its fans. Others praise Star Wars, living by it and its ideas that it garnished to do with 'The Force'. I never had any hostility towards Star Wars but I did toward the genre. Science Fiction has never been my favourite genre of film and likewise, blockbusters usually leave me underwhelmed and confused more often than not. The fact that Star Wars compelled me, kept me interested and above all entertained me then, is a fantastic achievement in itself.I just mentioned the word 'compelling' because that's exactly what the film is. Star Wars may be look upon as a 'fad.' or just one of those things where someone has come up with an idea that no one else has done before and then got rich off it through money and fans (Tarantino's Pulp Fiction may be a good recent example) but Star Wars is something more than that; it's a lesson in good and engaging story telling, interesting characters and fantastic settings. I remember seeing the recent prequels several months ago because they were available to me with the logic that if I watch Star Wars in chronological order, maybe I'll like the more critically bashed recent efforts more. Alas, Episode 1 was pretty good in my opinion but the second and third episodes stunk in terms of story telling, good characters and general interest. Seeing Star Wars now, I have come to really appreciate and acknowledge what this must've been when it first came out, what it must have been like to see something like this and be a part of it.It is clear Lucas had an idea in his head from the beginning which gives you an idea of the scope of his vision. There are numerous references to the previous episodes in the opening half an hour and it must've been both perplexing and fascinating for filmgoers to predict what it all meant at the time ? I felt spoilt watching and knowing what it all meant with audiences from 1977 in mind not knowing at all - when was the last time I felt spoilt during a film? This is all part of Star Wars' effectiveness. Whilst I don't think Lucas has achieved auteur status, I feel that his accomplishment as a filmmaker is more that cemented. Lucas has come up with these various types of alien species; he's shown us brief glimpses of them throughout the film, leaving us wanting more; he's given us the special effects that we want to see more and more of and he's taken everything to do with modernity of the time and contaminated it on screen with robots, laserguns and the now famous space Katanas (lightsabres to most people).But the films scope doesn't stop there. It presents us with one of the best character introductions of all time: Han Solo (Ford), a guy sitting in the seediest of bars in the galaxy where shootings and dismemberment is a common thing, talking crime and money with equally seedy people before blowing one of them away when he learns of his death's price. Although remaining professional and giving us an entertaining scene, the film tells us everything we need to know about a character without use of voiceovers or flash-backs or even silly special effects as someone does something truly unbelievable in a dumb attempt to 'woo' an audience. Here, it's just feet up, cool banter, find out about the price on your head and 'Blam!'; job done. The film also achieves its cult status through use of futuristic scope. Man had landed on the moon a mere eight years ago and in the same vein as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars throws everything on screen to do with technology and yet remains undated: space, space crafts, lasers, robots; things that are around now and are at a much more advanced level and yet remain in Star Wars as fresh and entertaining as they ever did, have I mentioned 'compelling' yet? Lucas shows us he can deal with the more serious sides of story telling: a brief flirtation with a love story and the personification of evil through the 'dark side' and its similarities with the Nazis of the second world war. The way the guards dress inside the death star, the way storm troopers guard certain areas on certain planets, the use of an 'empire' in a film and the way the dogfights resemble Spitfire vs. Messerschmitt battles during the Battle of Britain. The film also knows how to keep us in suspense; there are some scenes when Skywalker (Hamill) and Solo are disguised as stormtroopers, where they face being crushed, where Skywalker has to make an important shot aboard his fighter plane, when a door is slowly opening behind them and certain death awaits ? the editing and story telling make us involved and if you can zone yourself out enough, make it unpredictable; yes, unpredictable I said it.There is no reason not to identify the mediocre flaws the film has such as the may the dogfight at the end is edited in that dated sort of a way, nor can you ignore the fact any other Allied space ship being destroyed during the final fight is insignificant as we don't know who's in them and we don't care; I also didn't like the way the ships seemed to 'scream' past and the excessive beeping R2D2 kept making. These things aside, the film is still a 'blockbuster' and firmly cemented the legacy that summer films now have ? next time you watch a blockbuster that's guaranteed to rake in cash thanks to your favourite stars and characters, spare a thought for little known Lucas and co. whose Star Wars wasn't expected to do well and yet took the time to entertain and remained smart at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars - A New Hope.. Awesome film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally decided to watch this movie. I have it on DVD, and I have to say it was just awesome. I usually don't like movies with the genre of science fiction because movies based in the future usually use words that don't exist yet and talk about machinery that doesn't exist yet because they try to make it sound more like the future. This movie did that, too. But I decided to just continue watching and I understood more of the movie.Star Wars A New Hope. This film was exciting, full of action, and just fun to watch. The graphics were absolutely amazing! Oh my gosh. I never knew a movie filmed in 1977 could have graphics this great. I wonder how the newer Star Wars film are. It might make me pass out. The writing was just.. great. The actors were wonderful! This is probably the first movie I've seen without at least one bad actor. In the beginning though, I could notice someone was trying not to smile. I didn't care.This will be the start of my love of watching Star Wars! I have the collection and I'll watch the next one after my shower. I'll stay up all day watching the movies.I recommend this movie to everyone. Gosh, I feel like I'm going to be called a Star Wars nerd. Those who haven't watched it just don't know how amazing this film is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right before i start let me just say i'm writing a comment for all the star wars films not just a new hope.OK star wars is the best movie franchise possibly of all time.George lucas probably could never have imagined in his wildest dreams how big this franchise would become.Everyone knows the story about how Luke skywalker has to fight against the empire so on.The acting is very good and the special effects are amazing for a seventies sci-fi.Now i've checked and obviously some people actually hate the series.Now love it or hate it, but it is the biggest selling thing on the planet and your going to have to live with it.I personally think that the older star wars movies are far superiour and the most recent ones don't need the ratings they've received on IMDb.The good thing about star wars is the effects the acting the story and the music.Very worthy of being remembered throughout history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's all be thankful that today's computer effects did not exist when Lucas made the original Star Wars trilogy, because if they had then the original movies would have looked as bleh as the new ones. With the new trilogy, Lucas proves once and for all that he himself doesn't even understand what was good about the original movies. The original Star Wars movies are cool because they create a convincing, alien culture. Everything looks used, rugged and thousands of years old! It's believable as the surroundings of a five-thousand year-old and truly alien culture. It creates a timeless impression.The new movies, on the other hand, are nothing but run-of-the-mill "hot right now" special effects which will look dated in a couple of years. The look they achieve is generic futurism as we always imagine it, all sleek, silvered and aero-dynamic, all devoid of imagination. Fie on it, I say!!The new trilogy does not deseve to exist. Lucas you fiend, how much did Hollywood pay you to kill your imagination?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has it been 30 years since we first enjoyed one of the most spectacular films of the 20th Century. This film is older than many of the people I know.Volumes have been written on the creativity and innovation that was brought forth by George Lucas. This film had it all: sets, costuming, visual effects, music, writing and directing. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were light years behind the rest of America when they ignored this film for some Woody Allen comedy. They really showed their bias there! It is hard to believe Harrison Ford had been around for 10 years before this film. He seemed so young and fresh, and we know he goes on to some great work after wards. He is the one I remember most fondly from the film. Of course, one will never forget Chewbacca.</fullReview>

Directed by George Lucas, the film follows a young farmer who later is sent on a mission to save an enslaved princess along with the witty Han Solo and the 6 foot monster Chewbacca, who all have to take part in this daring quest of hope and vengeance, freedom and sacrifice. Nominated for best picture of 1977 and winner for the best visual effects comes the adventure of a lifetime. The acting is exceptionally good including Harrison Ford in some of his greatest acting forms and as for Mark Hamill, this film started him in his carree.

		<shortDescription>One of the first great 'epic' movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning An unbelievable thirty years after it was first released, George Lucas's epic fantasy Star Wars still looks amazingly fresh and fantastical and has left an indelible impression on sci-fi fans and movie lovers, young and old, across the world.I can't recite every name and thing about the film like your most ardent sci-fi nerd the film's inspired over the years, but the basic sketch of the plot can be described like this. Basically, the universe has been taken over by the Galactic Empire, lead by a treacherous Jedi Knight called Darth Vader (David Prowse- voiced by James Earl Jones) and his commander, a wicked emperor. Worse, they have built a devastating new weapon called The Death Star which could kill many people. The Rebel Alliance, lead by plucky Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) have been fighting back and she has stored some information in an android named R2-D2 (played by Kenny Baker?) which is actually a distress signal that must reach the reclusive warrior Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness.) Instead, the first to find out about it is a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill.) He becomes determined to bring the Empire down when they murder his family and eventually finds mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who, for a price, takes them on board to lead a battle against the Empire.Whooo, that was quite a complicated plot summary for such a film. But it's detailed plot is probably what's spawned all the madcap fans over the years, who can recite every character and group of characters and moreorless everything to do with this film. It may be 30, but Star Wars can still be regarded as one of the biggest blockbusters of all time, a film that could even put some of today's modern blockbusters to shame. It's one of the biggest sort of 'epic' films ever, massive on spectacle and style, spawning some unforgettable characters including Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader and, of course, the non-human characters Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. While Ford's career blossomed after this, his co stars Hamill and Fisher weren't so lucky and mostly got work in low budget films, usually straight to video.I can't make out I'm a Star Wars fanatic (as my rubbish plot summary should have proved) but I can still appreciate it for the classic action film it is and how it changed the face of the modern sci-fi film forever. Thirtieth anniversary fever starts here. *****</fullReview>

I loved all of the action scenes and the fights in outer space. I loved all of the other characters too such as Chewy, R2D2 and 3CPO.This movie also has a great storyline that follows into all of the rest of the movies. A little bit like a soap opera but much better. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you would missing out on one of the greatest movies of all time.

		<fullReview>Star Wars was the film that changed cinema forever. It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.My favorite scenes include the opening sequence: the massive imperial Star Destroyer roaring over the screen attacking the fleeing rebel cruiser, that scene is mind-blowing on a cinema screen, i love the introduction of Darth Vader emerging from the smoke of the laser battle between the Stormtroopers and the Rebels, i also like the way Vader is established as an evil killer right away when he crushes the neck of some poor hapless rebel prisoner holding him up with one hand and throwing him to the side like a rag doll, this gives Vader's character a sense of malevolence from the kickoff.Luke sees Obi-wan's plight, Obi-wan smiles at Vader, he raises his saber and closes his eyes, Vader strikes as look screams 'NO!' and John Williams score swells with tragic loss as Luke blasts away at the Stormtroopers. Its the one scene that sticks in my mind about A New Hope, that isn't special effects.The final aerial assault between TIE fighters and X-wing fighters over the Death Star is perhaps the most exciting finale of any movie. It was captivating and simply amazing when first performed. Even someone not a fan of Star Wars could not have liked that scene.</fullReview>

The film in itself made "Sci-fi" seem cool who knew that you could invent planets and species up and not be classed as a nerd or a geek or a weird person. The film is home to one of the best bad guys ever in the form of Darth Vader. His deep booming voice exudes itself in the corridors of the death star in which it makes the crew realise he is the BOSS and there will be know other like him. Luke Skywalker and Han solo make a formidable team but no one can compare in staring to Becca but sometimes his incessant groaning gets on me. Carrie Fisher provides good support as princess Leia but it is Mark Hamill who steals the show as Luke Skywalker</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Episode 4 Came First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe. This is the film, &amp; it established Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill), OBEONE KANOBI (Alec Guiness), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) &amp; Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) as part of a group rebels fighting the evil Empire, the Emperor &amp; Darth Vader. In parallel with Ben Hur is the one quote which carries the next 3 episodes. "Strike me down, Darth, &amp; I will become more powerful than you can ever imagine." This Obeone Kanobi quote makes &amp; Darth's slaying him, makes his character like Christ in Ben Hur as Kanobi dies &amp; then his spirit lives on in the force against the Empire. A New Hope was just that for the American movie goer as this film represented a new hope that films are made which entertain &amp; stimulate the imagination. George Lucas accomplished this &amp; set the stage for much more with this movie. While the film had to be done on a tighter budget than the rest of the series, this made the acting &amp; script more important in this film than in the others. This film made us want more. The climatic Death Star Raid sequence is arguably one of the best battle sequences ever in a science fiction film. It grips the audience with the fate of the rebellion in the balance. When I first saw this film, the great counter balance was with C3PO &amp; R2D2 as robots behaving like Abbott &amp; Costello for comic relief from all the serious acting going on around them. This balance is important in making this film entertaining too, though is often over-looked by film critics. This film created a hero for a whole generation of film fans, even 2 generations now.Few films have captured the imagination enough to spawn 2 sequels &amp; 3 prequels which have all done well. Then there is something about evil empires &amp; young hero's fighting impossible odds &amp; winning which brings out the film fan in all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars the movie seems very closely similar to military science and international peace accords involving space exploration and the ability to orbit the earth. I think the characters are very thought out with respect to human nature and actually events of military history.As I have read an exceptional book I will quote a few lines and cite it for you. As the main point of the book is and was to establish a trade route from Berlin to Bagdad using geological survey around the year 1914. The manipulation of foreign policy, free trade, and political science were essential in accomplishing this objective. Absolutely nothing should stand in the way of this objective, not the Moon or the Sun. The objective and its ideology would be the foundations of a new Pax Roma society, in the case of the cited book a German Society. A key and dominate figure was Baron Von Giesl from the Vienna Militaerische Rundschau, "Monarchy as a great power" and "The moral factors are with us, as also is the force".The book I am citing from in the above can be found within comments for the movie The Postman with actor Kevin Costner. So please refer to comments for that movie if you would like to know the Title, Editors, Publisher, and date of Publication for the above mentioned book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one that started it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any film has a claim to the greatest film of all time it is surely this. It spawned probably the greatest movie saga to ever grace the big screen...STAR WARS! It invigorated what was basically a dying film industry; it opened the door for countless more sci-fi and fantasy films that have been ambitiously created over the years. Peter Jackson himself said that he was inspired to taking on a task as large as Lord of the Rings after seeing how George Lucas had dealt with Star Wars. More immediate inspirations would be Alien and the Star Trek Movie; sci-fi successes inspired by Star Wars. But moreover it is the ultimate cult classic; it influenced the lives of an entire generation in 1977 and when it was re-released in 1997 it did a similar job, as I am part of that generation. It is not only a critical part of the film industry and critical part of western society. I truly believe that an epic like Star Wars is good for the world in every way. It symbolises hope or a NEW HOPE as the case may be. It is a modern fairy tale that delivers all the right messages. Or if you're just in it for the entertainment then there's isn't anything to complain about there either.What is brilliant about it now of course is how it fits into the brilliant Hexilogy that is Star Wars...seamlessly I might add. It picks up right off where Return of the Sith lets off and continues those magnificent adventure. Surely ones first reaction after Return of the Sith would be to immediately re-watch Star Wars. But despite its integral part of the Star Wars Saga, what makes this film stand out of all six for me is how it stands on its own. Even though I wasn't alive then I really sense how it captured the mood of the time that '77 feeling. I love it.You can watch this film and see it as part of the bigger picture in which case you get that extra depth from it; but you can also watch it as if you are a little kid back when you first saw it and it was the only film you ever watched. Thats the beauty of this film...thats why its the one and only Star Wars.</fullReview>

George Lucas did a phenomenal job of bringing this story to life. I loved how the futuristic world wasn't all shiny new chrome, but had a worn, lived in feel. Harrison Ford is the perfect Han Solo, and James Earl Jones' deep voice was dark and threatening (the only reason I wasn't scared was because I kept seeing Mufasa) All in all, even if you're not a big fan of science-fiction movies, this is one film you have to see, along with all of its sequels and prequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, 1977...I was 9 years old when this came out, and I can still remember waiting in line waiting to get into the theater to see this one. Me, my brother, his friend and my Mom were there. I can even remember sneaking in for a tiny bit while the movie was still playing for the previous show, to breathlessly report that they were loading "some robot into a spaceship". My Brother's friend says, "Oh, that's R2-D2".So started a good 20+ viewings of this film. This stuff never gets tiring. I hadn't actually seen it in a while, so it was quite amusing to tie it in with the later (well, earlier neener neener) movies and what not. I was like, "there's no WAY Lucas had one movie in mind!" because I was answering questions that IV offered that the other movies gave! So this was a GREAT course in movie history, and worth watching if this is your first... or 32482th time using the force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's another film where everything fits. I was 9 or 10 years old when this film started in Germany. And I remember that after visiting the first trailer on TV I examined every issue of our newspaper several weeks to see when the movie starts. My father had no chance to refuse my bid to go and watch this film. We got the last two tickets and what followed was so overwhelming that I can't put it into words to describe it adequately. And I never forgot this feeling. Whenever I watch this film I see it through my children's eyes. So my comment is everything but not the slightest touch objective. For my present day view this gave me an unequaled gift. Whenever I watch a movie and it gives me the faintest feeling of what I felt there it's a very good one for me. A film that has the power to make you see it with children's eyes is one of the rare godsends for mankind</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best in the saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first Star Wars movie that I ever saw. I first saw it back in 1990. (I think)I was only 6 at the time; I really didn't understand the meaning of the story.Now that I'm 21, I understand it perfectly. As I said in the comment I made about Episode VI, the three main characters were portrayed perfectly. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher played Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, respectively. Only those three actors could have played the roles.As for Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he did well. I hadn't heard of Alec Guiness until this movie, nor had i seen any of his movies.**Minor spoilers ahead** I loved the final battle of the Death Star, though the death of Obi-Wan made me a bit queasy. I also noticed, now that I've seen all 6 movies, Yoda is not in this movie. He appears in the other 5, but is not in this one at all.My Score: 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bar None... The greatest motion picture ever filmed!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I drove 50 miles to see this film on opening day during the summer of 1977. I saw it several times in it's original theatrical run, then I saw it a couple of times on each subsequent re-release. The last time I watched Star Wars in a theater (excluding the 1997 special edition) was in 1985 at a drive-in theater. In 8 years... the total number of visits I made to the big-screen to see Star Wars ... 21. There are two or three things that make Star Wars the best movie ever made. First, there were those incredible special effects. Special effects are not a big deal any more. Last summer I saw "War Of The Worlds" and, while I enjoyed the movie, I wasn't that impressed as the aliens blasted people out of their clothes and annihilated the bridge next to Tom Cruise's home. I've seen movies in the past few years in which the main star of the movie doesn't exist, except in the mind of the creator and in a computer. Anything a writer/producer/director can possibly imagine can be stunningly rendered on the screen using CGI. Such was not the case in 1977. As the camera paned down to the surface of Tatooine after the opening crawl, showing Vader's ship closing in on Princess Leia's ship, it was breathtaking... Like standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon. No one had ever done anything like this before. Star Wars was first and foremost a special effects movie. Second, the story. Our world was in turmoil throughout the 70's. The Soviet Union was at the top of their game. The US was torn and devastated by the Vietnam war. A President resigned in disgrace. Inflation was killing the financial future of the working man. We waited in line to buy gas. Americans were being held hostage in Iran. Hollywood was cranking out great movies. The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now and Chinatown were the top movies of the 70's. Some of the best movies ever made, but notice that all of them are somewhat dark. Godfather is a bloodbath and the ending shows evil winning out over Michael Corleone's soul. In Cuckoo's Nest our hero enters an institution a fun-loving goof ball and suffers a terrible death. Taxi Driver is about darkness and evil pushing a man into insanity. I could go on.. Even those famous disaster flicks of the 70's consider it a happy ending if 6 people out of 1000 survive (Poseidon Adventure). Star Wars gave us a good old fashioned battle between good and evil... and good prevailed. Sure, we felt loss when Vader struck down Obi Wan, but Obi Wan's spirit continued through out the rest of the movie as if his death didn't occur. At the end, after an emotional battle and a bit of a twist, with great ceremony, the hero's are honored and the closing credits roll to John William's majestic score. In 1977, there were very few movies you walked out of, feeling like you had lived a fantasy, feeling like you were there. But I was in that auditorium when Leia placed those medals on Luke and Han's neck. I wanted that feeling over and over and that's why I saw it every chance I got. In the early 80's I paid $150 for a bootleg VHS video, shot right off the screen of a theater, complete with washed out color and the flicker caused by the different frame rates of TV and motion pictures. When Star Wars was first released on video, the price for a VHS cassette was over a hundred dollars and I purchased it then. I purchased it again when it became available on Laser Disc, and again when they released the "definitive collection" (widescreen with Dolbly Pro-Logic Surround) on Laser Disc. I bought it again when the DVD became available. I will probably buy it one final time if/when it's released on high-definition video (added in 2012-I have the set on Blu Ray). That's how much I love this movie. "Empire", "Jedi" and the prequels were all great motion pictures, but only Star Wars (today known as "Episode IV- A New Hope") had the magic... because it had never been done before. I understand why my kids don't share my enthusiasm. There is absolutely nothing a film maker can do to get the "wow factor" back. At no time did anyone say "how did they do that" when aliens were vaporizing humans in "War of the Worlds". I don't give special effects a second thought any more. I understand why some people call Star Wars over rated. But I also understand why it ranks #2 in all-time domestic gross and has been near the top of the AFI's list of 100 best movies ever made for the past 20 years. The magic of Star Wars can not and will not ever be repeated. The reason: Prior to 1977, you couldn't even imagine such realistic images ever being filmed. Today, anything you can imagine, you can see (yawn). Star Wars is the greatest triumph in movie-making and deserved to get a Oscar for Best Picture of the millennium. It saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy, it began the tradition of the Summer Blockbuster (along with Jaws), it started the special effects revolution and made going to the movies an 'experience'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful, inspiring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie my parents ever took me to see as a kid. It was 1979, I was 4 &amp; it was the film's original theatrical run. I liked it so much that when it was re-released later on that year we went to see it again. This may be my favorite film. It's a hard call for me to sum up every film I've ever seen &amp; pick a #1, but this one would be close. I'm not one of these people that says that STAR WARS changed or in any way defined my life, but I am a really big fan of the whole star wars universe (the films, the "fan" films, the novels, etc.). I myself am an aspiring film maker &amp; I'd have to say my inspiration to produce my own film stars here. If I had to sum up my biggest director/filmmaker influences there would be 2, &amp; George Lucas is one of them (Sergio Leone is the other).As for the film...It's amazing. It's one of the greatest achievements ever made in the history of film making. It's the stuff of legends. I figure everybody's seen it by now so I'm not going to write a lengthy review on what it's about. If you somehow have never seen it, no offense intended, but you can read someone else's review. There's probably at least 10,000 of them out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie follows and actually typical storyline. Bad guy vs. good guy. Good guy likes girl. Good guy is mentored by great guy. Good guy meets a team of fellow good guys, etc. BUT WAIT!!! What George Lucas has created is a story about the fate of this universe and its peoples. He has created characters that you learn to love because of their importance in the world. And then he blows up a big space station. What more is there! This film has created a cult following due to the fact that every thing in the movie has a back story. You discover why these people feel the way they do and why they are like the way they are. Which would you rather have: a movie about strangers and have the great fun of learning about them or a movie with one-dimensional, self-absorbed people that you know.I think you'll make the right choice.</fullReview>

I have full control of my life, with both family and a successful job and career, and no one thinks that I'm strange or weird for that matter. And Star Wars does include some very dark settings. It is narrow minded people who fail to see through the action sequences,and go into the depth of this universe, and explore the philosophy and themes behind this. I didn't become a fan of Star Wars because of the special effects, but because of the story and the wonderful characters. I recommend this movie for people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Light-hearted Sci-Fi Flick Of Them All.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the the greatest light-hearted sci-fi flick of them all. It had an original plot, good acting, great casting, and it was just extremely fun to watch.The special effects of this film (in its original form) still stand up to this day despite the antiquated technology used to create them.The best thing about it was that the scenery and characters all seemed "lived-in" and "believable" as though although they didn't exist here on our world, they did exist somewhere. This is in stark contrast to the newer Star Wars prequals where the scenery and aliens are so colorful, squeaky clean and pastel-like that they actually look completely fake and you know that what you are looking at was cooked up on a computer.And last but not least, the most memorable screen villain of all time, Darth Vader, who spawned at least a hundred knock-offs. To this day villains in films often borrow from ol' Darth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this as a child on TV, back in the days when movies took 1 year to come to video and 3 to get on TV. It fascinated me then and still amazes me now.The movie is without doubt the cornerstone to the best sci-fi/fantasy series ever (I'm assuming because I haven't seen Lord of The Rings). Star Wars, really Episode 4 in the series, introduces us to some of the most fascinating characters ever to hit the big screen.The movie begins with us meeting a kidnapped Princess (Leia- Carrie Fisher). We then jump across to a young boy out buying some droids (Luke Skywlaker- Mark Hamill). Eventually these stories intertwine as Luke becomes involved in trying to rescue the Princess. Along the way we meet many pivotal characters, see some groundbreaking visual effects for the day and get engrossed in a brilliant story.Highlights of the movie include a storm trooper running into a door ledge, Han and Chewie in the control room, OB1 and Luke in the bar, the budding relationship between Leai and Han and lightsabres. The movie is legendary and worth seeing if you're one of the few who hasn't. I rate it 3rd in the set of 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And what a way to start! Imagine being four years old the year it was released and being overwhelmed by such incredible images as the Star Destroyer in the very beginning with all the explosive sounds that you felt go right through you. Of course I was too young to really know what was going on, but I knew who the good guys and bad guys were and had a sense of when they were in trouble and when they victorious. It was enough at the time. The heroes were the kind you had to root for and laugh amidst their bickering, and it was here that I discovered the greatest movie villain of all time in Darth Vader (of course the real reasoning behind that statement would have to develop over time and had "Revenge of the Sith" as its capstone).Speaking for it now, I come to see it weak points in dialog and a few plot holes (for Vader wanting the rebels to escape, the stormtoopers were sure trying awfully hard in that fire fight against them), but it will never take for the pure mystique, engrossing mythological application, and all round adrenalizing action. You just have to love this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget Sci-fi at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucas may not be a good director but Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are excellent actors so it doesn't really matter when you start watching this extremely amusing piece of cinema history. Part of the charm is probably the fact that it looks so cheap. You wouldn't imagine seeing claymation in a Star Wars films for instance. All the same, the films dwelling nature-shots are stunnig and ahead of their time.Though we only get one pretty uneventful lightsaber fight there is enough in the movie to digest that it doesn't start bugging you. Little errors in the worlds design (Latin lettering and such) don't derail the movie too much and in fact give it a kind of camp value.What's great is that you can watch this film as a single-parter, very much like Episode I without having to worry about potential plot-holes and some such.A very enjoyable film. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very best sci fib movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie broke new ground. It turned the industry - and audiences - topsy turvy. The acting was excellent. The story, a familiar line, was beautifully set out. But it was the special effects that put the movie over the top. They were a leap beyond all of its predecessors. The movie appealed to all ages and genders. You have to have been there to understand the effect when you saw it for the first time. Masses of people stood in line to see it over and over again with stars in the eyes. I was one of them. "Starwars" took what we always hoped was possible in a sci fib movie and made it a reality. It is no accident that it gave rise to five sequels (or prequels). Lucas deserves all the Kudos and dollars he got for this magnificent creation. It set a standard by which all future science fiction movies would be judged. All that for me makes it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a timeless classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's dated, it's clunky, and unbelievably corny. Yet somehow it works, and it is magic.A new review of the original Star Wars film is now warranted in the wake of the completion of the saga with Revenge of the Sith.Surely everyone is familiar with the Star Wars story, so I won't insult anyone's intelligence by summarising it. But the simplicity of its classic-style tale is one of the things that makes it so magical; a real good vs evil or David and Goliath tale for Science Fiction, complete with space battles, and possibly the first film of its kind.The acting is incredibly hammy, in particular from Mark Hammill and Harrison Ford, but that somehow makes it more charming. Alec Guinness however is absolutely superb, displaying the skills which made him one of England's finest, and best-loved actors to have ever graced the silver screen. Never tempted to overact, he carries the role with grace, dignity and gravitas - the embodiment of all the qualities come to be associated with the Jedi. Peter Cushing plays a terrific chief bad guy, just the right side of over-the-top, but of course the real star is Darth Vader. Menacing in both appearance and voice, he is the ultimate film baddie.Side by side it is amazing to see the obvious effort Lucas has put in to tying the films together, and at the same time the original seems unbelievably dated and anachronistic next to the shiny new films. But obviously that is no fault of Lucas' (at the time the special effects were positively groundbreaking) and the elbow grease has certainly been applied to scrubbing up the film. The added sequences also make a great deal of difference.Also, in light of the final installment of the Star Wars saga, events of the original become more informed, such as R2-D2's motives on Tatooine, and Darth Vader's character suddenly becomes much more layered.But underneath all the polish and new digital effects lies a classic story that is still one of the most popular of all time. It's a rousing adventure with good old-fashioned space-battles, endless quotable dialogue and possibly the most memorable film villain in cinema history.The film has a somehow indefinable magic that is missing from both the new films, and modern cinema in general. Maybe because it is the original, maybe because it relied on models, sets, and great storytelling rather than CGI, special effects and blue-screen filming. Either way, it still has the capacity for adrenaline-fueled excitement and thrills even on its twentieth viewing, something which certainly sets it apart from the majority of films. One of a rare few films which can justifiably be called a timeless classic, and that has a genuine claim to the never-ending debate of the greatest film ever.If you haven't seen it, then it is essential you do simply to see what all the fuss is about. And if you have already seen it, you don't need me telling you how good it is to want to see it again. Just go watch it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made history in my eyes,it became one of the most popular movies of the 20th Century in a mere weekend according to my research and although three more films were made in the last ten years,that out done the original three when it came to special effects by far,this film is still one of the most popular films to date.I think Mark Hamill's portrayal of Luke was incredible,and this film was one of Alec Guinesses best ever I've got to admit it.But the film was most popular for Darth Vader,who has been voted ultimate sci-fi villain,and in lots of occasions the greatest villain for at least twenty times on the television.I hope that with the release of the final film this October the six films come a collector's edition box set with six+ discs.My favourite part of the film is when Darth Vader was choking the man on board the Death Star for his "lack of faith",it showed that Vader was a villain that would kill his own men if he wanted to,which made him a very menacing villain,if I could I would give this film an 11.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning--er, fourth entry of the greatest space opera epic ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..." From the moment these words filled up the screen to ecstatic audiences in May of 1977, a legend was born. That's a pretty cliché way of putting it (since, chronologically, this happens to be the fourth chapter in the saga), but there is some serious truth behind the impact that this, the original STAR WARS, left upon many viewers. It's hard to believe that this movie ever got made, too. It was George Lucas's brainchild project since childhood, but when shooting this movie, he ran into production problem after problem after problem--many executives predicted that STAR WARS would die at the box office. And now look at what place it has in the history of moviegoers. If STAR WARS had not been the megahit that it was, there would be no sequels, no prequels, no fans going around reciting memorable quotes from the movie ("May the force be with you!"), and, well, all that it is.Looking upon STAR WARS, or should I say, EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE, it really is not hard to understand why this film became such a status of pop culture. Sure, it doesn't have the flashy graphics of today's big, loud and noisy CGI films (although this reincarnation does; more on that later)--but what makes this movie such a classic is simply because, at heart, it is great FUN. The storyline is epic and action-packed (those starship battles and the climactic Death Star Trench fight are always fresh every time), the atmosphere that Lucas created is imaginative and engaging, and, best of all, it has a cast of characters that have quickly become household names--eager, earnest young hero Luke Skywalker; dashing, courageous Captain Han Solo; tempestuous yet regal Princess Leia; furry Wookie Chewbacca; wise, saintly Obi-Wan Kenobi; ruthless helmeted villain, Darth Vader; and of course, those lovable robots (sorry, droids), C-3PO and R2-D2.It helps, too, that talented performers bring this eccentric cast to life. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a better trio than Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher as the three human leads, Alec Guiness as the elderly Jedi Master, Anthony Daniels as the golden, worrisome robot, or even James Earl Jones' memorably stentorian voice as Vader (one of cinema's greatest vocal performances ever). Say what you will about George Lucas' directing abilities, but these guys bring an infectious, lasting appeal to their roles that it makes those in the prequels pretty stiff by comparison.Equally memorable is John Williams' soundtrack, the title fanfare has been used in every STAR WARS movie to date, and of course, the motifs Williams creates for the characters fit them to a T. One can only imagine the atmosphere of STAR WARS had it been scored by someone else....With all this, and more, it's no wonder that STAR WARS's impact is still going strong, and, at the risk of causing controversy, the original trilogy can easily hold its own against some of the more cinematically complex and impressive trilogies of our time such as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, THE GODFATHER, and BACK TO THE FUTURE.However, George Lucas wasn't satisfied with his original version of STAR WARS (the miniscule budget he received could hardly be enough to develop some of the story's more ambitious scope), so in 1997, he and his company, LucasFilm Ltd., re-released the film as a "Special Edition". This version consists of some added-in and/or altered scenes as well as some more enhanced visual effects. Purists have opposed these additions, especially since Lucas has not decided to release the original print of STAR WARS on DVD. While this is a valid argument, Lucas himself has stated that this revamp of A NEW HOPE is HIS vision. But I don't want to get into the fan controversy about the Special Editions. On this account, I will say that watching this more beefed-up version is a treat in and of itself; it's interesting (and fun) to pinpoint the differences between the original and the new incarnations. Admittingly, some of the added-in stuff isn't really necessary (in particular, I COULD probably have done without the altered scene where Greedo shoots first at Han, although I'm not nearly as anal about it as others are), but they hardly affect the flow of the story and just add another level of enjoyment to the experience.For this DVD release of A NEW HOPE (which coincides with the DVD release of the original trilogy), the movie has been tinkered with yet again, this time to fix some of the more glaring flaws that were present in the Special Editions. Although it's not completely perfect (I did notice some matte-boxing around some of the starships in some shots), this version is about as good as it can get. Yes, I would like a chance to own the original on DVD as well, but this presentation is still excellent--the hard work that went into the visual and aural restoration is very commendable and is especially spectacular if you have a widescreen TV or state-of-the-art sound system.No matter which version it is presented in, though, STAR WARS is still, well, STAR WARS.</fullReview>

The main character - Luke - is a whiny brat. With Harrison Ford boring me out of my mind as Han Solo, maybe I'd have enjoyed it more if Al Pacino had taken this part.

		<shortDescription>Your First Step Into A Larger World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to remember a time before "Star Wars," even for those of us who were there when it came out. For teens and pre-teens like me, this was like cosmic compensation for missing the Beatles, a singular entertainment event that crystallized the era and reverberates still. I've gotten the same reactions telling young people about seeing "Star Wars" in its first run that men of past generations got telling what they did in the war.Since the film has come to serve as a cinematic yardstick of popcorn greatness, it's easy to overlook its considerable merits. People often attack the film because they don't like the way Hollywood followed up on it by pushing for dice-rolling blockbusters rather than the smaller, personal films of modest but dependable box office which went out of vogue after "Star Wars" and made the 1970s the last great decade for movies. Frankly, though, I can't see the 1970s being as great a decade without the joy of "Star Wars," just as the 1960s wouldn't have been the same without "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band."The story is simple, cleverly so: In a distant galaxy, a farm teen with big dreams stuck in a rut finds himself holding intelligence that could help overthrow an evil galactic empire. He seeks the advice of "a crazy old man" who tells him it is his destiny not only to get the information to rebel forces but become a member of a legendary group of powerful fighters, thought to be extinct, and restore justice and mercy to a seemingly uncaring universe with the aid of a metaphysical power called "The Force."I frankly don't care how much consultation director-writer George Lucas did with myth-scholar Joseph Campbell, or how often he read "Beowulf." The results speak for themselves. "Star Wars" is a tremendous thrill ride, serving up butt-tightening action sequences and extravagant special effects that have lost none of their power.People today see "Star Wars" as one of a six-film saga. That saga was a worthy enterprise of varying quality, but "Star Wars" is the only film that stands on its own. You can't watch any of the others without seeing "Star Wars"; you can however watch "Star Wars" without seeing any of the others.In his DVD commentary, Lucas points out the risks he took spending the opening 15 minutes focusing on two droids and never trying to explain the strange world we find ourselves in (other than it being "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.") It's an amazingly successful strategy, especially in how it pays off, plunging us into a dream world we accept for what it is because there are no handholds of conventional familiarity and even fellow humans are scarce.The opening sequence also pulls you in, remarkable not only for its composition but for the way it is so little commented-upon by "Star Wars" fans. The sense of doom in the squad of white-helmeted men, as their ship is swallowed up by a Star Destroyer and they wait for an attack they know they can not hold off, is presented in a short sequence of images that gives early notice of the film's stellar editing as well as direction and photography. It's a vision of hell we are happy to escape in the company of the two droids, R2-D2 and C3PO, and tablesets the rest of the adventure grandly by giving us a sense of the stakes and the cruelty of the foe. Darth Vader's "inquisition" of the ship's commander a little later on is likewise an ingenious introduction to one of filmdom's most frightening villains.The special effects made "Star Wars" important, but the acting is what makes it entertaining. Alec Guinness sells the concept as the aged Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi; while Harrison Ford as the acerbic smuggler Han Solo and Anthony Daniels as C3PO give us most of the laughs, but the film would not work nearly so well without Mark Hamill's performance as the na?ve farmboy, Luke, or Carrie Fisher's regal beauty and sense of purpose playing the heroic, noble, and ever-so-slightly-snooty Princess Leia. I even like George Lucas's oft-maligned script. The lines may come across as stilted, but in a way that plays to the unearthly setting, and there's a clever balance of comedy and intelligence in the dialogue that distinguishes it from other like films.Not sure what to say about Lucas's later tinkering. There are things I like and don't like; much the same others already noted, and for the same reasons. However altered, though, and perhaps reduced slightly, "Star Wars" has lost none of its magnificence or ability to instill awe. I still get a rush of adrenaline at the line "Let's blow this thing and go home!" Doesn't everyone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original edition. Special Edition is not worth it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, Star Wars. One of the greatest motion pictures ever made. Sadly, one of the worst ones ever made as well. Do you know why? Two words: SPECIAL EDITION! I don't care if the cantina has a wolf-man in it! I don't mind the strange orange force-field under the land-speeder! I was born before (well, way before...) the Special Editions were released, and I'm proud of that. Let me just say some bad things about the so called "Special" Edition: 1- All the CGI is totally out of place and looks horrible! 2- The new "Jabba the Hutt" Scene spoils the revelation of the Millennium Falcon, plus, we learn NOTHING MORE than we did with Greedo. 3- Greedo shoots first. And misses! What's up with that?!? On the other hand, the Original Edition ROCKS! These are the films all of us grew up with! I'm proud to say that I won the Original, Unopened 1995 Edition last night on ebay! Yay ebay! And only for 15 stinking' dollars! Back onto the subject of the movie, even though the effects may look even more fake than the Special Edition, they fit like a glove, and don't stand out! As for the acting, the best here is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. Everybody else is great, but he sticks out as an old favorite. If there's one good thing I can say about the sets, it's this: THEY LOOK LIKE PEOPLE WALKED AND LIVED THERE! They're dirty and scuffed, unlike any of the other sci-fi movie sets (not counting Episode 5 and 6). Of course, how could I forget the music? John Williams scores music that fits perfectly into every scene! The only track that should be in the movie is "The Imperial March"! Overall, watch the DVD (the DVD'S OK), but don't watch the horrible "Special" Edition. Watch the movie that, in 1977, took us to a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May be my least favorite of the six but still a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has definitely changed the way movies were made. Sure this was my least favorite of the six, but if it wasn't for this movie, the other five would never have been made. Maybe because I have grown up during this era is the reason why I kind of enjoy the prequels a little better than the originals, but I'm pretty sure if they had done Episodes IV, V, and VI during this era that they would have been better than the prequels.There were only a few things that I didn't like about this movie. First the lightsabre battle was to slow and to short. Yeah I know you are thinking that because the effects have gotten better over the years that they have improved the light sabre battles too, but come on, if you look at the lightsabre battles in "Empire" and "Jedi", which were made only 3-6 years after, they were twice as good as A New Hope. Another thing that I didn't like about this movie was the fact the Moff Tarkin was bossing around Darth Vader when Vader is a freaking Sith Lord. Darth Vader is the greatest movie villain of all time and Tarkin is bossing him around? Give me a break, you can't just do that to Darth Vader. The last thing I did not like about the movie was the pacing after the space battle at the beginning of the movie. After the space battle happens, the movie kind of gets slow, but I guess this gap in the movie was needed to tell the story.Other than those things the movie was great. I loved the WWII style fight scene where Han and Luke use those space guns on the Millennium Falcon. Han Solo is probably the second best movie character of all time, next to Darth Vader and Harrison Ford was definitely the best pick to play him. The storytelling is flat out amazing and the final space battle still remains one of the greatest action sequences of all time. The effects for its time period were definitely the best and they get a 9/10.I know a lot of people were disappointed with The Phantom Menace but it still beats out A New Hope. However I do understand why people living during this time period enjoyed this movie more than the prequels. Maybe if I was alive in 1977 this movie would be better than The Phantom Menace, but I can't say that now. However this is a phenomenal movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Two Hour Techo-Shock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many millions of reviews have been written of this movie that its hard to imagine what else there us to say about it. Iconic? Sure. The special effects, certainly. Cannabilised from westerns, Japanese folk lore, 30's adventure serials, yep, heard it - seen it. We could talk about incest, the minimalist direction, the slumming Alec Guinness, Lucas's tone deaf ear for dialogue or the double entendres that cause the entire screenplay to list toward the Carry Ons but instead lets talk about what this thing is REALLY all about.Star Wars is a film about domestic violence and sexual abuse. Don't believe me? Well it just goes to show that no matter how many times you've seen it, you haven't paid attention once. Lucas may have had the intellectual chutzpah to take the subject head on but his ability to hide the subtext amongst the dogfights and the cod-mysticism, is meticulous - daring even, and has escaped serious documentation. Tim Roth would do it better with his 1999 film 'The War Zone' but his debt to Lucas, for his tale of a sexually abusive father can not be be overstated. This is a film about childhood dreams, the destruction of the family, the sexual confusion born of repressed abuse and the gradual shift to confronting that sordid past. Lucas sets out his stall immediately with the infamous 'a long time ago in a galaxy far far away' card, deliberately evocative of childhood fairy tales and fantasy. What follows acts as an ironic counterpoint to this innocent introduction with the arrival of the Star Destroyer, a searing phallus forcefully pushing its way across the frame; its size and intimidatory potential calculated to mirror the perception of the Father's reproductive strongbox from the child's perspective. Symbolically we've barely grasped the significance of this opening scene and its horrifying implications until we realise that the pursuing vessel contains Vader: The violent parent with the abusive past, chasing his now teenage daughter under the pretext of searching for architectural blueprints- a hollow ruse. Vader, we come to realise from his monstrous appearance- an evil black visage, is a deranged psychopath, barely human and in denial of his parental status (he doesn't mention it once) and its this, Lucas suggests, that allows him to later administer an interstellar confection of drugs to Leia to gain her absolute 'co-operation', when she is held prisoner on the Death Star and is subjected to her Father's intergalactic insertions. We don't see it of course; Lucas's camera joins the complicit guards in the corridor outside, but the look of recognition, horror and resignation on her face, speaks to a forgotten childhood of sustained attacks. It's no coincidence that the man's speciality is constricting the flow of air to his victims. Prior to his mechanisation, its all too easy to see a gloved hand covering a small mouth; a size and weight advantage exploited for sadistic ends - a mother cowering and crying in an adjacent room. The dark side indeed. So why has Luke and Leia been forced to disavow their blood-ties and take refuge on the other worlds and in Leia's case, under an assumed identity? Split up as children and hidden from their father by Guinness' guilt ridden Jedi Knight (of whom more later) to protect them from his predatory impulses, they have begun the movie apparently unaware of their childhood horror. It is repressed as the Freudian paradigm would suggest, in the sibling's unconscious. However, several scenes hint at what we can only imagine...Luke's Aunt and Uncle who have raised him since his impromptu separation from his parents, react with horror when Luke looks like emulating his father. Little wonder. Anakin's shift to the 'dark side'(note the constitution of his mother as a sexual object in Episode II's under the covers scene), a euphemism for his descent into infanto-perversion, lead to the absence of Luke and Leia's mother from which we can read consistent beatings with bricks wrapped in stocking, the branding of flesh with a cow-iron and ultimately murder, from which an eruption of sodomy gushed forth like a Mustafian geyser. Skywalker the elder was an animal,Lucas intones via notably disgusted composition, who did unimaginable damage as his old friend Obi-Wan looked on, slow to act and gripped by a failing of moral courage. Obi-Wan DID act of course but too late to halt the traumatic tide. His scenes in his Tatooine dwelling set up an interesting ambiguity in which we're invited to speculate as to whether or not he participated in, or was tempted to do the same before his moral compass finally pointed north. The more we know about Vader, the more it makes a frightening amount of sense. His own mother murdered by sand people, he allowed himself to be wooed by a princess with a predilection for men she met as children and then allowed himself to be groomed by a leering father figure who we know to be interested in the exploitation and subordination of youngsters for unspecified 'evil' purposes. In conclusion Star Wars is at turns both touching (the brother's noble rescue of the sister from their father's clutches) and horrifying (witness the scene in which Daddy literally and metaphorically destroys Leia's world - one of many allegorical episodes in which the psychological crimes of the past are represented in the present). Its a brave, misunderstood film that doesn't flinch from the exploration of its sinister subject matter and we can only hope that subsequent DVD editions will tackle the film's issues head on..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Movie, New Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few times in the history of movies has a film reached so many people and been loved by generations, only to later spawn another set of movies telling the tale leading up to it. I am of course, badly or not, describing the 1977 hit that was brought to us by George Lucas later re-titled Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope."A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away" and we are brought to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Salo (Harrison Ford, Princess Leiah (Carrie Fisher), Obi Wan Kanobi (Alec Guiness) and of course the most feared man in the galaxy Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse voiced by James Earl Jones). In search of the remainders of a rebellion Vader leads his crew to many places, leaving no one alive except for one person. The empires army (stormtroopers) are able to capture and take into custody Princess Leiah, a woman they are sure is one of the leaders of the rebellion against the Empire and it's Dark Lord Vader. Leiah however is able to get a message away from her ship, programmed into a small android named R2D2. Together with C3PO they escape the ship and land on a desolate planet in search of a man that no-one seems to know Obi-Wan Kanobi. Picked up by scavengers and eventually bought by Owen (Luke's uncle) they find themselves being traced by the stormtroopers who will stop at nothing to catch them. Also introducing Han Salo and his partner Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) along with many other weird and wonderful alien creatures, Star Wars was always going to be big, even now some of the action and events look amazing, light saber fights that still enlightens and excites even the youngest of Star Wars fans.George Lucas hit it big with A New Hope and that will only continue with the latest that is Revenge of the Sith as it did with Empire, Jedi, Menace and Clones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good! Very overrated but good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well you can probably deduct from my one-line-summary that I am not a die hard Star Wars fan. The film is without a doubt good and it is a classic film. But people tend to place the film on a pedestal making it much better than it really is.First of the acting. The acting really isn't that great aside from Alec Guinness who does a spot on Obi Wan Kenobi and proves why he is one the most critically acclaimed actors through time. His acting is both nuanced and intelligent. At the same time his approach to the character as this quirky old man is just brilliant (and actually if you link it to the character portrayed by Ewan McGregor in the new films you begin to see a pattern). Mark Hamill is decent but nothing out of the ordinary, his real talents aren't seen before The Empire Strikes Back and therefore his character is pretty two dimensional and let's face it pretty boring. Harrison Ford also has yet to prove his talents and like Hamill produces a two dimensional character. Carrie Fisher isn't exactly bad but like Hamill she is very young and her inexperience shows. Her timing is sometimes off and she does not always display the emotional depth needed for the character. Having said that she does look the part and looking back on the pictures I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part. James Earl Jones' voice is good for Darth Vader but with the tedious dialog he does not get to prove his worth. His voice is very menacing and this is used to great effect and this is one of the reasons that Vader is one of the best film bad guys of all time. Also the Darth Vader suit is very well done. Especially the mask (which I am told has many similarities with a Japanese Death Mask) which is just plain cool.The story is in some aspects classic but it is far from brilliant. There are some interesting elements but it does not outweigh the fact that it is simplicity in itself. Now, I know that is what Lucas aimed at but really he should have been able to do better. The assault on the Death Star is a memorable scene but that is more due to the general skills of the special effects people and the editors than the writing.George Lucas did create a universe like no other and that is the real credit. The world of the film is the actual main character and not those portrayed by the actors. I find it inspiring that so many books, games etc have expanded the universe as it has been and I really do credit Lucas for being able to capture the elements he didn't add himself and make them a part of his universe. Even though we don't get to delve into the universe very much in this first film we still get the general idea and that is really all that is needed as we will get to delve into the universe in the films to come. The effects are good even today but that is mostly because of all the times Lucas has been re-cutting the film and adding CGI elements. But still the effects are worthy of noting and ultimately make the film better. Also the costumes should be noted because they are fantastic and they really help to define some of the characters (could you imagine Darth Vader in anything else?) All in all the film is good but ultimately overrated and has since been surpassed by both its predecessors but also other sci-fi films like Blade Runner or The Matrix.The main reason I give the film a relatively high mark is because of the status as a classic film and because of the thrilling climax which the first time I saw it really was one of the greatest cinematic climaxes I had ever witnessed.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Episode IV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...In 1975 when Twentieth Century Fox Executive Alan Ladd green lit Lucas' Star Wars with a budget of roughly twelve million dollars, the only extra incentive that was given to make up for his low pay check was that Lucas would retain all merchandising rights to the movie and the rights to any future sequels. After a troublesome production and an even worse post production, Star Wars was released on May 25th 1977 with low expectations from all. An almost 800 million dollar world wide box office gross and seven Academy Awards later, Star Wars sparked the most successful film franchise in the history of cinema. But why was Star Wars so successful in that summer of 1977? Why has it been a timeless piece of beloved entertainment for the past twenty seven years? What separates Star Wars from other science fiction, fantasy, and adventure films? One sure bet is that the answer can be found a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a young farmboy living on a backwater planet with dreams escaping his humdrum plight for a life of heroism in outer space. It seems that the galaxy is embroiled in a massive civil war between the evil Galactic Empire and the freedom-loving Rebel Alliance. Luke longs to fight for what he believes in, but the conflict is raging a long way from his far-flung world... at least until a pair of bumbling droids suddenly arrives on his uncle's farm. Luke discovers that the droids are carrying a secret message from a Rebel princess, intended for a wizened Jedi Knight named Obi-Wan Kenobi, who happens to live nearby. The droids are also carrying the stolen plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, a massive space station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet. Unless these plans can be safely delivered to the Rebel forces, their struggle for freedom and justice will be crushed once and for all. So with the help of Kenobi and a wise-cracking pirate named Han Solo, Luke suddenly finds himself whisked away into deep space on the adventure of his life, pursued all the while by the Empire's most sinister agent of evil... Darth Vader. It's really unnecessary to say much more about this film, as you're all no doubt intimately familiar with it by now. Even though Sir Alec Guinness clearly turns in the best performance of the movie as Obi-Wan Kenobi, giving the character class and stature, it is the result of the entire cast performing well together that makes these characters so lovable. Hamill plays Luke as a whiney teenager with remarkable heroic qualities that make him easy to relate to for the audience. Harrison Ford stars as unlikely hero Han Solo and Carrie Fisher is feisty as Princess Leia, and is able to steal scenes amongst the likes of Harrison Ford and Darth Vader with her crisp line delivery. Even though Anthony Daniels is shielded by his suit, he matches the expression on 3PO's face by keeping his intonation rather flat and emotionless. His banter with R2-D2, despite the fact that R2 only beeps, is among the highlights of comic relief in Star Wars. Finally, James Earl Jones voice acting of Darth Vader creates an antagonist that is feared from the first word that is spoken by him. He gives life and power to a character that would have otherwise been a bad guy in a black suit.10/10- simply Amazing!</fullReview>

George Lucas successfully brought this Epic to life with a blend of Groundbreaking Visuals, breathtaking action sequences and wonderful characters, all held together by the compelling story, that has captivated audiences since its release.Sure Star Wars isn't flawless, the acting is at times a little wooden, the dialogue is slightly cheesy on occasion and Harrison ford struggles to keep a straight face as he utters the famous line 'May the Force be with you', but it is all forgivable, Hell! It's insignificant when you look at the scale of Lucas's achievement.Awesome Bad-Guys, Wonderful Heros, Humour, Action, Effects, Originality, Style, oh! and JEDI's (how cool is that?)

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's captivating release of the film 2001 showed filmmakers around the world that sci-fi films didn't have to be corny or underdone. 2001's grand scale visuals were just a taste of what was to come. Hence: Star Wars, THE film that revitalized the box office and showed the world that movies could be fun again.With the release of Star Wars, sci-fi would never be the same. Gone were the tin can space ships flown on fishing string. With Star Wars, the bar was set so high that no other film in history has yet to match its lure and ever-growing popularity some 30 years later.Star Wars is the mark by which all other films intend to reach, but none have. A true triumph of film and cinema. If you've not seen this one of a kind classic, you don't know what you're missing. It came at a time when audiences cheered aloud in the aisles for their heroes and booed their villains. Movie-goers waited online for hours and went back again and again to see this monumental film. Check it out. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second best Star Wars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start off by saying that I will always love the first Star Wars film. However, to watch it as an adult is a much different experience than watching it when I was 10. It's still a very entertaining film, however there are a few reasons why this first installment of the trilogy doesn't hold up for me. First, Lucas's direction bothers me just as it has in the new films. Some of the scene transitions are just sloppy. If this had been a first film, all would be forgiven, but he had already done THX1138 and American Graffiti, the latter being one of my favorites of the 70s. Second is something I never noticed until the last couple of viewings. The actors in the film seem either bored or are just not sure about the lines they were speaking. With the exception of the voices (James Earl Jones and Anthony Daniels) all of the acting is very flat. I know this is nitpicking because the special effects are incredible, it's just that I can't, out of all 5 films so far, think of one truly exceptional performance besides Harrison Ford in Empire. This review is not meant to pan this film which I view as a classic. I just wanted to share some criticisms.I rate Star Wars Episode IV an 8 with points added for historical and sentimental value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Saga worthy of the highest merits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my earliest cinematic memories was that of Luke Skywalker flying his fighter ship into the long canal in the Death Star and using the force to accurately fire two shots into its core to blow it up. Ever since I was 5 I've loved this movie and I have never tired of it's story and excellent special effects. This movie was well ahead of its time and was a true trend setter as is evident by how many movies after Star Wars have taken from it. It was masterfully written and directed with a great story to go with even more magnificent special effects. This movie was all inclusive for every movie goer: there was the science fiction part of it with glimpses of the future not too far from reality. There was the tale of good versus evil and even a sub-plot of religious versus irreligious with those who believed in the "Force" and those who didn't. And there was even a bit of chivalry with the rescue of the damsel in distress, Princess Leia. The characters were intriguing and all had their niche in the movie. Ultimately, how could you not like the movie that gave birth to Darth Vader, arguably the most notorious screen villain ever. This is just an epic saga which I can't say enough about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my personal opinion this is one of the best Science-Fiction movies ever made. What makes it so good is the wonderful combination of story, special effects, music, etc.What makes a good science-fiction, according to me, is a movie that combines the fiction, with amazing action, enjoyable comedy and good drama. Star Wars has all these key elements in its story. And even more, it develops the characters very well, I can't tell how exactly, because it would be a spoiler, but trust me, watch it and you'll find it out for yourself.The special effects used in Star Wars were one of the best for the time, and still manage to convince me even now when computer graphics have developed so much.The music, well, what else can expect from John Williams? His 41 oscar nominations are not coincident. One of the things Star Wars is most associated with is the music. It's just great quality sci-fi movie music.Although overall I liked the movie, I find it kind of slow. It seems like a lot more could have happened in the two hours the movie runs, but since it's the first in the saga, I think it can be forgiven.Overall, I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of an brilliant trilogy which still holds strong today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On this day,Wednesday,May,25 of 1977 would be a day to remember in the history of motion pictures and science fiction itself. On this day,the eagerly awaited premiere of one of Hollywood's biggest secrets opened that day in theatres across the country and it would do so throughout the remainder of that year and well into the end of the decade.For one,this film would go on to become the biggest boxoffice champ of its day and would hold that status for the next couple of years. The film tooked four years in the making with a aresnal of top notch special effects never before heard of was history in the making with all of the elements combined with Greek mythological mixed in with all the elements of a American western,and with it the references of movies ranging from Akika Kurosawa to John Sturges not to mention thrown it with the surprise element of the grand Saturday Matinee serials of the 1930's and 1940's. In other words,it redefined with science fiction was meant to be and that made it very impressive with the critics and from there audiences couldn't wait to see since the day it opened long lines from blocks away were waiting to see it and would eventually see it again,and again.The Film? "STAR WARS" released in the summer of 1977 by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and by Twentieth Century-Fox. Fox pulled some great odds for this film since the studio itself was fighting to stay alive and it needed a blockbuster to bring it back to prominence,and it did just that. This was a visionary blockbuster that was eyepopping from the get-go which was a "quantum leap" that "redefined the entertainment industry" and established a "dynasty" by locating the "universal" in a "galaxy far,far away" where "original" critters,"futuristic samurais",side with a put-upon princess against the ruthless evil empire controlled by the most diabolical villain in the history of cimema,the merciless evil tyrant,LORD DARTH VADER for the control of the galactic empire and the universe itself,only to be stopped in his tracks by a unknown lad named Luke Skywalker,his companion Obi-Wai Knonbi,and renegade ex-soldier named Han Solo and a furry sidekick Chewbecca,a wookie. Together they must rescue the princess,and above all get-by the guards and save the universe from a certain fate. This builds up to a showdown against the forces of evil that is vastly entertaining with a mix of some modern myth,and it is a "thrill-and-a half" FX spectacular galore that is in a class by itself. In other words,"STAR WARS",not only saved 20th Century-Fox from a complete disaster and a near bankruptcy of the studio, but also it was "the movie that saved Hollywood",thanks to George Lucas. The movie made international stars of its cast which consisted of a unknown actors at the time who were hitting their stride,Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher,Harrison Ford,with a stellar cast of British actors:Sir Alec Guinness,Peter Cushing,and the voice of Darth Vader,James Earl Jones.The first "STAR WARS" film won six Oscars including several for best musical score from the legendary Hollywood composer John Williams,and for it impressive special effects. The film of 1977.However,"STAR WARS:EPISODE IV:A NEW HOPE",didn't stop there since Lucas insisted there was more to come,and it came too. The next one was even bigger and would be heralded as one of the best in the original trilogy and still holds up very well."THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK",also released by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and 20th Century-Fox roared into theatres in the summer of 1980,and it would become one of "the darkest of Star Wars series". This worthy first sequel features more depth in its characterizations and "the best storyline so far" which included revealing many important secrets about the origins of Luke Skywalker and man he rarely knew whom would become his father before turning into the evil Darth Vader. However,a new character was introduced as well,a renegade named Lando Calrissian played by Billy Dee-Williams(whom most remember from "Lady Sings The Blues" and "Mahogany" with actress/songstress Diana Ross back in the early 1970's). However,the sequel has no wooden dialogue from the first film,but here it is more "adult-oriented" of the original trilogy while that open-ended cliffhanger of a finale makes for a suitably spectacular windup since of this one George Lucas serves as executive producer and writer here and leaving the directorial duties to Irvin Kershner. Also Oscar nominated as well for John Williams' musical score. One of the top ten highest grossing films of 1980.The final episode of the Star Wars trilogy ended with Richard Marquand taking over the directorial duties with George Lucas serving as executive producer for "THE RETURN OF THE JEDI",released by Lucasfilm,Ltd.,and Twentieth Century-Fox on Memorial Day weekend in May of 1983. This was indeed a "worthy sequel" or "leftovers" from the last installment,but in all fairless it was a bitter disappointment. The storyline was very good in every detail,especially with the "good-versus-evil" conflict between Luke Skywalker and the evil Darth Vader in a climatic showdown and some of the coolest special effects ever devised especially in the amazing "final battle" in the destruction of the Death Star is amazing beyond belief. What didn't make it stand out in some of the segments is the weakest entry in the series which is overrun by Jabba The Hutt,cute-furry Ewoks,and the realization between Luke and his long lost sister he never knew. But in all fairless,this was the end of a trilogy that was really completely destroyed 16 years later in 1999,by THE PHANTOM MENACE,which was the weakest link in the history of the Star Wars series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is there to say about this classic space war story? It changed movie history so much that even now,25 years later,people are still talking about it everywhere in the world every day. Star Wars was the starting point(all right,it was part 4)of a saga that is unique in film. From the legendary opening titles you get sucked into an unbelievable story.The first shot of a huge Star Cruiser flying through space still gives me goose-flesh all over.The special effects are stunning and still not out of place.The space battles are beautifully made and so are the countless creatures.The characters are legendary in every way.Darth Vader is the personification of EVIL.Han Solo is the ultimate space cowboy.Luke Skywalker is in this movie still a little bit of a nerd,but this will change in part 5.Leia is stunning,but will be even more stunning in part 5.Peter Cushing is great as Tarkin,a sinister and ice cold imperial general.No wonder that Lucas asked the other Hammer legend Lee to play in part 2 and 3 of the saga.Obi Wan is the Jedi Master who can mislead everybody with his mindtricks.Still,he is not Yoda!The creatures,droids,ships and other characters are very inventive and original.The Stormtroopers are,although not very smart,very cool.And then the TIE-Fighter,the legendary imperial fighter with that great sound as it flies through space.The Millennium Falcon,the piece of junk that can outrun a Star Cruiser. The Jawa's with their funny talk.The diversity of creatures and space villainy in the bar of Mos Eisley.Another great part of the Star Wars saga is the soundtrack by John Williams.He made a brilliant score for all 6 episodes and all are(will be) brilliant.From the opening music to the Imperial March.Star Wars made Harrison Ford the huge star that he is now,although HIS role still is Indiana Jones.Although he wasn't a brilliant actor back then,he still made the best of it.The scene before they liberate Princess Leia,Ford talks to an imperial commander about the noise that he just made.Ford improvises when the commander asks him about what happened.Because Ford forgot his lines,he asks the commander how he doing.Lucas loved this,so he left it in the movie. Another goof that is very well known is the part in which a Storm Trooper bangs into a door.This was left out of the Special Edition,unfortunately!Overall,a timeless classic that became even better in part 5."The Empire Strikes Back" is to me best Star Wars movie. Still,Star Wars is absolutely flawless!! 10/10 </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm. This is the sort of movie that often comes in at number one on people's all time favourites list. I pointed this out to some friends and no one I know actually think it's remotely deserving of such an accolade. All I can think is that people place it at number one out of some bizarre automatic response (what was that number 1 movie last time? Yeah, that's my favourite movie), or that it's so famous that it crops up somewhere on a lot of people's lists. It's certainly a well done, enjoyable movie, but it's equally certainly not the greatest movie ever.Plot? Should I even bother? You've all seen it. Teenager boy saves the day (without saying `Whoopee!'). Space ships and gun battles. There's obviously some back history written here, and the story moves briskly along with all the depth of a pulp 20c science fiction novel. Indeed it's science fiction in the lightest of terms, merely using the future elements of ships, and light sabres, as a setting rather than making any conjecture about the future or the applications of science (as more hardcore science fiction tends to do). It's been described as a Western in space, and that's a fair sentiment. What's here is a very good action/adventure story, a family-fun affair. Its pace isn't quite as fast as you might expect, but the story/character building elements in between the fighting are generally okay.The characters here are pretty shallow. There's Spunky Girl. There's Farm Boy. There's Old Wise Man. Mark Hamill can't really act his way out of a soaked paper bag, but the acting isn't all that important here. However many people excuse the weak characters as Lucas' homage to old serials - that does not wash, and is no excuse for some wooden faced performances, and hammed delivery. Fortunately the failings of some are alleviated by the likes of Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan and Harrison Ford's debut as Han Solo.Lucas' directing varies a lot. At times it appears quite pedestrian - plonking the camera down and not doing much with a scene. However when it comes to orchestrating the action sequences, in particular the finale, his handling improves immensely. There's also a definite passion running through this piece, a sense of belief in the project. The actors, for all their skill, put their energy into the performances, giving it a needed sense of `fun'. It's all helped by some great technical elements - a fantastic score by John Williams, some great costumes, and SFX which hold up better than the jarring inserts Lucas' added in 1997. It's a polished product overall.`Star Wars' is a good action/adventure flick. It's generally exciting, andhas a nice sense of scope and large events. It's not exactly cerebral material, and tends to be slightly flimsy while some elements leave a lot to be desired. It's fun though, and entertaining, even if it created a media behemoth. Why it's ranked as #1 by so many people is beyond me as there are better sci-fi movies, better action/adventure movies, and better epic movies. Still, I think it deserves a 8/10, and I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>everyone talked about this movie in '77. everyone had seen it except for me. I remember friends in my 4th grade class had boasted about seeing it 52 times!!! when I did see it, my parents made a special trip to Des Moines, so we could all go to the movies. I begged to see star wars. Everyone had seen it. when I went, the theater was packed. what was all the fuss about? the moving was boring, there was nothing that caught my eye, except the picture was really neat. big rocket ships and lasers. wow!!! who cares? the part that most turned me off the movie was the ugly little high tech oompa loompas. and the scary looking hairy creatures. even when i was 9 i could recognize a horrible script. i curled up on the floor outside and took a nap. my parents were watching "close encounters," and my sisters were watching "star wars," I wish I went with my parents. star wars sucked, and I have never even bothered with any of the tired sequels. watch this movie, everyone says it is awesome, but never ask me to go with you, nor tell me about this piece of crap. the only positive part was seeing carrie fisher. I had a crush on her. I am now going back to never thinking about this Lucas crap again. I sure envy that guy, making a fortune off all you bourgeois, mindless adolescents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 10 years old when Star Wars was released. I had the merchandise (pen, ruler, lunchbox, frisbee), I was smack in the middle of the target audience, all of my mates loved it. So why does this film leave me cold? I want to like it, honestly. It should be a defining movie moment for someone of my age - the film that held an entire generation in spellbound rapture.I think I can answer my own question by referring to the opening titles of the film. The fact that this took place 'In a galaxy far, far away' made it unreal and something to which I will always fail to relate. That is probably why I consider Close Encounters a better way to spend two-and-a-bit hours of my life.And another thing, why does this feature in the top 5 of so many 'all time' lists? I can name more than five better movies made in the 70's alone.If you've never seen Stars Wars take my advice - if you want sci-fi try Blade Runner; if you want adventure try Raiders of the Lost Ark; if you want humour and a bit of romance try Aladdin.Just say no kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not a classic as some people would claim, but it still holds up as being cheesy fun, especially if you want to laugh at the light-sabres in the non-special edition releases.The plot is simple. A bored-with-life farm boy named Luke is picked up by a Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi and sets off with a smuggler named Han Solo, two Droids, Obi-Wan, and a Wookie to rescue a Princess named Leia.OK, so what's the main element of this film?Fun.The movie wants to take you to a galaxy, far, far away, thrill you with the action scenes, amuse you with the one-liners, and praise the fairy tale-like plot. And at that point, it suceeds.But the film has it's flaws.The effects look cheesy. I'd let it slide if it was intentional or the budget was under $1 million, but with an $11 million budget, they could have looked more polished, even though it was 1977. And yes, I do know that $11 million is still low-budget; but it is still enough money to fit in good special effects. But some of the effects look good. The effects used to transmit pictoral and sound messages to one or the other look very good, the scenes in space look good too, and R2-D2s effects look fine.And the acting and writing is a bit hammy. Some of the one-liners are funny and some of the supporting cast is good, but still hammy. I think decent actors would be avaliable on a low budget.But let the flaws aside, this is a fun movie to watch. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now days, when I think of Star Wars, I think of insanely complicated plots dealing with politics. Episode 4 -- The New Hope, is without question the most simple of all the films, but it is also one of the most memorable. This is not my favorite episode in the saga, so far I'm a die-hard Empire Strikes Back fan, and I am quite partial to the new Attack of the Clones.New Hope has the worst special effects and lousiest action scenes in the bunch, but it also does a phenomenal job of introducing characters and creating that Star War atmosphere we have all grown to love.

I have to admit that it's a classic, well made and those things that everybody knows. But I can't see on it the perfection that most of the people does. I'm not saying that it is a bad film, I love this one... but it isn't one of my top movies. You don't have to put faith on my review, because I'm a fan of the b-movies... "Evil Dead" and stuff like that... But I've always been a cinema lover, and I see all kind of movies. Now, I can accept a good movie of his genre when I see it (most of the people doesn't), and this is one (and a good film in general). So, rent it, sit down and be ready for one of the towers of the science fiction with lots of action, fx, and memorable actors. Anyway this Lucas experiment gets 8/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas' Star Wars is a wonderfully produced film about a boy that wants to find his place in the universe and is placed in life-changing situations. George Lucas' imagination comes to life in Star Wars. A simple yet meaningful story is combined with the futuristic vision of George Lucas along with special effects way ahead of it's time. Along with Episode V and VI, the Luke Skywalker trilogy of Star Wars is a satisfying movie experience. For me personally, I think this is a beautiful movie that gives us many essentials in quality film making. A story with necessary elements (a "coming-of-age" film), breathtaking scenery, a capable cast and an inspired director. A great film overall. Of course, a movie can not be without it's flaws (No matter how much we want it to be perfect, it isn't). I myself didn't feel much of an impact while watching this movie. The story wasn't relevant to what I believed in and the special effects and robots' dialogue do take away from the overall impact of the film. The dialogue was a little weird but I guess that was expected due to the futuristic nature of the film's setting. Overall, the film's slight flaws that I've pointed out can not take away from the greatness of the film and to some people, may give opposite reactions that I've had. To the people that seem to hate everything they see in this movie, I say keep an open mind and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I think this film isn't as strong as 'The Empire Strikes Back', the advent of this film was probably more important. I don't remember when it was released (I'm only 19, I can barely remember 'Return of the Jedi' being released!), but I have never seen any film or television program previous to 1977 that is in the same league effects wise as Star Wars. While the story is relatively simple, young boy feels trapped on home planet, well you know the rest, the film is so successful because you feel that you are not just watching Star Wars, but you are taking part. The other great success is the effects of course. Now pushing 25 years now, the effects still look good (Amazing when you consider the increase in technology). So, a revolution and watermark in film-making, although I believe even better was to come in 1980.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long Time ago...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(about 10 years, if I remember correctly) in a galaxy not so far away (if I'm correct it was even in this galaxy) I watched Star Wars for the first time and I immediately fell in love with it. So much even that I bought it on tape 5 years ago or so and when the Special Edition came on to the big screen I went to see it, all new, shiny and beautiful. Now I've got that Special Edition to my avail too and if I'm lucky I'll be seeing it on DVD in a couple of years, just as I hope I'll see The Phantom Menace on DVD in the next couple of years.Yesterday was the time for me, to go back in time and let my inner child be satisfied with the beginning of Luke Skywalkers adventures in this grand epic tale. But for me it was more than that. It was also some kind of a warmer upper for the next episode for which I'll have to wait another one and a half years ? SIGH -. And I must say again I was not disappointed with this movie (how could one be). It was as perfectly made as ever, bearing in mind the fact that this is the introduction, for this one is not as full of action as the other two episodes of this trilogy. Despite the fact that this is just the beginning I must say that George Lucas did a good job on this film. OK some of the effects are not too good compared to modern standards and neither is the editing or the action sequence direction (if you want to know what I mean, see The Phantom Menace and then watch this). But hey it was the 70's back then and you just compare event movies on this level from 1977 to moves from 1999. There you had all the critic I have about this masterpiece, which is and will be a true classic for me as long as I live. The reason for this film being classical are many, like the fact that it was the first real big event movie with good effects (outstanding for its time and budget) and also a good story, which is held together by the perfect portrayals of all the main characters (none of whom I'll have to introduce to you I bet, but I'll do it anyway). First of all of course there's Luke Skywalker, a young, maybe a bit naive, nice boy with a lot of hope and ideals who becomes entangled in the fight for freedom in this galaxy far, far away. Then there is Han Solo, an outlaw who smuggles and cares for nothing but money. Then of course Princess Leia, who immediately likes Luke and kind of dislikes Han Solo. Besides these characters there are also the 2 androids on the good side. R2D2, the always beeping repair droid and C-3PO the protocol droid, who is always a bit pessimistic and who delivers quite a few jokes. Not as many though as Han Solo, with his dry comments and his kind of odd way he addresses the princess. On the other side there is Darth Vader, whom all of you know and who is in my opinion the best villain ever. Never have I felt such emotions watching a villain on screen and even now there are times when my hairs just stand up when I hear him talk or do something.All of this is what made and makes this film trilogy so good and big. It is exciting, fun, moving and the characters are great. You immediately fall in love with all of the good guys in this movie. And that is also why episode, the Phantom Menace was just about as good as this one. I compare this episode A new Hope to The Phantom Menace because they are very much alike, for they both are introductions to a trilogy. The latter had nothing that truly moved you like in this one, but I must say, the well choreographed fighting scenes and the good effects made up for it. Maybe in The Phantom Menace there should have been more comedic elements as in this one and the characters should have been more gripping and adorable, but hey you can't have it all. Plus the people in The Phantom Menace were children and still had to develop many of their character. There are a few things I want to say here at the end of this comment about The Phantom Menace. As I mentioned in my review for that film, I would be seeing it on the big screen again, when it came to our little HELLHOLE ? cinema and I did do so and there were some things that struck me when I saw it again. I am now certain that The Phantom Menace is not flawless (too much aimed at kids, no epic and moving scenes and other stuff you can read in my Phantom Menace review) but it is good and there is one thing I even liked better when I saw it for the second time and that would be Natalie Portman's acting. She did a wonderful job as Queen Amidala / Padmé Naberrie. She is the only one, I felt watching the movie for the second time, who was already up to the standards of characters in Star Wars which were set in 1977. Which brings me right back to this film. The Special Edition really is worth a look (for me even a buy) for the picture quality is much better than the original, plus effects have been improved and scenes altered. But it has not been done to such an extent that you will feel differently about this ?version' than you did feel about the original.Watch, enjoy and may the force be with you????..always.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Lucas' classic sci-fi fairy tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course everybody has seen it so it's kind of unnecessairy for me to summarize. I'd like to speak my mind on this movie. I've always found it to be very entertaining and very well constructed (certainly it deserves praise for the groundbreaking visual effects). I find it fascinating and rather surprising however, that so many people name it as their all-time favourite. I've always preferred Star Trek, i think it's better thought out (it was also earlier established i might add). Special effects are better with Star Wars of course, but that shouldn't be the driving force of a movie. Nonetheless i like Star Wars and i hope Lucas learns from his mistakes with episode 1. Maybe he should watch this one a couple of times more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great science _fiction_ fairy tale (7/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though in my opinion, Star Wars is hyped &amp; overrated, I still like it. It is entertaining, funny, visually well done, has a great score and simply everything you expect of a entertaining science _fiction_ movie. There are a heap of comments on it and I think most people visiting this site already watched this movie, so I will not write much more about it. On the one hand, I affect to rate Star Wars too low (because it is hyped), on the other hand I tend to rate it too high (because of nostalgic emotions and a certain preference of science fiction movies) - overall, maybe a rating of 7/10 would be appropriate (inside sci-fi genre: 9/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not a GREAT movie is you just watch it now, and it's even less impressive if you watch the pre-special edition version. The reason is simple: This movie was a milestone in Sci-Fi when it came out 22 years ago, but now there's lots of competition for that style and special effects.Still, it's a classic! You're watching lots of cliches in the making, before they were cliches. The characters are great, the storyline is original, light and fun and Darth Vader is sooo cool! Buy the special edition trilogy. That's the only way to watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is good on the whole, but I'd be hard pressed to give it a ten rating. (A movie deserves a ten rating when the acting is also excellent, and I'd have to say Star Wars failed a little in this area.) Though the acting failed, the story succeeded in being interesting and exciting--the struggle between dark and light is not flat like it usually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regardless of how many people love this, here's a few critiques...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who doesn't know about this movie yet?I bet you could ask a person on the street and he'd know what you're talking about.Dated. The movie is dated! The special effects were superior at the time but now it's no different than your modern Hollywood mass-produced Sci-Fi epic. The dialogue stinks, and the characters are not very memorable (or someone you could relate to). If you grew up in the 70s the fondness of this movie is perfectly understandable. I went to a convention one time and the foot traffic majority consisted of either 30-40 year olds or kids under 10.This film is also uninspired. Many may not know this, but George Lucas originally got the idea from "The Hidden Fortress," a Japanese film written and directed by the famous Akira Kurosawa. If "Star Wars" was never made, "Fortress" would of been up there in noticeability with Citizen Kane and Casablanca. Essentially, this movie is just an early example of Hollywood's theft of original works of art.I'll take a cue from all the Star Wars fanatics out there and say this movie is a "fun kitsch," maybe something you could see every two or three years, but as a worshipped icon, give me a BREAK!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really great Sci-Fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made. I have seen it so many times that I can remember every detail and every word in the screenplay, and I'm sure there are lots of people who can do the same. But the best experience is when you watch it for the very first time. Then is when you really feel the magic inside this fantastic masterpiece of the SF genre. The scenes I like best are the opening scene with the background planet covering the screen all the way long, the scene of Luke thinking and watching the suns of his home planet as the evening falls and as a wonderful music shows his feelings, and the battle just after the 'escape' from the Death Star. The only not so good thing I can say about Star Wars is... Mark Hamill. He's the main actor and looks like he's the secondary. Perhaps Harrison Ford isn't so mature as in his later works, but he's brilliant anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The New Hope' is the one that started them all for Star Wars back in 1977. It is only due to the prequels that we see its real place within the whole saga.It's a decent enough film, ground-breaking at the time.If you're going from prequels to this one you might find the opening 30 mins a little slow, but the pace really builds after the entry of Obi Wan and never really lets up from there.I find Mark Hamill a little too meek and wooden at times but Harrison Ford more than makes up for it, stealing every scene he's in as the brilliant Han Solo. His chemistry with Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia also adds to the fun.Start at Episode 1 and work up to this smart and funny sci fi film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All these years after it was first released, Star Wars Episode IV is still the best episode, IMHO.Absolutely brilliant. This movie changed the world of movies, starting with sci-fi.George Lucas' mega multi movie masterpiece all started with this film.If you have not seen it ... you really should.Seriously, how different would our lives all be without the incredible inventions and characters that came out of the Star Wars saga?These days, you hear "epic" to describe just about any big budget blockbuster movie to be dripped out of Hollywood.Which is why it's all the more amazing that this, the first SW movie to make it to the big screen, did so with a very limited budget compared to today's films. There were lines around the lines around the block.Its impact was so massive, it truly deserves the title of EPIC.And you really, really should not watch this movie if you don't like exciting film.On the other hand, if you love the colorful creativity of the mind of George Lucas, and yet somehow you have been deprived of witnessing this early career chef d'oeuvres by Mr. Lucas, then do yourself a favor: Get the movie and press "Play". Of course, it helps if you have some friends to watch it with. Be sure they're the kind of friends who won't spoil it for you, plus a big tub of popcorn and sodas on hand.And when you come back here to give me your thanks ... don't. Give them to Mr. Lucas and his excellent troupe and crew that made this cinematic dream-scape come true to life ... back in the age of Disco, no less! (At least something awesome came out of the 1970s!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit from the start of this review that I am bias. 'Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope' is in my top 10 movies of all time. The score is also one of my favourite soundtracks. I love it. The story is filled with the standard elements, good versus evil, a damsel in distress, a bunch of people threw together by circumstance end up as Heroes, a daring rescue, the orphan farm boy who dreams of a more exciting life, the returning hero who returns just in the nick of time to save the day, they are all here. but the movie is anything but standard.The likable cast is headed by Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford wearing a "I'm only in this for the money" grin, Carrie Fisher and Alex GuinessI can't praise the cast of this movie enough here. The casting is spot on. Everybody is perfect.John Williams score is another valuable asset to the movie too.All this and I have not even mentioned light sabres lovable droids and a Death Star. The highest grossing movie of 1977 'Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope' is quite simply one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars Month #1: One of the Best Films Ever (Hollywood's Modern Trailblazer)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When George Lucas created his galaxy far, far away, no one believed it would be anything more than a dismal failure. It had modern special effects concepts that no one understood, casting and characters that went against the normal mentality, and above all things, it was science fiction (not a bankable genre at the time) But when the film was released in May 1977, all the doubts were immediately blasted away and the film became an international and cultural icon.Star Wars is one of those films that takes risks and presents what people can do with a lot of imagination, determination, and a lot of sweat. George Lucas changed cinematic technique forever with this movie. He applied universal themes and classic good vs. evil to a story with mind-blowing effects and a grand spectacle for all ages to come.This particular (now fourth but at the time first) chapter of the long (six-film) story involves the adventure of a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker as he is swept into joining the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire. He encounters many obstacles and tight situations along the way, before becoming the very hero of the Rebellion. This story, inspired by old space serials on television, may seem initially basic. But the way Lucas conceives his characters and the themes of the story is what makes it truly fresh and original. this begins Luke's emotional journey to becoming a Jedi warrior, and his understanding of a mysterious energy called "the Force." This film has classic characterizations, which makes all the more universally appealing. Luke is our innocent blank slate, who becomes just as invested as we do, but he isn't boring. he is a headstrong youth who will jump in feet first if he must. Han is very cynical, but ultimately sees what's important in the end and becomes a good friend. Leia is a not so typical damsel-in-distress. She is much like Luke in spirit, but projects some kind of wisdom beyond her years, which has become typical around Lucasfilm these days, but its not a bad thing. Alec Guinness expertly plays the wise mentor, Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who imparts his wisdom of the force onto Luke and the past story of the now prequel trilogy. Now comes the symbol of all evil in this universe, Darth Vader (physical performance by David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones) Darth Vader is more famous than the movie itself, and has become the symbol of Star Wars. His commanding presence is terrifying.What separates Star Wars from other films is its distinctive look and effects. The very impressive sets, designed and built in England by Superman designer John Barry, evokes a sleek but what Lucas called "used atmosphere." The reason why we buy that these things and sets are for real is that they look like they have been used and lived in for years, and that we can see the rivets and tiniest of details on the models used for the effects. The effects are some of the best that I have and ever will see. All the films in the saga have great effects as well, though some of them have better effects more than others. Just the frenetic pacing and fast action is enough to satisfy any movie goer.I will say, Star Wars isn't Star Wars without John Williams. His greatest known and successful score adds this level of timelessness that Lucas was trying to achieve. The famous fanfare is used everywhere now, as it heralds greatness. Lucas and Williams agreed that this score should be full of motifs and themes that would give an "emotional anchor" that may not have come across otherwise. While there is the grand and bellicose music for the action, there are very sweet and emotional themes punctuated throughout, making the experience of watching this film even greater.I can't say enough about this magical movie that uses movie magic to its advantage. It's fun, imaginative, and overall just outstanding. The start of the Saga is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember well what is the plot of the movie since my first and latest watch of the movie was a half year ago. But, I do remember my admiration when I watch this movie. You know, I watched it when the year is 2013, and the movie's released date is 1977. During those three decades the movie's visual effects change dramatically. Yet, "Stars Wars" is different. With all of the editor skill and their work hard, even in 1977 they can make film that has amazing visual effect as good as early twenty-first-century-movies. Of course, in my opinion, it is like "The Lord of The Rings Trilogy" of the twentieth century.And about the war scene, what a splendid war. I remember well, that I feel really enjoy watching the war scene. It is awesomely unique war. Yes, I look some funny effect because I usually watched nowadays movie. But, once again, for 1977 movie, it is beyond imagination.Almost perfect movie, great and unbelievable in its era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a great movie. It's important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's "The Hidden Fortress". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films of all time that changed the world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Star Wars' is a movie that every kid on Earth has seen and has been reviewed and praised over and over again. But, me, just an average movie goer, reviewing such a classic, cannot hurt, so why shouldn't I review it? I am pretty certain that everyone who watches movies knows the plot to 'Star Wars' but for anyone who doesn't, Luke Skywalker is taught basics about the force, a mysterious and overwhelming power that controls and binds the galaxy, by Jedi master Ben Kenobi. Along with a crew and a ship, they must go to Alderaan and deliver droids who hold the key to the Empire's brand new battle station, the Death Star, so that the droids can be intercepted, weaknesses of the Death Star can be found and it can then be destroyed.So much works in this film, most notably the characters and the setting. Every single character in this movie is so iconic that they are discussed even in households. They are not just famous but are so amazingly written and put to screen. If directed horribly, everything with Chewie and R2-D2 would come off horribly, as they never speak a word in English but speak in their own language, to the point where subtitles aren't even used. This further adds mystery towards the film which I just loveThe direction in this film is purely amazing and is some of the greatest in cinema history. A pity Lucas fell much like Anakin Skywalker did. The pacing is mostly great but after a few re-watches, 'Star Wars' at times feels rather slow compared to its legendary sequel. It isn't anything like downright boring but some scenes are oddly paced. One instance is when C-3PO and R2-D2 get on a escape pod and land on Tatooine. From there on, a good ten minutes of clear slow pacing is evident: not much indeed happens and happens rather oddly but as soon as Luke gets these robots, the things start changing. There are a few instances later on in the movie that are oddly paced but aren't as strange as the start of Tatooine. One of the greatest things in these original films is how amazing everything looks. The effects, since all being practical, due to the fact that simply 1977 didn't hold CGI, look amazing and realistic and we feel like we are part of this "galaxy far, far away" and not in a CGI world much like the prequel trilogy.The musical score by John Williams is perhaps the greatest to ever grace cinema. Yes, there are a few better soundtracks, to me, most notably Empire Strikes Back and any other score by John Williams along with films like the Lord of the Rings, but the music in this original film, even without the iconic Imperial March, is still fantastic. The cinematography looks superb in these movies and the action scenes are very well filmed and so easy and entertaining to follow, each containing the right amount of suspense. A later, older and weaker Lucas would fall and add CGI enemies all over the screen to the point where your mind cannot cope with what you are being shown- and not in a good way. However, in this film, the action sequences are 1 v 3 type fights to the point where everything is easily controllable and readable to us. The space battles are superb and thoroughly entertaining and the assault on the Death Star that ends this movie is downright amazing! Such perfection in film makingThe acting in this movie is great and I myself clearly find it an invalid argument when one would say the acting, in even the original trilogy, isn't that great. Yes, there are a few moments where they get tired but the acting is very strong. The scene stealer being Harrison Ford as Han Solo. Each member of the cast, including legendary actors at the time, like Sir Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin gives such a chilling performance as the head of the Empire the one "who holds Vader's leash"'Star Wars' is without a doubt a timeless classic that every human needs to see whether they have a love for movies or not. A movie that is close to perfection is only let down a little by the fact that the pacing at times is rather slow, despite the content being presented is interesting. 'Star Wars' is a definite masterpiece and one of the most revolutionary films of all time that changed action movies forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of a New Cinematic Era ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I belonged to the generation that experienced "Star Wars", in the dark, with a box of pop-corn. I wish I could have seen the film with the same fascinated eyes that witnessed the inauguration of a whole new cinematic era. "Star Wars" would have meant probably more for me ? However, I believe the purpose of a film's review is to be based on a minimum of objectivity, especially when it comes to the facts. You might appreciate or not "Citizen Kane", but you can't deny the impact and influence it had on film-making. "2001: A Space Odyssey" pushed the concept of Artistic film to an unreachable level of abstraction and perfectionism, but is not the most systematically praised film. And if "Star Wars" represents to some movie experts from MY generation, the quintessential unsubstantial and money-maker blockbuster, I just invite them to reconsider their vision by imagining themselves in the movie theater, transported to a universe, never experienced before ? A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away ? a brief pause before resonates the fanfare of American Cinema's most iconic score, rightfully voted #1 by the American Film Institute, with the two magic words : Star Wars, in a no less iconic design. All these elements, followed by the prologue scrolling up the screen constitute the trademark of one of the greatest cinematic sagas, regardless of the quality of any sequel. John Williams' music plays like the celebration of imagination's triumph, of George Lucas's extraordinary creativity. In one minute, we're plunged into another dimension, indeed far, far away, and in no less than one hour, they're all here, the gentle and cowardly C3PO, the cute and childish R2D2, the courageous Princess Leia, the sinister Darth Vader, the idealistic Luke Skywalker, the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi and the coolest of all, Han Solo and his furry sidekick Chewbacca ? probably the richest and most recognizable gallery of characters ever.The imagery, the costume design and the distinctions between the characters allow us to identify with any one of them, regarding their motives, their personal ambitions or their ultimate evolution. Indeed, even the most spectacular special effects and the most thrilling action would have been meaningless without the motives inhabiting the hearts of the characters, and without a meaning to this whole battle. And Lucas, besides being at the top of his game as a director is also one hell of a storyteller, for the choice to use space as the setting of a traditional battle between the good and the evil is a masterstroke, as it allowed the film to be a fantasy epic in the purest tradition of Japanese stories and medieval quests with a modern feel, an ambivalence perfectly conveyed by John Williams' score. By the way, I'm most thankful for Mr. Kurosawa for having inspired Lucas, with the legendary "Hidden Fortress" ?And like "The Hidden Fortress", the story works because the good guys are likable but not flawless : Leia acts like a mouthy little brat, Han Solo, acts and talks like a greedy mercenary and Luke exudes a naive idealism in his attitude. But beyond these facades, every character is absolutely endearing, on the top of them, Luke. Skywalker's evolution is the heart of the film, he embodies the fight between the good and the evil with an intensity that makes him one of the most romantic movies' heroes, and I mean romantic in the real meaning of the world : the spirit of an eternal, misunderstood, adolescent eager to change the world, even the score's tonality becomes strangely romantic in any scene featuring Luke. So, more than an epic fantasy, "Star Wars" is a coming of age story with all the elements that will trace in a conventional, but captivating way, the destiny of Luke, starting with the poignant relationship between the disciple and his mentor Obi-Wan, Alec Guinness who, in his Oscar-nominated performance, reinforced the seriousness of the film and provided a sense of quiet dignity. Otherwise, the movie would have been a bunch of kids fighting the forces of evil, Lucas needed an established icon to incarnate the forces of good, better known as the Force. As a religious allegory, the Force crystallizes any beliefs that inspire us and help us to fight the adversity and like a God-like presence, it's an abstraction characterized by its effect. Obi-Wan is the embodiment of the Force, as the gift that only belongs to Jedi knights ? Beyond the metaphysical undertones that covers the brilliance of the script, Lucas knows how to tease the viewer, and create this desire to "have more" ? So, I don't know if George Lucas anticipated making sequels while preparing the film, but this is certainly his most sincere one. He worked on the screenplay many years before coming with the final story and I'm sure he didn't think of the whole merchandising and pop-culture phenomenon that would come after. And maybe I kind of blame "Star Wars" for having paved the way to the blockbuster, basically the formula that couldn't fail : entertainment, memorable characters, great score, and almost guaranteed success. Movies would become synonyms of investments, big releases, and unless you were a known director, you couldn't afford to make an artistic film anymore. The film sealed the fate of the 'New Hollywood' era that started ten years before, a chapter was coming to end, opening the one featuring all the "Superman", "Indiana Jones", "Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter" ?But "Star Wars" is unique ? Adults were receptive to its depth, teenagers captivated by the story, kids loved the characters and everybody was thrilled by the spectacular special effects-driven action. "Star Wars" is cinematic entertainment at its best, because whatever came after, for the better or for worse, "Star Wars" is the number one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In A Galaxy Far Away................A Franchise Was Born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather Good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars begins as a really dull, flat, and boring film. 25 minutes into the film, and I still couldn't care less about the main characters. To be perfectly honest, I considered turning off the movie at that point, ranking it a 1 on IMDb, and writing a harsh review. But about 5 minutes later, the film really picks up, coinciding with the first appearance of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). That's when the film becomes "watchable". It becomes entertaining as soon as Han Solo (Harrison Ford) appears.What's wrong with the first 25 minutes? It's just plain boring. Perhaps the biggest error is having the majority of the first 15 minutes spoken in an incomprehensible alien language. It is just so flat, that the appearance of Luke Skywalker does almost nothing to balance it out. But as soon as the plot picks up, it doesn't slow down.I also hate George Lucas' direction. His eternally wooden camera does little other than panning throughout this movie, and in fact, his career.James Earl Jones delivers an amazing performance as Darth Vader (O.K., I know he does only his voice, but still, that guy's voice is AMAZING!). Vader is the perfect choice for a movie villain: that mask is creepier than any deformed or disfigured face could be: always expressionless, constantly breathing heavily? He's just plain, old-fashioned scary! This movie certainly has some fantastic acting, particularly from Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones (of course), and Mark Hamill (who would later voice the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series).Of course, the movie has its faults, especially when it comes to characters. Chewbacca and R2-D2 are quite possibly more annoying than watching Ace Ventura: The Animated Series.So overall, Star Wars begins very boring, but is very entertaining by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STAR WARS: It's become more than just a movie, it's now an experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Need i say more? It's STAR WARS! I have never seen STAR WARS in theaters, so you may not here anything in this review about those days were people flocked to theaters like an angry mob just to get a seat in nearly-full rows. Neither will you here about the lines that flocked back when series creator/director George Lucas brought back STAR WARS for a second round (now featuring never-before-seen footage, mostly with new special effects). My experiences with STAR WARS usually was on home video, and now the all new DVD's, where Lucas evidently has fallen in love with his work a bit too much. But even if he did a few revamps and revisits, STAR WARS is the kind of film that actually holds up for quite a time.Mostly memorable are, of course, the special effects, were it's meaning might have probably been changed by the release of this film. While special effects have been used already before STAR WARS was released, the film still showed it's audiences something anyone has never seen before, or not in the way it was featured in STAR WARS. With STAR WARS, Mr. Lucas has enabled to share his childlike visions and imaginations, which then gave way to other directors, lining up in Lucas powerhouse ILM effects studios with their bag of ideas. The incredible sights in STAR WARS aren't just the best thing from those faithful days in 1977, it has now become a history of the word special effects, or perhaps of its new meaning in movies.But STAR WARS isn't just memorable for the majesty of their mind-defying special effects, STAR WARS also works because of its inspiration on characters and storyline. The characters, starting from young farm boy-turned hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), stubborn but cocky gangster Han Solo (Harrison Ford), spontaneous Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), wise master warrior Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), merciless evil villain Darth Vader (Dave Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) as well as the lovable droid duo C3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and many others are either caricatures of our dreams characters as a kid or inspired from famous characters in other adventure films, mostly Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS and SEVEN SAMURAI. But Lucas makes these inspired characters with originality, and most importantly, likability. These are a bunch of characters that aren't too deep, but are beloved and charming, we don't need to know more about them than the fact that they are the most reliable characters in a classic sci-fi epic.Throw in the creativity punched into the special-effects, starting from the gangster-era inspired wastelands of the planet Tatooine, punctuated with a samurai-inspired lightsaber duel and ending with the exciting WWII-inspired space dogfight, STAR WARS is a feast for the imagination that hasn't just become the ultimate screen comic book adventure, it's an experience that didn't just change the meaning of the word "special effects", but also the word "blockbuster".Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantasy well realized....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, the New Yorker magazine wrote a fascinating article on Star Wars. It explained the whole phenomenon of Star Wars and how it happened. I was like other 5 year old "Star Wars" fanatics in 1977 and when I saw the Millennium Falcon zap into hyper-drive, it was an overwhelming stimulation of the imagination. Suddenly every 4 and 5 year old child was teleported into a future that existed long ago and in a galaxy far away. "Star Wars' gave reason to why we see movies in a big and darkened theater. Yes, Star Wars was a phenomenon but it was not THE film changed the movie industry. That was Jaws.Star Wars's greatest achievement is that the film was such a grand and ambitious project and yet, writer, director George Lucas was able to realize it. No other science fiction film has had so many creatures, planets and special effects as Star Wars. It is a universe in and of itself. Looking back on "Star Wars" many year later, I can see problems that seemed to permeate in the other films from the saga. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is a masterpiece, that is up until the story leads Luke and the others into the Death Star. By that point, the film turns into an exaggerated cartoon. When Han Solo is chasing after an army of stormtroopers, we get the idea that he's really not that scared. Okay, he's scared but not to the point where his life is at risk. We see this type of problem in all the Star Wars films (with the exception of "The Empire Strikes Back"). Characters are running around shooting each other like a bunch of kids playing tag. Where's the suspense and drama that leads us to believe that this is supposed to be real? It worked for the first half of Star Wars.The first hour of Star Wars is beautifully written. One of my favorite scenes is when Luke and Obi-Wan are sitting at Obi Wan's home. Obi wan is talking about the past and also talking about Luke's father and the "force" which is an "energy field created by all living things." This conversation is one of the moments of the film that always enhanced my imagination for the film. I not only believed in the film, but I also believed that there was all of this history and supernatural elements that existed prior to this film. Too bad, the history was later realized into another series of cartoonishly dull adventures in the Episode I, II, and III. Oh well. It is after all the imagination come to life that makes all of these films important. That's what counts. The rest is mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's left to say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the honoring of George Lucas with the Lifetime Achievement Award could not have come at a better time for the visionary and imaginative filmmaker. With "Episode III" still raking in sold-out crowds six weeks after its release, Lucas is pretty much on top of the world. But what about the film that started it all, "Star Wars" (1977)? What's left to say about it? Every good thing that has and can be said about it has been said already, ever since it debuted in the summer of '77 and changed the way we looked at movies, and the way people made them. "Star Wars" is sheer imagination run amok, taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, with farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) discovering the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, the latter droid of which contains a holographic image of a distress call from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The Princess is being held captive by Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and his fearsome military commander Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones), the dark lord of the Sith, on the newly constructed Death Star battle station. Skywalker, taking advantage of an opportunity to leave behind boring farm life, seeks out the mysterious Obi Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness, in an Oscar-nominated performance) and the two journey to a Mos Eisley watering hole to enlist the aid of swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), pilot of the Millennium Falcon, and his Wookie sidekick Chewbacca - their adventures resulting in them joining the Rebel Alliance - culminating in one of the greatest screen battles, which is the Rebel assault on the Death Star at the film's climatic conclusion. Lucas brought forth this ambitious vision to stunning reviews and a devoted fanbase that has established "Star Wars" as a subculture within pop culture. It's impossible to call this film dated in any fashion, given that Lucas often had to resort to imagination to get things done on this project since budget constraints allowed for such creativity. When I saw "Star Wars" for the first time when I was kid, it took my breath away, as I'm sure it did to everyone else that saw it for the first time. That initial viewing sticks with you, and as a result the film never looses its impact. "Star Wars" was of course followed by the somber "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) and the triumphant "Return of the Jedi" (1983), both of which are also considered classics in themselves. And with the prequel trilogy (1999's "The Phantom Menace," 2002's "Attack of the Clones," the aforementioned 2005 conclusion "Revenge of the Sith") out of the way, there is word out that Lucas isn't done with "Star Wars," and may be looking to start a new trilogy. But with all this, we still need to look back at the film that started it all, the film with nothing left to talk about, the original "Star Wars" (1977).10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this gem when I was seven. I guess I'll never get to see the original version of it in the theater again. It's a pity. It was so great!! I believe "Winnie the Pooh" came out that year also. At the time I liked "Winnie the Pooh" slightly better, but Star Wars was still awesome! Now I consider it to be no. 2 just behind "It's a Wonderful Life." I always found it quite humorous that the original version of the movie is not what George Lucas intended. I now own the original on laserdisc- no Special Edition bs. To me, it's the only version. The same is true for the Empire Strikes Back, which is no. 6 on my all-time list. The bigger the screen you can view it on, the better. This is truly a timeless classic that should be worshiped by children and adults for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars I would first like to say that I did enjoy 'Star Wars', simply for the entertainment of it. The film isn't some kind of "high art" or something, nor it is the greatest sci-fi film. In fact, 'Star Wars' isn't pure sci-fi at all. It's part western, part fantasy. But not sci-fi. It's also something of a pioneer in special effects.But although I enjoyed 'Star Wars', it is not correct to ignore its disappointing flaws. The acting is something of a mixed bag, and the characters are, for lack of a better word, lame. Han Solo and Leia are really the only interesting characters (besides Darth Vader, and maybe Obi-Wan), because Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have great chemistry. As Luke, Mark Hamill doesn't register much on the screen, and the few changes in facial expression and voice pitch aren't enough to fill out his character. Still, the film is fun for what it is, and I'd like to see the sequel.~ 8/10 ~</fullReview>

So below is my Favs in order from worst to best... 1. The Phantom Menace 2. Attack Of The Clones 3. A New Hope 4. Empire Strikes Back 5. Return Of The JediSo when Revenge Of The Sith comes out I hope it's better than Attack Of The Clones but not quite as good as A New Hope so it will work well for me to watch them in order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fun flick that spawned too many dire imitators</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I like "Star Wars" in isolation, I'm angry about what it did to science fiction and to movies as a whole. Let's be honest; although this is great entertainment, it does lack depth and sensitivity. The characters are all archetypes: the roguish Han, the sagely Kenobi, the brash youngster Luke. And let's not forget Darth Vader ("Dark Invader"?), who seems to have stepped right out of a 1950s pulp magazine. I like these folks - I grew up with them - but fascinating people they ain't. The film only works because it plays to very basic emotions and themes. Luke wants to leave home and see the universe. The Empire is evil - just evil, who needs an explanation? And though there's hardware and technology on display everywhere, it's ultimately faith and spiritualism (in the form of the Force) that saves the day. It's a very positive flick, but what is really the message? If you have a moment of Zen in the cockpit of your X-Wing, you'll be able to guide your torpedoes right down the throat of that evil space station? Strange that this moment means so much to so many people.Don't get me wrong; I love good sci-fi. But I was actually raised on the more cerebral stuff - the sci-fi that discusses issues instead of wages wars. "Star Wars" is firmly in the latter camp; it has great combat, but not great drama. And it has inspired so many feeble imitators (pick one, there's a million of them) and forced the advancement of special effects so far that movies have been forever changed, for the worse, because of it. After this, movies were all about faster paces and bigger bangs. The 1970s, a very meaningful decade for cinema, gave way to the shallow sci-fi spectacle of the 80s...and this is the movie that's responsible for that regrettable shift in emphasis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars is for dorks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit Star Wars : A new hope is a rather good movie. Although it has quite a slow start, towards the end of the movie it gets quite exciting, and you genuinely feel the tension as Luke barrels down the trench at the end. Having said that, it is important to note that although it is a good movie, its isn't THAT good. There are many other films that make far more of an emotional impact.The movie has been immortalized by sad, lonely people who struggle to fit into to regular society. I have a dork friend who is obsessed by Star Wars. He goes to see the new movies at midnight on opening night, hangs out at Star Wars geek meetings to discuss who important topics such as who fired first : Han or Geeko? Him and his hopeless depressed peers ponder upon the logistics of making many millions of clones and how the Emperor is an expert double crosser. I look at him and I pity him, because I do not believe that he will ever understand its a stupid film that made George Lucas a billionaire, and none of the characters are actually real.I have to be honest, out of 5 films only 1 has been any good. Which leaves me the question, why is Star Wars so popular? I have to say also, I thought Lord of the Rings was total cack also. But the intense geek following that is characteristic of Star Wars nerds is almost nauseating. God help sad lonely dorks, and may the force help them find girlfriends. Peace.</fullReview>

Anyway, I can't see any difference between this and Battlestar Gallactia and I don't see THAT in the top 250.

George Lucas combined all the great elements of cinematic technology and story-telling from the past to create this impressive "outer-space western". The film deals with a young man (Mark Hamill) who must rescue a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) from the evil clutches of Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones). Harrison Ford is also along for the ride and veteran British actor Alec Guiness (Oscar-nominated) gives the film a dimension of style and grace that makes the movie work on so many cinematic levels. Exceptional. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

Some scenes are not all there, but they are made up for the extraordiary space fights and great quotes "May the Force be With You".

		<fullReview>"Star Wars is the greatest movie of all time" claim the pundits. Nonsense. Star Wars is a good action movie, a reasonable science fiction movie, and a bad character movie. There is insufficient plot to fill out the amount of time you have to sit, and the special effects look like they were made more than 20 years ago. At its time this was a very good movie. It is a very influential movie, but it is not as watchable as Aliens or even Star Trek: First Contact.Of the lead 6 good guys:Two are incapable of human speech, and make noises that are supposed to provoke emotion, but just sound stupid.Two are now famous actors, one (Ford) showing what he does that makes him so popular, showing off his strength as an actor, and the other (Fisher) showing why she is no longer famous.One is an annoying weak wooden robot...and the other is C3PO.Mark Hamill is one of the weakest lead actors of our time, and the fact that three of his movies are rated in the top 50 movies of all time is very questionable.On the other hand, the special effects were impressive then, and are mildly impressive now. Lucas and Spielberg are two of the most impressive visionariesand directors of our time. Watch the film, but don't push it down other people's throats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying the movie doesn't suck, given the time it was made. The problem is that its legacy has created die-hard fans which have spawned the biggest franchise of all time; nothing wrong with that of course. But if you take a step back into modern day, you will see a film with all the elements a great fantasy epic should have (unimportant boy gets trained by old man, becomes great warrior etc) but a film where each element lacks the emotion to make you feel what you should. You don't feel sympathy when Luke's aunt and uncle die, you don't care about Kenobi's death because there was never an emotional stand-point that pinpointed him as a "great man". Everything simply happens without any given thought about the characters emotions. I could name a million films with all the same elements that have been done ten times better. That said, the originality is genuine, the whole story exciting and it's generally fun to watch. Just a shame its practically been ruined by its reputation as the greatest franchise ever.</fullReview>

The plot itself is amazing but that is it. The acting wasn´t all that great, the special effects were good but sometimes too distracting. I have seen both versions. The film was also a bit too long even though it was just 120 minutes it feels like 180 minutes and not that enjoyable. Also Carrie Fisher is probably one of the most annoying and talentless people I know in the movie industry and not that pretty either. You obviously know why this woman is famous. Overall grade 6/10.

		<shortDescription>A true landmark in science fiction and filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with reviewing a film like Star Wars is that it has been scrutinized and analyzed and poked and prodded for decades, which leaves little left to be said about it that has not been said already (and, consequently, probably means that virtually no one will read my review of it!). The thing that allows Star Wars to really get under your skin and have such a powerful and lasting effect on you lies in the combination of its simplicity and complexity. It is no secret that the vast majority of film plots revolve around some version of the ancient `good vs. evil' storytelling structure, and Episode IV is probably the most widely given example of this. The original Star Wars is a shockingly simple presentation of this structure, but it is also an immensely enlarged version of it. Lucas uses good vs. evil to structure his plot, but at the same time, he adds a story that entails such a level of complexity that it is impossible to reduce the film to a tired exercise of an age-old story structure.George Lucas's superhuman visual imagination is one of the things that plays the largest role in making the original Star Wars film such a joy to watch. Every single scene is packed with visual curiosities that fascinate the viewer time after time, making the re-watch value nearly endless. Lucas is able to walk the fine line between using visual effects to carry his story and using them to enhance it, and this is an even stronger testament to the quality of the film, because the special effects, while obviously not the most technologically advanced in the world, are far superior to the complexity of the story, at least on a structural level. The thing that really counts against the newer Star Wars films - rather ironically, as it were - is that they replace the physically creative genius of these earlier films by simply creating everything through computer generated images, making the effects slightly more lifelike but immensely less realistic. A cartoon is more lifelike than a hand-puppet, but not more realistic by any stretch of the imagination.The old Star Wars films are the happy home of Lucas' extinct belief that less is more, and we can see this in the tremendous amount of material that is discussed but never seen on screen, because it doesn't need to be. Lucas understood how powerful an effect he could create by having Obi Wan Kenobi give the young Luke Skywalker a brief description of what the Force is, and then use it to influence the weak mind of an Imperial Storm Trooper (`We don't need to see his identification. These aren't the droids we're looking for.'). This is great stuff, and there's not a single CGI effect in the film necessary to create it.Consider, also, the extent of creativity involved in the making of the human portion of the film. We don't just see good guys and bad guys, but entire governments created with uniforms and even wildly elaborate outfits for their dark leaders (Darth Vader is, undoubtedly, one of the most recognizable figures in film history). This is an extremely well-presented hierarchy of characters, but it goes beyond just the leaders to include lower levels, all the way down to the scum of the run-down trade cities, as well as other characters such as the infantry-level Storm Troopers, who always seem to travel around in amusing little idiot packs, no doubt chanting `We are the moron brothers' to themselves and each other all the while. It's amazing that the Imperial Forces have managed to become so immensely powerful when their most basic watchmen are such boneheads. Didn't Lord Vader notice how pathetically weak-minded all of his troopers were? Obi Wan sure did!Harrison Ford fits perfectly into the film as the greedy Han Solo, a character who is so one-sided that Ford has recently revealed that he has no interest in ever playing him again, which is too bad because there are sure to be a lot of interesting things that he could contribute to Episode III. Mark Hamill delivers a brilliant performance as Luke Skywalker, who has nearly as much charisma and charm as Norman Bates, without all that stuff about his mother. Carrie Fisher is spectacular as Princess Leah, although unfortunately so spectacular that her role in the early Star Wars films has immensely overshadowed the rest of her sadly dismissible career as an actor. She and Mark Hamill were both, in fact, horribly insulted by their roles in the latest idiot film from Kevin Smith, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. The title makes it immediately clear that the movie is to be largely a parody of the Star Wars films (specifically the older ones), and the parody that is made in that film makes it very clear that some people (Kevin Smith) haven't sense enough to respect such tremendously successful and brilliant movies like the old Star Wars films, but rather know only to try to feed and capitalize off of them, regardless of how low they have to sink to do it.It's sad that movies come out these days that are so insulting to old classics, and that this almost always happens in spoof films, which always have the potential to be tremendously hilarious and entertaining films, but they rarely do. I hope that someone with some power in Hollywood will notice that the spoof films that blatantly exploit the films they are parodying in order to get some cheap laughs are unequivocally the awful ones (Jay and Silent Bob, Scary Movie 1 and especially 2, etc.). I wish it wasn't so hard for them to see that films that poke fun respectably, like Spaceballs or even Wrongfully Accused, to some extent, are always the ones that generate the most satisfying laughs, and retain the most staying power.Regardless of how the spoofs deliver moronic parodies of the original Star Wars films, however, they continue to stand as some of the greatest science fiction films of all time, and they remain that way even compared to their computer aided descendents. It is a testament to any kind of movie when it can stand up to nearly endless childish parodies as well as to theoretically improved versions of itself and extensions of its story, and still remain as powerful and moving as it was on the day it was released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that this original Star Wars is a classic. Undeniably, several scenes, situations, and dialog are present here that I am sure have been copied endlessly - a mark of a true classic. John Williams' theme is grand and memorable. Yet there are elements in the film I wish were polished further.One is the utter unrealistic nature of the Stormtroopers' shooting. Obi-Wan's comment about their shots being precise made me roll my eyes. Never was it more demonstrated as Leia and Luke were trapped on the tiny dangling platform. Their military performance was horrendous. I understand how bad guys' aims are usually off - but Stormtroopers bring this to a whole new level of bad. I never felt a sense of danger even when faced against an battalion of those soldiers.Second is the battle and death of Obi-Wan. Their sword/saber-fighting was extremely stiff and boring. It literally felt like an old man swinging his cane. And Vader sure felt epic - but it didn't show in what was a prime opportunity. How unfortunate. Moreoever Obi-Wan's death, while honorable, was unnecessary and badly timed. He could have sacrificed himself when the survivors boarded the ship already, not when they were standing in plain view. But then, given number 1, I'm sure it wasn't much of a problem.Finally, the characters were absolutely bland. They were cardboard characters with a single attribute. Only Han was a tad developed, the rest were flat. Luke was earnest and brave, Leia a strong female figure, Vader evil, Ben wise. The rest, C3P0, R2D2, random 'generals' in the Death Star, felt necessary but boring. Well, except the droids. I was amused.Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I never watched this in the cinema, or watched the prequel trilogy before this original one. I downloaded all three in the hope that I would enjoy and revel upon this classic. Now, the next step is uncertain, because the first was unfortunately disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt in love with the Star wars movie saga when these movies were released again to movie theaters in 1997. I was just a teenager back then. I just watched them again in Blu-ray and some of the old excitement is gone. I guess almost 15 years of becoming familiar with great directors and great movies and also with Sci-Fi/Fantasy works done before 1977 have made me unable to close eyes to what is wrong with Star Wars. Though the movie is still a fantastic entertainment in a childish way, it has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a screen ?big or small- and terrible acting. Luke Skywalker is the archetypical hero and the character has great potential. However, Mr. Hamill wasn't skilled or talented enough to flesh out the character as it was written paper thin. As result, poor Luke is just a whining teenager. Harrison Ford fares much better as the rogue space cowboy because he was a very charismatic person not because he was the best of actors. Carrie Fisher is equally flat as princess Leia. Only Peter Cushing saves the day with decent acting as well as the powerful voice of Mr. Jones. The direction is mediocre but serviceable. The soundtrack sounds better than ever in its Wagnerian intensity and use of motifs. Watch it for old time's sake. Luckily, Empire Strikes back holds the passing of time much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film and I had created memories about how good it was when I saw it 20 years ago. But after seeing it again as an adult, I found it really really tedious. The special effects were still good for that time and absolutely does not distract from the film. What made this movie awful was the dialogue ... George Lucas simply cannot write decent dialogue nor can he write jokes and it shows painfully over and over again. The pacing at Tatooine was too slow. A lot of doing nothing and that's fine but then it would need more interesting camera angles. I can't really blame them for this because it was something no one had done before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest film in the world, but still magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get the most important point of my review out of the way first. I do not, like many, consider this to be the best film ever made. Further more I don't even consider it the best science fiction film ever made and I do not even consider it to be the best Star Wars film ever made (that distinction, in my opinion, belongs to The Empire Strikes Back). However, there is no denying that this is one of the most enjoyable blockbusters from Hollywood ever made. Setting in stone the foundations that blockbusters need, such as a high number of special effects, action sequences, a bunch of heroes and a good looking female lead, George Lucas has not created a work of art, but he has created one of the most perfect examples of what can be done in Hollywood. A hugely enjoyable adventure that amazes the eyes and senses. There's no point saying that the acting and script are great because they aren't. While Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones are fantastic, don't get me wrong, there isn't really anything here that could be considered award worthy, but that's not the point here. This is a film that will leave with a smile on your face for the simple reason that this is a blockbuster that is exciting, emotional and at its heart simple. The story is easy to follow, the characterization never complex and we can like all of it because it's so easy to watch.There is a lot that is right. Darth Vader's entrance almost seems to have been done with the knowledge that he would become one of modern cinemas most famous villains, the Death Star battle is superb by 1977 standards, while Carrie Fisher is undeniably one of the most beautiful females to have graced the screen (less so now, but then she was a stunner), while Harrison Ford has 'star' written all over him, it's not surprising that Indy, Jack Ryan and Blade Runner followed. George Lucas makes his film in the same way that a skilled magician does a trick, with style, ease and in a way that the audience is left awed. It is easy to why the fans have taken with it, even if it is less so why it tops films polls voted for by the public. Then there is John Williams music score which is deserving of its status while C-3PO is without doubt the best 'comical' robot to appear on film.The sense of magic about this film is undeniable. Empire may be the better film, but it is also the darkest, while the Ewoks were entertaining enough, but they still can't beat this, while the prequels, undeniably with better special effects and light sabre fights, concentrate too much on the CGI sets to have us fully engage (even if I must say, they aren't as bad as everyone makes out, if you ask me.)So there it is Star Wars. The greatest film of all time? No. The most cerebrally stimulating? No, it's not that either. Is it the most entertaining and fun film ever made? Yes it is, and for that we should always be thankful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More credit to Gary Kurtz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All-time classic of cheezy pop space battle opera. Poorly developed characters are given life by the excellent cast, especially Ford (who rose to fame in the role) and Guinness. Story from the Kurosawa film "The Hidden Fortress" is full of climaxes, but Lucas keeps the pace moving and the film never fails to entertain audiences of all ages. The goriest of all the series (just look for severed arms and bloodtrails); Ford is more convincingly "hardboiled" here than in the sequels (in the last of which, sadly, he is reduced to trading one-liners with the robot comic relief duo). A few notes on this film. I was surprised not to see the uncredited script contributions by Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck here on IMDB. As Lucas' more recent solo efforts show, a lot of the credit for ANY believability in the dialogue, not to mention good structure to the film, should be credited to them. In fact, a lot of the reason this film is great has nothing to do with Lucas; it's a solid production that came in under fire, and more credit should go to Gary Kurtz than is generally given. In fact, although you won't have much trouble finding a "Star Wars" fan who can tell you all about the eating habits of the Wookie (or whatever), you won't find many who even know the name of the film's producer. Most fans agree that the first and second films ("Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back") are far and away the best he has made, but few people have connected this fact with producer Gary Kurtz, who has been absent from Lucas' subsequent efforts. Although the second film is more polished and is much better directed, this first one is I think the true all-time classic because it's just so much fun and it has no shame in being what it is. You don't yet see the infusion of puppets that followed Lucas' semi-merger with Jim Henson Enterprises in the 80s, you don't see fuzzy teddy bears killing professional soldiers, but you do get a princess with a really weird hairdo (all respect to Carrie Fisher for even being able to carry off the part without laughing; some of the lines she has to say are just too much), guys with laser swords fighting, and cool space battles. That's another thing -- hasn't anyone else noticed that the cool space dogfights that were the high point of the first trilogy are totally absent from Lucas' last two Star Wars films? The battle in Episode I was very short and unexciting, and there was no outer space battle at all in Episode II. One thing that makes the film such a classic is that it is so involved. No matter how many times I see it, I always seem to notice some new object lying around that I can wonder about, or some nuance in the acting (which is mostly very broad, I will admit) that has implications I haven't considered. There are also some technical flaws and continuity errors that are fun to look for. One very smart move Lucas (or, more likely, Kurtz, since this looks to me like a "frozen funds" film for Fox) made was to involve 2 very solid British character actors: Guinness and Peter Cushing. These 2 anchor the movie in case the robots and guys in suits hadn't proved convincing (which they did). A lot of people don't comment on Cushing in this movie, but I think he's great here as always at implying a menace that is carefully controlled within a strong personality. There are some interesting scenes were Vader appears to defer to Tarkin, making him the senior power in the Empire, while there is a suggestion that Vader is simply humoring Tarkin. However you break it up, though, this one is for all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legend Begins... from the middle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Star Wars* was a revelation and a revolution. There will never be anything like it again. From its unique production values, to its pioneering special effects; it was cops and robbers, it was swords and sorcery, it was politics and romance; it was royalty and rebellion; it was car chases in space chariots and computer whizbangery from sentient trashcans. A villain in black, a hero in white, a wizard in robes, a cowboy and his trusted, naked animal friend...Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a farmboy on the desert world of Tatooine (even though his sandy-haired complexion screams surfer dude from Palos Verdes), who dreams of piloting a fighter plane instead of working a farm. Like all young men, he has been brought up to believe murdering innocent children in war is a more romantic idiom than toiling the soil and bringing forth sustenance for humanity. I digress.His dreams might have remained as distant as Palos Verdes is from Tatooine, had he not met two robots (née droids), a sentient trashcan (R2-D2) and an acolyte of Dr. Zachary Smith (C-3PO ? an interpreter fluent in 6 million languages with the unfortunate default setting on Perturbed Butler). In R2-D2's memory banks, Luke accidentally discovers a holographic cry for help from a princess (Carrie Fisher). So begins a journey which will take him to the farthest reaches of the galaxy ? to him, that would be ten miles down the road to the cave of doddering Alec Guinness (as Obi-Wan Kenobi), who spins wild tales of galactic war, Imperial armies, Luke's deceased father and The Knights Who Say Jedi. At Mos Eisley spaceport, while canvassing for a clandestine captain to fly them to planet Alderaan (where the cry for help bid them go), Luke and Obi-Wan meet the most sexual character of the *Star Wars* series ? no, not Han Solo ? Chewbacca the Wookiee; after all, he does the whole movie without ever wearing any pants. It is during this Mos Eisley "cantina sequence" that *Star Wars* does its most insidious good. George Lucas unwittingly shows us a universe where aliens were neither inherently "good" nor "evil", rather co-existing in a truly "universal" society, where good or evil individuals populate *every* species and race. The term "alien" is a moot point of reference in this movie, as every being (human and otherwise) traveled extensively between worlds. (The fact that this cannot be achieved without faster-than-light travel is tangential to the point.) The common thread of these disparate organisms is their multifarious strangeness; their co-existing diversity.Ironically, the cantina sequence - which features some of the most childish, lamest face-masks and character designs - is ultimately where the movie displays its most maturity. Meanwhile, a hulking, black-clad, helmeted menace in a fruity cape and 7-inch platform boots plots to rule the galaxy, with theme music heavy and minor and an army of stormtroopers - the military equivalent of fast food (plastic-coated and unhealthy) - bringing war in the name of hokey religion.His name is Darth Vader. To three generations, Lord Vader was the blackest, meanest, most badass villain to dress like the Pope since the Pope. Years later, we would discover that Darth Vader meant "dark father" in Swahili, a fact which jigsawed with the puzzle pie that George carbon-scored into the *Star Wars* sequel, *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980), proving that it wasn't just ? as he liked to call it ? a "space opera," more like a space SOAP opera. Darth and an old lady who looks like Peter Cushing kidnap the princess and tool through the galaxy in a planet-sized battle station called the Death Star, proving its awesome utility by decimating Alderaan, whereupon Obi-Wan, en route, coincidentally suffers indigestion and attributes it to mysticism rather than his ninety-year-old intestines, "as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced." (More like that Neimoidian calamari you ate, which was in the Millennium Falcon's fridge since before Han made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs.)(Read this full review at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/StarWarsANewHope.html)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it. It wasn't the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways, what's come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones, making up the story as he went. And of course, every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time, yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa, and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell's notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh, and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember, the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us "Annie Hall." Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself, despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels, indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically, and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice, for instance, how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don't have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on, and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years, Lucas would let us down, as a person and in this saga. In fact, I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event, he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining? Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes, it pinches off other things. When "Birth of a Nation" became a huge success, it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken. Again, there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect, it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren't the best at all.So "Star Wars" opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway, so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead, it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes, it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction. In film, at least, and because books are inherently cinematic now, in books too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost 40 Years Later, This Movie's Lame and Boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie might've been interesting for a 20th century audience, but that's probably only because the technology and visual effects were all new and thrilling back then. To those from the 21st century, who've already been exposed to much more exciting (improved) technological effects several times, this movie will be a waste of time. To me, besides the fact that the graphics that have been enjoyed by perhaps billions in the past were nothing in comparison to the graphics of the average 2010s sci-fi movie, this movie was horrible because of the fact that it lacked a reasonably good plot. The plot was all over the place, at times difficult to follow but mostly just downright boring. Even if you must watch this film because you're a devoted Star Wars fan, you're probably not enjoy this film.Lesson learnt: a movie doesn't need to be good just because it's at the top of the IMDb 250 list.If you're interested in sci-fi, I'd recommend watching more recent films, like (1) Interstellar or (2) The Matrix, or even something animated like (3) WALL·E.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A 1988 congressional hearing heard that colorizing old black-and-white films would constitute "destruction of our film heritage". The speaker's statement continued: "In the future it will become easier for old negatives to become lost and be 'replaced' by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten."It's hard to believe now, but that speaker was George Lucas. He'd re-release his most beloved trilogy of work, complete with a catalog of updates and changes, just nine years later. And in the 13 that have followed, he's gone out of his way to wipe away all evidence that any other versions ever existed.This week, Lucas announced that the Star Wars saga would be coming to Blu-ray before the end of 2011. The piece of news missing from early announcements, unearthed during an interview he gave to the New York Times, was that the original trilogy would be presented in the special edition form that appeared on the 2004 DVD release, rather than the classic versions released between 1977 and 1983. Sign up to our Film Today email Read moreThe 2004 special edition features all of 1997's awkward edits ? Greedo shooting first, Han stepping on Jabba's tail ? and adds even more egregious acts of self-mutilation. Most notably, Return of the Jedi replaces Sebastian Shaw as the spirit Anakin Skywalker with wooden imp Hayden Christensen, star of the prequels."In essence, films never get finished, they get abandoned," Lucas told American Cinematographer magazine in 1997. "The other versions will disappear. A hundred years from now, the only version of the movie that anyone will remember will be the Special Edition. I think it's the director's prerogative ? to go back and reinvent a movie."The DVD edition, at least, featured bonus discs holding weak transfers of the original versions, even if they felt like poorly treated outcasts, added just to prolong their humiliation at their creator's increasingly malevolent hands. The Blu-rays won't even feature those.Lucas says that's because the process of remastering them for HD is prohibitively expensive. During his interview with the New York Times this week, he claimed that putting them on the Blu-ray would be "kind of an oxymoron because the quality of the original is not very good. When we did the transfer to digital, we only transferred really the upgraded version."Alexandre Philippe directed documentary feature The People vs George Lucas, which premiered at this year's Edinburgh film festival. He believes Lucas has no intention of letting the films' original versions exist. "We've heard all the excuses: they don't represent George's 'original vision'; the negatives of the movies were permanently altered for the creation of the Special Editions; they can't or won't put in the time and resources needed to properly restore the films. Now, we're told that releasing the originals is an oxymoron. As the reasons for not releasing the originals pile up, they simply don't add up to anything coherent any more."It's hard to believe it has never occurred to Lucas that his position on the colorization of films is at stark odds with his approach to Star Wars. But the most oft-repeated line from the Lucas camp is that his original vision for the trilogy simply wasn't achievable when the films were first made in the 70s and 80s. That only makes one wonder if Lucas's "original vision" might not have created the cultural classics that resulted from the constraints of the time.Lucas's posturing about cultural legacy when it comes to his beloved black-and-white classics should surely apply here. That legacy was defined the moment the first Star Wars film opened in 1977. By his own standard that means the films now belong to audiences, in their original, unaltered form.Philippe says it's up to the fans to preserve that legacy now, just as they maintained a healthy trade in bootlegs of the Star Wars Holiday Special when Lucas tried to bury that. "I'm counting on the technologically savvy fans to keep them alive, restore them, and make them available."One truth to come from Philippe's documentary is that, for all their complaints, Star Wars fans will never stop loving the saga, even if "the saga" is now more a description of Lucas's poor decision-making since 1997. They'll be first in the queue for these Blu-rays, even if that means they have to make their peace with Greedo shooting first.</fullReview>

The old mentor, the impatient hero, the sassy princess, the charismatic smuggler, the menacing general, the imperialistic soldiers, the funny side characters... its all here and its fantastic and its in space. This film doesn't ask too much from the audience, it just expects you to enjoy the ride, an intergalactic struggle of wills and politics. The special effects aren't much compared too what we expect these days but are used in such a way that they aren't noticeable. The story moves in such a way that we aren't bored and are always on our feet expecting different things from the plot, but knowing that our heroes will be OK as the cosmos moves in such a way that will guarantee their survival. Indeed, this is one of those films where the story will end with a nihilistic destruction go the rebellion. The story proves that hope is still present in a galaxy far away and long ago.</fullReview>

It will be loved and celebrated for generations. Luke Skywalker must get the secret plans to the Rebel Alliance so they can destroy the powerful Death Star of the Galactic Empire but first he must save Princess Leia from the hands of Darth Vader with the help of his friends, Han Solo, C-3PO, Chewie, R2-D2 and of course his Jedi master, Obi-Wan Kenobi who teaches him how to be a Jedi and learn the ways of the Force. Even after almost 40 years, Star Wars is still considered one of the greatest movies (or movie trilogies) ever made. And even though we have the infamous prequel trilogy, everyone still loves and admires Star Wars for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star wars 1-iii sucked, my brother who passed away thought so too. I think maybe he saw the last 3 movies then took a breather. Anyways, If they did Starwars 1-3 ala 1989-93 then Kirchner would have directed with Robocop2, Predator 2/Terminator, graphics inspired by Ridley Scott and HR Giger I would turn my head and look. At least clone wars would have been done correctly. Then you would have two wins. A still youthful cast to cont the franchise via the best comics in history. That's right I bought Jedi Knight Dark Empire i &amp;ii during those times. Luke joins the dark side...the emperor is cloned...the introduction of world destroyers and tie phantoms, the empire is hurt a little. The clone bats are destroyed, Anakin Solo is born. Obviously at the end of the novel, the jedi are rising or winning even if Pinnacle moon was destroyed. I highly doubt an advanced civilization like that would just crumble and fall. They would get singed at the end, that's it. So they should have winged it, do 1-3 and 7-9 in the years before computers. Models=automatic win, harder but better. Pull off a harry potter with dark empire i-ii. Make the final movie like how you see it today, remove phantom menace and rotj completely from existence, or at least make it rots, a little more darker (not for kids..dark). Make phantom menace in the tradition of a new hope. Have attack of the clones as another win, change title to the Clonewars..or make the cartoon into a live action series idk. Make rots as a win or lose (rotj felt like an ultimate win, puppet wars however the good guy wins throughout the movie, making it not to believable, hence the empire is millions strong, they would just reform which they did). Rename 3rd movie as rise of the empire since it felt the empire should be rising and you have a compilation. Phantom menace lost bad, it was like phantom menace with a race scene. Remove the race scene, put like an escape scene again. Darth maul needs to be more hostile, he needs to be the Bobba Fett before Boba Fett arrives and returns via a sarlac pitt. Also Jango Fett could clone himself, but maybe black market some alien's blood instead. It makes sense if the alien is intelligent in form etc. A modern Jesus, or a race of giants, idk. 1989-1993 then 1994-96 the dark empire, return of the sith, and rise of the jedi. Then A New Hope, empire strikes back, return of the jedi. A phantom menace, the clone wars, RISE OF THE EMPIRE (in order last part is first). A compilation needs to work as a full movie. With plot points, firstly...no one even knows who the sith are. Why suddenly make them into an army? That's what the title implies and the expanded universe avoids. You move too fast even in the title. The sith aren't an army, rise is an influential term for a large group. Return of the sith because they are an old republic in the comics. Words can be redundant on a compilation. Attack of the clones is a good title, but clones to me say artificial life, or androids in the form of the movie aliens. The Clone Wars should have started in A Phantom Menace, then became apparent in Clone Wars. Attack of the clones means the clones are attacking, but maybe in star wars land, they need years to be made. And in star wars land, this would be order 66, a full movie called Clone Wars. Also I'm not dumb. The last movie rise of the empire would have been made correctly. The old republic needs to feel old or in peace. The empire would have won, they are the winning factors of a new hope. Has anyone seen the extended Luke skywalker joining the darkside hidden scene? Well, this review is based on that as well.The end.</fullReview>

Star Wars represents many aspects of an Epic, but is at it's core a classic example of Science Fiction at it's peak potential. Star Wars stands as one of the best Science Fiction films because it in many ways exemplifies the Science Fiction genre, terrifically uses visual storytelling, despite not being the most original work ever made. Star Wars in many ways defines Science Fiction, because it has since the late 70's been copied endlessly.While Star wars encompasses many elements of an Epic, such as the iconic score, grand scope, lavish costumes, and use of a large panoramic backdrop, but it is more Science Fiction. When defining Science Fiction there are some major elements that are all present in Star Wars. Star Wars contains the most famous unknown force in film in the force. It deals with lots of futuristic technology such as Space Ships, and Light Sabers, and it contains the ultimate Science Fiction villain of all time, Darth Vader. The villains while a great example of the Science Fiction elements are an even better example of the visual storytelling. Film, being a visual medium, is always more impressive when the story is told visually. The villains in Star Wars will be seen as bland characters, that are very uniform, and wear either white, black, or gray. Watching Star Wars you can clearly see a parallel between the Evil Empire and the Nazi Party, which makes them seem even more sinister. The use of color and parallels makes villains identifiable, on the opposite end the heroes dress diversely and colorfully, representing the difference. The film also used great visual acting to tell its story, in that the actors mannerisms are more powerful than their words. The film is also a visual effects masterpiece, partly because of an emphasis on practical effects, and location shooting. The story has one other major reason that it's easily told visually, and that's the familiarity with other films. Star Wars is far from original, it took many elements from Akira Kurosawa's "The Hidden Fortress", Fritz Lang's "Metropolis, and Frankenstein. An example of this is that Darth Vader is essentially a robotic version of Frankenstein's monster. However, Star Wars proves that a change in genre, location, and overall look can make an unoriginal film seem original, for instance the light saber seems very original but is essentially a variation on the samurai sword. On top of that the characters in Star Wars are variations of the archetypes, like the old mentor, hero, and rough escort.Despite that Star Wars wasn't the most original film, it has been copied numerous times, making it one of the most influential films ever made. Containing some of the best visual effects, of its time, and one of the best scores of all time the film boasts plenty of reasons it remains timeless. In the end Star Wars will probably remain timeless because of it's visual storytelling and variations of age old themes, characters, and plot points, while making them seem original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars: the ultimate science fiction. The go to franchise. A New Hope is where it all started. George Lucas labeled his first outing as the fourth episode, holding the start of the story until a later date. For 22 years though, we're with Luke Skywalker (Hamill), a youngster keen on joining the Rebel alliance, teams up with Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness), a couple of droids (R2-D2 and C3PO) and rough outlaws (Harrison Ford's Han Solo and Peter Mayhew's Chewbacca) to save princess Leia (Fisher) from the clutches of the evil Empire and destroy their battle station, the Death Star. A New Hope is groundbreaking, both in genre and visual effects. It represents the forces of good vs. evil perfectly. Luke's the guy we all want to be, whilst the Sith Lord Darth Vader intimidates with voice, presence and action. Leia and Han show glints of romance that hints at more to come. ANH is an all round great film in a world that encompasses unlimited possibilities. It's more of a need to see than a want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch the original theatrical version or don't bother at all. I'm not even a big fan of Star Wars, but even I can see that Lucas's "Special Editions" were a travesty.Hard to overestimate the influence and impact of this film. The model work is stunning; John Williams' score, of course, is superb; the depth of the universe the film inhabits makes the whole film feel so much more believable?Credit where credit is due- despite an often ropy script, this is a classic, good-vs-evil, spaceships-and-laserbeams film for kids to enjoy. Whether it's a film for forty-odd year old men to get angry about at conventions is another matter.Also, light sabres are really really cool.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Re watching this film after a couple of years since my last viewing and watching it on blu ray it is brilliant.This film has everything. Since it was made in 1977 the special effects to me still hold up to this day (The original effects not the remastered add on's that i think look ridiculous). The story is absolutely awesome everyone watching it is backing Luke and wanting everyone on the millennium falcon to triumph. One of the best parts of this film is the universe that it puts you in and the different species/people you get to meet along with all there separate stories. The only problem with the movie to me is some of the acting in the film, it really isn't the best it could be but with the places and scenes the characters are in, the acting isn't ever unbelievable or bad enough for you to loose interest in the characters. This film started my love for sci fi movies and I believe it will continue to do the same for people for many years from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Is STAR WARS!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has not seen the original 1977 Sci Fi film that pretty much started the giant wave of fandom, should stop what they're doing and watch the Despecialized Edition RIGHT NOW!!!Star Wars has been in my life for as long as I can remember. It's more common in the world than I can even imagine. Anywhere you go, STAR WARS! STAR WARS! It's everywhere, and its all thanks to the original 1977 film that changed how movies are made and marketed. All done independently, and self financed by George Lucas, who created a universe far greater than anyone imagined, probably more than Star Trek. Fantastic characters, a story that is timeless, a groundbreaking mythos, and some of the best special effects seen on the silver screen. Lightsabers and blasters, who doesn't wanna role play with a weapon of a Jedi knight after seeing this? Every kid wants to thrill in the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Lea, wither them re enacting scenes or playing with there action figures.The film is also an inspiration for future filmmakers, with its cinematography, production design and fast pace story. It also gives them the idea of independent film making and self finances to make the movies they want to make, without the support of studios. I'd highly recommend finding a copy of the original 1977 theatrical print, most notably the Despecialized Edition. All the special effects with the model spaceships are great to look at. That whole space battle at the Death Star will have you on the edge of you seat from beginning to end. The score by John Williams is probably his greatest work. He created themes for the world that is equal to Lucas's writing.Overall, Star Wars is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to capture the hearts of billions for generations to come. It's not just a film, it's an experience. With a terrific cast, heartwarming characters, fantastic action scenes, fascinating special effects, an incredible score and a legendary world, George Lucas should have one the Oscar for Directing and Picture of the groundbreaking and historical film from a galaxy far, far away. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the original Star Wars again, we are compelled to state that this is a must-see movie for everyone. Not only is it still an exciting movie to watch, and a classic at that, it has held up against the modernization of movies and remains a competitor. Amongst the titles that remain on your watch-list, Star Wars should be one of them. The saga continued with more movies, all of which were great to enjoy. Character development varied in quality, and the return to episodes 1, 2 and 3 made for a jerky time line. We look forward to new installations in the series. Drama. Comedy. Action. Sci-Fi. What more can one request from a movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As it is inevitably with all movies, Star Wars (1977) has dated. But how could anyone think that the passing of the years has made it any less fun to watch?Sure, it can be cheesy and the acting is not always top-notch. The effects may not dazzle as they once did (though the 1970s miniatures and puppets have held up much better than the wretched 90s CG added in the infamous special editions).But there is a giddy energy to the whole thing, the way it takes old myths and archetypes and breathes new life into them, the way it evokes 1930s science-fiction serials that makes it so unique.Though SW helped usher in an era of endless blockbusters, few of its successors have managed to be as fun or iconic. And even fewer have held up as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that needs no introduction, a film I have re-watched an estimated 300 times in my lifetime, a film with a wonderful score by John Williams, also Darth Vader is great, the whole cast is fine however I never warmed to the two robots like everybody else did (which partly explains why I like Star Trek more), but still a knockout block buster! The five films that came after were all fine, and the great John Williams scores kept coming, but the others will never compare to A New Hope.Trivia: the origins of Darth Vader date back to a 1949 Columbia movie serial - Batman and Robin - which also had a deep voiced guy in black (The Wizard) making trouble. One "chapter" of this serial is even titled: "The Wizard Strikes Back" (sounds like The Empire Strikes Back).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Phenomenon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars may be 'the' cultural event of an entire generation. It's difficult, near impossible to consider reviewing it without being at least slightly affected by the wider effect its had. It revitalised the Sci-Fi genre, created the first truly great Space Opera and solidified the summer blockbuster as the movie event. But one must depart from its cultural status to evaluate a defining movie.I mentioned above that Star Wars revitalised the Sci-Fi genre. While true, it did this rather coyly. Star Wars is successful because it doesn't jump knee-deep into Sci-Fi. At its heart, Star Wars is a Western in Space, with classical character tropes dating back to Fantasy of the middle ages (farm boy, princess, etc). It's also an homage to Akira Kurosawa's Samurai western "The Hidden Fortress" down to the heavy use of the 'wipe' screen transition and the 'sidekick' characters.Regardless, A New Hope succeeds both in spite of and because of its derivative core. It blasts past that with a successful mix of great characters and impressive world building. The Force is ambiguous between being science and magic (though Phantom Menace arguably retcons this, regrettably), and it is really the glue of the various quirks that make Star Wars so memorable; the Empire, the Jedi order, the futuristic Samurai Sword that is the light-sabre.The characters may be clichés, but full enough of life to excel. The main trio are all solid (Hamill being the weakest, but mainly for being stuck with the weakest writing), but the supporting characters make the film. Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan exudes the wisdom of age and the droids bring levity without undermining the film's tone (certain 'modern' films should take note!) Of course James Earl Jones as the voice of Vader steals the show, with a never-beaten level of blockbuster menace.Indeed, the common theme of Star Wars' success is its excellent use of familiarity. The beats are familiar, but are executed excellently. This is helped by ahead-of-their-time effects, combined with John Williams' greatest score. Without a doubt, the resounding score keeps the audience with the highs and lows throughout, and the fact that it gets better with episode V is all the more impressive.That Star Wars succeeds is not in doubt. Where does it fall down? Certainly, one doesn't get points for being as derivative as Star Wars unashamedly is. But George Lucas makes it his own. Providing his talents: creating wonderful characters for a wonderful setting. But it also provides his weakness: his writing, specifically the dialogue. It's hit and miss- "may the force be with you" works, but other bits fall flat, and can become cringe-worthy. And it treads on the wrong side of the line of exposition a few too many times. For a film with such impressive practical effects, it's a shame that the 'show, don't tell' maxim is not utilised more.Star Wars flits between predictability and innovation, and for the most part it keeps its balance, and as a result it has created a mega-blockbuster franchise and a generation of fans and filmmakers. Its influence is undoubted. Its quality should be as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can somebody say "classic?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, oh man, I LOVE this film. The one thing I will always appreciate is that it's contents shall not scare away an audience due to this being a "sci-fi." Instead, it keeps audiences interested without complicated terminology or very nerdy concepts. The plot is simple - the rebels are in a war with the Empire, and Luke Skywalker wants to make something of his life and help them along with learn the ways of the Jedi. It's quite simple and engaging for all audiences. Luke is a believable character who is not given very cheesy dialogue, and he really helps tell the story by being a somewhat-relatable teen. While the other characters may be "weirdos" and indeed trapped in a sci-fi universe, there's nothing to complain about. There is not much more I can say - this film is truly spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars - Turned a non-believer into a believer of the Force.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always thought the Star Wars as an over-the-top space opera with too many laser shots flying, with colored fluorescent swords (read "Lightsabers") and funny looking aliens involved. But after finishing all the major movie series, a random thought to experience the Star Wars series came in, after being exposed to all the hype and fan craze around the saga over the years.To say - I made a mistake of missing this series all along or was it a good thing for keeping one of the best for now. It is an absolutely impressive movie which sets up an epic series, with good SFX considering a movie made in 1977. The movie is just not about Visual FX, but has a strong story line with equivalent good screenplay and introduces you to characters - Luke, Han, Leia, C-3PO, R2D2, Obi-wan and one of the most legendary antagonists in cinema Darth Vader.For all sci-fi and adventure fans, this is a highly recommended movie series. And Contrary to Chronological order, start watching the series with this one (Ep IV) instead of going chronologically from Ep I.And like I said - this has turned a non-believer into a believer of the Force. Mr. Lucas, Thanks you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What hasn't been said before? Well, nothing from me, that is, until now.I was much too young, or so my parents were to tell me later, to see 1977's Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope.) Granted, I was three at the time of release, but I'm sure I would remember at least some of it.Most of my childhood memories of the Star Wars franchise came from the follow-up, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. So, basically, my earliest memories would be of my love of Yoda, the main "spoiler" of father/son and the big walking dogs at the beginning in the snow.Not those weren't great memories ? they were, but I was envious of all the other boys (and some girls) around my age that experienced the absolute joy the original Star Wars film gave them.This movie had everything for almost everyone: young/old, adventurous/romantic, Sci-Fi/grounded. So, any boy or girl who got a chance to see this must've absolutely loved it when it was released.Unfortunately, since I was not part of that bracket of "younglings," I can only admire it from an older kid/adult point of view.This movie, no matter when you watch it ? meaning now, in 2014, or back when it opened, is an incredible landmark in filmmaking.There are movies that change the course of all film history and this one is absolutely in the top five of that list. Jaws, The Blair Witch Project/Paranormal Activity, Toy Story, The Matrix, Airplane! and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also appear on that list, but Star Wars (Ep. IV) should be on the top or near it. I truly believe this carved a huge section of my generation.I understand this wouldn't have had the biggest of budgets, and in this case, it is a benefit. Case in point: Watch the "new" trilogy, i.e. Episodes I-III and then this "follow-up" and see the difference. There are a thousand things/objects/mostly CGI in I-III in each shot and far, far less here. I did just watch I-IV and let me assure you: the simplicity of A New Hope was not only refreshing, but exhilarating. It was this minimalism, whether intentional or not, that made me cheer this one far and above I-III.The story is an age-old one of good vs. evil, heroism, get-the-girl, underdog and David and Goliath. Despite its "unoriginality," it all fit perfectly and was understandable for both the very young and reminiscing elders. I don't generally forgive movies that have bad dialogue or poor acting, but when it's called for and it is what the movie needs, it's a necessity. Here it is. Of course, they, or more specifically Georgie Lucas, tried to recapture that for the prequels and failed miserably. It was welcomed here with this story and it shouldn't have gone further into the late 90s and into mid-2000s.At any rate, have you not seen this movie? SEE IT. If you're privileged and lucky enough, do NOT see the Special Edition which throws unnecessary and some horrible shots in ? i.e. the unintentionally laugh-out-loud scene with Jabba the Hut. If you can find the original cut, see that. I, and I know I am NOT ALONE, wish that edition would come on BluRay.Until it does, may the force be with you. Always.* * * Final thoughts: Following this (#??) viewing, I just had to revisit my two personal favorite spoofs of this movie: Family Guy's Blue Harvest and the everlasting classic: Hardware Wars. Now, there has been dozens, if not hundreds of spoofs, spin-offs, imitations and homage's to Star Wars (Episode IV,) but those two were absolutely the best ? yeah, even better than that mostly unfunny and tedious Spaceballs.I have been known to quote Hardware Wars 10x more in my life than the actual Star Wars. And I am proud of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The start of the best trilogy and films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film and the original Star Wars has a special place in my heart as it was the first film and trilogy I remember seeing as a child and I must say 10 years later it is still one of the best films of all time. When pushed for my favourite film of all time I am always struggling to pick between the three Star Wars films or the three Lord Of the Rings but I must say when a film can just make you smile no matter what mood your in or no matter how many times you have seen it that film holds a special case in your heart like Star Wars has for me. This film starts in space with the Evil Empire attempting to destroy a bunch of Rebels against their regime, through some events young Luke Skywalker meets a seasoned Jedi Warrior Obi Wan Kenobi and along with some friends embark on a mission to take down the Empire. Now everybody in this film has a great performance but their are two very different performances that may be the greatest performances ever. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is everything a man wants to be he just oozes confidence and takes no garbage from anybody including princess Leia overall he grows with this trilogy and as a character but Han Solo in my opinion is easily one of the best characters of all time. Also when talking about villains in film history in my opinion the most intimidating and villainous force in any movie has to be Darth Vader this entity is just the most evil character ever put on screen and is also the most intriguing villain of all time. Now when this film came out it changed cinema and changed the game for how we see film now, also I did watch Star Wars to review this on the DVD version so there was some tweaks but I just try to use the score, the characters and the settings to pull me back into Star Wars land and forget about these differences. Overall a flawless attempt at sci-fi to open a trilogy that in my opinion while never be bested in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, "Droids" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilised world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Movie Using A Streamlined Version of Dune</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Guerra de las Galaxias (Star Wars): A Review and PerspectiveGeorge Lucas is a genius, no doubt. A master film artist; the best at what he does. He created a film, its universe and its successors that stand up as cinematic wonders.He took me by storm with this tour de force when I was six. I did not realize it was subtitle "A New Hope" until years later.I saw it once in the threatre downtown, and then I saw it again at the drive-in threatre north of town. I was small, and the story made all the sense in the world to me. Breathtaking. Dynamic. Too good to be true. Drama and action, at its best.We did not have a Beta Max or a VCR back then, but we did get HBO a bit during my youth and I recall it debuting on pay cable. And then finally ABC showed it for the first time on network TV. I must have seen it at friends' homes on their video machines, too. Maybe at a party here or there.I was hooked, like so many of my generation. It filled my imagination with possibilities.Maybe because of this film, I distinctly remember saying at the end of 1977 on New Year's Eve,"1977 was a good year". Pretty good, considering that 1976 was a fond tri-centennial year in the United States, and yours truly was a precocious 7 years old with that much perspective as years go.My first two action figures were Han Solo and a Stormtrooper. My best friend two houses down had Luke Skywalker, R2-D2 and Darth Vader. And I seem to remember Obi-Wan Kenobi and C3-PO. And the Landspeeder. Of course, those figures may have been owned by a number of other neighborhood friends. I think anyone my age was drinking the Kool-Aid.By Christmas 1978 or 1979, I got the Darth Vader Tie Fighter as a present. Still have it (2013).By 1981 or 1982, I got all the figures from the first two movies.Significantly, I read "Splinter of the Mind's Eye" by Alan Dean Forster around 1979, which notably added to the understanding and capabilities of Darth Vader. (Check it on Wikipedia).And the myth of this blockbuster series was fundamentally essential in my life and imagination.Later, in 1997, at age 26, long after getting over the fact that the 9 part series would not come to fruition (although some people must have rumored the prequels by then, I guess), a college roommate suggested a book based on my question to him what his favorite book was.Dune. A story and concept I was somewhat familiar with. As an avid comic book collector in the 1980s, I saw copies of it featured in the front of the main store I frequented. Then around 1984 the film came out. It did not have success, which segues back to George Lucas and his genius. I think that Lucas had read and enjoyed Frank Herbert's Dune series and figured out how to adapt the story and streamline it in a more palatable fashion for the masses.Perhaps others have questioned George about this. I would be completely shocked if George Lucas never read Dune prior to making his masterpiece.But for film, George knew how to write and perhaps, more importantly, knew how to put in film what his story was about.Nothing but fantastic.I am not accusing George Lucas of plagiarism. But all works of art and concepts usually derive from other places.And I think it is important to acknowledge that the desert planet of Tatooine, that is now part of our own earth lore, has a great part of its conceptualization in the far off planet of Arrakis, aka Planet Dune.What will 2015 bring? It will all tie together, I am sure. And not just back to 1977.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder what there is to say about Star Wars that hasn't already been said by some fanboy or other. I won't endeavour to say anything profound, just give my own personal opinions. It's a really great film. As soon as the opening text is over, you're straight into the action. Things look strange, because everything in this film tries to be new, but somewhat familiar, because it borrows a few ideas from previous films. I wonder what the sets would look like without a bit of '2001' influence. For a film made 30 years ago, it looks stunning. The two suns image is particularly striking, and there are a lot of other remarkable sets, like the inside of the Millennium Falcon or Cantina. Sure, the explosions look a bit over the top and fake, but hey, it's 1977!The acting is very good, held up by a strong lead performance by Mark Hamill, among others. It doesn't really drag too much at all, and makes you ask lots of questions, usually providing the answers fairly quickly. Harrison Ford is a bit annoying and overly grumpy in this episode and occasionally got on my nerves when arguing with Leia. But it's all saved because James Earl Jones has the perfect voice for Darth Vader, and nobody questions that. I quite like the fact that, despite Vader being the one that everyone remembers, he's not in charge. The captain of the Death Star and Emperor Palpatine are actually the leaders, so you assume that they must be even worse than Vader, who seems to be the most evil person ever.The ending annoyed me slightly. Not because it's far too convenient that there is a very obvious weak spot to the Death Star which the rebel forces can easily take advantage of, but because the final scene goes on for a bit too long. The chase, despite cool graphics, doesn't really change throughout its run, and isn't particularly thrilling. Thankfully, scenes like the 'walls closing in' part are quite fun and keep you on your toes. Even though you can predict some scenes by the Family Guy rule 'We'll be okay, there are too many main characters here', they're still very exciting. One of the film's greatest strengths is that you are constantly rooting for the main characters, and they are easily relatable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great way to start of a trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite Star Wars film because, it contains the monomyth or more commonly known as The Hero's Journey. The others still contain a great story and adventure but I prefer this one. The beginning is great you get thrown right into the action of two droids known as C-3PO and R2D2. They're aboard a rebel star ship trying to outrun the enormous imperial star destroyer. But are soon caught, luckily our two droids jettisoned off the ship because before, the Princess of a peaceful planet known as, Alderaan gave information vital to the rebels victory inside R2D2. She gave him the plans on how to destroy the Death Star, the empires greatest weapon, with the ability to destroy an entire planet. Unfortunately the princess is taken aboard the star destroyer and then the Death Star, the two droids escape landing on a dessert type system. There they get captured by jawas which are little hooded creatures that sell droids. The two droids then get sold to a local farmer, his wife and there nephew, Luke a good hearted, brave teenager (our main protagonist), who lives in the middle of nowhere. That night when Luke is eating dinner, R2D2 escapes, making it Luke's responsibility to find him in the morning. Naturally when Luke wakes up the next morning he takes C-3PO with him to look for R2D2 they find him, when then sand people find Luke and knock him down luckily Old Ben, a very wise old hermit finds them and scares them off. Luke is then happy to see Ben because he found a message in R2D2 of princess Leia, pleading for help from him, stating that he is the rebellions only hope. They then find a jawa transport shot and destroyed because the Empire is alert that R2D2 contains the plans to destroy the Death Star. Luke then realizes that if the Empire found out who sold them, they probably found out who they sold them to. Running home he finds his house burned and destroyed also his aunt and uncles skeletons knowing this there is nothing for Luke anymore on this planet and decides to accept Ben's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and help the rebellion. But they first need a pilot, so they head to a local bar and find Han Solo, a reckless, cunning, sneaky pilot. And his companion and co-pilot Chewbacca a fury, fierce, bear like creature. They then go to the hangar bay where they fly aboard the Millennium Falcon, Han Solos ship. They then set the coordinates for Alderaan and use light speed to get there only to realize that it has been obliterated and a local space station is in the distance, known as the Death Star. They're then stuck in it's tractor beam and pulled on board. They send a scanning crew to check the ship and are easily taken out by Luke and company. When Han Solo impersonates an imperial troop asking for help, two more soldiers come aboard and again are taken out easily and have their uniforms stolen. Luke and Han then put on the uniforms while Ben, Chewie, C-3PO, and R2D2 still look normal, they sneak off the ship and find a room where they can lay low for a little. Here R2D2 scans the ship and finds that the princess is a prisoner here. Ben then goes to turn off the tractor beam because the Millennium Falcon couldn't escape if he didn't. Luke then encourages Han to come with him to save the princess, and Han reluctantly agrees, Chewbacca also accompanies them as their "prisoner" while C-3P0 and R2D2 stay in this room and lock the doors, their only form of communication is a walkie talkie type of object that Luke also has. Luke, Han, and Chewie then make it to the cells, and find the princess while troops arrive and know that they're impostors the princess then takes Lukes gun and shoots a small gate and dives in followed by the rest of them. It turns out to be a garbage masher about to go to work, luckily Luke contacts C-3PO and he tells R2D2 to shut down all the garbage mashers, it works and Luke and company are on the way to the falcon this time, out of disguise. Ben finds his way to the control panel and shuts down the tractor beam. And then he is on his way also to the Falcon, while he is delayed by his old friend, now enemy Darth Vader, once a pupil to Ben and shares a power with him, the force a living matter that surrounds the universe, you can learn from it and also use it to move things with your mind, with the force also comes a weapon, a lightsaber, a metal hilt with a laser as a blade. Using their lightsabers, Ben and Vader face off, right as Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, C-3PO, and R2D2 are making their way to the Falcon. Luke glances over to the fight and Ben looks at him as he sacrifices himself for Luke. With this Luke and company get on the Falcon and go. They land on Yavin Four a foresty moon, home of the rebel base, and Leia reveals the plans to destroy the Death Star to all the rebels(Han and Chewie leave). And soon they board their small one man fighters and take off. The way to destroy the Death Star is to fly along a long trench and shoot a bomb in the main exhaust port. The rebels go but it's not easy, they keep getting picked off one by one when finally there is only one left, a fighter is getting ready to kill Luke when Han shows up and shoots it first, Luke takes the shot and sure enough the Death Star blows up Luke and Han then return to Yavin to be awarded with medals form Leia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A childhood memory worth preserving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By some luck, the first time I ever saw this film was on VHS. It was the original in its mint condition, no extra Lucas digital crap. I remember that experience as if it was only yesterday. I remember falling in love with Star Wars. All the movies, all the games, all the toys, even. That was when I was about 5 and the dreaded Attack Of The Clones would grace the screen with its unholiness a year later.How in god's name do you do it? How do you review a movie that defined you? That you have loved for years? As a matter of fact, I re-watched this film just so I could have an unbiased opinion.The plot is that 2 droids on a ship are forced to leave through an escape pod and wind up on a dessert planet. They meet up with Luke Skywalker. They bring a message with the intent of reaching an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke knows a Ben Kenobi and believes they are somehow related. They make it to him and deliver the message. Obi-Wan then tries to teach Luke in the ways of The Force; a mystical energy that would give a Jedi (which are now extinct) his power. He meets up with Han Solo and Chewbacca and they try to rescue a captured princess from the grip of the evil leader of the empire, Darth Vader.I could write a 300 page book on how influential this movie was and STILL not have everything done however I personally hate it "Oh this film was so influential" so was Plan 9 From Outer Space! I hate it when people say that because it puts me off so I will not say a single thing in that respect.The acting is a mixed bag. James Earl Jones does a great voice as Darth Vader and David Prowse in that black suit of Vader with that combo Lucas made probably the most threatening movie villain to grace the screen. Alec Guiness does a good job as the mentor role and Harrison Ford does a good job as the scoundrel Han Solo. Those 3 are worth watching for alone. Mark Hamil and Carrie Fischer were pretty bad on their own right.There is something about family films of this time; Return To Oz, Labyrinth, Willy Wonka etc. where they were something to be experienced. The "magic" of those films are alive, even today, with this actually being a better example.Overall this is an enjoyable film. I even found it in me to tolerate the re-edits. A must see for all science fiction fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars will be with you always......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah here we are, the big cheese, the top dog, simply one of the greatest films ever made. Looking back its a miracle this film turned out the way it did (especially when you watch those prequels). Every aspect of this film stands on its own. Firstly, theme, who doesn't love the main Star wars theme? Or the Imperial March? Really one of John William's finest pieces and thats saying a lot! Special effects are once again dazzling. The assault on the Death Star remains the greatest sequence I have ever seen and guess what? It's not in 3D! And thers no CGI! Wha!!!???? 99% of people must think thats an impossibility! A simple story, Good vs Evil blah blah blah we know, but the ideas of the Force and Obi won Kenobi really add something more. That famous scene with Luke gazing out at the sky longing for something more really adds an emotional dimension. Some truly legendary moments in this film, I just hope George Lucas doesn't go back and CGI some stupid character(cough Jar Jar Binks) to be running around the background. Actor wise this film is often criticized, but eh Alec Guinness??? Peter Cushing?? A great backing cast. Mark Hammill is critically acclaimed for his voice-over of the Joker and deserves high praise for his performance in this film. Carrie Fisher is feisty, cheeky and strong (although she may not be necessarily acting!) and Harrison Ford, ah what more needs be said about Han? Simply too many positives with this film, a true classic and example of movie-making magic! A must see!</fullReview>

I mean you got some great actors and the special effect it good for it's time but that doesn't mean you will like it. Lets say two people are watching TV and they are looking and see if there is anything on and one of the people says "oh I really like this show" but the other person is like "from what i have seen it's not so good", so you cant always expect every one to like something. But whatever it doesn't really matter what i say anyway. If your a big sci-fi fan like me you will love this movie but if your not it won't be anything special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection in Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to imagine watching 'Star Wars' and not getting lost in its joyfully infectious spirit. It is one of those films that seems to have captured lightning in a bottle. The casting is perfect, the score is beautiful, the visuals stunningly imaginative and the storyline is wonderfully accessible. It is a movie that whisks you away for two hours and when it is over, any viewer must be a bit happier for having had the experience. It is an unabashedly FUN film, and that is sometimes a rare delight.If possible, see the original (1977) version. Admittedly, the technical limitations of its era are evident, but the film is better paced and feels more polished it is original form than its subsequent, digitally enhanced release. The re-issue feels significantly different and to experience 'Star Wars' only through its recent upgrade is to sacrifice its 'perfection of the moment' in favour of 'digital trickery.' Admittedly, some of the 'eye candy' shots in the special edition are clever, but the film itself suffers for the alterations and feels less impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As some people may know, I am not one to give out a good, or a half decent, review about any film, saga or series. Although I am sure I have brought many tears to many eyes as loyal followers who live their lives through my reviews, I am sure you are clinging to the edge of your seat and reading with intent to every word I am now typing. But I must now disappoint you.. I do not have much to say regarding the whole Star Wars Saga. However, not to disappoint you all too much, I shall be taking the Mick whenever I can.The Star Wars Saga has given everyone a dream to become Jedis. Some people have given up on that dream, and settled down to work in an office. Some people still have the dream, and are gay enough to pop into ToysRUs every week to stock up on their Star Wars figurine collection. Seriously, why buy toys if you're not going to take them out of the packaging???? What is the point of it?? Anyway, back to the whole review thing ... And the small number of people who had the dream of becoming Jedi, and slowly figured out that they had something much more powerful and awesome than the Force, became Ninjas. To those people, I salute you!!The best thing about the whole Star Wars Saga, apart from its influence in my becoming a Super-Awesome Ninja, was quite possibly Ewan McGreggor and his Scottish Accent! Damn that accent ... Ooh, and C3PO and R2D2 were quite possibly the glue that held the films together, even though C3PO had an almost definitely a Serial Peadophiles voice. Was it just me or did anyone else catch the whole thing about C3PO 'suddenly' finding himself 'naked' in front of the kid that turned out to be Darth Vader?? Even R2D2 was a stoner!!Long live the Jedi people who turned out to be awesome Ninjas ... everyone else can be shot!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can i say? An American classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long ago in a galaxy far away, there lived an evil empire under the iron-law of a dastardly dictator named Darth Vader (Voiced by James Earl Jones and played by David Prowse). He kidnaps the lovely Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and sends out her loyal androids C-3PO (Voiced by Anthony Daniels) and C-3PO (Kenny Baker) to the planet Tatoonie where farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil) finds them and notices the video message C-3PO accidentally plays as it's meant for Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) who is Leia's only hope for he takes them to him. Obi-Wan with Luke and the droids head to a sleazy bar where they meet cool-as-hell space captain Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and tough furball brute Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew)as they all join forces together to rescue the princess then have a plan to destroy the Death Star.What is there to say about this movie? it's a complete masterpiece of film and changed American cinema forever as it has became one of the biggest crowdpleasers of all time. George Lucas always had this idea for years as he was influenced by Metropolis, 2001, Akira Kurasowa's films mainly Hidden Fortress, Star Trek and Frank Herbert's Dune novels and combined them brilliantly. He originally wanted to sell this idea to Universal or United Artist but they rejected it so Fox got the rights and filming started, it has became one of the most successful films of all time among audiences and critics as it even got an academy award nomination for best picture in 1978. Great performances, memorable dialog, awesome special effects and quality storytelling makes this a cinematic treasure everyone in their life must see. It spawned 2 sequels, 3 prequels, re-issues, spin-offs, merchandise, a fanbase and influenced pop culture as we know it much like Star Trek has.I love how it combines a bit of Sci-fi, a bit of fantasy, a bit of western, a bit of world history redone in Sci-fi, a bit of action/adventure and that kind of thing. This movie is a movie that every kid in their life must watch like i did back in the 80's and introduced me to film in a good way on VHS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars is one of the few immovable pillars of blockbuster cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films that have become household names in the past few decades and have had equal amounts of respect among filmmakers and audience alike, there are few examples as famous and as grand as Star Wars. It came out in 1977, 38 years ago, and this film has stood the test of time stronger than a lot of films that came before. It has everything someone looking for cinematic adventure could possibly desire: action, drama, humour, and the scope of the universe fully realised in one gorgeous masterpiece.Star Wars established so many tropes that so many other films since its release have tried to copy or emulate, and very few of them if any tend to succeed at capturing the magic of its heart. This film is essentially a mixture of classic movies from the German Expressionism Era, emulating the storytelling and editing of Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa, and Westerns, like Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy. Star Wars takes these ingredients and comes out with a result that is wonderfully refreshing for us to behold: we are introduced to this new universe that is completely detached from our reality, yet we are right at home within it; a relatable experience that is completely in a fantasy world teaming with characters who are like good friends of ours, an out-of-body spectacle.I can't write everything I want to say about this film in adequate words, but it really is something that is out of this world, and despite ageing somewhat, it hasn't grown old with the times, not really. Even a prequel trilogy later and an upcoming sequel on the way, the original film Star Wars is the very thing to thank for all that and it has been a generational key to escapism for millions of filmgoers, and the reason for my genuine love in movies.If you're reading this review and somehow don't know anything about the movie, go watch it now, specifically the original 1977 theatrical edition when you can, and you will have done yourself a massive favour and discovered something, wordlessly wonderful.</fullReview>

The beginning of one of the most successful trilogy of all time. Wow, the battle between rebellion again the dark side of the evil emperor. And I saw the spaceship chased another, and hit them with laser. What a feeling! My heart just wanted to jump out. I fell so exciting. How did George Lucas do it? How could he imaged such a picture? Here we have a princess Leia, a wise old man Obiwan, whom teaches Luke about The Force, Han Solo with his big Wookie named Chewbaca, C3PO with his best friend R2D2. And I didn't forget a bad guy, wore a black clothes and mask, along with his strange voice. His named Darth Vader. Seen it again, and again, I always fell the same thing. I couldn't imaged my childhood without Star Wars. Thanks George!</fullReview>

Even video-games as "Halo" seems to be somewhat influenced by this movie."Star Wars" was the beginning of a new time, not only for science fiction, but also for cinema in general.

Everyone can feel I can do it what Luke did in our mind. The force thing first time is too difficult to understand but today it is so easy to understand.

		<fullReview>You know what the dirty little secret about Star Wars is? It's a really frickin' great movie.I'm not entirely sure why that gets glossed over or ignored or disputed, but it does. Maybe it's because the prequels left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. Maybe it's because people feel something as commercially successful as Star Wars can't also have creative merit. Or maybe some people just resent the way the film fundamentally changed the movie industry. But I do think there are many people today who don't appreciate just how good this move is.For those of you just arriving Alpha Centauri, Star Wars is the story of young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a farm boy on a desert planet in a galaxy far, far away. Luke yearns to escape his small and simple life and run away to the stars. He gets his chance when two droids, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), come into his life carrying the secret plans for a new superweapon constructed by the vile Empire. That's brings Luke to old Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), a hermit who used to be a mighty Jedi Knight and is being called back to battle by the lovely Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) to help the Rebel Alliance defeat the Empire. Luke and Ben hook up with smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his co-pliot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and they end up trying to rescue Princess Leia from the clutches of Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and Darth Vader (David Prowse and James Earl Jones), the evil Jedi who killed Luke's father, and racing against time to destroy the Empire's Death star before it can annihilate the Rebels.There are so many good things to Star Wars, but let's start with the well written characters and the good acting that brings them to life. Don't laugh. Luke is a whiny adolescent when the story begins who really isn't much of a hero. Even when Ben Kenobi offers him a chance to come with him on a great adventure, Luke declines because he doesn't want to be bothered with other peoples' problems. But as he grows into a hero willing to risk his life for what is right, Luke never stops being a kid. Alec Guinness does a fine job as Luke's mentor, giving a sense of serenity and grace to a role where he has to impressive enough to be believable as the man who changes Luke's life without overpowering Hamill's performance. Of course it is rather weird to rewatch Star Wars and recognize that the Obi-Wan Kenobi of this film doesn't really fit with the way the character was portrayed in the rest of the series.Carrie Fisher also has a tougher job than you might think. She had to make Leia tough and strong and commanding with a condescending sarcasm befitting a young woman who grew up fast in the world of galactic politics, while still being a beautiful princess for the audience to fall in love with. And Han Solo is actually more than just a rough around the edges rogue. Harrison Ford gives him a puffed up self-importance but let's us see that he's trying to impress himself as much as he is other people. He also has to be both not quite as smart as Luke but still show he's a bit wiser as to the ways of the universe.The movie is also better written than people realize. Luke starts out as a kid and doesn't magically morph into some super skilled warrior. For most of the story, the fighting is handled by the older, more experienced characters and Luke's contribution is coming up with some great ideas. It's really only at the end after going through all his experiences that Luke is ready to be a warrior himself. When Luke and company escape the Death Star, the script has enough confidence to not try and dumb things down. It realizes that it's far more believable for the Empire to let them escape, rather than pretend that 3 people, a wookie and a couple of droids could really shoot their way out of a moon-sized space station staffed by possibly millions of soldiers. But it doesn't just let the audience understand that, it let's the characters be smart enough to understand that.And of course, the writing of Star Wars can't be discussed with the subject of Greedo shooting first being addressed. In the original, Greedo is a hired thug who corners Han in the cantina and is about to kill him when Han blows him away with a hidden blaster under the table. In the special editions, George Lucas made Greedo shoot first and Han kill him in self-defense. A lot of fanboys have bitched about that and here's why it's important. While shooting him first from under the table is still arguably self-defense, it's a cold blooded and ruthless act. It's something that good guys, especially in 1977, don't do. With that act, the audience understands that Han isn't like Luke or Ben, that he'll do things that are unheroic. That tension in the character is what underlies his actions and his relationships with other characters throughout the film. It's the reason why you can believe he really is leaving just before the final battle, because you've already seen him do something like that. When Lucas made Greedo shoot first, he eliminates that moral dimension to Han Solo and he just becomes another hero in the story.Star Wars is the Babe Ruth of comics. Jaws may have been the first summer blockbuster, but this is the film that changed the way the game is played. The way movies are made, what movies are made and how they're marketed changed with this film. But its historical significance shouldn't blind people to its artistic greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Among Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would be extremely hard pressed to find a film that has affected pop culture in anywhere close to the way Star Wars has since it made its way into theaters on May 25, 1977. From the way films are made and special effects are done, to the way it changed marketing and merchandising forever, Star Wars has become the defining example of pure blockbuster fantasy. It is a pleasure to watch as much for its ability to take us to new worlds and tap into our imaginations as it is a revolution in creative and inspired storytelling. The charm, the fun, the grandeur, it all clicks on levels rarely seen and stands the test of time as one of the best moments in the history of cinema. It has many iconic characters, including one of the greatest movie villains ever in Darth Vader, as well as perhaps the only character Harrison Ford could ever play that could compare to Indiana Jones in Han Solo. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, and R2- D2, Chewbacca, the list goes on, and these characters stand as some of the best examples of how to take standard character types and make them instantly memorable and engaging.The tone of this film is outstanding, injecting enough humor and light hearted fun when necessary, but also having an emotional core that resonates to its timeless themes. It has plenty of action, including one of the most dynamic climax battles in movie history. It would be hard to find someone that can't appreciate that final assault on the Death Star (in itself an iconic creation), from the shots and effects to the surprisingly deep emotional core. And without Star Wars, we wouldn't have perhaps the coolest weapon of all time, the lightsaber.The special effects might have taken over to horrifying extremes in the newer prequel films, but when it comes to the original, it's still impressive how immersive this universe is and how well the effects help tell the story. And while the story is in no means original, the way it's told is simply inspiring.Adding to the proceedings is the first of what would be some of the best musical scores of all time couryesy of John Williams. Every character has a memorable motif, every scene injected with cues that perfectly accompany the visuals. In fact, one could listen to just the soundtrack and follow the film perfectly, that is how good this score is.One of the amazing things about Star Wars is how well it comes off considering how hard it was to make, and how having to create a movie with so many production issues spawned a series so good. Perhaps nothing has tapped into our collective imagination so effectively since Star Wars. It is easily one of the most important and influential films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is the kind of movie that seems to never get old, it stands the test of time, the only fault I kind find with the movie is being followed by Empire Strikes Back, one of the greatest sequels ever. All the characters are well drawn out and you become attached to them.With Luke, you see a young innocent boy who wants to leave his boring life and find adventure. With Lea, you see a beautiful princess who can also kick ass. With Han, you see a sarcastic smuggler who is such unlikable man, yet you like him anyway. Darth Vader, you see a cruel, dark man who has no mercy. There are plenty of other characters, but whats the point of explaining. The effects to this day are still amazing, but they don't overshadow characters. Star Wars is a classic, if you haven't seen it yet, what's wrong with you, go see it, though it isn't the best Star Wars movie, it comes very close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Do You Review a Film Like Star Wars?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you review George Lucas's "Star Wars" (1977)? A movie that has become so cherished by millions of fans that most critics disregard it, a movie that has inspired people to create a religion based on the force and a movie that has become so famous that it is regarded as weird not to have seen at least one out of the six films? How do you review it? One of the few ways to actually read balanced reviews of it is to look at what the critics said when it was originally released, thirty-two years ago. At the time, unlike now, where most "serious" movie critics treat it with contempt, they liked it. Roger Ebert called the film "an out-of-body experience," and Vincent Canby called the film "the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure." These reviews show us, that at the time, just about everybody (Pauline Kael, Jonathan Rosenbaum and Stanley Kauffmann excepted) agreed that "Star Wars" was a great film. These are the critics (unbiased) opinions before the days of "Star Wars" bashing became fashionable among the critical elite. And take it from me. Roger Ebert was right: It's an unbelievable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May the Force be with You! :-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so it's a hot San Juoquin Valley summer afternoon in Sacramento, and I'm there with the parent outside one of the old brown dome Century theatres on opening day for this thing. In addition to the blistering Sacramento summer sun there's a slight hot breeze, but I'm in the shade with the family, so it's not a big deal. I'm just happy to be waiting for that space movie I heard about on TV. I'm just hoping it won't be scary.The doors open, and we go inside, and are given a booklet of some-kind describing the characters, places and back-story. Neat :-) I flip through it, see some color pages, see some black and white pages, and don't really understand a thing of what I'm looking at or reading. Rebels? Imperials? Huh? Who, what, where, when? And... why?Oh well. The lights dim and the movie starts. I'm just hoping I don't see the wires on the "special effect" models. The lights dim, that blue font opening line appears, then the scrolling text. Hey, this is just like that Flash Gordon thing I saw on TV ... well ... almost. The story stuff vanishes up into space, and the camera pans down.Thank god, I think, this doesn't look too fake. Hopefully it'll be a little better than Star Trek on TV where the effects go. Then the two ships race by overhead. And you can pick up the collective psychic connection of every sci-fi type sighing in relief and saying to themselves "Thank God! Somebody finally got it right!"Yeah, it was a WOW moment. Star Wars re-heralded old fashioned film making. In a day and age of the 70s when edgy art films were all the rage, and old overweight police detectives dominated the TV air waves. Oh sure, "King Kong" came out the year before, but sci-fi was more of a 1950's genre, because at that time that's when most of those films had been made.Star Wars was a much needed relief from a lot of over wrought films that were promoting some kind of new social stigma. Where were the heroics? Where were the cavaliers? Where was the derring-do that we used to see? Well, it was back in a piece of high-adventure space-opera. :-)Star Wars is a film about human endeavor, and the value of heart and soul. It's not a codified social statement as much of science fiction tends to be, but a true fairy tale to take the viewer and audience to a time and place where there are clear boundaries between right and wrong. In the day and age of the Cold War with proxy wars happening around the globe, and with the memory of Vietnam still fresh in everyone's memory (and Afghanistan coming into the forefront), Star Wars was a unifying reminder of the consequences of delegating freedom to a kind of social automation of the spirit; i.e. allowing extreme organization and ceremony to act as a mechanism for social order, the consequences of that, and how a single soul can combat such stalwart foes.Personally, I love the film for what it is. As a kid I bought the Marvel comics' adaptations, bought the sketch and art books because I loved the artistry of the film as a whole, but I never bought any of the action figures. I bought the magnificent soundtrack, but not the toys. I also never had a favorite character. Nor did I ever really get into the story too much, though I liked the story. Add to that, I understood people liking the film, because it was very entertaining, but I couldn't understand the extreme fandom that accompanies it to this very day.But hey, that's just me :-) Truth is I do understand some of the fandom, but I'm not really a Star Wars fan as such. Love the films. I worked for a couple of the SFX guys when I was in my 20s, and was even offered a job up at ILM after working my tail off to impress those guys, but I liked the spectacle of the films more than the message, because the message was pretty basic. And I guess that's the real charm of Star Wars for tons of people the world over.It's a basic positive message with some fantastic artistry. Personally, I also happen to think it's the film director's personal story; i.e. a young man striking out on his own and facing adversity, and that resonates with people everywhere. It might explain the age demographic demarcation between young and old SW fans in terms of liking the newer films and the "classic" SW films. But perhaps that's another post for another time.In the meantime, May the Force Be With You. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R2D2 is "The Little Prince"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Geoege Lucas must have watched "The Little Prince" film, which pre dates Star Wars. There is a sequence in The Little Prince where the Prince wanders off into the desert, whilst the Pilot is remonstrating with him, aka R2D2 and C3PO on Tatooine. There is then a sequence where they pass through a canyon, which looks exactly like the spot where R2D2 was captured by the Jawa; they then walk past the skeleton of a large creature, and the editing, in which the images change by a sweep from side to side, is exactly the same as the editing in this part of Staw Wars. I hereby copyright this discovery!I have to write another couple of lines of text, apparently, before this post can be posted, and so here I am writing a few more lines of text.

		<shortDescription>one of the sagas of all time, but still room for improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the reason I put seven is because I averaged the whole saga PM=1 AOTC=4 ROTS=9 ANH=10 ESB=10 ROTJ=8. When I first saw star wars I was amazed. The special effects, Plot, Characters, and overall movie were just amazing. Don't get me wrong there is room for improvement a lot of room in the first two prequels. Here is what I think of the movies.The Phantom Menace= where do I begin, here is one word to summarize it BORING. The characters have no emotions, the acting is terrible, and there is no story to tell. Jar Jar is Horrible, and so is all of the other characters. Lucas is a great story teller but this film should have never been made.Attack of the Clones= A little below average, there are a lot of points in the movie that will make you sleepy it gets better in the end though in the lightsaber fights and battles. Lucas is starting to get a little better.Revenge of the Sith= Lucas has finally reached the level of greatness the first trilogy had. Buy this film you won't regret it.A New Hope= Amazing nothing needs improvement The Empire Stirkes Back= If I could give this film an 11 I definitely would. People will get mad at me for saying this but this film is better than the Godfather parts 1 and 2, The Dark Knight, And Shawshank redemption all put together.Retern of the Jedi= This would have been a perfect film like the other ones but I took points off for Being on endor 3/4ths of the time. I also took points off for the ewoks I mean in an epic saga no one wants to see little stupid furry creatures running around.Overall this is an amazing adventure. For people who call the films nerdy you don't know what you are missing out on. George Lucas don't remake the original trilogy it will be the biggest mistake in the history of mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If the Big Boys won't let You play, just take Your Ball and Start Your Own Game! George Lucas did and Look What Happened!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Hollywood Legend goes, young Producer-Director George Lucas had sought to obtain the Screen Rights from the Hearst Corporation's King Features Syndicate to do a new Film version of their FLASH GORDON Comic Strip. The Classic Space Adventure Strip had been created by Comic Art Master, Alex Raymond (1909-56) and debuted January 7, 1934.The Comic Strip was a magnificent combination of Science Fiction and Sword, Sandal and Sorcery. In spite of having misgivings about Universal Pictures turning FLASH into a Movie Serial in 1936, Buster Crabbe, the Olympic Swimming Champion, found himself loaned out from his own Studio, Paramount Pictures Corporation, and cast in the lead. It was an overwhelming success and FLASH GORDON (Universal Pictures, 1936) merited 2 subsequent sequels: FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (Universal, 1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE (Universal, 1940); both Sequels had Mr. Crabbe in the Starring/Title Roles.BUT, back to the 1970's where we find our little chum, George Lucas age 30ish, waiting patiently for an answer from King Features; hopefully a Positive answer, but any would do, just to get an answer one way or another. Finally an answer did come. "No" was its short and sweet message.KNOWING that rejection is a large part of this, this Show Biz and one could not hope for success by sitting around, pouting, lolly-gagging and otherwise wasting precious time; Mr. Lucas took his Ball Home (it was after all, his BALL) and found himself another game.SO before long, an entire new Universe of New Characters and History emerged as we learned all bout Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Won Kenobi, Darth Vader, Chewbacca and the struggles between the Old Republic and the Totalitarian Oriented Empire Lucas' own "Flash Gordon" was born, fully fledged and in the middle of on of those famed Stellar Conflicts.STAR WARS (Lucas Films, Ltd./20th Century-Fox, 1977) was of course the answer and final by-product. And although there is obviously influence from previously mounted Space Operas, this Film and the ultimate 5 prequels/sequels really stood up as an original saga, unique unto itself with no other saga.To begin with, the entire concept and story belonged to George Lucas. It was a true Lucas Film in every sense. He built favourite baby using the finest of ingredients available. The cast, for example is a sterling example of what we're speaking of.We have Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill) as the mystified young orphaned kid, raised by Aunt Beru (Shalagh Fraser) and Uncle Owen (Phil Brown). Their whole lives are radically altered when they receive a message via the Robot R2D2 (Kenny Baker) from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).THROWN into the thrall are Ben (Obi Won) Kenobi (Alec Guiness, a Stout, virtuoso Actor) Robot C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), a Free Lancing Space Soldier of Fortune &amp; Sort of Swashbuckler, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Alien 'Wooki' sidekick, Chewbacca (Peter Mahew).PROVIDING the disloyal and murderous opposition we have Darth Vader (Davis Prowse = physical part, James Earl Jones = vocals), the former Jedi Knight turned Evil and the Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) who represent every smile to your face-back-stabbing wuss of a Boss that we've all met at on tine or another. At their beck and call are minions of the Empire's Storm Troopers, Bomber and Fighter Pilots and all who work on the infamous Death Star, the super combination space vessel and self contained planetoid of destruction; almost being to the average space ship as a Carrier is to a Destroyer or P.T. Boat.WITH the counter balance between the white clad Obi Won Kenobi and the all Dark Armor and Black Cape, Lucas has given us a clear contrast.. With the many references to "the Force" and "May the Force be with you!", Mr. Lucas is clearly placing morality squarely in the middle of this otherwise seemingly "bubble gum" Space Opera.IN Ben Kenobi (Obi Won), we are clearly presented with Good. In Darth Vader the opposite is represented, Evil.WITH the term "The Force" Mr. Lucas is doing just one thing. He is giving standing and recognition to someone who probably is known to all; yet perhaps most of us probably don't give him his due. George Lucas obviously recognized this and decided to do something about it; even though in doing so definitely would fly in the face of that Politically Correct Crowd.IN the prominent placement of "The Force" as a central theme and motivator of this and all the other entries, he in a sense reintroduced us all to GOD.Thank you, George and May the Force be with You!

		<shortDescription>This will be a film long remembered?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Star Wars" is not only in the upper echelon of Science Fiction films, but of all films. This original installment of the "Star Wars" films and the rest of the original trilogy created a magic unmatched by the prequel trilogy. It is well known that "Star Wars" has had a profound impact on moviegoers and has spawned an unprecedented amount of merchandise in the form of books, toys, computer games, etc."Star Wars" has sets and special effects that are seamless and compare well to other Science Fiction movies and television shows of the time as well as the prequel trilogy. In fact, I found the models in this film were more seamless than the CGI effects used for the prequels. The special effects were used well to create fantastic space battles, aided by John Williams' unforgettable score. Many people know the premise behind the film: a young farm boy becomes untangled in a galactic civil war between a desperate rebellion and an oppressive empire. With this premise, the film's story develops engagingly from start to finish.Every character in the film is appropriately cast. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford give great performances in the lead roles. Alec Guinness brings his experience to bear in his performance which makes "the Force", which might otherwise seem silly, a legitimate concept. James Earl Jones was the perfect choice to provide the booming voice of Darth Vader to aid David Prowse's physical performance. Peter Cushing creates a memorable character in the arrogant Grand Moff Tarkin with aristocratic airs. In short, every performance in this film is memorable and the dialogue is high quality and quotable.Several editions of "Star Wars" have been released since the film's initial release in 1977. A "Special Edition" was released in 1997 with added and altered scenes and a special DVD edition in 2004 with more changed. Personally I found that the added and altered scenes never improved on the original film and some of them were even detrimental (see at: Greedo shoots first). For me, the best version remains the original, available now on limited edition DVDs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the theater, and I've never experienced anything like it, before or since. I went into the movie not knowing anything about it, and it just blew me away. I was drawn into it immediately, and was in awe throughout. The movie has all the elements you could want in a movie. It has an intriguing story, action, humor, romance, cool special effects (pre-CG, but way ahead of their time in 1977), a tremendous musical score and has moral lessons about greed, temptation, sacrifice and loyalty. Good and Evil are clearly defined and the fight of Good vs. Evil is the central theme. George Lucas and his extremely talented crew got everything everything right in this movie. The movie benefited from two previous Lucas projects. THX-1138 and American Graffiti. STAR WARS blended Lucas' interest in technology with warm, human, defined characters. If you haven't seen the movie, I would recommend watching the original version, not the Special Edition re-release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The far, far away galaxy has delivered its frame-by-frame perfection to us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first sounds we hear are the laser blasts between a Rebel Blockade Runner and an Imperial Star Destroyer, and for the next two hours, we're in that far far away galaxy, witnessing the wars between good and evil. One of the greatest directors of our time said that if you have a villain that your audience is truly afraid of, you've got a brilliant film. George Lucas must have been thinking about that when we see Darth Vader, six-feet-tall and with raspy mechanical breathing, breaking the neck of a Rebel. The audience had no idea what to think. Man or machine? It didn't matter, did it? It did. That was what made Darth so great: the audience didn't know. He was heartless like a machine, but at the same time, he barked orders like Hitler.1977 was a landmark year in movie history due to this film, and there has never been a movie that I could compare to this, not even the sequels. The Empire Strikes Back was darker (but equally good, maybe even better) and the rest were nowhere near as good. Mark Hamill is perfect as Luke, and Harrison Ford, Alec Guiness and Carrie Fisher make for great supporting roles (aw, and let's not forget James Earl Jones's Darth Vader voice.Star Wars became the highest grossing motion picture in its time, and received 6 Oscars (but it should have been 8; Woody Allen's a thief).I know every form of life in the universe has seen this, but I'll say it anyway: IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE, YOU ARE NOT TRULY ALIVE. SEE IT ASAP!!!!!!!Age is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It changed the way film was made. A phenomenon, a forever and forever impact on our lives and culture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say, really so many words and adjectives can be used to describe "Star Wars" that it's hard to find them all. Without a doubt this 1977 masterpiece from George Lucas which he done it by his own independent and rebel way clearly is one of the greatest films ever made. So many themes and elements are present mainly a tale of good against evil it comes down to light vs. dark. Plenty of mythology is present as Lucas shows by the different cultures of the film and that one must believe in higher powers to accomplish things. "Star Wars" has it's own civil war battle with the big focus on the rebels and the empire's fight over the galaxy with the Empire's greatest weapon being the mighty Death Star which is ruled by an iron fist with the cruel and powerful Darth Vader. Yet even though Jedi Knights are supposedly long gone, enter Luke Skywalker who's the film wild card who just as a simple farm boy wants and has bigger plans to be a Jedi and defeat the evil empire. Help is provided along the way for Skywalker by the beautiful Princess Leia, and droids C-3PO, and R2-D2(who sends the secret messages and signals) and most importantly the trust and experience of loyalty from Obi- Wan Kenobi. As the furry Chewbacca and cocky pilot Han Solo provide the transportation during this galaxy adventure. I must say also that the special effects and model crafted spaceships used in the film are superb many had never saw anything like it. Great job from George Lucas his direction of the scenes and sets is fabulous. Really what more can I say this movie is so special to me since it was one of the first I saw and being a little kid in the 70's it has a special place in my heart. Seeing this for the first time it was like my real cowboy movie, making me role play in my head and among friends the character of Luke Skywalker thinking he was real I wanted to be him! This epic saga also was the film that started to make me collect action figures, and truly believe in myself and see that the world was about good versus evil. "Star Wars" created a lasting impact on our times and culture a great tale of morality, faith, good versus evil, and it had all the genres of fantasy, adventure, escape, sci-fiction, and drama mixed together. Really one of my favorite movies of all-time, and always remember what it taught us all "May the force be with you".</fullReview>

In all films I've seen in the cinema, none have come close. The follow ups were were brilliant, but this one had it all. Lucas made some job of casting for this film too. Where the other Star Wars films were brilliant, particularly Empire, this is the only one that had it all. The start on Tatooine was so perfectly orchestrated. Alec Guinness was awesome as Obi Wan Kenobi. Harrison Ford was incredible in an early role for him, as the space pirate who doesn't really seem to care about anybody but himself! Mark Hamill was fantastic as the kid from the moisture farm with dreams of far away. The escape from Mos Eisley and then the rescue of Princess Leia from the Death Star, including all the mishaps that befell our heroes during this daring rescue were incredible. The final unmatched dogfight above the Death Star was incredible. The conclusion of this was a real crowd pleaser and had people gagging for more Star Wars. With John Williams unbelievable soundtrack too, this stands as one of the greatest films of all time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it first when I was 11 and have seen it about a million times in the space of 7 seven yrs, I have even have their DVD's.When I saw it as a kid I really connected to it, and somehow I related to the character of Luke Skywalker ( I know everybody does), that's the real magic of this movie, it takes you in this fantasy world and makes you believe its real and that it could really exist. It gives you happiness a feeling of hope and makes you feel good from the inside.Even when I have become 18, whenever I am down and have that sinking feeling in my stomach I watch this movie to get my spirits up. It has so many memorable characters and the sets, with all those minute details are just so amazing. The movie has all the emotions in it friendship, loyalty, love, hate.Now a word about the actors/characters, Mark Hamill owns the part of Luke Skywalker he has that quality in him that you feel what he feels, the scene where he's standing and looking at the two suns setting is just touching. Harrison Ford was the best man that Spielberg could have chosen to play the part of the all so cocky Han Solo. His presence just lights up the screen and his chemistry with Carrie Fischer/Princess Leia is just a treat to watch. C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca add just the right amount of comic fun that is needed for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie captivated me when it first came out, and I still get drawn into its drama, adventure and science fiction. It is the perfect combination of all three without diluting the quality. It is not over played or over directed, nor does it take itself too seriously. No one character dominated the screen and the special effects are still considered to be phenomenal and realistic. Star Wars was the beginning of the respectable science fiction movies. Before its release the genre struggled against the history of B-movies that varied greatly in quality and imagination from the beginning of the movie industry. It benefited, instead of suffered, from the release of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The three movies became what most directors can only dream of, a true continuation and conclusion of the original story, unhindered by fluff and the desire to just shove something into production. Mark, Harrison, Carrie, Alec and James all executed their roles with the most professionalism and supreme acting as can be recorded on film. It is easily the greatest movie ever made.</fullReview>

And one thing two charectars never die in the movies artoo-d2 and c-3po, artoo helps the jedi a lot in space but c-3po just stands around and shouting "oh dear, oh my!" Thats all he did through the whole movie. But all in all the new hope is a good movie of star wars (because it was the first one made!)I wish they could of made more star wars movies like 7,8,etc, but who know maybe one day they will.

		<shortDescription>The most complete movie ever??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, you set out to write a story to make into a movie. How do you decide whether to write a Pirate romp, a Sci-Fi story, a Magical Fantasy with Wizards and Giants, a Heroic adventure, a War epic, a Love tale with a Princess, or even "just" an Action movie? If you are George Lucas, you don't. You put them all into one.You start with a couple of robots and tell the whole story from the perspective of a couple of lost servants towed along through the maelstrom that follows. You throw in a beautiful Princess in a flowing white gown, then contrast her with probably the greatest evil entrance in film history, a 7foot terror dressed all in black and hidden by a mask.You twist off to start the Heroic arc of the teenager taking orders from his over-protective step-parents. He recruits a Wizard, replete with Shakespearean gravitas and a cloak to match, to guide his endeavours. They then head off in search of a pirate with a laser gun and an 8foot teddy-bear sidekick, to help rescue the Princess.An enemy ship so enormous they mistake it for a planet, disguising themselves as enemy soldiers, escaping from a closing garbage compressor (and it's monocular octopus), sword fighting with glowing blades against the mystical giant, swinging across open chasms with the princess, an aerial battle over the enemy ship and even a ghostly return of the wizard.What more could you cram into two hours of the greatest escapism ever captured on film? (Well, maybe a Jim Henson midget green alien with even more mystical powers and some funny grammar, but for that you only have to watch the next episode).</fullReview>

George Lucas really created a world of this own, combined with then revolutionary visual effects, and story telling that would be it's main core to this beloved saga. Now that it's turning 30 years old, It really deserves to be seen once again in the big screen.Sir Alec Guiness carries the wisdom as Obi-Wan Kenobi into his fellow actors giving depth to what the Force is about, the Clone Wars and The history of Luke's father. I also enjoyed Darth Vader's presence in the film, he really is one of the most feared villains in motion picture history especially in Episode V.For all the newbies of the Star Wars saga, I suggest you see this film too especially who has yet a hangover on Episode III. You will never regret it I promise you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"May The Force Be With You" - And Also With You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally, this was my favorite film. It has since been overtaken, but it remains at the number two spot. Originally, this had the greatest special effects money could buy. Of course, we now see what it has spawned and we wonder if it was such a good thing. Originally, this was just a story of good and evil, of youth learning, and of science fiction's maturity. Now, we see that the story of a boy following in the footsteps of his father had five other films to go with it.I stress the word "originally" because of the fact that this film has been tweaked countless times in the past thirty years and it doesn't seem like the original film exists. It's really the only one that should because that's the version that became the phenomenon. That's the version that won all of those Oscars and that's the version that I, like so many others, first saw.Why is it so important for this film to be seen the way it was first shown, you ask? Just look at what it has done to society and what this small film has accomplished in its short life. You won't have to look far to see that Star Wars has influenced almost, if not everything, to come after it. The "Citizen Kane" of the 1970s was one of the original blockbusters and the first science fiction film in over twenty years to be taken seriously.You know what it has become, so what was it originally? Star Wars was the story of a boy who longs for adventure. He wants a life away from the farm. He yearns to discover new worlds, new cultures, and experience what it's like to grow up. At its heart, this the all-American story of chance and opportunity. On the outside, however, it doesn't look so simple. We see battles being fought, royalty being rescued, wizards performing their magic, and good triumphing over evil.Yes, Star Wars has it all. Science Fiction may be its classification, but don't judge too soon. For those wondering whether to go ahead and finally watch the film for the first time, I urge you to follow through. You're journey will truly be one to remember as you see what everyone else has been talking about. I do impress upon you the fact that seeing the original is of the utmost importance. If you've seen and used the technology today, it may seem like you're playing Atari, but when you look back after thinking about what it had to offer and the feelings it gave you, you'll realize how awesome this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A favorite for sure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like most, have seen this film hundreds of times and never tire from it. The risk George Lucas took to complete his vision and the chance with using an full blown orchestra in such a film obviously paid off gazillion fold. I can sit and watch the original three with as much enthusiasm now as I did in the 70's and 80's. As a matter of fact, this was the only film that after seeing for the first time, I left the theater only to get back in line for the next available showing. Thanks George...However, I must say that the prequels, although fit the story line and answer several questions that lingered did not have the same "grab". The characters were too deep and seemed to lack personalities for the audience to relate to. I liked them, but there's nothing like the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true sensation of cinema. Star Wars: A New Hope, is a film that sets the standard for all science fiction films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly spectacular film, Star Wars: A New Hope, is unique in many details. The best of the Star Wars films, this lays the foundation for the success of the next five films. The special effects were literally beyond this universe. Intriguing plot, genuine suspense. Inspired in every detail by a wonderful cast in Alec Guiness, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford &amp; Mark Hamill. Interesting races of Aline's, Chewbacca the Wookie, the Tusken Raiders, the Jawas, and of course in the special edition the greedy Jabba the Hutt. Perhaps the most interesting of all characters was the supreme villain, Darth Vader. A imposing villain who inspired many villains to follow his style.This is a movie that needs to be seen over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars changed my life when I was 13 and saw it for the first time in 1977. I actually didn't want to go see it, but my best friend did. I can still remember stepping out to the theatre, and feeling like I had actually been to another world. No other movie has made me feel like this since. I loved bring my son to the re-release in 1997, and being able to share it with him. Even though he was only just over two, that kid was glued to the screen for the whole time...and wanted to go see Empire and Return of the Jedi. I look forward to the 3D versions that are rumored to be coming out next year in 2007 for the 30th anniversary ( I can't believe it has been almost 30 years). I also look forward to sharing this movie with my grandchildren one day. This is one movie that will be around to the end of time...a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 3. I loved it because I didn't know what to think. It is a great movie. It totally deserved to win best picture over Annie hall and best director! I have seen this Star Wars at least 100 times. Now, to some of you, that is not a very big number. I am a big star wars fan. I absolutely love John Williams' score. It has the best music ever. This is way better than the 11th best movie of all time. It is totally the best movie over The Godfather. George Lucas is a genius. He is the best director of all time. But I don't get why everybody at IMDb likes Empire Strikes Back better. I think that it is the worst. It is totally worthy of all Oscars. A New Hope that is. So, if you don't like my comment, suck it. I am only 13. But, I hope you like this movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,"It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy..."Star Wars, originally billed as standard B-Sci-Fi, has long been considered one of the greatest science-fiction films of all time. With timeless characters, famed lines, breath-taking action and awesome special effects (Especially at the time this movie was made) Star Wars is truly one of the greatest films ever made.Picking up from where the first paragraph left off, Leia sends two droids, C-3P0 and R2-D2, to Tatooine to contact Obi-Wan Kenobi. They're sold by Jawas to the Skywalker family and their adventurous nephew, Luke. Luke discovers Leia's message and takes the droids to Obi-Wan Kenobi. In the mean time, while Leia is being tortured on board the Death Star, Darth Vader has sent troops to Tatooine to capture the droids. Recruiting the help of a down-on-his-luck smuggler named Han Solo and his first mate, the Wookie Chewbacca, Luke and Obi-Wan escape with the droids while Alderaan is destroyed before Leia's eyes. Captured by the Empire, Luke, Han, Chewie, and Obi-Wan retreat into the depths of the Death Star. Obi-Wan goes to face his pupil Darth Vader while Luke and Han go to rescue Leia.Star Wars is unforgettable. It's just plain and simply unforgettable. Mark Hamill plays the semi-naive Luke Skywalker while Harrison Ford is great as the gruff yet charming Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is beautiful as Princess Leia Organa and James Earl Jones lends his amazing voice to everybody's favorite villain: Darth Vader! Also cool in George Lucas's masterpiece is the breathtaking Lightsaber duels and the truly unforgettable score by John Williams, one of the greatest composers ever.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first, the best, the blast-your-head-off-with-a-laser greatness! Star Wars begins with a BOOM! of quality that will take you to a Galaxy Far Far Away... Only the Death Star, Only Darth Vader, Only Tatooine, Only George Lucas could have brought such a miracle to the big screen. Inspiring, 'Star Wars' combines the elements of both modern life, and the Space Age into one motion picture universe! Such detail on space creatures, ships and characters is amazing for the 20th Century. The Tusken Raiders added that little bit extra, I think. Tatooine is so like normal habitats in deserts, yet so different. Although, I thought the Imperial Stormtroopers a bit of a disappointment. The main infantry of the evil Galactic Empire, outsmarted by a talking tin-man (C-3PO-On the Death Star). And more could have been said for the garbage creature that attacks Luke in the garbage chute, with Leia, Han and Chewbacca. But, in my opinion, no one can (or should) argue that Star Wars ranks as one of the movies kids will still be trading cards of, arguing about the best character and making fan fiction of in 1000 years to come!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSStar Wars is the one of the most ground-breaking film of all time. It was high-tech for 1977. It's just too bad it didn't win best picture. It lost to Annie Hall. Star Wars introduced classic characters like Luke, Vader, Kenobi, Leia, Solo, 3PO, and R2. I also think some quotes in it are just plain silly, such as, "When I left you, I was but the learner, now I am the master." "Only a master of evil, Darth." That line was plain silly. Great film, though. Overall, this film is superb. Should not be missed if you like science-fiction9/10Recommended films: Spaceballs. Well, if you like comedy.</fullReview>

I have to give credit to my friend Rita for actually spotting it, but for the sake of the attentive IMDb crowd, I was the only one with the account and so I thought I would post the question anyhow.

		<fullReview>The original Star Wars is the greatest motion picture ever done in cinematic history. The first ten minutes of the film has been and will always be the most enjoyable moment in cinematic history for me. George Lucas has changed special effects for every filmmaker out their. The original Star Wars trilogy itself has not only changed the way I looked at movies but changed me as a person. I know that sounds a little fruity but it really has. Even though I am not a fan of the prequel movies I will say that the story of the whole saga is simply genius. If you watch each movie carefully you will notice has much it pays tribute to every aspect of pop culture and history. I will end off by saying that George Lucas is a master story teller and probably one of the most,if not the most genius of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that launched a thousand space-ships.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone who saw this film for the first time had barely taken their seats before witnessing the most jaw-dropping special-effect ever. To see that colossal Imperial star-ship growing out of the screen until the front is in middle distance whilst the complete fuselage is not yet made visible, was to see science fiction and fantasy changed for ever. Instead of being the poor nephew of production, overnight it became the new box-office spectacle.The first 2 minutes alone were worth the price of the whole movie. And indeed; 30 years on, they still are.CGI effects have taken over as the preferred medium of invention, and there is certainly a place for that technique too. But ineptly done they are no more plausible than stop-go latex. It is possible to create more features and movement with them, but whether or not they're necessary is debatable. Later offerings seem overblown. There's just a bit too much of everything. Well-made models and micro-cameras have a realism and substance that computer technology has yet to replicate.Consider the robots R2D2 and C3PO. The latter was a real person dressed up to look and act like a robot. Even R2D2 sometimes contained a small actor at times. Once again, they have a presence on the set that CGI robots lack. Compare them with those of 'I Robot' and you will see what I mean.I could go on, but there's no need. This movie has it all. A hero rescuing a heroine, good versus evil, one of the greatest baddies of all time with the most spectacular entrée imaginable, title music as rousing as any national anthem... Ah, but we all know it by now.I don't think George Lucas has done anything else BUT the StarWars series. And that's fine; it's as worthy a legacy as anyone could wish, something that will last as long as cinema - and beyond.It's no good; I'll have to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VOTE USCWANNABE My name is Tom Costabile and I am currently the lead runner up in the Presidency contest at Hyperspace.com, known on that site as USCWANNABE. I have been intently working on trying to win this election and have come to the conclusion that I can't win this with just friends and family...I'm going to need the help of the millions of fans Star Wars has adopted for itself to win this contest so I've decided to write this letter to introduce myself and my ideas for the fan club presidency. I went back to school and got my GED. I went to college for Media Arts and Animation (because I wanted to be GL) and got my bachelors. I moved to Studio City, Ca to go to USC and started my real life, the one I envisioned when I was 5, and within 3 years I own multiple corporations, my dream houses, my dream cars, I don't do drugs or drink In essence, I have everything I have ever wanted for myself and I have Star Wars and George Lucas to thank for it, and my way of giving back is to take my place in the SW world and be the best damn Fan Club president anyone can. I have a few ideas for how I can make it better for us as fans : I feel that we are entering a very scary time in terms of our beloved Star Wars. For the first time in SW history we are in a realm of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next. For the entire time SW has been in our lives we knew there was going to be more, it was just a matter of time, and now, according to Lucas there will never be another film. Of course we're going to have the video games, the board games and the television shows and so on, but nothing, absolutely nothing can compare to watching the midnight showing of a new Star Wars film. It's probably the greatest experiences of my life and I don't want it to end! I feel that there is a way around this though. If there were more conventions than SW would stay alive forever. If we as fans can come together more frequently I believe SW would never leave us and its that simple. We need to urge LucasFilm to produce more functions in more cities all over the world in order to satisfy the needs of the true fans and as president this will be my number one priority. Not just every 3 years, but every year. Not in just one city but multiple cities. One of the things I found to be disturbing was that because it was in Indianapolis, and only in Indianapolis, it was extremely hard for a lot of people to come there. They would have to get time off work, save up money, and make room for this in their personal lives. These reasons deterred a lot of people away and that I feel is not fair to them. It should not cost an extrordinary amount of money and time to celebrate these films and now that there won't be any movies its all we have to look forward to as a group. If LucasFilm will not cooperate with this I feel that we should come together as a group and make it happen ourselves and as President of the fan club I would be more than happy to make all of the arrangements and make this happen! I also feel that SW fans are probably the most enlightened and creative people on the planet. We at an early age saw the talent that went into making these films and have been trying to find that talent within ourselves ever since, and the best part about it is many of us have but we don't know what to do with it!! Especially in a day and age where there are more film students than law students and a time where the world is the smallest its ever been in the history of the Earth. We as a society are watching films from England, France, Japan and so on and seeing the impact that SW has had on not just the USA, but the world!! I propose that if I become president I begin an organization where people from all over the planet can submit their artworks (not just SW stuff) and gain the assistance of people in the entertainment industry. From writing to storyboarding to CGI to film and all that has to do with it. An organization by SW fans for SW fans!! A way to come up and not need no one but ourselves to make it happen. If we took all the talent that is in the group of people that will read this letter and put it together in a serious way your talking American Zoetrope to the tenth power. Your talking about possibly the next wave of great filmmakers. A way for me to give back.I felt an obligation to do this. If I don't win this contest I want everyone who reads this to know how I feel about everything that has been going on around us in the SW society as an extremely concerned fan. I think that everyone I have ever met at the conventions and the midnight showings and the Weekends at Disney have been the greatest, greatest group of people this world has to offer, and I am so greateful that I'm a part of it. May the force be with you all. Thomas Costabile USCWANNABE</fullReview>

The only thing that I didn't like, is the fact that in a couple scenes, the acting wasn't the best, it was good, but not the best. I noticed that through V&amp; VI as well. But that's because it was made in 1977, and they didn't have all the cool gadgets that we have today. So I would rate it a 10 on a scale of 1-10, but George Lucas, you did a REALLY fantastic job, same with all the other actors, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and all the other stars that participated in the making of these movies. You all did an amazing job.I really love star wars and this is fantastic. Even tough my dad thinks that this movie is lame(he liked star wars). But it really isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the stuff that makes for classic film-making! The film has it all - a great and simple story (which is really the Hero's Journey in play - Luke Skywalker our hero escapes his desolate existence to fight evil and rescue the Princess), properly paced editing (this film did a 180 from the classical style of editing where the pacing was slower and the editing less), a wonderful score by John Williams (who already outdone himself with Jaws in 1975), wholly original production design (lightsabers, the Death Star, X Wings, and of course Darth Vader!), and a sense of danger wherever our likable heroes turn. The best scene of this film is when Luke Skywalker looks at the twin suns of Tatooine longing for more than his dismal existence as a farmer. Don't we all feel that way some time? Don't we all long to do something extraordinary, to get that happy ending. I sure did and this filmed delivered - for this reason, I give this film a solid 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars, and how two into one will not go. There are two very different interpretations to this movie, though not suffering from any schizoid tendencies as such, but more of a conflict of interest's.Here we have the eleven-year-old boy who first saw this movie at his local Cinema, way back in 1977. This was one of the biggest movies of all time, as was the Great Hollywood classics of their times, Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz both from the Thirties, Citizen Kane arrived during the Forties, Ben Hur in the Fifties and from the Sixties we were given Psycho. These movies, all in their own right, were movies of great significance, from a Cinematic point of view. Until the 25th of May 1977, the seventies had produced very little in Cinematic splendour and worldwide success. That was until the release of George Lucas's Star Wars. The World was about to explode. The World went Star Wars crazy. Mr Lucas had succeeded in making not only the biggest blockbuster of the Seventies, but had kick started a whole new generation of movie fans and Cinema-goers Worldwide. Loosely intertwined around the 1958 Japanese story The Hidden Fortress and the 1972 Silent Running movie, amongst others, he had become over night one of Hollywood's greatest assets. Star Wars not only appealed to the very young, but to a wide spectrum of Movie lovers, apart from containing the qualities of a good story, such as Science Fiction, Adventure and Romance, Star Wars contained that one magic formula, that the audience, might, just might, relate to the life of that Country boy, Luke, the frustrated and oppressed life style,and becoming ever so eager to support him in his quest for Manhood , and to finally become accepted.This eleven-year-old boy, too, had become Star Wars crazy, he too was awe struck at its fantastic effects, the adventures of the Good Guys and how they battled across the Galaxy, flying to far away Planets and wonders. The Good Guys deserved to win and the Bad Guys deserved everything they got, and in the meantime, the adventure was on. He was captivated. A Childhood moment that would stay forever. Being only eleven, he saw nothing wrong in the way the too simplistic dialogue was delivered on screen. He did not know of the indifference of the main leading Actor, Sir Alec Guinness, maybe due to the fact that he seemed completely embarrassed to have any connection with Star Wars. He would not have understood the concept of hype and exploitation, and as he was growing up would come to realise that Star Wars, as great as it was, did not match up to the expectations of his Childhood. Seeing this movie through grown up eyes, he become more susceptible to a cynical viewpoint, or should that also be a realistic view?The movie as a whole is very good, but now, many years later, he came to realise that some things are best left in the past, and that Star Wars of 1977 was a far better and different movie than the Star Wars of today, this is in no way what so ever a comparison of the two different Star Wars movies of past and present, but of Star Wars in itself. It has stood the test of time; it has made its mark on Cinema history and all the better for it. However, it is time to move on to Galaxies new and explore new Cinematic Worlds. Star Wars: One of the earliest Cinematic experience I have had the pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant first chapter to an massively influential series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I'd just like to say, I was born in 1990. So no, I'm no long-time devotee to Star Wars, at least haven't been for nearly thirty years. I witnessed the masterpiece that is Star Wars at the tender age of four or so, I was amazed at the coolness of the lightsabers, Darth Vader(David Prowse) menacing attitude and voice(James Earl Jones), not-to-mention the heroic escapades of Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) and his allies.I laughed at the jokes, the pessimism of C-3PO and Han Solo's sarcastic comments towards the situations. The entire movie had me thoroughly entranced and drawn into the Star Wars world, needless to say, I was hooked. So later I saw The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and the three newest chapters to the story. Looking back though, this is the one that really did it for me, as sad as it may sound, I don't think I'd be the person I am today without Star Wars.The acting is quite good, the whole cast really seems to fit their characters nicely, especially Obi-Wan(Sir Alec Guinnes) and Darth Vader, both of whom set up a nice set of questions for you: What's the connection, the Clone Wars, what does Darth Vader look like? The rest of the cast also deliver equally stellar performances, I remember feeling a real connection to Luke, possibly even more-so today, seeing as I am reaching that age that is so strike-out independent. This Star Wars also manages to be the most light-hearted and generally, funny of the six, and it's perfectly kid-friendly.The special effects also look surprisingly good for being thirty years old; the opening scene especially looks quite cool. And though the camera on the original uses a rather odd filter and retains a definite 70's feel, the movie is without a doubt: watch able.Anyways, just go see Star Wars if you haven't already. The whole series is phenomenal and perhaps the greatest cinematic achievement of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>despite being a tad on the long side, the original "star wars" has everything a movie needs to be great...a hero, the best villain of all time in Darth Vader, the beautiful heroin, and the cocky rogue (Han Solo)...throw all that in with a planet-destroying space station and you have one of the best movies ever...the graphics of Lucasarts are incredible for being 1977, and they add a level of realism that was nonexistent in movies at the time...also, the depth of the characters and the rich storyline got me hooked and involved like i haven't been in many movies in my life...i caught myself genuinely caring who won the battles, and more than once i caught myself jumping out of my seat giving a little cheer when the good guys managed to get a victory over the all-powerful empire...all in all, star wars kicks off the best series of movies of all time, and ranks in the top two or three of my list of all time favorites</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has held up well over almost 30 years. To understand why it is a favorite of those of us that saw it in the theaters, you have to understand what movies were in the 70's. Movies were socially relevant and commonly the bad guy won. I was one of those people that cheered in the theater when the good guys actually win. This movie took all of us back to right winning over wrong and began to give us hope again. This is one of my favorite movies, I love the sets, the costumes, the plot, the characters, the new inventions and the genius that Lucas put forth in his "experiment". Even though the new production has added images in it, I don't think it takes away from the original or its intent. This is Lucas' story and his film.</fullReview>

As a pianist, composer and teacher of music I can only salute maestro John Williams in "the-original-music-score-par-excellence"!! Together with the imaginative story-telling etc,etc of Mr.Lucas, Williams and a whole crew- at the peak of their powers- completed this epic adventure, heavily awarded and with a brilliant closing.

		<shortDescription>An epic tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What else can be said about STAR WARS? Since the moment it was released it has been seen by so many people and characterized a whole generation. That's why I don't think of it as another old movie you just have to see. For me it's more; a lot more. Two very fundamental components of our lives are illustrated in a very good way. Good and Evil. Adults know that in the real world there are plenty of shades not just black and white. But nevertheless we keep telling our kids fairy-tales. When you think of STAR WARS as an epic tale, which reduces the complex universe to the ultimate and eternal fight between good and evil, you might see how wonderful it can be. The characters are brilliantly played and their positions are very quickly set. I want to say that I liked all actors and their performances. Some of had been inseparable connected to their characters and made them immortal. The movie contains also scenes and sentences which also had become legendary. But I don't want to anticipate the movie.My résumé is that this movie is worth to watch! And I hope that you are able to see the power behind it.</fullReview>

In my opinion it is the second best trilogy after the Lord Of The Rings trilogy of course. When Star Wars, was out in the theater's the movie world changed. Star Wars is one of the first movies to have good special effects, after Star Wars other movies with good special effects came out. Like Terminator and other movies.I think Episode IV is better then Episide V, other people say that Episode Vis the best of all the six movies, but i don't agree with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the COOLEST films I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that gets me about this film was that I wasn't even alive in 1977. Sometimes, I really wish I had seen it in theaters, ESPECIALLY in 70mm on the larger-than-life big screen and full stereophonic surround sound. That REALLY would've been a experience to remember. Even though I saw it 100,000 some-odd times I never got bored by it. I owned it on VHS and I own it now on DVD.I first saw the film on VHS (yes, folks, VHS) when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I started to like it, so I saw more of it as years went on. This was THE film that inspired me to wanna be a filmmaker. Too bad when it was re-released in '97, I didn't go and see it. I used to be scared of seeing films in theaters 'cause the sound was too loud and it was just too much.I have NEVER seen the original "Star Wars" in theaters to this day.This will always be the best film of the original SW trilogy. The second trilogy (not counting Episodes I &amp; III; TPM was okay, though) and that "Clone Wars" piece of celluloid crap made by the jackass I call "George Lucas No. 2" make the whole franchise look real stupid.Special effects, no words to say about 'em. Back in the '70s, special effects like those and the ones you saw in "2001"; they was just unmatched. Now, when you compare those effects to the effects you see in films today, it looks kinda cheesy, but it was still state-of-the art, and the old-fashioned special effects are the ones I prefer, actually. Industrial Light &amp; Magic has obviously come a long, long way since then.John Williams' score for the film is definitely one of the best ever written and one of the best ones I've ever heard. The theme song for the film is one that's gonna be loved and remembered for decades to come.The acting is awesome. The three leads are great, and the thing they all have going' on in the movie and the way they are is what makes it funny. The relationship between 3PO and R2 is another great comedy touch. And Darth Vader. The only thing I can say about him is he's the ULTIMATE bad guy.Another funny thing was that this made more money than ANY MOVIE IN HISTORY up until that point. I didn't know that.Great movie from a ex-great filmmaker from a great year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I am old enough to have gone and seen the Star Wars movies(or,rather,had my parents take me to see it)when it was first released,I was rather slow about getting into the genre until much later. I don't think I even got around to seeing all three films until I was in college. Most people(I am assuming)know the general crux of this film,so I'll spare the plot summery here. This movie is,for all of its technical flash(for 1977),strum and drang is basically a Western/Actioner serial that is set in space with slight shadings of adult savvy,mixed with kid-like enthusiasm. Creator/Director George Lucas cannot be credited enough with bringing to life a cultural phenomenon that can match Star Trek for the level of adoration and emulation. The actors involved(even mega star Harrison Ford) seem secondary to the story,effects and world,but that is something that cannot be oversold in a business where actors and images seem to exceed the value of their roles or the movies they do oftentimes.At the risk of seeming really,REALLY clichéd and trite:yes,I,too believe this movie is an INSTANT classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas used elements of folk motifs, added spectacular visual effects, and cast then-unknowns who had chemistry to craft one of the most enjoyable films of all times. Not to get too Joseph Campbellesque but by tapping into those traditional-held elements (e.g. the sword, the orphan who is really the lost lord, etc.) predisposed the audience understand the conflicts that Luke must endure in this and future episodes. Add the mysticism of The Force with its ying/yang Zen of good versus evil and we were ready to follow the Jedi to the end of the cycle. It is criminal that Mr. Lucas broke faith with all of us and will not do the final three episodes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie, but not the best in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The legend begins with this old, but great movie - Star Wars. It is obviously made with love and it is a very nice introduction to the magnificent world of George Lucas, full with humor, terrific action, very likable characters and creepy villains, including the notorious Darth Vader, probably the coolest character in the series. The movie begins like a typical faerie tale, on a small planet, and the main character Luke Skywalker is just an ordinary boy, caught in extraordinary events. Ben Kenobi, the wise old man with mysterious past is really an interesting and charismatic hero, Han Solo and his friend Chewbakka are hilarious and even princess Leia is nice - not with striking beauty, but likable and human. And the villain... Vader. When I was young I dreamed to be like him. He is a symbol of the true evil - big, black, menacing, ruined and with this skull-like mask. His voice, his powers and his attitude made him possibly the greatest movie villain, even if in this film we saw a glimpse of even greater evil in the face of the hideous old Emperor. The story is good for a beginning, but a bit slow. However, it becomes better in the next two movies.</fullReview>

I was lucky enough to acquire the Star Wars Trilogy, and see these three epic classics remastered. Well, all I can say is it was well worth the money.When this hit the screens in 1977, in had the world in shock. The special effects were incredible for the time, and are decent enough now, almost 30 years later. A miraculous classic, Star Wars should be viewed by everybody who has ever heard of the sacred word "film". Starting off with a great Sci-fi battle sequence, the precious Princess Leia has Empire Secrets and is captured and held on a massive Empire ship. This epic film follows the quest of some truly memorable characters; the timid Luke Skywalker, the arrogant Hand Solo and his truly loyal Chewbacca, Darth Vader and of course, who could forget R2-D2 and C-3PO?A stunningly fantastic sci-fi action-adventure, Star Wars is one of the greatest films of all time. 5 stars all round.

		<fullReview>When I was 13 I heard tell of a movie that had my childish heart leaping with joy. A sci-fi adventure that, from the trailers, was like nothing I'd ever seen before. Until then, the best that sci-fi had shown me was Star Trek.I counted down the days until it came out and then, one fateful day in the summer, I went to see it. In the queue, I met up with a friend who'd also gone to see the movie alone. So we got tickets and sat together someplace in the middle of the rows. Whilst we waited for the movie to start we, like everyone else there, discussed what we knew of the film, what trailers we'd seen etc..Then the lights dimmed and as the curtains (they had real fancy ones in those days!) drew back from the screen, the 20th Century Fox logo appeared and the signature tune burst into life with deafening loudness.From that moment on I sat open-mouthed, like everyone else, as the film unfolded before us. There were no mobile phones in those days to annoy you, no sniggering teens in the back rows. There were teens, of course, but they were as raptly enthralled as everyone else. In the rare quiet moments of the film, the silence in the auditorium spoke volumes as to what we were bearing witness to - to what we were becoming a part of. The friend whom I was sitting with faded into the darkness - we never exchanged one word during the whole film. Afterwards, as we left, both of us were strangely subdued. The film had stunned us so much that mere words could not begin to explain how we felt. It was almost as if we wanted to savour the moment, as if we knew that such a perfect afternoon's entertainment would never come again. And we'd be right.To say that Star Wars changed my life may seem a conceit. The movie offered nothing more than (for a 13 year old) a fantastic couple of hours entertainment that you wished could go on forever. But it's true nonetheless. For Star Wars, unlike the dry and dreary sci-fi flicks of the time such as Silent Running and Zardoz, offered one thing that no film until then had managed.It opened doors to the imagination. From that point on no movie need be limited by the constraints of the movie-making process. Anything was possible. Of course, it wouldn't be until the advent of CGI that this promise could truly be fulfilled, but after Star Wars, nothing was the same again.My only complaint against Star Wars is that it is no longer available in the original theatre release version. Mr Lucas' Special Edition of the film, though adding much to the movie, also (in my humble opinion) took just as much away. The Special Edition looks slicker, nicer, more complete. But my memories won't let go of the original version, which had such a profound effect upon me. The Special Edition version, whilst fantastic, just doesn't look right to me. To me it's as if the original has been supplanted by some Doppleganger. It may look the same on the surface but......it isn't same.This is perhaps the only time I've ever thought a special version of the film was worse than the original. So here's my hope - that the original version will be released on DVD too. I can't be the only one who would want that, can I? In the rest of my life to date only a few films have ever come close to matching that sense of awe and excitement - Jurassic Park, Aliens and The Fellowship of the Ring. And even they, whilst great films in their own right, do not come that close.But don't take my word for it, go and watch it yourself. Today, of course, it shows its age, and everyone is used to films with huge scope and effects. For those who saw it originally as I did - as a kid at the dawn of FX cinema - I probably don't need to go on. For those who have not seen it - why not? In my other reviews I sometimes pour scorn on movies, scripts, SFX, acting - you name it. Sometimes even I think I can be a little harsh at times. But if I am it's because bad movies shouldn't be made anymore. If they could get it right in 1977, shouldn't they all be great films now? My benchmark for judging other films are the memories of a 13 year old kid. Is it any wonder nothing can live up to them? The only parting comment I'll make about Star Wars is to recommend you see it on a big screen if at all possible. Nothing like that should ever be show on a 14" portable with mono sound. Some films demand a cinema, or at the very least a hefty plasma TV with surround sound. Nothing else will ever do it justice.Enjoy!</fullReview>

It can be watched and enjoyed by both the young and the old, and it's impact on the history of cinema has been examined countless times. The original Star Wars trilogy were three of the first movies that I ever watched, and I'm very glad I was introduced to the adventures of Luke Skywalker and friends at such an early age. I can't imagine how many times I've seen this film over the past 18 years or so, but it hasn't lost it's appeal at all. The acting could honestly be better in some places, but the special effects and storytelling are top notch.

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the second time today. The first time was in thetheater when I was twelve years old. I think after having not seen it inso many years that I may have developed some sort of phobia. Mygirlfriend bought the box set several years ago and I've been starringat the plastic wrapping ever since. The aftermath of hurricane Francishas me grounded today so I figured, "what the heck".I have, nor do I seek any credibility in terms of my film critiques;therefore I have nothing to lose by submitting a review for this filmthat is not entirely flattering. Re-watching it was an exciting andenjoyable experience, although I found much of the film to be laughable.I attribute this, in part, to having seen "Spaceballs" much morerecently and more often. I couldn't help relating certain comedicaspects of the parody to the real thing. For instance, every time theysaid "Force" I was expecting to hear "Schwartz", and so on.Then there was the squadron of Jedi Fighter Pilots who assembled toattack the Death Star. One guy was at least a hundred pounds over weightand hadn't shaved in a month. Another was fifty pounds over weight andpushing sixty years old. These two must have been George Lucas'brother's cousin's stepfather's former roommates. That or "The Force" was short of a much-needed physical fitness program.Don't get me wrong, I have a great deal of respect for theaccomplishments of this film in terms of special effects, sound effectsand the fact that these, along with other features were displayed hereeons ahead of their time. I thought it was deserving of all of itsAcademy Awards Nominations with the exception of one, that being BestPicture. Again, it was entertaining, but one of the top ten films of alltime? Please! In 1977, does it rank as the best movie that the averagetwelve-year-old boy has ever seen? Absolutely!, but lets grow up and getreal. I understand that this is sacrilege, but in my humble opinion, andspeaking from a dramatic standpoint, you simply can't compare this storyor the performances of this cast to sci-fi films such as "Alien", or forthat matter, "12 Monkeys".Most feel that the sequels, "Return of the Jedi" and "Empire" are muchbetter, (I'll soon find out). If this is the case then it's highlyunusual, as most sequels aren't worth the laser disc they're burnt on.Considering the recognition that these two films received it's obviousthat they're well worth watching, at the very least. However, they mayalso help to prove my earlier point regarding the strengths andweaknesses of this type of film. While both made their mark in terms ofAcademy Awards, they were completely void of any acclaim in theindividual performance related categories. I'm obviously not a hard core sci-fi buff, but I am glad that I finallymotivated myself to see "Star Wars" again. It brought back many fondmemories and I'm sure I'll see it again very soon. In the mean time, ifyou find spelling or grammatical errors in this review, don't give me ahard time. I used the force of Microsoft Word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars, ostensibly about Hats, really about Germans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i once heard a friend of mine describe this as "libellous Nazi filth". i am now coming round to his point of view. the final presentation at the end (of the medals) is a little more than reminiscent of the Nuremburg rallies, note the visual assonance of the lighting with the nazi banners at the rally. The nazi aircraft project "X-wing" to do with research with nuclear fuelling, does X-wing ring a bell with anyone... i thought it might. Overall, decent film, fights somewhat lackluster... not sure what all the fuss was about really, its certainly no Sam Raimi project... let alone a brand worthy of the Star Trek enterprise. p.s the recent ones as one step beyond this "tosh" to quote Gary McGibbleson, noted film reviewer of our time (the nineties).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the key is the context</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Star Wars, I wasn't especially impressed. The acting was by and large atrocious. Mark Hamill rushes his lines like an acting 101 beginner and Harrison Ford murmors his way through the film. The minor characters weren't so bad though: Alec Guiness gives a sublime performance, and Threepio is good as well.However, as the title suggests, the key is the context. It's been said that Lucas was inspired by legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress. Clearly, the Jedi swordplay was inspired by it, and the concept of "the force" is an offshoot of Japanese Buddhist/Taoist philosophy. The clothing worn is Japanese inspired also; it's a world where the beauty of swordplay can hold it's own against modern guns.That's just a brief glimpse into the story, but it just goes to show how deep it is. Lucas has also stated that the star fight scenes were based off of WWII fighter footage, and the droids, and their sentience, are based off of Asimov. There's the subtle anti-nuke theme to it; when the Rebellion learns of the Empire's Death Star, they do not set out to build their own version of it (ie cold war) but rather set out to destroy this horrific weapon.In conclusion, Star Wars is a classic film. I personally like Empire Strikes Back more for it's vastly improved acting, pacing, and plot. However, Star Wars will always be the art-house film that kicked off the series. May the force be with us all(ps: if you're looking to buy a version of this, avoid the "special editions" put out in 1997. Lucas went a little batty with his newfangled Macintoshes and made some significant and terrible changes to the films. If you can, try to get a copy of the original theatrical film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Star Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, them were the days. I remember watching this with a room full of bouncy prepubescents, in the sort of creche room of a boring adult drinks party. We knew every single line of every single character, not only through repeated viewings but also from the pungent originality of the whole imperfect melange of performance and idea.The importance of this brilliant film was brought home to me by an article by a critic, claiming ET to have driven American culture from its release in 1982. One looks back not only at the appearance of dolls from Star Wars in the film, but the culture of Star Wars which meant that said dolls could not be omitted from the natural texture of a middle class American child's playroom.Do try and watch the original theatre release if you can. The added CGI garnish is distracting at best. I can't talk about how good the film is dispassionately so I'll give it 9/10 and see if I can go and find the Boba Fett I nicked from my brother when I was seven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Motion Picture Sagas Ever Filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 17 years old, Godless and bored. I believed in nothing but work. Between a Saturday matinee and the evening performance of a play I was performing in, I caught Star Wars and my whole world changed.To me 'the force' is the single most important dogma out there, I knew it then -- I understand it now. Even Mr. G. Lucas couldn't alter my opinion with his 'strange' explanation of the force in that dreadful Episode One film. Mediclorins, indeed!!!The force is something between the rock and the land, between us and the universe. It is what we all are. Where we came from. Where we will end up. It is a mystery, an old one, awash with echos from the serials of 1940s.Luke pines for the kind of adventure, a seventeen year old boy, can only dream of. Han doesn't care about anyone cause no one cares about him, 'cept a Wookie. Leia is fighting for truth and freedom. Darth wants to oppress the entire universe. Ben longs for day 'The Chosen One' will show himself.These are basic character goals, something we as humans can relate to. Dreaming. Caring. Fighting. Longing. We believed in those characters, they spoke directly to our hearts. They were innocent. We were innocent.In 1977 we were all trying to make our way in the big universe. We all had a Darth in our lives. If you were lucky you had a best friend covering your back -- like Han, and a girl you liked but didn't get. For the volumes of science fiction essay that Star Wars has inspired, I wonder if the basic, raw truth has ever come out. Using the guise of sci-fi / fantasy, Lucas tells a simple story of humanity. That's it. Pure. Simple. "The little guy can over come the bad guys of the world even when the bad guy turns out to be your Dad"Star Wars tells us we are strong, we can over come. It's message to children with stars in their eyes, is to look toward the heavens and never fear -- you've got good on your side.The innocence of Star Wars carried a generation into reality.As a footnote, back then I spent every cent on Star Wars toys. Being 17, I didn't open the packages and play with the products but I kept them until two years ago. On E-Bay I sold the entire collection from all three movies. Suffice to say, the proceeds were a mighty fine down payment on my house. In honor of Mr. Lucas, my study features, among other things, an original poster of the movie and the M. Falcon hanging above my deak in mid-flight.To this day, I can find nothing wrong with the film., a film that caused me to "look up" and see the future -- my future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important piece of cinematic history -- good or bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few people need to be explained the impact of "Star Wars." It rightfully belongs amongst the most influential works of art of the 20th century. It was an overwhelming commercial success. Nearly everyone who's lived at all during the past 26 years since its release has probably seen it -- at least once. It started the merchandising tie-in trend that has started to this day. It was a critical success --witness its Oscar nominations and wins and its win for Best Picture from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. People are fanatical about it and have fallen in love with the characters, story, and themes.But is it "good?"There is a lot to admire about "Star Wars." It is an audacious film. For example, it starts at "Part IV," outright saying that it's portraying the history -- not the (fictional) story, but the REAL history -- of another universe. (And many moviegoers choose to believe that it IS real.) The special effects continue to impress. The story is as exemplary a myth as any.But the acting is just about terrible. Alec Guinness is, well, Alec Guinness, and the rest of the cast stands in his shadows. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher do their job, but Mark Hammill is just disgraceful. (It doesn't help that his character is whiny and annoying -- or is it just in the portrayal?) Adults, if you haven't seen the film in awhile, try watching it again without laughing when our boy Luke is whimpering "What's that flashing?" Besides which, most of the drama is really melodrama.Ok, so these are perhaps petty gripes. "Star Wars" is far from the best film ever made, but neither could its importance ever be underestimated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR WARS (1977) **** Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, Carrie Fisher, David Prowse, James Earl Jones (voice only), Peter Cushing, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew. George Lucas reinvented the genre of science fiction with his masterpiece of a story that takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away in epic proportions with groundbreaking Oscar-winning special effects and one of the all-time money making blockbusters in cinematic history. Luke Skywalker (Hamill) embarks on a life-altering odyssey when two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2 are dropped into his possession with a plea for help by Princess Leia (Fisher) asking for Obi Wan Kenobi (Oscar nominee Best Supporting Actor Guinness), reputedly the last Jedi Knight of the Force to battle the evil Darth Vader and the oppressive Empire. Enlisting space smuggler Han Solo (Ford in his star-making role) and his right arm Wookiee Chewbacca to get them to the kidnapped princess and help the rebel forces against the Death Star. Oscar nominated for Best Picture and Best Director (both losing to Woody Allen's "Annie Hall") and Academy Award recipient for Best Art Direction, Best Costumes, Best Score (John Williams' rousing score embellishes the fun) and a shared Special Achievement in Sound Effects with "Close Encounters of the Third Kind".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SHUT UP!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those people that are always saying that Lucas totally copied "Hidden Fortress" and all these other movies. SHUT UP every movie ever made is a copy of something else. Go back to cave man drawings and you will most likely find a story about a boy rescuing a princess, after being given a sword by the mentor, battling the evil ruler. "Star Wars" is my favorite movie of all time and I am a filmmaker, and the reason I get so upset with people when talking about this movie is not because I'm one of the die hard fans, it is because people criticize for the wrong reasons, you are not giving it a fare chance. This talk of copying others, I watched Fortress under the impression the I was going to watch "Star Wars" but not really, and saw so little resembling "Star Wars" I was upset. It just upsets me when people say things without having thought about why they are saying it.And another thing, there is so much that is good about this series, I&amp;II included, if you look for it. I could watch Godfather, or Kane and totally rip that apart as well, you can find bad thing about any movie if that is what you are looking for. If you look for good things and watch movies to be entertained the way you should, you will find a lot of great things.ohh and by the way, who ever said that Anikin is a winey, brat,... HE IS DARTH VADER, you know the most evil character in movie history, he is not cudley and likable, and have you listened to Luke lately?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great snot-based epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all of the space-adventure/snot-metaphor movies of all time this one might be the best. As a depiction of man's fight to not be subdued by his own allergies it is really without parallel (accept for maybe the Godfather, or some say Citizen Kane. Now I do think Citizen Kane is a great movie, but it has nothing to do with allergies). Back to Star Wars.Consider the setup, a young boy lives with his aunt and uncle, after his parents died mysteriously (of asthma?) when he goes to by some robots. These robots don't breathe, but nonetheless they are being chased by the empire, which is like the great snot in everyone's nose. The empire seeks to "tighten it's grip" on the solar system the same way snot constricts your nasal passages and makes it impossible to breathe. Consider the scene where Darth Vader, the Emperor's right hand man constricts one of the royal governor's breath. This is exactly what allergies at their worst do! You Can't breathe.Ok so Luke goes to hang out with Obi-Wan who has been fighting allergies all of his life, by a pattern of correct breath, very zen-like known as the force. By getting in touch with the force you can control your allergies and hopefully subdue them. However the empire is constructing a "death star" which fires a giant green "death" ray, more like a giant green snot ray if you ask me.Things get even worse when they try to rescue the princess, who is really snotty. This bothers Han Solo, who thinks some technology and luck, as in anti-allergy medication (symbolized by his reliance on a good blaster) will prevent the empire from stickin' it's slimy tentacles on him.The garbage dumpster scene. Do I need to say any more?Another thing about this movie: lots of rockets. Snot rockets. Also, consider the noses on many of these alien races. They're crazy! How do they deal with snot.The movie ends with a climax where luke fires a quick snot rocket aimed directly at the nostrils of the death star. Plugged up an unable to breath, it explodes, sneezing out darth vader to a fate unknown to those who plot the ways of snot.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR WARS: EPISODE IV-A NEW HOPE is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen. Every time I watch this movie, my eyes are wide open and my mouth is hanging (I'm in aw).It starts out with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammle) finding two fugitive 'droids (R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C3P-O (Anthony Daniels)), who are carying secret plans to the Death Star, an armored space station with enough fire-power to destroy an entire planet. Meeting up with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness), an old Jedi knight, Luke travels to save Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with the pilot Han Solo (a young Harrison Ford).This is the ultimate adventure story. The plot is simple, but not stupid. The acting is fantastic as well as the directing. Another thing that amazed me about this film is the amount of detail put into it. Lucus and Kurtz both create an entire galaxy, giving the film a very distinct sense of wonder and realism.It won 6 Acadamy Awards (Best Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Edditing, Best Sound, Best Cosutme, and Best Art) and was nomintaed for 10 (Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, Best Supporting Acrot, and Best Picture). I give STAR WARS: EPISODE IV-A NEW HOPE (1977) 10/10 This film contains brief, mild language, and sci-fi violence.</fullReview>

Star Wars has become nothing else but the biggest franchise ever and Geaorge Lucas has almost no talent (just like Peter Jackson). If a director is good, then he'll make more than 6 movies that all look alike and have a straight storyline. And only one good or at least popular actor in the first 3/ last 3? of course I mean Harrison Ford. Just get over it. It is nothing else than a nice movie from 25 years ago. There are many more good movies out there that don't involve pathetic actors and director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is the greatest movie ever made. Of course, this is open to debate, but its hard to find a movie that has so many great aspects to it, as Star Wars does. A great movie must factor in many parts that make up the whole, and Star Wars has almost everything. An incredible imagination, a gripping plot, fantastic cinematography, special effects that were light years ahead of its time, memorable characters, and amazing music. However, there is also something that sets it apart, an intangible that is not easily explained. Watching this movie on the big screen is like no other, it pulls you into its world. Although this movie changed the way movies were made and marketed, it had none of the contrived marketing that "blockbuster" movies have today. This movie became a huge success because of the movie itself. This movie is simply the greatest movie experience of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people find this (and the other SW movies) the best ever, since they watched them at a young age. After that they were indoctrinated through Star Wars toys/action figures/comics and so on. I never got around to watching the Star Wars trilogy until i was 19 years old, and didn't really find them that special. The special effects are fairly good for the late 70s/early 80s, but the storyline isn't exactly something it would take a genious to come up with. I can think of many other scifi movies that would rank equal or over Star Wars. As for the prequels, Episode I was a dud in my opinion, Episode II was a smidge better. It's all really about getting to watch how the Anakin/Darth Vader thing plays out, but the three year waiting periods just ruins the whole thing. By 2005 I'm sure I'll sit down in the theatre seat, and walk out 2.5 hours later a mediocre experience richer. Why do I torture myself...?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One rarely sees such a blatant rip-off of the writings of the Marquis de Sade and so many excessive references to sub-contextual sado-masochism that I can barely contain my trembling colon as I write. Apparently the project arose from an ibogaine experience George Lucas had while attending a frat party at USC in 1968. New initiates were requested to grab the ankles of a high back chair and sing "Louie, Louie" while a man in a black leather mask, known only as "Dirk", administered lashings of Greek discipline. I think we can make the appropriate inferences with regard to certain characters in the film. Here are some other points: 1 The suggestive names: "Han Solo" "Leia Organa" "Moff Tarkin". 2 The fact that Obi-Wan lived on Tatooine because of a restraining order issued by the Imperial magistrate several years earlier and was forbidden to leave his cave. 3 Princess Leia was known on some out-lying worlds as "Queen Purple Button" and was arrested on several separate occasions during the Endorian equivalent of Mardi Gras. 4 Constant references to "The Force." The sequel, at first called "Hot Lunch" and later renamed "The Empire Strikes Back" shifted gears by introducing the latent oedipal conflict among the Skywalker family. However, the guilt remains, and to this day no one in Mark Hamill's inner circle can utter the word "wookie" without causing flashbacks of savage intensity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overhyped movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars does not meet the benchmark for a great film. The film did break ground in its use of technology, level of detail and positioning of the audience. It will be contended that the while breaking ground, the film cannot be consider great by today's standards due to the poor choice of actors, unrealistic setting and a plot based on ideas misappropriated from ancient culture and legends. The films shortcomings in terms of the technology, detail and positioning, whilst revolutionary for its time, must be examined compared to today's standards for the movie to be considered great. The technology used in Star Wars was groundbreaking. Star Wars was the first time that computer technology was blended with cinematic techniques to create special visual effects. The film did captivate the minds and imagination of its viewer around the time of its release with its spacecraft, light sabres and flying cars. However, due to the early stages of computer technology, the films special effects make the film appear very poorly done, and draws attention to the films plot, which has been recycled several times since, except with better special visual effects.It must be conceded that no other film has surpassed the level of detail in Star Wars since its release. The creation of at least thirty different types of Intelligent Non-Humans, along with alternative languages, spacecraft, vehicles and weaponry, based on nothing ever seen on earth. The use of this high level of detail shows excellent craftsmanship by the director, but unfortunately the lack of technology makes the added detail look very primitive in comparison to today's films. Whilst the initial positioning of the audience is most certainly original, this does not necessarily make it great. The viewer is placed in the centre of a battle, and is left without much insight as to what is occurring. This can leave the viewer confused about the plot, setting and characters until more detail is revealed Star Wars is a disgrace in terms of its cast. It again must be conceded that many of the actors in the film have become some of the giants in the film industry, in Star Wars, only their lack of experience and indeed talent shone through. The director did manage to dupe two distinguished actors into the film, but left them in relatively minor roles, without much opportunity to exercise their acting expertise. This was a waste of some of the cast's abilities, and consequently the acting in Star Wars is terrible at best. The plot is pieces of ideas from westerns, Arthurian legend, eastern culture and the Samurais'. The use of intertextuality as the basis for the plot leaves the film with a disjointed, heterogenous plot. It also does not make sense and is quite unrealistic. This is another feature of the film that condemns it to be less than great, An unrealistic setting and features compound the lacking of this film. The opening scene, exemplifies the utter stupidity of the film. An eight-grade science student knows that sound cannot travel in space, but apparently the producers of Star Wars are unaware of the Laws of physics as the viewer hears sounds of lasers and explosions in space. Also there is incongruity between the technology and the time frame. This film is set in the distant past, and in the film they were able to jump between solar systems and had developed gravity repelling vehicles. This may be described as fantasy, but it is contended that fantasy that defies history is stupidity. This is another example of the idiocy of the film, writer and its producer. Star Wars shortcomings in terms of setting, technology, level of detail and choice of actors sentences it to be branded as an amateur attempt at creating a film, and is therefore most certainly not a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear George,I remember seeing Star Wars on its first release and being completely immersed in the story, the characters, the effects - to a thirteen year old it was wonderful, I saw it a couple of times after and the magic never diminished.BUT THEN at the weekend I sat down and saw this "new" film with added effects that more often than not stuck out like a sore thumb. Additions that somehow said "remember that film you loved so much...well actually it wasn't good enough". Well Mr Lucas it WAS good enough, it didn't need some hokey special effects to make it better - for me it had the opposite effect.In particular the scene with Han and Jabba looked dreadful - it repeated (almost verbatim) a previous scene, made Jabba seem insignificant and unthreatening and made poor Harrison Ford look like a second-rate actor who didn't know where to look.Sure I still enjoyed the film - but the additions (and of course the inevitable subtractions) meant that there was no longer any magic here for me.Just because you can do this it doesn't mean you should. You had the opportunity to show off all your special effects muscle in The Phantom Menace, why did you feel the need to meddle with your "back-catalogue" to try and produce a homogenous mass of work rather than a timeline through recent film history. Your attempts failed and now you have a half-decent film where there was once a great one.Thanks also for giving a treasured childhood memory a thorough kicking.-Andy (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good, but it ruined a lot of things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MORD39 RATING: *** 0ut of ****STAR WARS is a "good" sci-fi movie. There, I've said it.It's adventurous and exciting, a very Flash Gordon-esque zap-boom serial type of thrill ride.But in 1977, I can never forgive it for totally changing everything. I am a huge fan of the PLANET OF THE APES franchise, which I believe is far more intelligent and even influenced the Chewbacca character (remember that Fox owns both series). The now-famous lettering for STAR WARS was also taken from the PLANET OF THE APES logo. What I'm saying is that when STAR WARS came, the APES were out.But it wasn't just about that. There used to ge a great monster magazine called FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND. In 1977, the influence of STAR WARS even ruined that magazine, as each cover would feature the silly C3PO or R2D2 (though Darth Vader was cool), and the magazine became a STAR WARS publication. Indeed, the magazine covers would feature a tremendously bold "STAR WARS" on the top, while underneath you would see a tiny "famous monsters of filmland".Harrison Ford and Mark Hammill are not strong actors, and Carrie Fisher is far too average (but cute) to be a princess in my book. The silliness starts in this film with the robot characters (and gets worse in the special new version when you see more cartoonish ones) and got worse in the sequels (JAR JAR BINKS became the epitome of this nonsense).Perhaps the best actor in STAR WARS is Peter Cushing, in a role that should have been bigger.It's good fun, but I still am unable to fathom why people are so fanatical for the STAR WARS movies in general. The first one is worthy , the others just aren't. The fact that it inspired so many other science fiction ripoffs is REALLY incomprehensible.Maybe I just need to remind myself that even STAR WARS (1977) is a rip-off of all those aforementioned serials. A good rip-off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I think stunning is the only word that could even begin to describe this masterpiece. Just think, this one film changed the way space movies were made, and it did everything right. There's so much imagination here you have to watch it more than once just to take it all in. No words I say can really describe the film, because it's all been said before. While this movie is more than great, I don't think it needed a special edition, because it was good enough on it's own. Even so, any way you see it, it's still awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And so it begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought we had all seen Star Wars. Turns out we haven't. My fiancée had never seen any of the series until she saw the Phantom Menace. So I rented the first three and sat down one fateful Saturday afternoon and watched them in succession. As always, another one was captivated and lured into the legend that starts out with those spinetingling words, " A long time ago in a galxy far far far away.... "It doesn't matter if you are six or 36, Star Wars and it's sequels and prequels will hypnotize you, and even if you have seen the films 100's of times, it is always great to go back and pay homage to the film that entertained us and captured our imaginations. And even though this film is now more than 20 years old, it is still easy to marvel at the technology and Lucas' impressive vision. I remember hearing that George took this to many studios before 20th Century and they emphatically denied him any funds to make this film. But then someone at 20th Century told him that they liked what he did with American Graffiti and they told him to do it. Could you imagine what the guys at the other studios must have been saying to themselves after Star Wars went on to not only break box office records, but shatter them? Perhaps some execs lost their jobs for passing over Star Wars for the latest Al Pacino movie, but they shouldn't have. Star Wars was a gamble. It has far off worlds, another language(s), Wookies, the force, a man dressed in all black that moves things with his mind, princesses, old wizards, androids, farmers, space stations, bars with singing puppets, space cowboys, bad guys with British accents, landspeeders, tie fighters, X-Wing fighters, lightsabres and so on. Who in their right mind would want to gamble on this when in the previous six years of the decade the biggest films were that of a killer shark, a ruthless family of Italian mobsters and a boxer with a speech impediment that goes all the way? Star Wars clearly didn't fall into the category of box office gold. But then something unbelievable happened.Other films have gone onto gross more money than Star Wars ( E.T. Jurassic Park, Titanic ) but I don't think any other film has ever done to an audience or to a society what the Legend that is Star Wars and it's sequels has done. And that is taken something that is a motion picture and turn it into something almost tangible, something that has a life of it's own. And it just makes it even more fun to look back on the films from 20 some years ago now that the second batch of films is in full bloom. We can now ask questions like, How does Anakin go from that darling little boy to the evil and mechanical monster that he is? How does Yoda end up in the Degabah System? What happened to all the other Jedi Masters? Why does Obi Wan end up on Tatooine? Why why why and how? Many answers are awaiting us in the coming episodes. But we can all look back to 1977 and a young man named George Lucas that had a vision, an epiphany perhaps, and we can thank the movie Gods that Star Wars was born. This is one of the true defining moments in motion picture history.Star Wars- 10 out of 10. Can you give it any less?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>because of the new star wars movie hype, i decided to rent the original trilogy to watch it again. I recall watching it once on TV when i was 5 or so. I thought that the first episode was the worst of them all. They all were good, but this was the most pathetic one. The special effects really look dated, and the attempts at humor are cliched. Anyway, about the special effects, i guess they looked wonderful in 1977. But one thing is for sure: the effects were better in episodes V &amp; VI. Another thing i didn't like about it, was that there weren't many different locations, it was all on Tatooine or on the Death Star. All in all , i thought this movie would be better, more adventure and action. The other two never let up in the action department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some apologists for "The Phantom Menace" - not all - defend it by saying, "Yes, it has its flaws; but it's just as good as the original Star Wars, which had the very same flaws."After a while it's hard to avoid the suspicion that they're right. Not about "The Phantom Menace" being a good film - it's ridiculous to suppose that they could be right about THAT - but about "Star Wars" being no better. Maybe we've been deluded these past decades. Similar delusions have persisted for just as long - longer - in the past. Could it be that "Star Wars", too, was an unimaginative, flatly directed, kiddie movie?NO! Most certainly, it was not. One thing "The Phantom Menace" reveals, though, is that "Star Wars" was not fated to be as good as it was. It became great partly by accident.Harrison Ford has genuine charm; Mark Hamill is perfect as the innocent adolescent with a tendency to whine; Alec Guinness managed to be at one and the old time an old sage and an ex-warrior; and no other female lead had the strength of Carrie Fischer - at least, not while playing a traditional princess. Maybe this perfect cast was assembled by sheer chance. (Lucas never replicated the feat, after all.) But so what? It's still a perfect cast. They all created memorable characters; and moreover, as characters and actors, interacted successfully with each other.Mos Eisley's spaceport was also a fortuitous accident. "Never will you find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy" - yet it managed to avoid being a thriving, respectable looking town largely because George Lucas didn't have the money to turn it into one. And a good thing too. It's possibly the most frightening place in the Star Wars universe: truly grimy, light years away from real civilisation, crawling with odd and touchy aliens.With art direction, special effects, and music, too, George Lucas struck gold. Has a science fantasy world ever looked better? Have special effects ever succeeded in making such a world look more real? Arguably not - although this isn't what makes "Star Wars" unique. Nor is the music (although the music is part of what makes it unique). No: there really is magic here. It sounds a cliché, but there IS something about the simple but honestly pursued story, or the world, or the score, or something, that lifts "Star Wars" high above by-the-numbers space opera - the same indefinable element that makes "Das Rheingold" more than a soap opera with occasional sorcery, and "The Lord of the Rings" more than the first of five thousand episodic fantasy adventures. This is the company "Star Wars" belongs in.If the film isn't quite up to the standard of the opera or the book, well... maybe that's because it found its way into such company by accident. It belongs there all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this for the first time in years recently, and was hugely disappointed.The acting is abysmal - it would've been better to go over the top and ham it up, as in a film like in Flash Gordon. The script couldn't possibly have taken longer than 20 minutes to write: I know it's supposed to be a "simple tale of good and evil", but that's no excuse for completely omitting a plot.To give it some credit, some of the sets look good (especially the interior of the death-star) and Darth Vader livens things up a bit whenever he's on screen.How this film has taken on the aura that it has is one of the many phenomena of modern life that beggar belief (like the popularity of mobile phones).Incidentally, I was a 13 year old boy when the film came out in 1977 (a perfect age for being hooked, you would think), but I don't remember liking it much then either.</fullReview>

That was when I was 10 years old. I'm now 19 and I still think A New Hope is not the best out of the 3.

		<fullReview>No, I am not a STAR WARS fanatic. I have seen it a few times, we own it (the original, not the re-release version), and I even saw all three movies at once in New Jersey about 5 or 6 years ago. And I'll certainly see THE PHANTOM MENACE when it comes out. But I don't own the toys, I didn't see the re-release versions, and I don't think it's the greatest movie of all time (I can't say on sci-fi because I always seem to end up arguing about semantics, and I haven't seen that many anyway).The special effects are good for its time, but special effects alone don't make a movie. This is a fairy tale, as many have pointed out, but it's rather a clinical-looking one. Some of the characters are one-dimensional. Mark Hamill was a little too green as Luke. And I can sympathize with Harrison Ford, who reportedly told Lucas, "You can write this s---, but you can't say it," as some of the dialogue is wooden. Maybe I needed to grow up on old serials like Lucas did.Having said that, the story is generally compelling, Ford and Fisher are good, and there's nothing wrong with simple if it's done well, which this is. For people who blame this for what it left in its wake, PSYCHO has inspired more rip-offs than this, and it was inevitable movies would become more product than art, this just happened to be the trigger for it. Another one would have been in its place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>okay-but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that I did enjoy Star Wars. But only for the entertainment of it. The film isn't some kind of "high art" or something. The best sci-fi film out there is by far 2001. Then Dr. Strangelove. Star Wars isn't sci-fi. It's part western, part myth, part legend. But not sci-fi. It's not a pioneer in special effects. 2001 is. Whoever said that "nothing in the following years is better" is wrong. I believe you said that Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark were not better. That's your opinion, but Jaws was made before Star Wars. I like art films. 2001, Psycho, The Godfather. My favorites. And, although I enjoyed Star Wars, it is not correct to call it the greatest film ever. The acting is horrible, and the characters are lame. Han Solo is the only good character (besides Anakin, and maybe Obie-Wan) because he is flawed. Luke is barely flawed, and the few flaws he had disappeared within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. Leia isn't flawed at all. Good characters are flawed, severely. Norman Bates (Psycho), Micheal Corelone (The Godfather), The Human Race (2001: A Space Oddyssey). All flawed. Great stories have flawed characters. It's always been like that. Anyway, that's my two cents.-LMAN</fullReview>

I'm so relieved to find other IMDb user comments along the same lines, to find I'm not the only one!....My name is August 4 and I am a Star Wars dissident! Is this SW thing some kind of contagious delusion, mass-hysteria or pseudo-religious fervour? Why do I feel as if I'm some kind of heretic? I love fantasy movies and became a cine-junkie back in the mid-seventies when the new breed of blockbuster was born. Sure I saw Star Wars, sure I enjoyed it. I even preferred The Empire Strikes Back (though Jedi is at best a rehash of the first two movies for the under-fives.) I think I've gone a little way towards qualifying my stance. I like the movies, really, I do! But can someone explain this madness to me? I'm so far past this obsession it brings me down to see the stuff everywhere, always, without respite, EVER. The toys, the gadgets, the books, the re-released soundtrack sets, the re-released video sets, the bed linen, the computer games.... On top of this, people around me greeting these things with enthusiasm, even excitement. PLEASE, SOMEBODY HELP ME! For me, the films have always lacked a certain something; passion perhaps, a deep emotional involvement. Star Wars never hit me in that place that makes a movie something personal and enduring. The Dykstra / ILM special effects leave no space for imagination. It's all about technology, never beauty. That opening shot of the Imperial Star Destroyer going overhead has always left me unmoved, (this blasphemy alone would be enough for certain buddies to kick that chair out from under me!) even at the age of 10 when I saw it the first time round. These days I've moved onto movies with a bit more of an emotional kick. I'm still a dreamer, but I prefer characters to be defined a bit more clearly and the technology to be a bit more blurred. Beguiling as the trailer for The Phantom Menace looks, I think the SW franchise is on the brink of being devoured by SFX. I hope it's brilliant, but even if it isn't, prepare for it to be around FOREVER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where The Whole Thing Started - For Some Inexplicable Reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A confession right off the top: I'm not a Star Wars fan. This original came out when I was a teenager. Everyone was so into it that I finally had to watch it. I did. And I didn't like it. I realize that puts me very much in the minority, but - whatever - I just didn't like it. I was totally bored with it for the most part and I've never watched it or any of its sequels (or prequels) since, until I rewatched this just a few days ago. My brother in law decided that my daughter had to be introduced to the Star Wars phenomenon, so he brought the DVDs of those first three movies over and we sat and watched the first one. My daughter's 11 - and wise. She agreed with me. "Do we have to watch the other two, dad? I was bored." "Yes, honey, your uncle brought them over to watch with us, so we'll watch them when he's over." So, eventually, I'll get to watch "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." I'm as enthusiastic as my daughter.So, to this movie. I was still bored with it. It has one of the least interesting beginnings I've ever come across. It's a struggle to watch the first hour or so. And once the action really starts - it's just a gigantic space battle, and I just don't buy that good old Luke Skywalker can go from farm boy to ace fighter pilot like that. And really you have to mix in some pretty weak performances - especially from the two main leads. There's a reason that Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher never really did much after Star Wars. They're just not that good! Harrison Ford is the only one who managed to turn his role in this into a big-time acting career - but, let's face it, most people remember him as Indiana Jones and not Han Solo. Granted that George Lucas got some big names in this - Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. But the newer, younger crowd of actors just wasn't that good. And then there were the aliens. Some of the worst looking aliens I've ever seen - especially in the bar scene in Mos Eisley. I really loved the alien who looked like a green-ish burlap sack with bright buttons sewed on for eyes. Add on some ridiculous dialogue and irritating droids who get far too much of the ridiculous dialogue to top it off.Those are things that stand out for me that just didn't work for me. I'm not dissing "Star Wars" completely. There were some good things about it. Give George Lucas credit for imagination. This was a very interesting and imaginative universe he created. And the space battles were pretty well done - I just thought there was too much of it. And let's face it - Darth Vader has become an iconic character; one of the greats in Hollywood history. Everybody knows Darth Vader - whether they like Star Wars or not. And "the Force." Who doesn't know about "the Force." Something has worked well when characters and other things get sealed in the popular imagination. And I admit again that I am in the minority. You can't deny that Star Wars has become a cultural phenomenon. I may not understand it, or buy into it, but I can't deny it. To some extent, it really re- invigorated what had become a tired concept - space-based sci-fi. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that "Star Trek" - which was being planned as a TV relaunch as I understand it - actually ended up appearing on the big screen not long after the amazing success of "Star Wars.") So Star Wars changed a lot of things and created a legion of fans that lasts to this day. I can't deny any of that. And yet, I still can't bring myself to really like this movie. But since I can't deny its impact and importance - it gets a 5/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can imagine that the first Star Wars was impressive for its time, and how it managed to become instant pop culture icons is understandable. For its time. As someone looking back and watching this in 2015, it's certainly a good movie, but it has its laughable moments. The first scene, all the lasers conveniently miss their targets, there are some comedic death scenes (that were not intended to be so) and the aliens are obviously puppets - no ifs ands or buts about it. But despite these goofs in the film making (which you have to remember, this came out in 1977 - but I'm judging it from a 2015 standpoint), it's genuinely a good movie. The plot sets the precedent for the epic saga that will come afterwards. Original, iconic characters like Chewbaca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Jabba the Hutt are unforgettable. The "childlike" charm of Luke Skywalker and the interplay between the haughty and arrogant Han Solo, as well as as the bantering between droids C3PO and R2D2 give the film enough comedic relief to make a film about galactic civil war more "down to earth." Although I personally enjoyed Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi more, A New Hope is still good and one of the better films in the saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now with the kinda enormously anticipated Force Awakens premiering this Friday, I decided to chat about the film that started it all, Star Wars? from 1977. And even though I very much enjoy this movie, I will not shy away from the flaws. Anyways lets blastoff!!! (Yes that was corny, but I'm in the mood right now so shut up.)So first thing I want to talk about is the story. The story of a young farm boy being sent on a quest to save the princess and the galaxy from an evil overlord. While the story isn't anything new compared to today's science fiction films, it does have a timeless feel in how its presented. Its also pretty interesting the fact that the story took inspiration from old samurai films.The characters are probably the most iconic thing about this film, besides maybe the story or soundtrack (which is freaking excellent by the way.) We all know them, the whiny Luke Skywalker who learns to mature, the wise old Obi-Wan Kenobi, the awesome Han Solo, the strong and determined Leia, the sinister yet captivating Darth Vader, the?.Chewbacca, every character is instantly recognizable and you remember them all. Though one thing I should point out is while the characters are good, the acting at times could be pretty bad. Not all of them, Alec Guinness is great as Obi-Wan, but some of the others aren't all that great.One other thing about this film that is iconic are the effects. When they were making Star Wars they actually had a pretty small budget, which is more amazing when you think about how revolutionary these effects were, they were so revolutionary that this film practically created CGI with the blaster and light saber effects. Even though not all of the effects hold up today, there are still some really good effects considering nowadays. Even the some of the hokey effects I can forgive since the movie's budget was pretty constrained.Even though, like I said before, I do enjoy this movie, I do have some issues. One thing I talked about already was the acting. Another thing is that looking back at it, the first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie are really slow, and this might be just because I am used to movies having a more faster paced story, but I did feel really uninterested at this point. Also, while I said that the story does feel timeless, it does have a lot of ridiculous moments. A famous example being the Death Star having a small hole that if you shot into would cause it to explode. Also when the fight at the Cantina starts, its just because some guy saw Luke and "didn't like him". And even though the Death Star battle is iconic and entertaining, it is very overblown and cheesy at times.Even with the flaws I have with it, I do appreciate Star Wars for doing something that hadn't been done before at the time, and in the process created blockbusters and sci-fi films as we know it.Final Score: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still fun after all these years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to watch this movie almost every day in the summers when i was a kid. Some of the scenes are pure nostalgia for me (like when Luke looks at the purple sky and that beautiful theme from composer John Williams starts playing). But episode IV was never my favorite installment after I saw the latter two. I was always surprised how much people loved it. It's a good introduction to the Start Wars saga. You learn the basics about the force, the jedis and are introduced to the colorful characters. The dialogue is fun and the movie has a classic "hollywood adventure" feel to it. However, the battle scenes are really cheesy bordering on stupid especially the fight between Vader and Kenobi. The last 30 minutes of the movie when they destroy the death star are just agonizingly boring for me, I never liked that part even as a kid. But all in all, a worthy film and now I'm looking forward to re-watch the other ones to see if still like them. Oh and the restorations are terrible and I wish I could find a version without them. I think CGI has arguably ruined modern cinema (at least the films that over-indulge in it and don't seem to understand how unrealistic it is).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Galacitc Game Changer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Warning! Spoiler Informatio...(Nevermind)***After Interviewing with every possible production company on the planet, George Lucas pitched his "Space Opera" script to 20th Century Fox. The absolute bare minimum of capital was pledged , and in 1977 Star Wars was released.Luke Skywalker is an orphan farm boy, raised by extended family. Completely unaware of his true identity he comes of age in short fashion. After the brutal Empire murders his Aunt and Uncle, He enlists in the rebellion , with training from a mysterious Jedi. Ben(Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) , and mentor ship from a rogue smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford).A magnum opus for the genre of Science Fiction, in its own right Star Wars was released as a stand alone.It was not till shortly afterwords its writer George Lucas realized it was one of many. Sequel or no Sequel, Star Wars instantly transformed the cinematic world, Becoming the highest grossing film ever made, until topped by E.T.(1983). The acting of a relatively unknown cast (at the time) , is spearheaded by the talents of Sir Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing. Cushing an actor himself publicly criticized in his early career for "squandering his considerable talent on the untenable genre that is Fantasy and Horror film". I can only hope who ever wrote that saw the movie.The Effects were revolutionary though fairly basic for today's crowd. they are how ever a foundation that has quietly worked to create a new breed of film stock (both visually and auditory). As nothing was done with computers in this time the modeling department was understandably "out of this world".The Writing is precise and at the same time morphic. A brilliant blend of inter-cultural interpersonalism that survives political trending and popular opinion shifts. What appears to be a simple space epic , yields a cultural consciousness shift that is still felt today.There is a reason everyone has seen it. If, by chance you have not , do.Three Stars(of 5.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of film, a must see for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This films is probably the definitive scifi film. Winning 6 Oscars for its visuals and famous score by John Williams. Anybody who doesn't know the theme song must be hiding under a rock for the last 37 years. The film over the years has collected one of the largest fan bases for many reasons which I will now elaborate on.The film as I already stated won 6 Oscars (all deserving) for its groundbreaking visual effects. In 1977 this film broke through the glass ceiling completely with visual effects. Not only that but it goes on to become one of the best and most well known films of all time and creating a trilogy that is only possibly matched by lord of the rings (maybe). The film also created some of the most memorable characters of film history human and non human. Just to name a few Darth Vader, Chubacca (I think I'm spelling that right), Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and the list goes on and on. Almost everybody whether you've seen the film or not you've heard of these characters at the very least.This film did not just gain this notoriety without reason, it has this reputation because it is indeed one of the most groundbreaking films and is on its own one of the greatest films of all time. If you haven't seen this film then what are you waiting for, you need to see this movie. Not everyone will like it, all films has its group of haters but for the majority this is an outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see it again movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars episode lV is a subgenre to the genre of action films, other action films in this subgenre are star trek and space odyssey. George Lucas took space adventures and space travel to the next level of film fantasy, and was such an inspiring pioneer. Star Wars episode IV is a typical genre film that is shot digitally with incredible special effects. Star wars episode IV is based on the rival between the good and evil of the force, and how mankind once again must rely on the good of the force to protect the galaxies from Lord Vader and the dark side. George Lucas is a master of film editing and uses so many techniques in this film from fade in fade out, dissolve, establishing shot, shot/ reverse shot, eye line match, and fast cutting. Every scene seemed to flow smoothly from each sequence, and I felt so drawn into each scene that I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scene. Sound effects used in this film were incredible and extremely effective from the sounds of Lord Vader breathing you could just feel the power in his voice, and the sounds of the light sabers when battling. The sounds of the battleships and voices of Chewbacca, RC3PO, R2D2 and other characters were so real meaningful to their parts in the film. The music in the film had such a dramatic impact and theme in the film such as scenes with Lord Vader and the dark side. I felt that the music had such a mysterious tone that it gave me a sense of fear when shots and scenes of the dark side shown. The way Gorge Lucas used sound to each shot and scene was remarkable, because every sound had some meaning and made the scene come to life and so realistic. The sound effects I felt were synchronous sound and diegtic sound, and what drew me deeper into each sequence. When it comes to cinematography George Lucas was the pioneer of digital photography. I have the same feeling that George felt for digital photography it brings more clarity and realism to each shot. George was able to create films sets in digital photography that he couldn't have done using film. The film used many techniques from tight framing, loose framing, and symmetrical composition. Camera perspectives such as deep focus and zoom shot helped make the digital shots more to the mind of the viewers. Camera positions such as bird's eye view, eye level shot, and low angle shots made scenes more powerful and dramatic. I feel camera distance was a major focus on each shot because George wanted to give viewers the sense that they were right there in the scene. Viewers could see the details in every costume, set design, and how life like each subject looked. George used close up shots and medium shots on subjects when battling or in conversations. Extreme to long shots used when showing the Death Star battle cruisers passing by and the conflicts with the Galactic fighters. Camera movement such as panning, crane shots, and hand-held shots were incredible smooth between each shot and scene. I believe that the cinematography and sound brought the other aspects of the film together. I feel George Lucas wanted to create a film that reached out to all individuals by giving the power of imagination in space travel. Star Wars episode IV gives you hope that good will conquer evil, and if you believe in your inner self that anything can happen. All mise-en-scene of this film was done with high detail and a deep imagination. It is this detail and imagination that sticks in the minds of children and adults for generations to come. I have never enjoyed a film so much or was drawn into the film as much as Star Wars episode IV film. This film is a must see for the whole family and gets a two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of modern science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I'd like to state that this is my first review, and to apologize whenever it has some mistakes.Star Wars is considered, as written in the title, "Masterpiece of modern sci-fi". That's true; This movie is a division point between the Kubrick/Tarkovsky - like philosophical sci-fi, and the Cameron/ Scott - like action sci-fi. Many people consider it bad, because it's old and they say "looks fake". Now, I want to state that, yes indeed it doesn't have so advanced effects as the movies nowadays made, but confronting with both contemporary and latter sci-fi works, it's got outstanding effects (e.g. it won the Oscar for that). Don't want to spoil the story, will just say that it's what could make this movie a Fantasy- story in a science fictional setting.There are two editions traveling around the world: an upgraded with CG effects (Though many people say these add-ons are invasive I disagree) and an original edition from 1977. No complains for any of those.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is almost unbelievable to think that some people in this universe still haven't seen Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope. With the new set of Star Wars films coming out soon, we thought that we'd better enlighten those who have not yet witnessed the splendour of the original Star Wars movie where it all began a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.There's this young guy named Luke Skywalker (a youthful Mark Hamill). He lives with his aunt and uncle on a dusty farm in a backwater part of the galaxy where nothing much ever happens. Then, one lazy day, some dizzy Droids drop in, the sparky R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and pompous C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), who take Luke on a chain of events to meet Ben 'Obi-Wan' Kenobi (an immeasurably brilliant Alec Guiness) to embark on a quest to save Princess Leia (the delectable Carrie Fisher) that involves intergalactic upheaval, fierce starship battles, intense lightsaber fights, old, mystical religions being resurrected, planets being destroyed, some mean ass aliens, such as the kick-ass Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and super cool villains, including Peter Cushing (a malevolently ruthless Grand Moff Tarkin) and the iconic, fearsome Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) doing some serious rebel arse-whupping, all blending into a heady mix of space-based mayhem that gives you a maximum adrenaline rush.What makes the film work, for me at least, is the happy stitching together of various exciting film styles, such as World War II fighter plane films, cowboy movies Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is a typical Wild West gunslinger, and he has the jerkin to prove it!) replete with bar room brawls, swashbuckling knights and castle sword-fighting, which makes for bucketloads of searing adventure, neatly packaged into a shiny science fiction unit.In Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope (by the way, nobody really knows why George Lucas started the series with part IV to be honest, but it probably shows he had aspirations to mass market franchises from the very beginning ? very prescient George!) the action is relentless. This is in complete contrast to the newer Episodes I, II and III, where there are far too many laborious scenes at the galactic parliament involving many dull aliens making streams of dreary, unnecessary speeches, or tedious romantic interludes that mostly involve gazing wistfully out of large windows. Avoid all of that nonsense, and the hideously annoying Jar Jar Binks, and watch Star Wars: Episode IV ? A New Hope instead. It's packed full of the best action, the finest space battle sequences, the worst-aiming stormtroopers that any evil empire could ever hope to train, the weirdest robots and oddest aliens, backdrops to die for that are unique and timeless, and a complete film that will get your heartbeat racing and you wanting to sign up to the rebel resistance immediately after watching it. If you haven't seen it yet, use the force and see it now! It rocks! TL-R</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while I have what I think of as an out-of-the-body experience at a movie. When I use the phrase, I simply mean that my imagination has forgotten it is actually present in a movie theater and thinks it's up there on the screen. In a curious sense, the events in the movie seem real, and I seem to be a part of them. "Star Wars" works like that. "Star Wars" is a fairy tale, a fantasy, a legend, finding its roots in some of our most popular fictions. The journey from one end of the galaxy to another is out of countless thousands of space operas. Star Wars" taps the pulp fantasies buried in our memories, and because it's done so brilliantly, it reactivates old thrills, fears, and exhilarations we thought we'd abandoned when we read our last copy of Amazing Stories.The movie relies on the strength of pure narrative, in the most basic storytelling form known to man, the Journey. All of the best tales we remember from our childhoods had to do with heroes setting out to travel down roads filled with danger, and hoping to find treasure or heroism at the journey's end. We get involved quickly, because the characters in "Star Wars" are so strongly and simply drawn and have so many small foibles and large, futile hopes for us to identify with. And then Lucas does an interesting thing. As he sends his heroes off to cross the universe and do battle with the Forces of Darth Vader, the evil Empire, and the awesome Death Star, he gives us lots of special effects, yes -- ships passing into hyperspace, alien planets, an infinity of stars -- but we also get a wealth of strange living creatures, and Lucas correctly guesses that they'll be more interesting for us than all the intergalactic hardware.Seeing the film the first time, I was swept away, and have remained swept ever since.</fullReview>

So why did I liked this movie: Well it has an original, and gripping story, that now everybody knows, it has great acting,and special effects that blew my mind completely, and that today (In My Opinion) look better than most CGI crap today. It had great characters Han Solo, and Darth Vader, are my personal favorites, and finally it was a lot of fun without being childish, and overall It is still just as great as I remembered it was.Now I won't into much detail about this, but......

		<fullReview>There are Star Wars 'fans' who complain about the difference in quality between the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. The truth is that there's not much difference between them. All SW Episodes are pulpy effects-driven space operas with not much originality or acting talent.Of course the prequels lack certain elements that the originals have, but the same is true vice versa. People who constrain their enthusiasm to Episodes IV, V and VI should not be called Star Wars fans, but Star Wars original trilogy fans, or Star Wars fundamentalists.As for myself, I also think that The Phantom Menace is the least of the Star Wars Episodes. But that doesn't mean I can't enjoy it. Unlike the two sides of The Force, Star Wars isn't just good or evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope is an outstanding movie with a very well developed storyline, a talented cast and likable characters that will forever withstand the test of time. The Star Wars franchise begins here, and though effects may have improved immensely since this film, it still holds up very well as a beautiful movie that I never grow tired of, people always question what order you should watch the series in, I suggest you start here, it's a light hearted and fun story that kicks off the series perfectly. The cast are all fantastic, each actor delivering an iconic performance, my favourite would have to be Harrison Ford as the witty and sarcastic Han Solo, probably one of the most well written sci-fi characters there is and he suits the role perfectly, James Earl Jones' voice-over work as Darth Vader is also one of the most memorable in film history, the actors always play a large contribution to a films success, and it was all great casting decisions made here. Watching this movie is like watching a piece of film history, every scene is in some way noteworthy, whether it be a well known line, music or just a characters action, no moment goes unnoticed. Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope is a must see for all sci-fans and moviegoers alike. Luke Skywalker as begins Jedi training with some help from Obi Wan Kenobi and meets up with some unique characters in order to defeat the Death Star, battle Darth Vader and rescue Princess Leia. Best Performance: Harrison Ford</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to rate this, cos I was in the theatre, on the first DAY that star wars was shown in San Diego. It had already gotten a kind of limited run, so there was a slight buzz about the film (And I mean Film, not Digital Medium).But still nobody in the SOLD OUT Theatre knew what was going to happen next. We see this little Space Ship flying by, Oh, look at that, it's being chased. Then we see what it is being chased BY, the Star Destroyer FILLED the screen.From that moment on, we are all in a kind of Fugue. We were caught up in the story being told, the characters interested us, even that original Bar scene that Lucas said he hated, it was fantastic, it was like nothing else ever imagined on screen. And finally, these Rebels, we don't understand what they are rebelling against, except that it is "The Empire" and that it's BAD - And NOT Explained-These Rebels are being attacked by a huge World-Sized Space Station. It was something nobody had seen before, the dimensions were incalculable. And Oh yah - There was this thing that gave our hero, Luke Skywalker, a kind of Edge - The Force. We didn't know what it was, and it was not explained by the "Old Man" of the movie Sir Alec Guinness: It was a MYSTERY.And so it all led up to "The Trench Battle" - WHich was visually and creatively the most intense thing anyone could experience. By sitting in that Theatre, we all were WITH Luke in his X-Wing and what he saw, We saw.It was an incredible experience for me, one that impacted me. So, I had to see it again... And Again and Again and Again. Five Times I saw it, and my friends who I had gone with also came back, and brought new friends. If the IMDb Demographic had been done in 1977, it would have been, 90% to 95% 10/10.People forget this, and younger people, they just never knew it. This Movie affected the WORLD.And Star Wars, as it was called back then, stayed in the theatres to SOLD OUT SHOWS - Every show! For almost a YEAR.Trying to explain this to people who politely "like" Episodes I through III - Well it is impossible, because they were never there. Had they BEEN there, they'd have to agree with me, because it is not me, it is History. Perhaps, there is some Data Bank in Hollywood that shows how LONG Star Wars ran and how many people went to see it during that time. I challenge any person who insists that Episodes I through III are "good."Because, we're not talking about something that was JUST "good" - People did not discard their Tight Budgets of 1977 just to go see a Movie up to 60 times. I knew one person who saw it 100 times.And because it was expected to be a FLOP - There were no TOYS made in time for the showing of the movie. So, Kenner gave people "vouchers" - Which they could redeem when they finally caught up with Production Demands of Hans Solo action figures. I have, a Luke Skywalker Action Figure of that time. It is not special, except that it is rare.George Lucas went with "No Name" actors for the characters he had created. Except for one guy: Sir Alec Guiness. All of the acting was good, because the story was good. It was more the Gestalt of the whole-The young actors, the incredible visual effects which were used to propel the STORY forward ? the satisfying resolution... Oh the Explosion of the Death Star was satisfying in So many ways, and the "Special Edition" ruins even that by adding the "Praxis" explosion from Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country.The release of Star Wars even affected the look of Star Trek, when a Motion Picture related to THAT show was released in 1979... Gone were the streamlined look of all the ships from the TV Show, the Klingon Ships had visible windows, tanks, portholes, hatches... All due to the look of spaceships in Star Wars.You cannot compare episodes I-III to this, even if I am wrong and they are "good" movies - Because Star Wars the Original was not just a "good" movie, it was world class. It made statements for Conservatives, it made statements for Liberals. It made statements for Religious People, it made statements for Atheists. It made statements for people who read Science Fiction, and it made statements for people who read The Bible.So, I cannot accept that Episodes I through III are in any class related to this, the original and unbeatable story of Luke, Leia, Han and Obi-Wan.The Original Trilogy was American Mythos Created and Personified, the Second Trilogy was UnMitigated Garbage and Filth- And more importantly, an EXPLOITATION of the first trilogy - An exploitation designed for one purpose: To Generate MONEY. And that it did, much to my dismay. Because if you spend enough money, you can get people to believe ANYTHING. Just look at what happened in 2010 with the Mid Term Elections, all bought and paid for by Corporations. Which is exactly what happened to the Star Wars Franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The whole series is giving meaning to every one of the six films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To present the six episodes is of course a challenge. I will not present them one after another in any order (historical or chronological). I will make a few general remarks. First, why did the last three episodes come first? It was necessary for the suspense to remain intense about the only important element which is that Dark Vader is the father of both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, both on the side of the rebellion against the Empire. These three episodes were more naturalistic and they did not need the special effects, not possible at the time, necessary for the conception and shooting of all the artificial and very strange creatures of the first three episodes. The happy ending would have been ruined by our knowing the genetic filiation between the two young heroes and the arch-enemy of freedom and democracy. Dark Vader had to be black and dark right to the end for the surprise effect of his fathering the two young heroes to be effective. Then the first three episodes arriving afterwards in time did not have the same function they can have today when we watch the six episodes in chronological order. They created a frame of reference. It is the demonstration that the Republic can only fall because it is totally engulfed in corruption, red tape bureaucracy, the incapability to take a fast decision and to act promptly, the constant waste of time because of political maneuvering. On the other side, that of evil, swift and surprise attacks and violence are the rule. The Republic has been infiltrated to the top and the Force itself embodied in the Jedi order has been drowned in bureaucratic impotence. Then the dark side of the Force can easily convince and capture those who are suffering from that impotence and are frustrated by the refusal to act straight away. It is also necessary to think that those first three episodes that came last needed a technology that was not available before and that is the technical justification of the inverted order, though then the director plays on it and with it. Some of the scenes of these three chronologically anterior films are absolutely breathtaking and only because they use the full array of computerized effects. The race in the first film is amazing, the underwater world is fascinating and the clones and their war against the strange giraffe human species is phenomenal and were not possible without the late 1990s and early 2000s technology. And the battles would never have been that impressive without these special effects. Then we can wonder about the meaning of the whole series back in chronological order. A Republic dies in red tape bureaucracy and corrupted calculation and is taken over from the inside by the main leader who is an infiltrated putsch maker and his military coup is based on the full destruction of the only protection the Republic had, the Jedi order though this one had been made impotent by the red-tape dictatorship of the democratic Republic. The Empire that takes over is based on effectiveness, swiftness and the absence of any waste of time due to useless discussions. To the point of any decision taken by one man. Then you can speak of efficiency. But that Empire that is going to impose an absolute one-person dictatorship is not able to control the grass roots movements and the local dynamisms of all the planets and peoples of this galaxy. That's what the rebellion against this Empire needs to be effective in its turn. Underground rebellion and resistance. Yet they cannot succeed if they do not re-conquer the Force because the Empire is founded on the dark side of that Force and is embodied in the father of the main heroes and leaders of the rebellion. The Force has to be re-learned by Luke Skywalker in order to be able to face his father and defeat the emperor who is manipulating Luke's father. This Force is the only real defense and conquering power of any resistance against any dictatorship. Without a Force of that magnitude no resistance can succeed. But then the meaning changed completely from that of the last three episodes that came first and could appear as a simple metaphor of the rebellion against a dictatorship, hence a metaphor of the defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union for one. Later on when the first three episodes that came last were available, the meaning was no longer the same because history had changed in the mean time. The meaning then is that any democracy when it forgets it has to be fast and courageous in its decisions that should refuse red tape and bureaucracy will automatically fall in the hands of potential potentates or dictators. That is a common myth and political theme in the USA: the Roman Empire died after two centuries. Unluckily the Roman Empire was not the Republic of Rome and here Lucas is playing with our references. Are the USA a target of that decay of democracy? Yes indeed. That's the message today of this set of six beautiful films with great actors, even the perambulating carpet.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know this film. You know the characters. You know the music. Why is a review even being written? Star Wars: A New Hope revolutionized and forever changed the game for American cinema back in 1977, and stands tall today as one of the greatest films of all-time. Back in 1977, there was absolutely nothing quite like it: the blend of epic music, incredible sets, spectacular ahead-of-its-time special effects, superb action sequences, and an overall complete package of film-making that before and since has rarely ever been met. You are immersed in a totally different world in a totally different time period, and thanks to George Lucas and the talented staff behind him that obviously gave their all in this movie, Star Wars is one of the 15 best movies you'll ever see guaranteed. For the first time in history, you really felt like you were in an alternate universe in space (Hush 2001: A Space Odyssey fans, Star Wars didn't separate its audience from the subject with ridiculously sublime yet frustrating subtle imagery that never quite explained what was going on).Based loosely off of The Hidden Fortress (A Akira Kurosawa film) and the Hero's Journey outline of Joseph Campbell, Star Wars follows a simple farmboy (Mark Hamill) rising to become a major threat to a rising evil led by the sinister and heartless Darth Vader (Voiced by James Earl Jones). Along the way, he meets the self-centered yet reliable Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and a feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Basically, Luke's tale is a hero's journey, copying the same timeline that Campbell laid out for all writers to imitate. Written by George Lucas, it was a script that at the time was presumed to be impossible to imitate because of its lush settings, amount of visual effects needed, and of course, the mammoth sets required (See: Death Star).Luckily for all of us, they delivered. The biggest part of the movie (and the franchise) is how the special effects not only enhanced a scene and brought it to life, but also blended with the actors, actresses, and sets. The special effects were achieved in a variety of ways; whether it is small models (extensively used for the final battle), tricks with lighting, and motion control photography. Industrial Light and Magic, one of the top special effects studios in history, got its mammoth start here. Of course, you need good acting to bring the effects to life, and our main cast does a decent job even when the dialogue is less than satisfactory. Alec Guinness gives the best performance however as Luke's mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. Last but not least, let's praise David Prowse as the intimidating, powerful, and downright scary Darth Vader. Just imagine having him as your boss.How many other ways can I praise this movie? John Williams gives us the musical score of a lifetime as he combines soft, lighthearted music, with bizarre tunes (like the one in Cantina) and epic tracks that resemble (and outperform) the best of 18th century classical music like late Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. George Lucas, despite his modern-day reputation, established himself as one of the better directors of the 70s with a combination of epic shots with ever-growing tension and mammoth cinematography. While he didn't take the director's seat in the two accompanying sequels, A New Hope displayed his absolute love towards his creation.Bottom Line: So where would we rank Star Wars among the best? We have the acting, the talent, the special effects, the music, the sets, the pacing, the tension, the action, the costume design, and even the puppet work as among the best you'll ever see?especially considering the year it was made. Lucas created an entirely new world for everyone to see, and delivered it with amazing craftsmanship, precision, and detail. The techniques of Star Wars has been copied and mimicked ever since. Surely The Empire Strikes Back would practically perfect any insignificant shortcoming this film had to offer, but A New Hope was the beacon for blockbuster cinema. No longer were the movies establishing this higher-class reputation; Star Wars bucked a trend of huge Hollywood blockbusters with full intention of blowing you away quality-wise by any means necessary.The Annie Halls, Godfathers, Space Odysseys (your pretentious films full of dialogue, symbolism, and feeeeeeeeelings?) were now put aside because of your Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Aliens, Terminators, and eventually, your Pirates of the Caribbeans. I rank Star Wars as one of the 15 greatest movies of all-time simply because of its effect on cinema, usage of special effects, and execution of a hero's journey and execution of the handing of a villain. Name a villain that was even close as scary or intimidating as Darth Vader. Now name a movie that has a bigger effect on blockbuster cinema than Star Wars. Can't name one? That's because (aside from Raiders of the Lost Ark) there honesty isn't one. If you haven't seen this movie, it's because you are simply trying to avoid it. If you hate this movie, it's simply because you are trying to hate it. If giving Star Wars a 10 is morally, spiritually, and emotionally wrong, then I shall never want to be right.May the force be with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun but vastly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Star Wars remains a fun film, and its easy to understand the sense of nostalgia many viewers get when they re watch the film. Still its vastly overrated in my humble opinion. The story is simplicity itself, and is a bit slow to start. Gradually the plot develops finally ending in a rousing final battle. Harrison Ford remains the star of the show, and without his magnetic presence, the film would lose a lot of its appeal. There's also Darth Vader who remains an iconic villain to this day. George Lucas updated the Special Effects in the re-issue of Star Wars. This helps a lot as the original Effects have dated considerably. Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrison Ford Saves this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Star Wars" is a good movie, but it is nowhere near the cinematic masterpiece fans and the AFI claim it to be. It is an interesting and often exciting adventure story with elements of mysticism and Kurosawa flicks spun into a science fiction landscape. It's fun for a Saturday afternoon matinée, but it seems a bit silly to compare this movie to, say, "Citizen Kane" or "2001: A Space Odyssey." The acting is fair. None of the stars, with several big exceptions, wowed me with their portrayal of allegedly mythic heroes. Mark Hamill, as Luke Skywalker, still seems a little green around the edges, and is far from being a mature hero. Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher, also seems a bit immature as the "damsel in distress," and her acting is a bit wooden. No, the most intriguing character in this movie, and arguably the biggest star and electric dynamo of the "Star Wars" franchise, is Han Solo. He, unlike Luke Skywalker, is a fun guy to watch: a brilliant antihero with ambiguous morals who actually undergoes a moral transformation in the movie, from gruff space pirate to reluctant member of the Rebel Alliance. Ford clearly know how to make this character come to life. Unlike Luke, Han Solo is a macho man's man, a guy who's tough and not a pure hero. Ford's acting, unlike Hamill's or Fisher's, is the most convincing, most emotional, and the most fun to watch. It's no coincidence that "Star Wars" made a Hollywood A-list star out of Ford, rather than Fisher or Hamill, and that Spielberg and Lucas later chose him to be the title hero for the equally successful "Indiana Jones" movies. The reason Ford came out on top above all the others stars is that, well, he's just that good!Other actors who do well include Alec Guinness, as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and body-builder Daivd Prowse as Darth Vader. I think poor Mr. Prowse has not gotten the credit he deserves for donning the Darth Vader costume and making the role truly menacing. Sure, James Earl Jones is Vader's voice, but Prowse IS the man behind the mask, and he is just as responsible as Jones for making Lord Vader one of cinema's most iconic villains.Overall, this is a good movie, but again, not a timeless work of art for the ages. Watch it for Harrison Ford, who is one of the greatest action heroes of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part four of a great fantasy series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the fourth part of my essay on the themes and motifs of Star Wars.The first Star Wars film was released in 1977 and started not at the beginning of the story, but in the middle. A New Hope begins the series with the galaxy in civil war. The Republic has fallen into ruin and has been replaced with the Galactic Empire, which is opposed by the Rebel Alliance. The children of fallen hero Anakin Skywalker now take their place in the epic.One of the most prevalent themes in Star Wars is the fallibility of technology and the conflict between technology and humanity. Nowhere is this conflict more evident than in the menacing villain Darth Vader. Horribly disfigured in Episode III, he is kept alive only by a mechanical suit. Yet, enslaved as he is by technology, he is very much aware of its limits. He chides an imperial officer, Admiral Motti, over his pride in the Death Star super weapon: "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force." This statement is further reinforced at the climax when Luke Skywalker uses his humanity, as embodied in the Force, to destroy the Death Star when a powerful computer could not.Yet technology is not all bad in the Star Wars universe. The droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, are technological and yet they show more humanity than the film's human villains. In addition to Vader, these villains include dehumanized storm troopers hidden behind Nazi-style helmets and effete officers like Grand Moff Tarkin who are so detached from humanity that they think nothing of killing millions of people to make a political point. These acts of villainy remind us both of the events of the past and the ongoing events of modern times. Perhaps the best message to take from the film is the necessity of maintaining our unique humanity, even under the most dehumanizing circumstances.In 1977, few would have predicted that Star Wars, like the struck-down Obi-Wan Kenobi, would become a phenomenon "more powerful than you can possibly imagine." Ultimately it owes this legacy not simply to revolutionary special effects, but mostly to great story-telling and timeless, primal themes of humanity.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure that the true depiction of the film is shown as Hans Solo struggles with Data Vader. The true meaning lies with the local-ism of the film and the truth it brings to home in the fight to survive.The use of the animinitronics in the film allows us, the viewer to see the nature in its true context. As IvoryNaymex describes in the above comments incorrectly, Hans Solo is not a robot but a mere mortal similar to the rest of his kind.Many people try to distinguish the difference between kinds as a 'race' however I just feel it is a different look, like people with different coloured hair and funny looking clothes.I hope people are able to relate to this and correspond accordingly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Force Will Be With Us, Always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewing the might that is Star Wars, part of me wonders if there is even any point. You know that cliché review term, "what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before?". Should I pretend its 1977 and I'm just back from the movie theatre, If only I could have experienced it firsthand. With the hype underway for the upcoming The Force Awakens (don't let us down J.J!), I've been rekindling my love for Star Wars (the good trilogy, not the crummy one), so allow to be the zillionth person to give their own perspective on Star Wars.Before I had ever even seen Star Wars I felt like I had watched it before. You could probably recreate the film from parodies. It's hard not to get caught up in a five hour conversation about these movies, talking in depth about every single frame; these movies turn adults into big kids.I can't help by get tearful over the beauty of the original trilogy, whether it's the introduction of Luke Skywalker to the achingly beautiful John William's score, or Luke and Leia's scene in which they try to get away from oncoming Star Troopers by swinging on a rope over a drop, but not before she kisses him, such a classic image taken from any swashbuckler. The sights and sounds of lasers blasting or dog fights in space has a charm which I could never tire from. What makes the Star Wars universe feel so human, there is advanced technology but it feels used and it doesn't always function properly. Also I'll say it now and I'll say it again, CGI ain't go nothing on practical effects. Part of me doesn't want to know how they did these effects just to be keep alive the thought of "how did they do that?!". I can still enjoy the special editions despite the changes; it would take a lot more CGI to entirely ruin a film like this.What imagination or imaginations can come up with something so wonderful, which raises the question of just how much of genius within Star Wars can be actually credited to George Lucas? Is the guy an untalented hack who got lucky by being surrounded by talented people? It's disheartening to think the man may never have been the genius we all thought he once was, making the man as much of an enigma as the fictional universe he came up with.Is Mark Hamill's performance in the original Star Wars the greatest? No, but I feel it works in the trilogy's favour as his performances in Empire and Jedi are much improved just like how the character of Luke matured. But If I'm going to really talk about one Star Wars characters, it's Han Solo. Simply put, Han Solo is my favourite movie character of all time. He's badass, cocky, funny, has a legendary vest, is the most handsome man ever (no, really), every word of dialogue he utters I would frame and hang on my wall. Yes, he is God himself. Also what gives C-3P0 AND R2-D2 such a great dynamic? They're both robots and one is essentially a talking fax machine, either way, best robot chemistry ever. The other thing I love about Star Wars which like many things, was sorely missed in the prequels, is the entourage of British actors. I don't want to endorse typecasting, but it just isn't Star Wars without an imperial star destroyer on which every commander on board has an English accent. The confrontation between Obi-wan and Vader still remains my lightsaber duel in the series. Two old men, minimal movement, no music, choreography as basic as it gets, yet it is infinitely more emotional and substantial than Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen doing somersaults inside a volcano for five hours.Star Wars changed cinema, pop culture and the world as we know it for a reason. Something which has brought joy and happiness to myself and millions around the world (as well as much anger and despair). Many film snobs will dismiss Star Wars as the film which ruined cinema, helping being about the end of the New Hollywood era, which it total tosh. I could go on and on and on with this review, adding more to it like Lucas likes to add changes to his already existing films, but I feel the best way to review what Is one of the most talked about films of all time I too try and convey the sense of emotion and euphoria I get from watching such a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The force is strong with this one. *personal top 100*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it a '9', because I can't give The Empire Strikes Back an '11'! Star Wars (which for me this 'Episode IV' will always simply be) is a legendary, seminal story which was followed by a sequel which somehow managed to surpass it. 'Story' is indeed the word here. We are drawn in *right away* to the plot and characterization, both of which are rich yet crystal clear. Always 'story' feels foremost, from the plight of the rebels and Princess Leia at the outset, to the entwining destinies of the droids and 'farmer-boy' Luke on Tatooine, to the spectacular final battle between the forces of evil and the underdogs. A timeless story if ever there was. Movie-making technology blends seamlessly into the plot only to serve it.The same cannot be said of the prequels, which while having much to commend, are swamped by digital spectacle and action to the extent it feels like the makers are simply 'showing off' (I used a worse expression in my Episode III review). Modern CGI has 'upgraded' certain Episode IV scenes, notably Mos Eisley and Solo's meeting with Jabba the Hutt. However, the strengths of the movie remain its original ones. These are the parade of epic characters - Leia, Luke, Vader, C3PO, Obi-Wan, Han Solo, Grand Moff Tarkin - the script given to them, and the perfectly paced drama with which it unfolds. Harrison Ford, whose character of Han Solo gets no preparation whatsoever in the prequels, sweeps into Episode IV and all but takes over. Of course, these days everybody knows that he (Ford) is good, but watch them through in order: he's a striking phenomenon. It's not as if he didn't have competition: the casting of two British thespians, the noble Alec Guiness and the icy Peter Cushing, was inspirational.Finally, there's THAT battle, 'The Battle of the Death Star', which must rank alongside the Ben Hur chariot race and the raid of 633 Squadron as one of the monuments of cinema history. It is of course a rip-off of the latter, but it transposes it to the stars, and even improves on it dramatically. It is the perfect length, the perfect tension, the perfect climax. The impression of speed, the realism of the trench scenery and the sense of the sheer difficulty and peril those pilots faced was magnificent. It was BELIEVABLE, unlike so many of the CGI scenes in episodes 1-3. Also, the emotion of it: I wanted to weep for every one of them blasted to oblivion in a ball of flame. This is because there is somehow 'room' to care about them, so well are the cockpit shots done and so deftly does the script make our fleeting acquaintance with them.I need an excuse to score it only '9'. Well, if they must upgrade something, how about a digital spectacle of the apocalypse on Alderaan when it is zapped? Nevertheless, this is science-fantasy and cinema greatness. The force is indeed strong with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Father of the sci-fi genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the best movie of the science-fiction genre. I not only state this because I am Star Wars fan like millions of others around the world, but for many other reasons. Star Wars: A New Hope brought Hollywood up to a new level of visual effects. From the aerial views of Mos Eisley to the battle of Yaven, it's a masterwork in special effects.Additional to the visual works, the cast members were phenomenal in their roles. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is the perfect protagonist. Harrison Ford is awesome as the funny and cocky Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is simply great as Princes Leia. But the two best performances were Alec Guinness as the wise Obi-wan Kenobi and James Earl Jones as the chilling voice of Hollywood's most infamous villain Darth Vader.Star Wars has an original story of good vs. evil, but it is unique. It follows closely to the hero cycle: an unknown individual who loses everything becomes the galaxy's unlikely hero. The ultimate score by Hollywood's best composer John Williams not only sets the mood for the story, but it also makes it believable and uplifting. Also the other departments of editing, costumes, set-decoration and sound effects editing were all tastefully done.The movie maybe 30 years old, but I hold it as the father of all science-fiction movies. There's no way I can give this less than a 10/10.</fullReview>

Not only does it provide that excellent use of action and drama, but it features some of the most memorable characters to ever grace the big screen, excellent casting decisions, especially Harrison Ford as Han Solo, plus John Williams' score is incredibly awesome. Plus the visuals by Industrial Light and Magic, which was their first film, still hold up remarkably well for its time.

I liked the scene where Luke, Han Solo(Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) took out the StormTroopers. Then there's the Death Star battle. A real gem. When they showed the extra scenes later in the years, it's worth the watch even more!

		<shortDescription>Arguably the most important film in Sci-Fi history...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR WARS is, without a doubt, one of the most *influincial* films of its time (and perhaps even _ever_). When it was released, people began standing in line for hours in order to watch this movie for the fifteenth time -- something that had never happened before. STAR WARS changed the way we think about movies; it changed the way we market movies; it changed the way we think about sci-fi and fantasy in film; it killed the second STAR TREK series in pre-production at the time; it was important.Let me say that again: STAR WARS was important. That fact cannot be stressed enough. STAR WARS launched George Lucas into history, and created an industry legacy: ILM, THX, and so on. Suddenly, the idea that special effects needed to be of superior quality, and that the technology of movie making was something that needed to move forward became evident.STAR WARS was a "great" film in the sense that it was so important. But as a film, taken away from its context historically, it is not such a "great" film. The acting in many cases is sub-par; the dialog is painful to listen to at times; and Luke Skywalker has got to be the whiniest kid that ever lived (asside from, perhaps, his father, as it turns out).Still, STAR WARS stands alone as a fun, entertaining ride through the stars with an adventure that some fans, these days, can practically quote line-for-line.George Lucas has made some slight modifications to the film over the years -- the most note-worthy being the Han Solo-Greedo match-up. Although I am not really happy with that particular change, these are George's films and he can do what he wants with them. This makes George Lucas and his films unique in the industry: George really does not care if his films are popular, or if anyone likes them at all. Geroge makes movies for George to enjoy. We are all just along for the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such an overrated made-for-TV flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1977, I was able to go to the theater and go right into the theater in Kankakee, IL, and thought, "Wow! Everyone everywhere else is standing in line, and we got right in!" Then, two hours later, I was asking myself, "What the hell? THAT was what all the hoopla is all about?" I'd seen better science fiction flicks as a kid in the 50s.Prior to seeing it, a co-worker had gushed about it, and I asked him what it was about. He told me the plot, and when he got done, I asked, "And then...?" I thought he'd described the opening half hour. And he said, "That's the story. That's all of it." After watching it, I was still asking that question, "Where is the rest of the story?"The plot was simplistic, the dialog inane (when everyone thought that about the three new Star Wars episodes, they were in the majority), the characters really 'flat' and not very interesting. C3P0 and R2D2 as comic relief were just plain inadequate.To this day, I think people were just sheep, thinking that they had to say wonderful things about this movie, so they did. The amazing thing to me is that 30 years later, they are still not seeing this as the average B-movie that it is.Look, I LIKE Harrison Ford, and I LIKE the other actors in the movie, especially Alec Guiness. Okay, Mark Hamill wasn't Larry Olivier, but he is at least likable. And James Earl Jones has the best voice ever. But for this movie to be considered one of the best 20 movies of all time? Color me out of the mainstream. I agree with probably 8 out of the other 19 top-20 movies, so I must not be too freaking alien. Why is this movie given such status? I just don't get it.</fullReview>

Now, Star Wars (now retitled Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope) is one of the most inspiring films of all time. Being inspired by several old sci-fi stories, such as Flash Gordon, Star Wars may have suffered from several production problems, at the time, but that didn't stop it from being loved by everyone. I can agree with most people that this is one of the best sci-fi films of all time.The plot of Star Wars takes place a long time ago, in a far away galaxy, during a civil war. Rebel Spies stole plans for a secret weapon, from the Galactic Empire. The weapon is called the Death Star, which is a heavily armed space station that can destroy entire planets. Princess Leia, the leader of the rebels, was in posses with the plans, until her ship got captured by Darth Vader, lord of the Galactic Empire, along with an Imperial Force. Leia then hides the plans, as well as a holographic recording, that shows her requesting help from a man named Obi-Wan Kenobi for help (hoping that he would bring the Death Star plans to her home planet, Alderaan, and give them to her father), in the astromech droid, R2-D2, before getting captured. R2-D2, along with a protocol droid, C-3PO, escape on a pod ship, which lands on a desert planet, named Tatooine. There, they meet Luke Skywalker, who accidentally plays part of the recording, when cleaning R2-D2. The recording then leads him to a hermit named Ben Kenobi, who reveals himself to be the Obi- Wan Kenobi that the hologram was talking about, as well as a former Jedi Knight. After Obi- Wan and Luke view the full hologram, Luke decides to join Obi-Wan and learn to become a Jedi (specifically after his aunt and uncle were killed by Stormtroopers who were searching for R2-D2 and C-3PO). Obi-Wan and Luke, along with bounty hunter Han Solo, and his friend, a Wookie named Chewbacca, go to save Leia from the Death Star, whilst trying to protect the Death Star plans from the Galactic Empire.The best part about Star Wars, is its characters. These characters are so well developed, such as Luke, the main character of the film. Luke is a young man who wants to explore the wonders of the galaxy, and whilst he does become slightly whiny and immature, at first, the man eventually grows more mature, as the film goes along. The film also takes the time to build the relationship between the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke, up to the point where you can feel it as a close teacher/student relationship. Another character who I'd like to talk about is Han Solo. This guy is a badass, not only that, but he also starts out as someone who doesn't care about anything (well, he does care about his friend, Chewbacca), aside form his job, but eventually becomes more caring, during the film's runtime.The performances, whilst slightly dated and not the best that cinema has to offer, are still very impressive. Mark Hamill does a very strong job portraying the adventurous Luke, and gives some really good charisma in his performance. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, giving both a badass and charismatic persona to the character. Carrie Fisher can come off as slightly cheesy at times, but she still does a good enough job, as Leia, who is not just your typical damsel in distress. Alec Guinness is great as the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi, and shares great chemistry with Luke. In fact, the chemistry between all of the characters is fantastic, with some really witty banter between them. Darth Vader is excellently portrayed in this film, with a great physical performance from David Prowse, and an awesome and menacing voice performance from James Earl Jones. Both the physical and voice actors are so great at being menacing, that you fear Vader right from the very first scene he's in.Of course we can't forget to mention the special effects of Star Wars. What makes the effects so impressive is that, even though this is a 1977 film that uses practical effects, they still hold up well and look amazing today. The backdrops and set designs, whether it be Tatooine, the Death Star, just space itself, are all incredible looking, and the creatures, such as Chewbacca, and droids, such as R2-D2, all look very realistic. The action sequences, such as the opening shooting sequence, and the battle between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader are all entertaining, on their own, but George Lucas is fantastic at directing, by bringing so much energy and tension to this film.Overall, I don't think anything needs to be said about Star Wars, considering how revolutionary it is, but it's just that. It's a very revolutionary film. The acting,w whilst not perfect, is solid, the characters are all fantastic, the visuals are amazing, and the action is really fun to watch. If you haven't seen this film, then what rock are you living under?FINAL VERDICT: A+ (MASTERPIECE)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without Star Wars I have no idea where film would be today. I don't even know where our culture would be today, where I would be or even if the human race would still exist. Star Wars revolutionized science fiction cinema and movies in general, it inspired countless individuals and continues to do so today. It exploded in pop culture and it is one of the few movies I know about that you can pretty much still buy toys from at a regular Wal-Mart today, over 30 years after coming out.First of all, I don't care what anybody says, the effects still hold up and any practical effects of the 70's will always, ALWAYS be better in my mind than the digital crap that is modern Lucas cinema. That being said, the effects look dated, but still awesome, it is a part of Star Wars, the grittiness, the fact that it was done on a relatively small budget with little resources. I simply can't review Star Wars without mentioning John Williams score. One of the best music ever, not only for movies. John Williams is a modern day Mozart. The story is amazingly imaginative and draws you in every second of the movie. I love it.Star Wars is a nearly flawless movie, it's one of the greatest movies ever made and I love it. About the changes in the special edition: I don't hate George Lucas. How could I hate the man that created something that I love so much? Something that I grew up with? But what he did to these movie is simply unforgivable. Lucas has explained in interviews that he felt he was always held back by the technology at the time he made the original trilogy, so he went back and changed sooo much stuff. I'm not gonna talk about anything, but 1) Han shoots first, 2) Jabba is definitely NOT in A new Hope and 3) The CGI enhancements at Mos Eisley are simply terrible.Star Wars is an epic space tale about adventure, friendship, loyalty, good vs. evil and It's not just a movie. Star Wars is a part of our culture, it is a movie that transcends time and it is our responsibility to keep it in its original form for future generations to see. It built my entire moral compass and taught me the difference between good and evil, loyalty and why friends are so important. I love Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people will give kudos to George Lucas for this movie but I won't. It isn't really his movie and you can tell which movies George Lucas did vs. the ones he didn't because the ones he had too much control over sucked. This movie did not suck.OK. I'm not a fan boy. I saw this movie like a billion times back in 1977. I own the original copies of the VHS and refuse to own the DVD or Blueray copies. George Lucas is brain dead for making the changes that he did and Han Solo shot first.This movie is a great classic. It goes down and one of my top ten movies of all time. It has all the aspects of a great story even if there are a ton of bugs through out the script and special effects. I don't care, it rocks.Rebels vs. Goliath. Outerspace. The Force. Lightsabers. Aliens. Cool stuff!Why can't they make more movies like this?Because directors are constantly trying to please those who want profit over art.10/10 stars is not enough for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I knew all that was well in the galactic empire and Star Wars was back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as the Storm Troopers came in, through the slide-doors, after they blasted it with there 70's laser effects, and they emerged from the misty smoke of alien mist, I knew all that was well in the galactic empire and Star Wars was back!I can totally see the design of the Trooper's helmets being based on the Samurai Armour, because of the inspiration George Lucas got from Jidaigeki. A Japanese film genre, a western version of the Japanese films."Set lasers to Stun!", right from the Trek. Plans for the evil Empires Death Star (Destroyer of Planets) are in the possession of Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer)- shes passes them off to the two most lovable droids in film history, before Sith Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) finds &amp; prisons her.R2D2 and C3-P0 get off the captured star-ship with the plans and make it to the desert ridden planet of Tatooin. On the planet they are both captured and enslaved to the sand people, but by blind chance they get brought by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Thanks to sub-par R2D4. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) takes Luke and his new droid friends with him to make sure the important Death Star plans get to the rebels, and like his father he will teach him the ways of the force. The Republic order has been completely liquefied by the Emperor, he no longer holds a Council- he takes complete control, with his Death Star he controls the Galactic Empire like a dictatorship. The Death Star Captures Han-Solo (Harrsion Ford) &amp; his band of friends, Skywalker and his droids. After successfully escaping with Princess Leia. The most unexpected group of friends are the leading force in taking back the Empire and restoring The Republic.I wish I had watched the original, un-remastered film for this review, for my blog. It does not ruin the film but it reminds me of the prequels bad special effects. After Han-Solo is introduced in the the bar there's no need to review how brilliant this film is. With all the ingredients the film just goes on to excite, move and above all entertain whoever is watching,I hate to argue its re-storing, over and over, like a angered fan, but it takes away the filmmakers hard-efforts to make a film that was a hundred years ahead of it's time- those hard working men and woman efforts are dis-honored each time there's a pointless CGI alien in the background. The only thing good about the re-master was the infamous Storm Trooper who bumps his helmet on the slide-door that was just a little to low. They added a sound effect to it and a murmur from the victim, funny for once Lucas.One thing I like about the prequels, if thou adds them to the equation; R2D2 &amp; C3-P0 'know' everything; they 'know' Anakin is Darth and they had witnessed the fall of the Jedi and the termination of The Republic, they may have had there memory banks deleted but they were there to see it at least, a cool idea I thought.Only thing about the original films that angers me is that I was not there to be a part of the phenomenal sensation that spread across the world and language barrier. The new films Disney are pumping out to make Star Wars dough, wont even come close to generate that type of first-hand experience. It changed cinema, like many have before and many more to come.This Star Wars has a more faily tale story then the rest (saving the princess from evil or prison) Greatest moment, Obi-Wan realizes Luke is the chosen one not Anakin, in the middle of his battle with Vader. When he becomes a Force Ghost, so sensitive to his force, he denies Death and is able to live on.A brilliant film, Simply! It's impact, unspeakable, but strong, like the force. Why didn't the the Death Star shoot down the Millennium Falcon when it appeared first time, just another ship, Why tractor beam it in. Everyone has a geeky question, this film is better then questions, just enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A New Hope is a great movie,it's lots of fun but has interesting characters too. Han,Luke and Leia all have great chemistry together. Alec Guinness is wonderful as Obi-Wan. Watching this right after The Revenge Of The Sith really brought his performance to a new level. You can see all that pain he had is still there after 20 years. Han and Leia have a wonderful banter,it's hard not to fall for them right away. I do find the part with R2D2 and C3PO a bit tedious but other then that it's very well paced. The music is amazing and is so memorable. I'm not old enough to have seen this in theatres but I remember watching this on VHS many times. I loved Princess Leia and wanted to be just like her. Even watching this movie years later I still do! You really fall in love with these characters,even ones like Chewbacca,R2D2 and C3PO. The effects are still good today,some of it may look a little dated but none of it actually looks bad. This movie is a treat to watch.</fullReview>

Star Wars is the best thing ever. It has better ideas and creativity than any other movie since. It couldn't be greater! From the opening scene on, this movie keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. If you haven't see this movie, do so.

		<shortDescription>Space drama never started so well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope is a film that although now is the fourth in a franchise of a high earning series, is also the start of something extremely special and a film that starts it all well too. With revolutionary effects, great fight scenes and just a story on an epic scale, A New Hope is just one film that you will not forget easily and one that can make you fall in love with Star Wars. I liked even the actors who basically were all starting out and I found the movie to be strongly an amazing film, and here below is why so.The story is just so massive but in a 2 hour film, a lot of things go on but all things are resolved well to say it is just this one film with a lot of plot points. The story is also very interesting and you can't help but feel if you miss anything then you should rewind and see what happened because it can get a grip on you. The action quota is pretty good to say it isn't all about that kind of stuff, some great gun battles, space fights and of course the legendary lightsaber battles.Mark Hamill is just young Luke Skywalker in this and although he never takes the role to new heights in cinema, he still solidly commands it and never puts a step wrong. For me the real hit of this film is Harrison Ford as Han Solo with his cool persona yet also very edgy when aggravated, he delivers a performance that basically eclipses that of the main man Skywalker. Carey Fisher is good as Princess Leia and Alec Guinness also in his finest role in his older age, just shows how well some can act in Sci-Fi which is never seen to be always that well award winningly acted.George Lucas is just awesome in making this film with it's directing and writing and setting into motion a critically crazy franchise of films, he directs it perfectly and no other person could have made this even a little bit better, it is what it is. He also delivers so well on the screenplay and the actors say there lines with complete ease and how you would expect them to do it. The effects are just so brilliant for 1977 and work even in the future with modern effects, just beautiful sets to look at completely. If any criticism comes it's way, well, there isn't much to pick out if truth be told and if they are they are minor. I didn't think the film was perfect even if this review seems like I did so far and the reason I didn't is mainly because of the maybe slower parts toward the end of the movie where it can seem as if you have been worn out by all the things going but in all cases you shouldn't dislike it for doing that.If you want possibly the best Sci-Fi film ever then this is a true contender and to say I didn't find this flawless yet I did think it sensational then it goes to show how much more some will love this if they haven't already viewed it. I guess those who should stay away is anyone who hates an epic space drama really if that makes any real sense, you get the stereotypical people where one hates Star Wars and never wants to hear of it ever again after watching it and the other is in absolute love with it.Overall I found it Strongly a Sublime piece of cinema history and one I think will never be forgotten in the tapestry that is film. You know a lot of people see Star Wars fans as nerdy but I think anyone can love this even if they are not mega fans afterwards or anything like that, it is just good fun all round. Oh and one more thing to add is the comedy, the film is actually very funny in certain parts and really mixes up beautifully to create legendary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie changed my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever my friends ask which movie series is my favourite I will always answer Star Wars. Believe it or not A New Hope was the last Star Wars movie I watched. I guess it was never really on TV that much. But wow! This movie had the perfect balance of every element the characters, the action, the plot and all the emotion put into this. Yes I am one of those relatively new Star Wars fans as in I grew up with the prequels (which I do enjoy especially III) but the fact that this movie still impacted me even though it was released in 1977 really tells me how special this movie is. The hero's journey of Luke to the reluctant hero of Han who initially is only in it for the money, Leia who is an actual character not just eye candy, Chwebacca the great sidekick, R2 and C-3PO their comedy I really miss when watching the prequels again. Ob-Wan the wise old mentor who not only teaches Luke about this galaxy but us too. We must mention the villains of course. Darth Vader was menacing the moment we saw him on screen and Tarkin who I really hope his back story is done right in the upcoming novel by James Luceno.Just everything in this movie and yes this movie was groundbreaking in visual effects but to me the magic of this movie is in its characters and how we can all fall in love with them. George Lucas dared to dream when no one else wanted to at the time and in a way Star Wars reflects George's own coming of age and being free from the old Hollywood ways into the new. Star Wars will always be amazing to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Science Fiction and Money came together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember as a kid seeing one of the original commercials for Star Wars and I thought "I want to see that if anyone will take me.". I was 13 and did not drive yet living where the nearest theater was 10 miles away. My older brother took me and I knew after watching this movie in its first week of release that the landscape of science fiction had been changed forever. The success of the movie and franchise is now legendary as this launched the whole genre into one in which there was finally serious money being thrown at it after years of being subject to B movies with laughable affects. The special affect at the time were awe inspiring as they set a new bar for quality (even though they remade many with CA in future releases). For the era it was the thing for which it won awards, and specials were made on how they achieved such great special affects. By today's standards the original may be laughable, but the role the movie played in causing the genre to go main stream is what makes it stand apart as a part of movie history. Soon we had Alien and a series of high budget, good script science fiction to watch (along with those taking advantage of the new popularity). I remember thinking after The Empire Strikes back that this brought hope to my dream that someday they would make a series of movies that did justice to The Lord of The Rings. It took decades, but it came to pass. It was only a matter of weeks before there wasn't need for a whole lot of advertising for this movie as word of mouth launched it into history with its unprecedented success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the Emperor bequeathed "Let there be Science Fiction for everyone!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas, as entertainment maven, brought an appeal of science fiction to the masses in a way that the Beatles did for rock and roll. With a sustainable balance between cowboy action, science fiction mythology, cock-sure humor and groundbreaking visuals, Star Wars delivered. Weeks after the films' opening, I remember standing in line for hours among the events' full demographic spectrum. Looking at the film 37 years later, I can see where my suspension of disbelief and fickle patience with directorial re-releases has taken over. It's as if the geek inside Lucas' mind needed reeling in. The aliens are silly and the dialog about "womp rats" remains ridiculous. But for all that is and has been said, my entertainment continues through our main characters, on their personal quests which seemingly will again re-unite for another episode hauled in by the Disney Machine and their power. Has Star Wars now crossed over to the Dark Side? I'll take the family and find out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas' fairy tale has had more of an impact on me than any other film that I have ever seen. It was the first film I remember seeing, it stayed with me through my childhood and infused me with a passion for film that has never left me. To this day, I am a Star Wars fan and probably well remain forever after.Star Wars is a film that offers up a science fiction extravaganza containing elements we already know. Lucas offers a story that we can easily get comfortable with. He offers character types and gives them bold personalities: The callow youth, the hot-shot, the wise old wizard, the beautiful princess (in need of rescue, of course) and the loyal support of the muscle and the bickering comic relief. He offers a villainous enterprise not a million miles removed from the Nazi regime.&nbsp;He places his heroes in the path of overwhelming odds so that tiniest dot in the universe ends up making a dent in the&nbsp;villain's&nbsp;evil plan.For better and for worse, Star Wars would change the direction of American cinema. The decade had been ushered in by a new breed of rebel filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola, Robert Altman, Steven Spielberg who made personal films, small intimate films that didn't need a large budget. But when Jaws and Star Wars both became a box office triumph, Hollywood saw the box office potential and turned their intentions toward a large scale entertainment.What Lucas had that other filmmakers in this genre did not was an eye for detail. It is easy to hammer together a series of cardboard sets and have actors stand in front of them but to create a desert town populated by humans, aliens, creatures and droids packed into the background so that entire frame feels populated was something unheard of. He also created what has been called the "used future", realizing that automobiles in his fantasy world should look used and rusted and aged, not sleek and looking as it if were created before the camera was turned on. Note Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder which has a thick coat of rust and grime and a paint job that suggests it has spent it's entire existence sitting in the hot sun. Also note Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, a rusty hulk that seems hammered together from spare parts (the in-joke of the film is that the heroes keep noting how shoddy it looks even as it's saving their skins).As with all landmark films Star Wars was the right movie for the right time. It came along in the mid-seventies, in the midst of a wave of personal and gritty films like Taxi Driver, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, movies that were born out of the decade after the production codes had collapsed and filmmakers were free to tell real stories without persecution and nullifying censorship. It was Star Wars that put that kind of film out to pasture and in it's wake came the era of the blockbuster, when films for profit became the mainstay. For well and for ill, it changed the Hollywood mindset and moved the industry toward more fantasy oriented fare, an era we are still experiencing.For Lucas,&nbsp;making the film&nbsp;was an uphill battle because, at the time, science fiction was considered box office poison.&nbsp;The most prominent sci-fi was Kubrik's 2001: A Space Odyssey, a film that had more detractors then fans.&nbsp;The studio feared that the same reaction would meet Star Wars and had so little confidence in it's success that they set up a tax shelter for when the film flopped.&nbsp;The distributor couldn't get theaters to buy the film unless they sold it as a package deal with a movie that they thought was destined to be a blockbuster - The Other Side of Midnight - Heard of it? Me neither.Yet the film did succeed, mostly due in part to Lucas' decision to make the film his own way.&nbsp;He broke the rules by eliminating traditional opening credits (he paid a fine for this and then dropped out of the Director's Guild). He announces that the story takes place in the past but look like the future.&nbsp;He starts in the middle of the series (this is Episode IV) progresses his saga forward then turns back and tells the preceding story up to the point where this film begins.&nbsp; By starting in the middle he develops a story that already has a rich history with characters that are fleshed out to the point that we are always interested in their relationships.&nbsp;He develops a warrior spirit that is passed on from one generation to the next, from an old wizard Ben Kenobi, who is the keeper of a dying zen religion - The Force - that favors patience and a clear-head over mindless violence.&nbsp;He imparts it upon the young Luke Skywalker, a callow youth hungry for adventure that we only slowly understand is the one who will bring about the end of the Nazi-like Galactic Empire.&nbsp;The friends he takes along on his journey start as bold character types (a hotshot loner, a loyal dog-like companion, a feisty revolutionary&nbsp;and a pair of bickering robot who provide the comedy relief) but eventually their personality become more refined and we care about their journey.&nbsp;Lucas was generous in these details.Star Wars is a pure movie-going experience, a red-blooded adventure that takes the elements of it's genre seriously.&nbsp;Many films&nbsp;have matched it's success in dollar amounts but none has had the cultural impact. It has become part of our language.&nbsp;Like The Wizard of Oz, it propels us on a journey of such joy and imagination and has worked it's way so firmly into our popular imagination that we can hardly imagine our culture without them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a young 6 year old boy, I was intrigued and fascinated with the special effects and epic dramatic fashion this movie presented. I was an instant fan and captured a filmmaking bug that also translated into photography and radio production. I not only became a fan of the Star Wars franchise, but as I got oder, grew more and more interested in the mind and imagination of George Lucas. I also saw growth of the acting career of Harrison Ford, who became one of my all-time favorite actors. Although there are many loyal fans of Star Wars who detest Star Trek, as I was when I was young, I grow an appreciation for the ground breaking steps the Star Trek TV Series took to inspire directors like George Lucas. I can honestly say that without Star Trek, there is no Star Wars.</fullReview>

It is a big adventure with great and memorable actors: Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, James Earl Jones, Peter Cushing, and Sir Alec Guinness.The Blu-ray disc is magnificent, and the only true way to watch this at home.

		<fullReview>Having seen the Star Wars movies, I am very familiar with the concept of them and I don't think it works as a SciFi movie, and because the action in the movie "plays second fiddle" to the storyline, it can only work by the standards of a SciFi movie. Therein lies the problem. You see, a SciFi movie has to be somewhat grounded in reality; people have to be able to identify enough with the characters in order to put themselves in their places in order to enjoy a storyline about extraordinary technology. However, in the movie, because the characters and events are set, "a long time ago in a galaxy far far away," that implies that the events in the movie have nothing to identify with.The audience can't try to relate the movie with their lives. They can't ask questions like, what if these things really were to happen? As a person with x attributes, how should I feel about this movie? What types of lessons should I learn from this? Without a story being grounded in reality, all of this is lost and becomes nothing but meaningless dribble (which would be fine if that's what it was supposed to be.) It's like making a comedy to poke fun of something that doesn't exist; no one would be able to identify with it so no one would be able to laugh at it.In short, Science Fiction isn't good fiction, unless there's there's science fact for it to contradict and/or exaggerate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas could have done the world a favor and let Darth Vader die at the end of A New Hope. I was 31 in 1977 and, though I thought the film was okay, I was not swept away like the kids. I thought much of the dialogue was stiff and unemotional. Carrie Fisher had little if any charisma. Harrison Ford was the only one who did. The weird names and bizarre creatures are hard to digest after a while. Star Wars plots are inconsequential. Only nerds, dorks and geeks know them. It is the characters we remember: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, C3PO, R2D2 and Chewbacca. My favorite may be Obi-Wan. He is the one with perseverance, the one who waits years to set things right. Ultimately, he sacrifices himself for the cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest movie series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the summer of '99, the star wars films have had a huge impact on my life. the fictional galaxy serves as a second home for me. the special effects, the plot, the characters, the dialog- everything that a movie should have are in all 6 of these films.Let me discuss this particular movie- a new hope. the movie is about a young farmer boy named Luke skywalker who joins the rebel alliance to defeat the evil galactic empire. it can be looked at as a coming-of-age story with unforgettable characters and story.all 6 star wars films are the greatest movies ever (besides the wizard of oz and Brian depalma's scarface, of course). just give star wars a chance; you will make no regrets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies of all time. How can you hate it? Most of the people who hate it are people who just don't get that this is more than a movie. If not for this movie, would there be a Spaceballs? No. Would there be countless spoofs and parodies in TV shows and cartoons? No. If not for this, what would be every geek's favorite movie? Lord of the Rings movies, but before that! Logan's Run? 2001? Who knows?! Star Wars is THE GREATEST cinematic masterpiece of all time. It's just excellent. I know there are people out there who hate this movie, and usually that person's favorite movie is something like Scary Movie 3. 10/10, this movie rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boy Who Loved "Star Wars"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original "Star Wars" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first "Star Wars" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review "Star Wars" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to "Star Wars" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of "Lord of the Rings" or "Star Trek" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that I enjoyed in my childhood, and that I still enjoy today...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars deserves a special place in movie history because of the special effects achievements alone. The jump in technology has effectively separated all movies into two categories -- before Star Wars and after Star Wars. Industrial Light and Magic is now considered by most to be THE benchmark for special effects on the silver screen. ILM was formed by George Lucas specifically for the original Star Wars movie in 1977. However, a movie cannot live on special effects alone (see "Battlefield Earth", "Soldier", or "Jurassic Park III"). Also, once a movie becomes old, the special effects are no longer all that special; and it is the quality of the movie itself that will decide whether or not it will stand the test of time. In the case of Star Wars, it has aged well. Sure, a few of the special effects look dated now, but the story and the acting are able to carry it. Let's be honest -- this is not "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", or "The Silence of the Lambs"; but it does have an interesting story, fun action, and some good acting (especially Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford). But most of all, the original (non-Special Edition) Star Wars has MUPPETS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie star wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the small film American Graffiti, George Lucas unleashed Star Wars on the public and movies have never been the same since. A space opera, Star Wars featured never before seen special effects, exotic alien lands and introduced the world to the oddball characters of the Star Wars series. Harrison Ford, who was unknown at the time, stole this movie as Hans Solo the wise-cracking pilot and this film made him a superstar overnight. Legendary actor Alec Guiness is the Jedi master Obi Wan. There are also the robots R2-D2 and C-3PO and let's not forget Chewbacca the giant wookie. The movie was followed by two sequels and then three more Star Wars films. The first film is by far the best in the series. Star Wars is #15 on the American Film Institute's 100 greatest films list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best in the series, but better than your average movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original is typically considered the best in regards to a film series, but this isn't necessarily the case with Star Wars. I loved the film as a whole, but stylistically, it doesn't measure up to par. I'll always look at this film in a visionary sense, simply on the level that it simply reshaped film as we know it, which is sometimes more important than the content matter. This seems to be George Lucas' vice: he always makes an average first movie. Episode I was relatively inferior, and Star Wars was fairly pedestrian in many ways. The re-issue was a fantastic film to watch to watch, which makes one wonder: What if Star Wars was released in the 1990s? Always an interesting question to ponder. Nonetheless, I will watch this film every time its on TV or when I have a chance, and I'll certainly be in line when it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dont get me wrong, when this movie came out, it was like a splash of ice cold water after a night of drunken orgy. I was so blown away, that I saw it over fifty times. I have one major complaint about the way this film changed the theatrical exhibition business.I, like hundreds of others in the theatre, was sitting there with my eyes in a glaze and my mouth wide open in amazement over what I had just seen, when an usher came out and said we had to "clear the theater"!.Excuse Me? I had been going to movies for over 20 years and the price of admission had always meant that you could stay as long as you wished until the theater closed. Why was this? I heard that the theaters had gotten "Star Wars" for next to nothing, because of the lack of known names or star power--This was just a money grab! (I didn't know at the time that there was a basis for a law suit, although "class action" suits were almost unheard of then)When I went to see other films, I found that not only did they not have a second bill (B-Movie), but you could only stay for one seating--even if you were late!Although Star Wars episodes have contributed much to my entertainment pleasure, it also took away a great part of the movie going experience.I guess its a good wind that does not blow some one some ill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>comments seem to be only extremes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I see are rave reviews and slams for this movie. None of you get it. I seriously doubt that that many of you genuinely love this movie. Your eyes are clouded by its popularity and because your friends and just about everybody likes it. On the other hand to write it off as terrible with a blanket statement is a pretentious way of trying to establish oneself as an artsy person who really gets it.To judge this movie accurately you must first realize that it is philosophically deep as a mud puddle. It is not about art. It is about creating a world and putting you in it. From the standards of the time it did this very well with special effects. Now many of these effects look very fake (the cardboard box and PVC gun turret on the death star) Also many of the scene changes look dated. Datedness is inevitable for any movie, so to criticize a film based on this is to criticize practically the whole media.Instead the way to address the film is to find the distinguishing feature which has totally altered the movie industry. Off the top of their head a cynic would say that budgets have been forced up because other movies have to meet the special effects standards set by Star Wars. This in turn has made independent low budget film go way underground. This is true to some extent, but by this reasoning any movie with advanced special effects would have done the same, and it was bound to happen anyway. In terms of plot to explosions ratio Star Wars isn't that bad. A devout Star Wars fan would say, 'Well, duh Star Wars'My response to both is that what was new about Star Wars and still makes it good viewing today is not shiny new visual effects, but having a futuristic world with advanced technology and still having disgraceful examples of that technology. I will call this concept jalopies in space. The idea of craft like the Millennium Falcon with technology to go light speed being held together with duct tape and rubber bands is why Star Wars is still relevant today. The feel of the beat up helmets, which the wing men wear, or Han Solo's 'just hit it with a hammer' attitude were a new way of presenting the future. (Yes I realize that the story is set long,long ago, but it is still a representation of a more technologically advanced society than ours, so for purposes of this review its the future)The dirty feel of the technology has very much affected the feel of science fiction movies. Prior to this, although a technologically advanced society might be morally degenerate in a 1984 novel sort of way, the technology would have no chance of malfunctioning unless it wanted to kill people. Also the jalopie feel of the movie is not an attempt at comic relief. It is an attempt at realism that works well. The dirty feel of the film also applies to other genres to a lesser degree. In the 90's computer generated effects have been knitted into all genres. You know the look of these graphics: too clean, too smooth. Having a too perfect look is good if that is what one is aiming at otherwise it's not so good. A realistically rough look can be applied to any visual media.This realism makes perfect sense. It is the sort of thing that cannot be replaced with shiny new computer graphics. I do wonder how much of the jalopies in space feel of the movie was intentional. In the special edition rerelease Tatooine is computer generated and looks really clean. A one horse planet shouldn?t be clean. On the other hand the damaged rebel clothing and helmets had to be intentional, because it would be easier to get a matched set of new looking helmets or clothing than a beaten up look. In terms of Episode I being clean this makes sense because it represents a period of time when the universe is economically stable and deals with affluent classes.My final recommendation is to see this movie regardless of who you are, because it is referenced ALOT. Of course you have probably already seen it multiple times, because I only know two people who haven?t.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BIGGEST DISGRACE OF THE 20TH CENTURY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is the absolute biggest scam in movie history. Why?Let's think for a second. We're in 1977. A few studio guys get together. They think, "you know what, we need a big movie, so we'll spend a lot of money on great special effects". The result. A movie about a SPACE PRINCESS who needs help from some INTERGALLACTIC WARRIORS or bounty hunters to fight a VILLAIN WHO ALWAYS WEARS BLACK, talks with a scary voice and even is upstaged by the EMPEROR OF THE UNIVERSE. Complete wtih LIGHT SAVERS (shiny sword-type weapons that are lasers), and even a little green puppet, Star Wars is absolutely pathetic. But you know what the worst part about it is? The only reason people saw the movie was because it was 1977 and no one had seen special effects that were THAT good. If any movie today were to open back then like, ummm, I don't know, Starship Troopers, it would've gotten the same accolations. Let's flip things for a second. Let's say Star Wars opened July 4th weekend, it would be thrashed by a B movie like Armageddon. Why? Because the public wouldn't pay attention to a movie with such a corny plot. With the special effects of today, Star Wars would just get passed along as if it were Meet the Deedles. Yet you gotta admit, the studio was very smart. You spend some money making a pointless movie with lots of special effects and some bizarre outerspace plot that doesn't make sense and what do you get? The 2nd highest grossing movie of all-time, #15 on the AFI's 100 Best List, unbelievable fan devotion from nerds and 40-50 year olds who want to feel nostalgic, and even 2 sequels and 3 prequels. Wow. Star Wars, congratulations! Your pointless franchise robbed Americans of about $1 billion dollars combining the first three sequels. Possibly the biggest disgrace in film history.</fullReview>

Why do we enjoy this film? Not because of the FX. People can't identify with FX. It is because we can relate to Luke and how he deals with his adventures. Who is Luke? He is all of us, but he is also George Lukas who puts himself into the story and then has a joyful ride. We are glad to go along for the fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE is a film that I really enjoyed when I first saw it and I knew from the beginning I would love it and this was the first in a much bigger series and the fourth film in the STAR WARS franchise overall (in chronological order).The story is amazing for a 2 hour film and the film does not feel like it's 2 hours because it goes by really quick and I really think it's just amazing and spectacular and fantastically well-made and there are reasons why it is the best movie of all time and it's the best film ever made.THE CHARACTERS: Luke Skywalker is our main protagonist and he is played by Mark Hamill and he is really spectacular. He is my favorite character, along with Yoda, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, C3PO and R2D2, Mace Windu, Padme, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Emperor Palpatine.Hamill does not fail in anything and his performance was really great and just amazing. Carrie Fisher was really fantastic as Princess Leia and she is not the normal damsel-in-distress in today's movies and she was the right choice for the character. Harrison Ford is really nice as Han Solo and all three actors would later become famous for their roles in these films and they really do a very well good job.Harrison Ford would play both Han Solo in the original STAR WARS trilogy and Indiana Jones in the INDIANA JONES franchise, which I will get to.The next performance is the late Alec Guiness in the best role of his career as Obi-Wan Kenobi and he should have won an Oscar for his part. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew plays C3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca in this film and they do a really outstanding job.George Lucas does a very good job creating an epic space opera series that starts off with the middle of the series and that is not possible in today's film making world, but was possible for 1977 and he does a very good job writing and directing and the screenplay he wrote is one of the best screenplays that I have ever read before in my life.John Williams composed one of the greatest musical scores ever created for a film and his Star Wars theme song is one of my favorite musical themes ever credits.The visual effects back then were amazing and so were the lightsaber battles and the dogfight sequences and they were really cool back in 1977 and it was really cool and just amazingly created and today, they still look amazingly well-done. I have seen the 1997 special edition of this film and I think it is really good, but I also love the theatrical version is just really cool and just fantastic.Overall, I love STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE and the movie is getting a 10 out of 10 from me because everything is just really great and fantastic to inspire a lot of filmmakers including Christopher Nolan, Joss Whedon, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, John Singleton, Dean Devlin and Peter Jackson and it also inspired future filmmakers including myself.It's a smash hit, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know Star Wars and we all know that it is the worldwide famous sf space film made by the legendary director George Lucas in 1977, which revolutionized the possibilities of filmmaking in cinema forever. However, nearly 40 years have now passed since this movie first made a cinematic revolution around the world, and now, better cinematic elements than Star Wars are coming to the big screen and that's just the reason why I don't like Star Wars. It's not even the film of my time in the first place and I was born just around the time when cinema started making further advancements in filmmaking, so it is obvious and logical why I don't like Star Wars. I found the film completely boring and uninteresting, however I do understand the reason why people loved this film BACK THEN. The only things I liked about this movie is the fact that the movie takes place in a galaxy far, far away, which is obviously an original setting for a sf movie, the technically imaginative Death Star, the well chosen cast, Harrison Ford's intriguing character, the Darth Vader costume and mask, the arrival of the light sabers, the plot and the movie's mythology. My rating for the movie: 6.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A New Hope was released in 1977 and was the first Star Wars film. It impressed fans across the globe so much that it later spawned 2 sequels and a prequel trilogy. This film for me feels like it wasn't supposed to have a prequel. Revenge of the Sith makes this film more understandable but it seems that this film should have been a one man army. This Star Wars film is great but don't kill me when I say it, can get a little boring. Harrison Ford is great as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is dazzling and Mark Hamil is just plain and correct casting. Obi Wan Kenobi returns in this film much older and wiser than in the prequel trilogy. His death is more emotional when you get to know him in the prequels and is why I think they're a good asset to this franchise directed by George Lucas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all because of Jimmy Carter and his peanuts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both Star Wars and Star Trek are not movies about the future, but about the past.Star Trek relies upon the adventures of Captain Cook (even down to red uniforms for the marines, the ones who always get shot). Star Wars relies upon the tales of Medieval Europe.Someone once told me that the white clad troopers in Star Wars were based upon Nazi storm troopers. Err...this is nonsense. Nazi storm troopers rape and pillaged on a mass scale, neither of which are evident in this movie. The white troopers are the equivalent of medieval crossbowmen; skilled fighters but far below the heraldic level of knights (Jedi Knights).Star wars is a variant of a late medieval version of Camelot but set in Jerusalem during the Crusades, with Luke Skywalker playing the role of Arthur, Obi Wan Kenobi playing the role of Merlin and Hans Solo playing the role of Lancelot. The robot R2D2 is the court jester and C3Po is a serf. Darth Vader is Saladin, the enemy of the white Christian Knights. Princess Leia is a dose of women's lib thrown in for good measure."Feel the force Luke" is the most putrid sickening phrase of the whole movie. It comes straight out of the late 1970's disco scene and is laced with homo-eroticism. "Feel the force." says monkish Obi Wan to his young male student with a twinkle in his eye. It sounds like the advice of Catholic priest to his preferred choir boy. So I ask myself, why did this movie became so successful? We know up until this point that sci-fi movies were largely serious affairs: 2001 and Silent Running just two examples. Prior to Star Wars the most successful sci-fi movie had been Planet Of The Apes. Is the re-direction from these genres sufficient to explain the success of Star Wars? Probably not. I believe the true answer lies in the year it was made and the political environment of that year. Jimmy Carter was the president and he was pushing for economic austerity in the use of energy supplies. Driving speed limits were 55mph and the Saudis were in control of most of the US energy supplies(note Darth Vader = Saladin).Along comes Star Wars where energy usage is limitless. There's plentiful energy for a Death Star, space buggies, robots, laser swords and space fighters. Nobody in the movie is concerned about how much energy they are employing. And the movie doesn't explain where the energy comes from...unless it's that homo-erotic Force? Energy is apparently limitless. No driving speed restrictions, no queues at the pump for your space buggy. Put away those energy efficient, slow moving space ships in 2001 and Silent Running. No need to ride a horse as in Planet Of The Apes.The audience felt a sense of relief from Carter's energy austerity. Soon they would actually get it when they voted for Jedi Knight Reagan and his "Star Wars" program.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of a sci-fi literature and have read a lot both in Russian and English. The reason I'm putting my comments here is my curiosity. There's a Russian sci-fi book "Tumannostj Andromedy" written in 1930 by a Russian writer Ivan Efremov. The main character's name is "Dar Veter". What is it a coincidence, that it closely resembles "Dar Weider" in the Star Wars series, hardly ever because the spelling is too close. I'm not sure when the book "The Star Wars" was written, but it sure looks that someone liked the name and used it, but who? I wonder when The Star Wars was written? Maybe earlier, like the 20-s? I'm not expecting your comments, just put my notes to make it full 10 lines of required space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made, Entertaining Adventure, but not a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a confession to make. Although I consider myself a film buff, I had never seen "Star Wars" until recently, even though in Britain, it is regularly voted the greatest film of all time. To call it a cult movie would be an understatement; it seems less like a cult than a full-blown mainstream religion. (That is not necessarily a figure of speech. In the 2001 British census nearly 400,000 people, when asked to state their religion, replied "Jedi", a greater figure than the totals for several well-known denominations).I have finally overcome this gap in my filmic knowledge and have seen the film which has caused so much excitement. In essence it is a simple science-fiction adventure story, set in a galactic empire ruled by a despotic government which is being challenged by a popular resistance movement. The government forces have captured Princess Leia, a rebel leader, and a motley group are attempting to rescue her. These include a farm boy named Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, a survivor of the Jedi (a once-powerful brotherhood of warriors sworn to uphold good against evil), Han Solo, a cynical and mercenary space pilot, Chewbacca, an abominable snowman-type monster and two robots. One of these talks in an old-fashioned upper-class British accent, the other only in a series of squeaks and whistles. The government are also attempting to destroy the planet that serves as their base using a "death star" that can destroy whole planets.The only episode of the "Star Wars" franchise I had previously seen was "The Phantom Menace" which struck me as a high-tech version of those old space invader games, distinguished mainly by its wooden and lifeless acting. I initially wondered whether the original "Star Wars" would be more of the same, with clunking seventies special effects in place of more advanced nineties ones. I thought that seldom can such an influential and well-known film have used so many obscure actors in leading roles. Were it not for this film and its two sequels, neither of the two leads, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, would be household names outside their own households. The main villain Darth Vader was played by an actor best known in his native Britain as the "Green Cross Man" in a series of children's road-safety commercials.The film improves with the entry of Alec Guinness, possibly Britain's greatest ever screen actor, and a man who probably could not have given a wooden performance even if he had wanted to. His Kenobi is not only wise, noble and authoritative but also kindly and amiable. He can make us believe not only in the Jedi Knights but also in their belief system, centred upon a mysterious "Force" that permeates the universe. In other hands this "Force", which the Jedi draw upon for their powers, might have seemed mystical nonsense (as indeed it does in "The Phantom Menace"); with Guinness as our guide it seems quite plausible. There are also good performances from Peter Cushing as another leader of the villains and from the young Harrison Ford as Solo.One of the reasons for the film's popularity is the way it draws upon other film traditions for its source material. One much quoted is the Japanese samurai film, with the Jedi as the samurai and belief in the Force as the equivalent of Zen Buddhism. I also detected another Oriental influence, the Chinese martial arts movie. Such films often glorify rebellion against a repressive government and frequently also feature religiously-inspired brotherhoods of warriors such as the Shaolin monks. In "The Phantom Menace" Obi-Wan's teacher is named Qui-Gon Jinn, a name probably chosen for its vaguely Chinese sound, just as the name Obi-Wan Kenobi was designed to sound Japanese. There are also elements of the Western (particularly the character of Solo and in the scenes set in the spaceport) and of the Robin Hood type of mediaeval adventure. One might have thought in that a society which had developed the means to destroy planets from a distance of thousands of miles hand-to-hand combat would be an irrelevance, but Kenobi and Vader fight a duel with close combat weapons known as "light sabres". The most obvious influence on "Star Wars" is, as its title might suggest, the war film. The patriotic war film had gone into a decline in the post-Vietnam late seventies, but there was clearly still a demand for films that could stir similar emotions. Much about the villains is reminiscent of the Nazis- not just their ruthlessness, but also their black uniforms and the description of their crack troops as "storm troopers". Even Vader's helmet recalls the German "coal scuttle". The later part of the film, where brave and idealistic young rebel pilots try to destroy the death star before it can destroy their planet, is strongly reminiscent of British films about the RAF, such as "The Battle of Britain", "633 Squadron" and "The Dambusters", with spacecraft taking the place of aircraft. Another touch of Anglophilia might be seen in the fact that, although the rebels are nominally fighting for "the Republic", their leader is a Princess. Over the next few years, the film's vocabulary entered the real-life Cold War, with President Reagan denouncing the Soviet Union as the "Evil Empire" and his own Strategic Defence Initiative becoming known as the Star Wars project. I would not claim "Star Wars" as my own favourite film, and I cannot see that it could serve as the basis for a new religion. (I doubt if anyone ever intended it to). It is, however, a well-made and entertaining adventure story. Prior to 1977, science fiction films, although there were exceptions, were often embarrassingly bad. We remember tenth-rate examples such as "Plan Nine from Outer Space" with a sort of amused contempt, but there were also plenty of eighth and ninth-rate examples, now largely forgotten. If it achieved nothing else, "Star Wars"; at least rescued the genre from that sort of association. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Episode 2 currently in the theaters, and many people complaining about how shallow that movie is, and how unbelievable the story and how much better the original trilogy was etc, I think it's time to make a comment.First of all, Star Wars movies have NEVER,EVER,EVER had a good story. They're basically about the age-old tale of good vs. evil, set in various locations in a galaxy far far away. The plot is usually full of holes, the whole thing often depends on extreme coincidences and every Imperial superweapon has a verious obvious flaw that any apprentice engineer could have found in five minutes. This movie, Episode 4, is probably the most basic of them all. The main point is, Star Wars was never SUPPOSED to be about the story. It's basically a lot of (brilliant) nonsense put together, and it works just fine because the makers know that it's nonsense and make the best of it. That being said, the level of creativity in making up all those aliens, vehicles, space ships etc. is unmatched.When we look at Episode 4 specifically, we see a corny story full of lucky escapes and loose ends about a farmboy saving a princess, and the Universe too, while he is at it. The acting is nothing special, the dialogue can be god-awful at times (OK, not a bad as Episode 1), and the first hour of the movie is quite slow. But it's still a lot of fun ! Star Wars is entertainment and escapism in it's purest form. It was 25 years ago and it still is. *** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it that in Star Wars everyone wears a housecoat? Obi Wan wears one, the Jawas wear them, Vader wears one...WHAT IS UP WITH THAT? Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy SW after all these years, but frankly, my enjoyment of the movie has just deteriorated over the years. I first saw it when I was 8 years old...and now, 25 years later, the magic isn't there anymore. The special effects are so antiquated now that they look FAKE, the dialog is HILARIOUS, the battle sequences are PREDICTABLE, and the acting...well, let's not touch that one. I do however, still enjoy John Williams' soundtrack, even though it has been rehashed OVER and OVER in the following movies.If it seems that I have a bad attitude about SW, I guess that is due to the 2 "prequels" that have been released. Phantom Menace has basically ruined everything I ever enjoyed about Star Wars, TESB...and I never liked ROTJ in the first place....BUT, I used to regard SW as one of my favorite movies of all time. Now it is just an afterthought...Thanks alot, George Lucas...why, OH WHY did you ever have to release the prequels in the first place??!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Lucas stole so much from everybody else to make this film, it is a shock that he gave Glen Larson a hard time with Battlestar Galactica. Star Wars is classic T.H. White when it comes to its story and cast of characters. The opening credits was taken from the movie the PLAINSMAN with Gary Cooper I believe. Luke returning home to find his uncle dead and house burned was taken right from THE SEARCHERS when John Wayne returns home to find his place burned to the ground. What else? Little things from Darth Vadar's helmet being the same of a Nazi's soldiers helmet to Obi Won being the perfect Merlin match. Still, don't get me wrong, this film is great. I just don't know why Lucas would get upset for the title Battlestar being named after the Death star ??? Go figure !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars: Lucas's vision?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when Star Wars 1st came out and everyone kept asking "what about chapters I - III? George Lucas answered back by starting a rumor that he had already written 3 other chapters, but that the move company told him to scrap the rest aside form Chapter IV. Well as it turns out, none of this is true. The original scripts, characters and plot were so different in the original "journal of the whills" story, there is no way they could link up to anything created around the 1977 version of Star Wars.The thing that made star wars was not only the attention to detail in the scenes, weapons and ships, but as well the characters. Think about it- we had A wizard (ben), a princess (Leia), a cowboy(solo), a brute(Chewie), a underdog hero (Luke), and the evil wizard king (Vader). Sounds a lot like G-force meets Dr. Doom huh? The point is, we had all the characters of our dreams all smashed into one movie with some great realistic special effects. The sad thing is, this makes Lucas out NOT to be the genius everyone thinks he is, because it took a LOT of evolution for these characters to form into the ones we see on the screen and as well a lot of input from people surrounding Lucas. For example, take note that in the original scripts...there is no C-3PO or R2D2... there were added (probably not by Lucas) as a kind of laurel and hardy to lighten the mood of the story and were not found in the original scripts.Even today, Lucas is asking people ONLINE to come up with new Star Wars adventures for him to put on TV because Star Wars was never really his vision in the first place. The final drafts of the original Star Wars scripts were written pretty much as they were being filmed.(it's no wonder someone else had to write the story for "The Empire Strikes Back".If you look at Lucas's earlier films, you will see that Star Wars was really just way out of his league. Watch "THX 1138" and you'll see what I mean. The movie was based on a student short he had written and was as boring as the original "Journal of the Whills" story, showing that Lucas has a very limited vision when it comes to actual writing and had not grown since his student days, and still today lacks the vision necessary to complete his "dream" - or should i say, his 1977 inve$tment as "executive producer". You can read more on Supershadow.com where Lucas is quoted asking for ideas for upcoming Star Wars plots and then telling kids to go spend their money on Star Wars stuff even though the economy is at its worst. And then to top it all off....is telling everyone thank you for making his life so perfect. What a spoiled "gimme gimme" attitude.</fullReview>

The start of an amazing story, and the beginning of one of the most well known movie franchises of all time.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece that can clear the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a list of films that shook the world, the original Star Wars might be very high on my list. This film set the benchmark for every single audacious sci-fi film to date.A tiny consular ship flees from a domineering Star Destroyer, teaching us pretty much everything we need to know in a single scene. The Empire has bigger guns and more of them, and they're always closing in on the Rebels. Then we get the beautiful reveal of Darth Vader, whose black armour and cape contrasts starkly with the white (but no less ominous) Storm Troopers. We know immediately that this is a guy not to be messed with. Vader is so much of the soul of Star Wars - a flawless combination of David Prowse's physical presence and James Earl Jones' menacing voice work. In stark contrast is the orphaned Luke Skywalker, played iconically if not necessarily masterfully by Mark Hamill. Luke, dressed all in white, is hurled suddenly into the world he had always dreamed of in circumstances he never necessarily asked for. Luke undergoes a remarkable adventure in this film but his determination never wavers and that makes him a terrific protagonist. Han Solo, played by the irresistibly charming Harrison Ford (remember when he looked like he had the will to live?) is an excellent foil for Luke, and Carrie Fisher plays the classy and surprisingly tough Princess Leia, creating a character who is iconic in her own right, not just as the love interest of one of the leading men. Surprisingly, the character I enjoyed most on rewatch is C-3PO, again captured by unmistakable voice acting, this time by Anthony Daniel. Threepio is a pretentious snob and a complete sycophant, always willing to chide the more rebellious R2. He is responsible for much of the film's humour, and surprisingly undergoes a subtle arc himself when he desperately volunteers his own circuits for R2's repair. See Lucas? No need for Jar Jar to be funny.The sound effects are impeccable and probably the most iconic in the history of film. Whether its a the hum of a lightsaber, Darth Vader's mechanical breathing or the screech of a TIE Fighter zooming up the Death Star's trenches, you know a Star Wars sound effect when you hear it. Same goes for visuals, except those clunkily included in the remastered edition, which stand out like a sore thumb. In one scene, a Bantha has been created by draping a costume over an Asian elephant, whilst in the scene before that, noticeably underdone slug-horses are trudging around Tattooine. By and large, though, visuals are amazing - ranging from an exploding Death Star to a simple jump to light speed. Costumes? Forget about Vader, Chewie and Threepio, I bet one in every three humans could probably pick the costumes of Luke, Leia and Han as well! And John Williams' score - well just go back to my prequel reviews to read my raves about that masterpiece. Williams' glorious triumph is the beautiful scene in which Luke looks out to the two suns of Tattooine and the audience has nothing to do but soak up his beautiful music.The screenplay is filled with delightful dialogue (especially in the hands of Ford). Moreover, it has an impeccable narrative - it creates backstory without extensive exposition, sets up for a sequel without leaving the film unresolved, and creates what is ultimately a very funny, smart and enjoyable adventure. If there's one word to describe Star Wars, its an adventure.</fullReview>

The cinematography is also wonderful and looks great by today's standards, never mind nearly forty years ago! Credit due where credit is due. However, despite all of these things this film is largely overrated. The plot is fairly basic:there are bad guys, a princess needs saving and there is something called the force. As for the characters, at times quite annoying and apart from at the start, with Luke, there's little emotional build. In fact, the robots have more charisma and likability. What is missing is the bond between viewer and characters. Why should I care about these people? Why should I be rooting for them. Being instructed as to who the goodies and baddies are is not enough I'm afraid. Overall, there's far too much bang bang, zap zap and rushing around for this film to be enjoyable. With an improved plot/script maybe it would have been better, who knows. All I can say is it's not for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half way the story: pros &amp; cons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a difficult task, reviewing an isolated chapter of a much larger franchise such as the Star Wars saga! One might draw parallels with other epic undertakes as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, for example. Is it fair to review a single movie as an independent story, when actually much of what transpires from it (or to it) is directly linked to crucial motifs in a story that spans for six movies? Not only that but in the particular case of this movie (episode), we have reached half way in the story, with the first act of the saga completed in the earlier episode (Revenge of the Sith), giving this movie the job of linking the two trilogies together. So as one might expect we get back in first gear again, with the story unfolding very slowly again.Some twenty (more or less) years later after the events that toke place in "Revenge of the Sith", the empire is already established, the senate hanging on a thread, and with the Jedi almost extinct nothing is between the emperor and his grip on the universe, except for a few rebels. The movie opens with a ship carrying princess Leya, a rebel ambassador, fleeing from an imperial cruiser.Lucas has told many times that he chose to tell this movie and its story from the point of view of the two bickering droids, R2D2 and C-3PO. For as amusing as it is (they really stand out as a kind of odd couple), this really makes the first half of the movie very slow. Inspired from Kurosawa's "Hidden Fortress", these slow beginnings where seldom in the Japanese director's movies, but then again you got rewarded in the end, as Kurosawa made self contained movies and no sequels, hence the drawback in Lucas choice. Before George Lucas directed the later trilogy it was understandable, as there was the need for introducing characters. Not anymore! For some interesting exceptions (the delightfully Han Solo) we already know from the prequels who the droids are, who Obi-Wan is, who Darth Vader is, etcetera, etcetera. Perhaps one of the few unexpected consequences of the recently produced trilogy and prequels.However, once we get to the second half of this episode things start to get moving! The escape from the Death Star helps you to sink in with the real nature of Episode IV, an adventure movie more than anything else, not really worried with developing the true motif and backbone of this saga which revolves around the Skywalker family. From there on, including that final assault on the Death star (very nicely done by the way!!), going through it all with the land mark score by John Williams (which is indefinitely part of the story's identity), we are definitely in gear: accepting the new characters and their roles in the saga, as well as going back to our empathy for the old ones (Obi Wan and such). And of course, by this time the prequels have helped to emphasize our wish to see the Skywalker novella unfold. So when the credits come on the screen you are already reaching for the "Empire strikes back" DVD.To conclude my review, if you want to see a self contained movie, you are in for a fair adventure movie, but the real prize will get past you if you haven't seen the prequels or don't intent to see the sequels. So don't waste time. By the whole lot and see the full six episodes! It's a unique cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much for Princess Leia being entrapped by the Imperial Senate as well as the dreaded sith known as Vader. The most striking beginning of this Episode IV movie was in the height of the very first attack between rebel forces and Storm Troopers, where Princess Leia inserts the CD right in the mouth of the famous droid R2-D2. The CD contains clear outlays of the Imperial battle station, which is sometimes called the "space station."She does that in time, just before she is knocked out temporarily by one Storm Trooper. In another scene when Leia is forced to reveal the secret base, that flying contraption that seems like a space-age soccer ball was the intimidator as it hovered in front of her. I had speculated that failure to reveal would mean that ball will zap her with electric shocks.The midpoint of the flick, of course, was when Sith Vader ordered Alderan to be destroyed. I realized that it was true after watching Episode III of Star Wars, "Revenge of the Sith", where I had seen fire and volcanic lava on that planet, when Order 66 was made by Anakin Skywalker to wipe out the Jedi knights on the planet. And it was Anakin who turned to the "dark side" and became Darth Vader in the first place.The battle scene between the rebel freighter and the four Imperial tie fighters was something. This was akin to the same space battle seen in "The Last Starfighter"....because in both movies, of the difficulty of tracing the guns to the enemy targets that sometimes go quite fast.The final part of the movie was scary....Princess Leia seeing the indicator at the rebel moon that the Death Star would destroy the rebel moon in minutes...as soon as the rebel force started the mission to knock out the enemy space station. With Carrie Fisher playing Leia, I had seen the fear in her eyes....She already had witnessed the fearful firepower of this station....and she knows that Vader will use it against her. Of course, when Luke finally knocked out the station, all of the fears within Leia just wiped away....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you choose to watch Episodes One-Three first, you may be disappointed in these older films which, quite understandably, lack in the special effects compared to the other ones. It should be noted however, that these films were at the height of technology at their time, and remain a credit to their creators. As far as story line goes, I was unimpressed with the action. The movie does contain a few fast paced scenes, but they lack the feeling of suspense and excitement which make the newer movies so fun to watch, and which had come to be associated with Star Wars. Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hammel, is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Carrie Fischer does a scantly better job. Most kudos should likely go to Harrison Ford, as Hans Solo, who makes a few foolish attempts at being funny, but whose acting is at least up to par. Or maybe the Star Wars Oscar should go to whoever played Chewbacca, for being inside that big costume all day. All in all, a bit of a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars is not the greatest movie ever made. The plot is essentially "the brave knight fights the dragon and saves the princess from the dark castle." A lot of the characterization is pretty silly.However, it is still a very entertaining film. It's full of action, adventure, and good-natured heroism. The special effects now look somewhat cheesy, and a lot of the dialogue is just ridiculous, but heck, that just adds to the fun. Star Wars may not provide deep insights into the human condition, but it sure delivers good, swashbuckling escapism.The recently-released "Special Edition" is in fact inferior to the original. While the special effects have been "enhanced" by Industrial Light and Magic's digital whiz kids, these slick computerized FX look out of place beside the rest of the movie's more "primitive" visuals. As for the much-ballyhooed added scenes... well, let's just say that there was a reason that they were cut from the original. Some other alterations are just foolish. It's still fun, but not as much fun as Star Wars' original incarnation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully entertaining spectacle, an adventure for all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The science-fiction film of all time has to be "Star Wars". This epic space adventure continues to dazzle audiences even after sixteen years.The cast (including Carrie Fisher, Sir Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing) do a marvellous job amongst all the machinery and technical wizardry of George Lucas. Yet it probably has to be said that they are not only outshone by the technical special effects (still eye-popping even now) but also by the very funny antics of droids C-3PO and R2D2, who really steal the show.Its a movie that has something for everyone, including romance, adventure, action, chivalry and good versus evil. A great spectacle for the kids, and a marvellous adventure for all us adults. Wonderfully entertaining.Thursday, July 22, 1993 - Astor TheatreThe landmark sci-fi movie of all time, "Star Wars", remains the most amazing journey into the imagination of writer-director George Lucas.It's visual splendour and special effects genius still has a marked impact almost two decades on, as does the old fashioned story of home grown heroes up against dastardly villains in its dazzling futuristic setting.Sir Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford almost match the show stealing turns from C-3PO and R2D2, but not quite. While finally, John Williams magnificent score is a treat. A real must for the young at heart.Saturday, February 19, 1994 - VideoTwenty years on and the "Star Wars" trilogy is back, bigger and, some say, better than ever. For mine I'm not so sure. I have two schools of thought about "Star Wars" at the movies.a.) If you've already experienced the big screen adventure of the rebellion as they unite against Lord Vader's evil Galactic Empire and his awesome Death Star, then the new "Special Edition" may not have a great deal to offer you. Yes, Lucas and his whiz-bang team at I.L.M. have touched up the whole show, adding some new creatures and effects - most notably Han Solo's scene with Jabba the Hut - as well as digitally re-mastering the soundtrack. But often I got the feeling old George may have just been a little carried away, and sometimes he seems to be trying too hard to impress us. However, I guess if I was given the opportunity to digitally enhance my favourite baby after twenty years, I would be inclined to let things get out of hand too. Perhaps it's just me though, griping about changes to the original, even if very few things have changed. In short, if you've seen "Star Wars" at the flicks before, then you'll only be seeing it again. But I reckon that's a good enough reason.b.) If you've never seen "Star Wars", or only viewed it on video, then I would definitely recommend you go out right now, find a huge, loud, packed cinema and experience for yourself the groundbreaking science-fiction film which has been infinitely duplicated and whose special effects have only been surpassed in recent years by "T2" and "Jurassic Park".Sure there are some awful lines - the whole movie is targeted at kids folks (they'll love R2D2 and C3PO and so will you) - but for pure adventure, heroism and good versus evil, you can't go past "Star Wars".Saturday, April 5, 1997 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded..."- George Lucas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The studio dismissal of his first (and, arguably, best) film, THX-1138, and the phenomenal success of his second feature, AMERICAN GRAFFITI, led George Lucas to undertake an Americanized version of Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS- by way of the old FLASH GORDON and BUCK ROGERS serials. Replacing the two flesh and blood leads from THE HIDDEN FORTRESS with a pair of robots who might well have stepped straight from Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Lucas fashioned a kiddie corn classic. Luke Skywalker, one supposes, is the young Lucas himself (whose interest in fast-moving machines nearly cost him the farm in his misspent youth). Forgettable in many ways, but nonetheless entertaining, STAR WARS has become the backbone of big-budget fx filmmaking in this country. One can't begrudge Lucas his phenomenal success, but one tends to find oneself longing for a return to the old, inventive days when he made movies with a tad more substance- movies that didn't follow the selfsame beat, frame after frame...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most notable for its influence for the worse on Hollywood film-making ever after its release; the reliance on spectacle, excess action and noise, Star Wars is actually a reasonably good film. Set design, costume design and the like are superb; as of course are the effects, but it all rings a little hollow to me; maybe The Empire Strikes Back will prove a more satisfying film. The actors try their best, but the script isn't really centred around the creation of layered characters, although each of the main characters is defined well two-dimensionally. The only actor of truly great calibre in the film is Alec Guinness, wonderful in so many British films in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly "Kind Hearts and Coronets" in which he plays 8 parts and "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Guinness is good, but simply not given the scope to show his talents to the full. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is reasonable, as is Carrie Fisher in an underwritten role as Princess Leia. Peter Cushing is forgettable, overshadowed by Prowse/Earl Jones as Vader. The music is quite impressive. The film could have done with some better comedic touches; and with Alec Guinness this shouldn't have been difficult; that's a problem: Obi-Wan needed to be a more varied, ambiguous figure, in my view. While it should be mentioned this is a pretty wonderful film for children, it only rates as pretty good escapism otherwise. Rating:- *** 1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Might as well get it out there. Sci-fi "almost" never age well, and this is no exception. Consider episode 1,2,3 vs 4,5,6. (ok ..I,II,III vs IV,V,VI). Look at the original Alien, all the lights inside the ship looks so lo-tech. A2 is kind of like Nam. A3 bit better with Fincher - but story a bit awkward. Now look at Blade Runner - it is superb on blu ray - but maybe not in 2054. The more recent Matrix will probably look like cheese comes 10 yrs time.Well, back to the topic. When this came out and I only watch it once in theatre. Well... errrrh.. hohum, like the title said -&gt; all exterior and not much interior. Just slightly above Michael Bay's best effort and that's The Island. (Now the look of that movie "looks" good) And if you see THX 1138 by Lucas -&gt; wow, you wonder with many many unpleasant questions.No, I'm not trashing this completely, with a value 6. There are good things - but none too memorable or can be identified with, for me. Roger Ebert said it --&gt; it's a space opera. With large brushes of generality and campy dialogue to back it up.But that is just me, with sentiments toward the other end of the spectrum when it comes to Sci-fi. So STar Trek, Star War, all the same to me. Really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has, possibly, the worst script I've ever come across in a film.So, we meet Luke. He lives with his aunt and uncle in some sort of extraterrestrial farming. The get killed, we never hear from them again. A passing shot is it. Luke never even recalls them once.He meets a strange man, this man he has been told is crazy and possibly senile. The man tells him about a mystical "force" that lives in everything and without any demonstration of it, or the man's sanity, Luke declares he wants to leave everything behind and follow this man and learn about the force. What?! We meet Darth, a man portrayed to be villainous by the mere fact we're told he's supposed to be and that he dresses in all black and wears a cape. The story never builds on him at all, and I was left wondering why I should I even care about him.The characters are all shockingly two dimensional, with little to no back story and nothing else ever added to them.The only thing that salvaged my viewing of this was the relationship between C3PO and R2D2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, everyone knows "Star Wars": a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) battle Darth Vader's evil forces. Obviously, this is probably one of the top five most famous movies of all time, and it has truly withstood the test of time. It doesn't suffice to call "Star Wars" a sci-fi, a fantasy, or anything really; it is everything that a movie could be. Looking back on it, we notice that it was actually pretty low tech (which is part of why "Episode 1" was so bad).Well anyway, the point is that George Lucas created the ultimate masterpiece here. This movie will live on forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most overrated movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is literally the definition of "aging badly" and "nostalgia shielded". Sorry I wasn't born fast enough to enjoy all the special effects that were only good by 80's standards. OK we will get the bad out of the way with first because I do have some compliments to throw this movies way. As said the special effects are garbage, for example in the trash compactor scene the eye of the alien briefly pops up and it clearly looks like a badly made puppet. If we all complain about CGI because it is unconvincing then why can I not complain about unconvincing practical effects? The action is also garbage. Seriously in the very first few scenes of the movie there are Storm Troopers coming a very small doorway, the rebels should have massacred them, but instead the opposite happens. Do I even need to mention how rubbish the light saber fight between Obi- Wan and Vader was? Do not give me any rubbish about production delay's, production of a film is irrelevant to critiquing a film. I have to really stretch my suspension of disbelief to believe the sequence of event's. Do the imperials at the beginning just forget droids exist? Can they not scan for droids? Why can they not just board up the pipe on the outside of the Death Star? Why did the Laser Luke fired bend with the pipe?. Loads of plot conveniences. By the way they never inform of the Empire's ideology, philosophy or motivation. Seriously the bad side of the force is literally called the dark side? that is really on the nose. Alright now for the good. The acting was good, the writing for the dialogue was good, the characters were great, the cinematography was great, it had a good concept (shoddy execution though) and it never really bored me. No I do not see being an industry influence for other Science fiction films as a positive. The influences of a film are irrelevant to critiquing a film. Now to finish off I am not saying do not like Star Wars, like whatever you want, just try and differentiate when you like a film for it's quality and when you like a film because it was apart of your childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The luckiest con artist in the galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In almost four decades since it was made, "Star Wars" has spawned five cinematic sequels, a Christmas TV-special, an animated series, comic book adaptations and novelizations. It has sold millions of thematic toys and other related merchandising. It has spawned a multi-million following that slowly turns into an organized religion of its own. It has also inspired over 1300 reviews on IMDb. The reason I'm here, writing another one, is because I recently took another look at it, in its Blue-ray Cinemascope splendor, keeping in mind one thing: at the time it was made, this film was all there was meant to ever be of "Star Wars". No saga, no nine-part soap-opera. Just this.That's right. Once upon a time it wasn't called "Episode IV". Once upon a time its "sequel" was "Holiday special" on CBS and CTV. It was at first thought the film would sink at the box office. It has had a proper closure at the end, with that drawn out military ceremony. It only had a feel of an episode of anything because Lucas, by his own admission, conceived it as an homage to early sci-fi television series format (all the way from scene transitions and goofy sound effects down to having a secondary villain escape at the end). The only other idea for a film Lucas did have at the time was about an archaeologist with a whip and a fedora hat. Nowadays fans believe his story of having the whole series written down from the outset, but he really only worked it out as he went along. That's one of the reasons why all the apocryphal stories, called sequels and prequels, tie only very badly to this film, baffling fans with their inconsistencies to this day - and for centuries to come.The impact "Star Wars" had on the future of filmmaking is incontrovertible. Not even the biggest detractors can deny it. The mass frenzy it caused and success it had are well documented. The influence, not only in the genre of science fiction, but in entire business of making films and marketing them, is such that it can indeed be said that it changed the film industry forever. One can find numerous reasons why was that so, but the last of all would be the quality of this film - as a film.Put together its pluses and minuses - "Star Wars" is a mediocre film. A couple of things are really, really good and were responsible for having it hold water. The overall idea of a young nobody becoming a somebody in a war taking place in space. The wonderful Williams' score. The cinematography. The voice of James Earl Jones. And the special effects. Not only were they excellent "for their time", they're excellent even now. Even today with all the CGI and money at hand, filmmakers often fail to make effects as convincing and "meaty" as they are in "Star Wars".The bad things in the film are also really, really bad for a high end feature film. And it really stings the eyes... and ears. The key elements of the story are idiotic: the princess of nonexistent planet, the disposable rebels without a cause, the omnipresent yet unreliable force called "the Force", the villains with overly complicated plans to quell the rebellion, the plot twists. The inane dialog that wants to sound inspired: "I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16", "Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?". The cast is, well, atrocious: Alec Guiness, who's only brought on board to add a little aristocratic glamour, looks tired and almost embarrassed, Mark Hamill is juvenile and neurotic, Carrie Fisher lacks sex appeal and charisma and comes off more like an irritated cleaning lady than a person of vision and authority; and Harrison Ford, who profited the most out of this project, still had to learn about the movement and timing in front of the camera. Only the actors playing the villains did okay. Token supporting cast, clumsy extras and silly puppets need no further analysis beside that they were clumsy and silly. Perhaps, though, a lot could be said about "the droids" but to say that they were given far too much screen time is enough.Hadn't there been for history making element, this film would have been one of the hundreds of those "cult" thingies from the Seventies, taken off of the shelf once in a while for nostalgia purposes (something that happened to its sci-fi peers "Logan's Run" and "Westworld", for instance). However, the odd combination of psycho-socio-economical factors made "Star Wars" stuff of legends and George Lucas one of the richest men in the industry. Nowadays it is a revered piece of film-making, a never ending source of inspiration and the motor behind a lucrative "Star Wars" franchise - for all the wrong reasons. And relentlessly spoofed, for the right reasons.But strip away the aftermath of its creation, the sequels, the folklore and the pretentiousness that arose from it over the years, and you have what it was always meant to be, for better or for worse: a silly fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was eight when I saw Star Wars; it had just been released, and was making a huge splash, even in the tiny northern community of Leaf Rapids, Manitoba. Employees at our lone theatre were dressed as the movie characters, and even R2D2 and C3P0 made an appearance - I have no idea how such a tiny town managed that.Like everyone else, I was enthralled. But as the years have passed, I've found myself less and less impressed by this "masterpiece." It's still fun...but in the end it seems elitist and hollow. I find it difficult to empathize with any of the characters but Artoo and Wedge Antilles - perhaps because these are the "everyman" characters, the workhorses who do their jobs with little glory. Luke was too whiny, Han too smarmy, and Leia too insubstantial.That being said, I thought Christopher Lee was great as Grand Moff Tarkin. Too bad his character was killed off in this film.All in all, Star Wars is a decent time-waster, but undeserving of the attention lavished upon it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the Star Wars trilogy always enchanted my childhood which included purchasing figures and spaceships and re-enacting the space battles from the movies. This first movie A New Hope was way ahead of its time and the characters in this first instalment lead us on the greatest ever journey in the quest of good against evil. Before they even added the cgi I still thought the effects were out of this world( no pun intended)and will forever treasure my childhood memories watching this for the first time ever and buying it on VHS and watching it over and over again. Luke Skywalkers character kind of inspired me to being an actor because the message you got from him was you can never not do anything. Belief can get you to where you want to be,realised once the fate of his Aunt and Uncle were sealed. To me though I always endeared myself to Han Solo and always thought he was cool.When I saw him in this for the first time I always wanted to be him. And the Beautiful Princes Leia made my heart flutter even though she was tough as old boots. Absolute Classic is what I think of this Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Effects, Generic Storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect Star Wars to be a feel-good movie, one that can even be said to be a movie for the whole family. Definitely, it is one of those all-in-one movies jam-packed with action, adventure, comedy, and a bit of drama and romance here and there. Of course, special effects-wise, this film is truly a pioneer. I almost could not believe my eyes at first, knowing very well that this was made 36 years ago. However, the story itself is quite a generic one. The characters are quite stereotypical and are not even developed that well to get past their stereotypicality. It is unsettling that Luke Skywalker was able to come to terms with the death of his aunt and uncle, people who had taken care of him all his life, faster and quite easier than Obi-Wan Kenobi's. Another splotch in the storyline is how the rebel army immediately included Luke into their ranks. Perhaps this can be justified by the fact that they were lacking in men but it just does not seem realistic.</fullReview>

But I still don't get whether it's a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark, the setting differs a lot, however Mel Gibson's acting is probably one of the few theatrical highlights. Another thing is a small editing error I have noticed; the ordering of the films. They seem have accidentally made the final 3 first, and only realized in the late 90s, and had to cover the tracks by producing the first 3 in a hurried attempt to cover plot flaws. However, most people have over looked this and I think it adds character.</fullReview>

But Episode IV: A New Hope falls disappointingly short in retrospect.when in first came out in was the pinnacle of special effects, and everyone was amazed. But as someone who wasn't alive in 77, it is quite easy to see it's shortcomings.The plot is very basic. Seeing this film for the first time in 3 years i was surprised at how short it was. And simplistic too. Not very much depth or character development. With the exception of Alec Guiness and James Earl Jones, the acting is pretty poor two.The special effects were good for their day, but I still find that clash between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader painful. It is a bit ridiculous now with all the lightsaber twirling in the prequels, but they weren't even trying. Just standing rigid and lightly bashing their swords together.That said this is the one that launched so many other great films, and introduced great characters like Darth and Han Solo, and has to receive credit. A phenomenal achievement in cinema, but it's clear Lucas's skill needed a little more polish.</fullReview>

As it is, I really had high hopes for it, and I really tried to like this movie, but eventually I gave up on it.What's the story? Well, I tried to watch the movie four times, and I fell asleep about halfway through every time. The first time I saw it, that might have been caused by watching it at 2 AM during a movie night. But the other 3 times I watched it in the early evening, and I just kept falling asleep.The bits I did see were utterly unconvincing. Mark Hammil is one of the worst actors ever. The story is one of the most far-fetched ever to be put on film.And then there are people who say this film "started the epic sci-fi genre". Really? You'd have to ignore the original "War of the Worlds" from 1953, "Planet of the Apes" from 1968, and "2001: A space odyssey" also from 1968.I think I can divide my friends into two camps, the Star Wars aficionados, and the ones who find it as boring as I do. And I know how worked up the fans get, whenever someone dares criticize this movie. The fact remains that I am definitely not alone among fans of Sci-fi to be quite bored by Star Wars. The pages and pages of worshiping reviews therefore, are understandable, but misleading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is where it all started, the original trilogy and saga of science-fiction epic adventures, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated writer/director/creator George Lucas. "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away" the universe in ruled in fear by the Empire, and a new threat has been completed, the Death Star battle station. The rebels however have managed to capture the plans for the station, and Senator Princess Leia Organa (introducing Carrie Fisher) places them into the memory of droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). R2 with companion droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) escape the ship and land the desert world Tatooine, the Princess meanwhile is held captive by the Emperor's trusted servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and battle station leader Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). R2 and 3PO meanwhile eventually end up with farm boy Luke Skywalker (introducing Mark Hamill) who lives on the planet with his Aunt and Uncle. While cleaning R2, he comes across the message from the Princess, mentioning Obi-Won Kenobi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Alec Guinness), an former Jedi Knight who they find in the desert. After his relatives are killed, Luke wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi. They contract pilots of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo (introducing Harrison Ford) and Wookie Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to take them across the galaxy at light speeds. They travel to what was the Princess's planet, Alderaan, but they are pulled in by tracker beam by what destroyed it, the Death Star. After avoiding the stormtroopers, and rescuing the Princess, they eventually escape after removing the beam, but Obi-Won was killed (and became one with the Force) after being killed by his former pupil, Vader. The concluding scenes are the craft and laser battles with the Rebels and the Empire, Darth Vader escapes (giving way to the sequel), and Luke eventually blows up the Death Star (with a great explosion), and the heroes are rewarded, a happy ending.

		<fullReview>Maybe the first sci-fi/fantasy/adventure film to be taken seriously since production and definitely the first one to be considered as such... I have to say that personally I'm NOT a big fan of this movie (or should I say "these movies"?), but I consider it as one of the greatest achievements in fantasy films... Anyway, it's hard to judge it when 20 years ago there was nothing to be compared with as there iss today, but I think that even in the VCR this movies looks great (when I saw it again about a year ago in the movie theatre I was kind of disappointed because I couldn't catch the original magic)... I would like to find another movie with the original magic of Star Wars attached to it on these times... but... I don't think that would be possible, not even with the first three chapters on production.. :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really is a kid's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star Wars is one of those movies you have to see as a kid. I saw it in 1997 and it instantly changed my view on movies. However, six years later, my tastes in movies have changed and Star Wars seems disappointing. The acting is mostly lacklustre, even from Alec Guinness, who looks bored of the whole exercise. It seems a shame that Sir Alec would be doomed to be remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi for the rest of his career, as it's hardly a good part. Elsewhere, the effects are getting worse as the years pass, although the Death Star trench run still excites after countless viewings. And anyway, at least it's better than the prequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>here it is. a guy who thinks star wars is the most over-rated film...ever. Don't get me wrong, i don't not like it, but really, when you break it down folks, it's pretty dire. The dialogue is horribly horrible. The direction is even worse. Almost no invention, or intelligence with the camera. Which i why i still and always will believe that George Lucas is THE worst director in cinema history. The story is interesting, but that's it, the sets are cheap, costumes are almost laughable. But yes, it can be enjoyed ever so slightly, the drama is quite convincing, as it's the acting which is to be applauded. It's not great but they must be quite good at the art if they can come across as realistic while having to speak such awful lines. Look closer guys and girls, it's not the best film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but Lord, it wasn't *that* good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inspiration was the space opera serials of the '30s to the '50s and numerous other sources, with the result that this movie is almost startlingly unoriginal. The script was not great. The acting was achingly uneven, from the brilliance of Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing to the awkward mouthings of Mark Hamill. The special effects were amazing only in their ubiquitousness; the techniques used were venerable -- and have been considerably "spiced up" in the currently available video editions. Yeah, it was lots of fun, but beyond that it had no meaning or enduring value. So what inspired the fanatic following enjoyed by the Star Wars franchise?According to George Lucas, he was guided by the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell, who was able to distill from the world's folklore the foundational elements of myth. These are principles and images that resonate; our response is almost biologically hardwired. Using Campbell for a blueprint, Lucas constructed a modern retelling of the hero's journey. In this he didn't do a bad job, because the resonances are certainly there. This I think is key. It fools into thinking we are seeing a great story, because its structure causes us to react to it as we would to any number of other great stories. But the story cannot fill this structure. The mythological resonances blind us to the gaping plotholes, the shallow characterizations, the poor acting, and that godawful dialogue.A really harsh critique of this film is required not because it deserves it by any absolute measure -- indeed, under other circumstances it would really be too lightweight to merit the attention -- because against all reason it has become a standard by which all other movies of its genre are judged. There are far better candidates for that role than this.</fullReview>

This film is full of it, which is OK in and of itself, but much of the visual effects do nothing to advance the story or characters.If Star Wars hadn't had such a marketing blitz and sold like $1 trillion in toys, we probably wouldn't be talking about it still today. Doesn't anyone care how cheesy the entire cinematography is? How the dramatic camera switches and how the ending just cuts off is so laughable?And, worst of all, just like Episode I, the movie ends with all the characters standing around waving and smiling with big cheesy grins. I swear it's like the ending of a video game. Video games end really badly and shallow often, as this movie does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you get over the nostalgia (difficult, I know) and take a hard look at the facts - this movie displays: bad acting (with very few exceptions, namely Sir Alec Guinness), very mediocre directing, dated special effects, basic plot line (good against evil, final showdown, etc.), and very few redeeming qualities - perhaps the excellent score by John Williams.If this movie was released today, it wouldn't get a fraction of the attention and income it did in 1977. This is true for a lot of movies, of course, but it helps to put things in perspective.All this is not meant to take anything from the importance of Star Wars and its huge effect on the movie industry.

		<shortDescription>Charming, but time took its appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think everything about this sci-fi story is known to everyone. "Star Wars" grossed 460 million $ in U.S. cinemas making it the most commercial movie of the 1970s. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for best picture, director and supporting actor Alec Guiness. For all those categories it was nominated also for an Oscar. The movie won 7 Oscars, but only in technical categories, while the one for best picture went to Woody Allen's "Annie Hall". Many were outraged at that Oscar decision, but I think this is one of the few times I would agree with the academy.I like "Star Wars", really I do. It made so many people nostalgic but I noticed that I truly loved it only when I was a kid, and not now while I'm a grown up. Strange irony; back then I hated "Annie Hall", today its one of my favorite movies( Grade:10/10 ). What's the problem with "Star Wars"? I think it has only about 15 % of the magic that is anticipated while you watch its poster.------------------------------- Take the characters for instance. They are all one dimensional. We never find out more about Luke's life on the farm. We never see him taking a bath, sleeping, going out with his friends or being in love. Chewbacca is so silly that you don't know if he is a animal or an intelligent being that's mentally ill. The only character that is developed is the cynical Han Solo ( I wish there were more lines from him like the one when he says to Obi-Wan that he thinks that the whole Force theory is a joke ). Look at how quirky the characters are in animes like "Slayers"! The best scene was the one where the two Sunsets can be seen from Luke's planet. That was real magic, unlike other sequences which were more action oriented. I guess the thing that is the most problematic is the almost total lack of emotions. The utopic story is cold and not interested in drama. I wonder what Jean-Luc Godard or Joel Coen could have made if they had directed "Star Wars"."Star Wars" is a good film and its creation of Darth Wader is classic, but looking at its wooden story you just can't but not to wonder if the whole cult thing around it( its no. 9 on IMDb's top 250 films )may have never been started if the special effects weren't so grand.Grade: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film even though it doesn't live up to all the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that there are few movies out there which are as much loved as "Star Wars". So, I think I should say this straight away; I do *not* think that this film deserves all the praise and all the hype it's gotten over the last 22 years. However, I do like this film, it's just that it is so full of clichés that one more cliché would've made it a very silly film. As it is now, it's not silly, it's a good film for kids. I don't say that to try to put the film down, there's nothing wrong with children's films. Look at the best Disney films for example! Some of them are masterpieces. And I really like fantasy films like "Star Wars" even if I think that e.g. "Time Bandits" is a better film. Having said that, there is nothing really wrong with "Star Wars", it's good entertainment. It's rather funny (I like interplay between R2-D2 and C-3PO) and apart from the clichés (though they are overwhelming) it is a rather nice story -- for kids. Not being a child I do demand much more from a film's script than this, but I was still very entertained while I watched "Star Wars" and my vote for it here at IMDb was a 6 (out of 10).</fullReview>

Ford takes on a big character and with his charisma delivers a great Han Solo and keeps up his act through the three movies he is in. Personally the 4th movie which was the first one to be made is in my taste a little slow. But you are introduced to the story and learn about the characters.I am giving A New Hope a 8/10 since it is a part of one of the best series i have ever had the pleasure of watching.

		<fullReview>Many would have you believe that Star Wars is about a little blonde pipsqueak who wants to fulfil his dream of becoming a space samurai. Not true! The true heart of this epic saga is the character of Jek Porkins, the portly, ill-fated, X-wing pilot of Red Squadron. For those who have seen Star Wars but have no idea who I'm talking about, Porkins is Red Six. He is a young, ambitious member of the Rebel Alliance whose dreams of kicking ass and taking names were cut tragically short when his T-65 X-wing starfighter was struck by debris, leaving him with several mechanical and computer malfunctions during the assault on the Empire's planet-sized Death Ball. During his moment of technical weakness, Porkins was sucker blasted by enemy turbolaser fire and killed. There have been many jokes at the expense of Jek Porkins' honorable memory. For example, some have said that Jek's X-wing simply couldn't take the weight of his masculine frame, that it simply wasn't realistic. Well, how realistic is it for a retarded sand savage to leave a wimpy farmboy without a crushed skull when he has ...a skull crusher? How realistic is it for a princess to walk out of a giant garbage disposal with her virginal white dress completely unstained? And don't even get me started about target shafts that are only two meters wide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best received films of all time that spawned two sequels and three prequels. I first saw this when I was four years old and from the first flashy credits it left an impression of what was capable in the film industry. However it has not fared well with time. The effects are dated the look is dated and Lucas' screenplay lacks a psychology that could only be mastered in episode V The empire strikes back by Lawrence Kasdan. George has set the stage though and what a set up it is with so many possibilities to be explored in the Star Wars universe. It has a Hero, a mentor, a cowboy, a princess, A dark overlord a pair of bumbling droids and an ancient art rekindled by Jedi master Obi Wan Kenobi. People who grew up with Star Wars find the series to be a sentimental favorite. It launched the career of Harrison Ford who's Han Solo by the end of the series enjoyed more popularity than that of the hero Luke Skywalker. When Watching this film please remember it was made in the seventies and that movie psychology has evolved so much more since. My advice is to just go along for the ride</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, Star Wars (1977) -- believed by many to be the film that started it all -- is in fact, a weak microcosm of what 70s Hollywood tried to accomplish, which was producing films such as the mentioned, with blockbuster budgets in light of attracting youngsters to the theater.Hollywood was quite successful in doing so, however, what has aroused my curiosity is the fact that despite the agreement of most people in the extremely poor quality of the audio/visual effects, the bad acting save the performance by great Alec Guinness, audiences have allowed the mere interesting story that's been as unique as Terminator and Matrix at their corresponding times; in addition the publicity given to Star Wars, aside from what we here from parents --teenagers/early teens of 70s-- effect their judgment.I saw this film for the 2nd time in my life in the class, and now as a film student, and never in my life have I seen such annoyance caused by ridiculous techniques used to assemble special effects, the horrible noises of the trashcan look alike R2d2, to which so much screen time is given.In my opinion as a movie fan and student the movie is quite terribly done, and by God don't start with "Well, it's been done 30 years ago!"

		<fullReview>Indeed, as good as this movie might have been for its time, and despite still being entertaining and funny, it's been surpassed by finer movies over the last 10 years.With a good direction, mostly on the special effects, a memorable score, and some funny characters, the story itself is formulaic... well before Lucas came up with Star Wars - it had been around for years in sci-fi novels/short-stories.But besides formulaic, it's simple and awfully written - there's no plot development, all the tension comes from action, and the actors are only there to justify the action scenes.I liked it when i was a kid, but i've grown up and seek more complexity, and can't find it in Star Wars; unlike The Lord Of The Rings, which has a far more complex, structured story really separated in three segments.The fact is, Star Wars could have ended with the first and there would be no reason for a further episode, but they did more sequels - and the awful prequels - and it began losing its frail quality.Not a movie for the new millenium, i give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

However what remains, when you strip this movie of it's special effects and science fiction setting, is a basic plot that's been done thousands of times. It's very predictable and boring. I was 26 years old and one of the few people who never saw Star Wars. Everyone said it was good. So when I came across it on VHS three years ago, I decided to give it a try. Man, was I disappointed!

		<fullReview>In 1977 when audiences flocked to see this film i can only imagine how great they thought it was, a spectacle of visual astonishment, a mythical world full of wondrous creatures, but let me just say this, the story telling was awful, the acting was less than desirable, the screenplay was embarrassing and the plot contained more clichés than troy...but all of these points where overwhelmed at the time from its outstanding visuals. When looking at this film from a non judgemental perspective, at this time, this film holds many faults that make it highly predictable and at times slow paced. Every star wars fan has highlighted all of these points but are unable to expect, the feeling they got in 1977 does not allow them to..The movie going public and critiques alike are all aware that this is most definitely not the best film of all time but undoubtedly the most influential. When it comes to great acting, screenplay, and story telling, revenge of the sith is superior to its predecessors. Lord of the rings for example is a film, like Ben hur, schindlers list, pulp fiction and the godfather that will last the test of time for its outright stunning ability to encapsulate the hearts of its audience and portray a side to life that provokes us to rethink the way we act. Star wars : a new hope is very weak but is not an awful film, disappointing i may say. And in 100 years time lord of the rings, pulp fiction, schindlers list and even titanic will be remembered and re watched, star wars will have died into a non existence...........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star Wars - Episode IV, A New Hope is an entertaining, if rather dated, voyage into the mysterious depths of outer space. Unfortunately films of the science fiction genre tend to age quickly due to rapid advances in technology (as evidenced here by some very static inter-ship battle sequences). However, the essence of the film remains unchanged, and modern viewers are just as likely to feel uncomfortable in the presence of the black and foreboding Darth Vader as audiences of 25 years ago. Vader belongs to the Empire - a consortium of power-hungry and remorseless warlords whose aim of galactic domination is threatened by the theft of some secret plans. Enter young Luke Skywalker, who - with the aid of smuggler Han Solo, Princess Leia, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, a 7-foot Wookie, and two incredibly camp droids - must ensure these plans reach the rebel base and are used to destroy the Empire. The setting gives the designers free rein to create some imaginative non-human beings, and these range from the sublime (such as the majestic yak-like Banthas used as desert transport) to the ridiculous. A collection of people wearing masks reminiscent of department store Halloween costumes does not make for a very convincing inter-species frontier town. Apart from this, and the almost unbelievably abysmal target accuracy of the bad guys, there is a lot to like about this movie. The characters are clearly defined, and although ostensibly the story is spearheaded by Mark Hamill, it is Harrison Ford as sarcastically laconic space cowboy Han Solo who carries the film. The passage of time may have slightly dimmed the power of the light sabers wielded in the battle between the Force and the Empire, but they are by no means extinguished.</fullReview>

I have one reason for seeing it: I am a film major and before I start this semester I figured I had to see a movie with such historical value. Plus, so many people have put it over as being the best movie of all time. I never had interest in the sci-fi genre, but I figured if it was good, I'd like it.Nope. Sorry. Now, I only fell asleep once, and just for a few seconds. I quickly woke up, rewinded, and decided it's best to stay awake. After all, it's the last time I'll watch the movie.I understand completely the historical value this movie has. 25 years ago this film was groundbreaking. The effects were pretty good, even by today's standards. But the movie itself is not very good. It's just average. The plot wasn't very interesting. I was given no reason to care about Luke Skywalker whatsoever. And all I kept thinking throughout the whole thing was "Wow, I never realized how much Independence Day took from Star Wars... but that movie did it so much better!"I expect a ton of Star Wars nerds to send me hate mail for not totally digging this "Great" movie. WAKE UP people. There's so many better movies out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I've got a bad feeling about this." - Han Solo, Star Wars There's no reason to have a bad feeling about "Star Wars." The film is as shallow as a donut hole and a pure masterpiece. Rarely have I seen a shallow motion picture also be a memorably exciting and visually dazzling one, also. There's something more to "Star Wars" than just good visual effects, though. It is a fun movie, a playful movie, and it inhabits our memory. I've analyzed it many times before. I came to the realization that there is simply nothing there virtually. But was there ever anything filling up classics like "2001" or "Metropolis"? Well, maybe, but that's what seperates "Star Wars" - it's just fun. Fun with holes the size of the Grand Canyon. To fully understand the significance of "Star Wars," you must understand the time. It was 1977, and audiences were still raving about the special effects witnessed in Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey." When word came out that "Star Wars" director George Lucas was borrowing the ideas of an outer space saga from Kubrick, it appeared to waiting audiences at first to be another rip-off. But something astonishing happened. Audiences were amazed to see that Lucas had actually improved upon Kubrick's space vision of the future. This was the first film to ever show a space-projected background move with the camera. This was the first film to see hyper-speed space fighters duking it out at lightspeed. "Star Wars" was the first of its kind. It wasn't as serious as "2001," it's not even necessarily a better film, it's just a different film, and no one and nobody expected that. To go into the plot is pointless, as (a) it really makes no particular sense and (b) it is already known by everyone around the world. I will say that the actors involved in this film (Ford, Hamill, Fisher, Guinness, Jones, etc.) all did a great job. How often do you see such a great cast make you care about their characters? Harrison Ford steals the show as Han Solo, and the robot droids R2-D2 and C-3PO have chemistry (I never thought I'd say that about robots). The film seems to be filled to the rim with nonsense spiritual dialogue about the Force - something that is all around us and joins our spirits together - but the dialogue is so cheesy it must be so awful on purpose. The actual story behind the film is a metaphorical study of the Bible. The Force is God and Darth Vader is Satan, and all the subplots going on are very reminiscent of spiritual warfare. "Star Wars" is an updated telling of the Bible, full of hyperspace battles and lightsaber fights. The special effects in "Star Wars" were so revolutionary that George Lucas started his own special effects company named ILM, and the film itself inspired so many rip-offs over the year it is amazing. Everyone - everyone - knows this movie. Just like "Casablanca," "It's a Wonderful Life," and so on and so forth, this is a film everyone remembers, and probably always will. And those in the future who may forget about this motion picture...well... May the Force be with them. 5/5 Stars -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this, I was very young and fell asleep midway thru. I finally saw it on the re-release cause I was sick of being one of the few people that never saw it all the way thru. I guess I would have been better off staying awake in '77 cause I really was not impressed. Maybe back in '77, when special effects were not as good as they are today, I would have been impressed. And to be honest, I am not a sci-fi nut. I can see the attraction, but I will never buy into the hype. It is decent....ok, at best, in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Better Remove Those Rose-Colored Glasses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your nostalgic, starry-eyed, inner-child has deceived you, then, just remember this - Star Wars was not intended to be viewed as a religious experience, nor was it a metaphysical endeavor in any way, shape, or form.I fully agree that Star Wars may be fine entertainment for any adolescent to enjoy, but it is surprising to see just how bad it actually is when you view it as an adult. Any reverence one holds for Star Wars can easily be summed up as childhood illusion.Star Wars is incredibly over-rated, badly acted, and a prime example of horrible story-telling. Its weak, clichéd plot that caters to a teenage, male, sex fantasy only serves to provide a thoroughly rotten structure for the entire Star Wars saga.Star Wars' special effects aren't even as impressive as those of 2001: A Space Odyssey, a film which actually predates Star Wars by 10 years.And to make matters worse, Star Wars featured some really lousy characters, like an unattractive, almost masculine-looking Princess Leia; a wimpy, pipsqueak hero - Luke Skywalker; and an annoying, gay, ninny-of-a-robot - C-3PO.I had to laugh when it came to Darth Vader's musical cues. After a while I knew exactly when Vader was due for a screen appearance just by the way the background music would suddenly change in its tone, from light'n'lively to heavy'n'ominous.Yep. You better remove those rose-colored glasses, everyone, 'cause Star Wars' greatness is a childhood illusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's official, Carrie Fisher is a joke of an actress.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The same with Mark Hamill.The good things: Good concept, nice plot, very good SFX (though not as good as in 2001, at least in my opinion), good score (though Willams is generally overrated) and acting of Harrison Ford and especially Alec Guiness.Now, the minuses.1) The dialogue. Childish.2) Logic. When you look at the Empire soldiers you wonder :How is it possible that with a bunch of such unskilled, stupid and poorly trained idiots it managed to defeat the Republic. It's a mystery. Lucas could hire Stevie Wonder or Ray Charles, and at least then I would understand why none of them managed to wound any of our heroes. Come on it's not that difficult; Rosie O'Donnel would be worse target. They were supposed to be the best soldiers in the galaxy (I believe OWK said sth like that).3) And now for the acting. Mark Hamill is just an annoying piece of wood, but Carrie Fisher...... arrrgh. The best part is when Alderaan is blown up. The reaction of Leia is not "I will kill you", "You b******s", "Nooooooooooo" , no cry, no despair. It's just "ahh" (or sth like that). Come on lady! It's not as if Darth Vader said "You can't go for a date, go to your room" or "No, I'm sorry, I can't give you my car tonight, daddy needs it". Your home planet has just been destroyed, billions of innocent people died, your family was probably there!!! Show something!!! Curse! Shout! Cry! Spit at his face! Kill Lucas (that would be the best idea)! Burn the Empire flag as a sign of protest! But for God's sake don't act as if somebody has just bought the dress you wanted.Now I hope that the plans for the remake of 'Casablanca' will change, as Ben and J.Lo should rather try in this one. They'd definitely win hands down.And finally, I can't believe it's #9 in Top250, especially when you see so many incredible movies below (Empire Strikes Back #15, Matrix #33, 2001 #58(!!!!), Alien #64, Blade Runner #80, to mention sci-fi only). But those didn't sell so many posters, toys, stickers etc.Better watch Empire Strikes Back instead.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From "Star Wars " onwards,sci-fi became the most popular genre for a while.It as a return to simplicity,in spite of the huge special effects.Actually,the screenplay could have been written by a ten-year old,and the characters ,stereotyped and Manichean ,will not do any harm,will not raise intellectual dilemma.Princess Leia Organa is totally sexless and seems to come from some forgotten fairy tale.Luke is a pale shadow from a knight of the round tables without a Graal to conquer,and Han Solo is the masculine raider we've already seen in a lot of movies. Humor,like in Fredric's Brown tales?none,unless the two robots count. Mystery ,like in AC Clarke's 2001?none,unless Darth Vader 's hidden identity counts? The last quarter of the movie recalls a giant video game. After "star wars"(and close encounters of the third kind) ,intellectual sci-fi was over the hill;now two kinds would share the market between them:the harmless sci-fi for toddlers and brats(Star War saga,ET,the black hole)and the horrific ,brainless and witless sci-fi (Alien and sequels)"2001" became an ET movie and its overwhelming genius did not influence anymore,alas.</fullReview>

It was spectacular and it is JUST the first in a line of three films we have to travel back to that galaxy far, far, away. If you hated the first episode, you have forgotten what it was like to experience that place from the very start.No doubt, the 1st of George Lucas' saga is the best (with EMPIRE coming a close second), but the excitement is there, the galaxy has expanded, we see a younger version of Sir Alec Guiness played well by Ewan McGregor, and Lucas is behind it all more than ever. Watch Episode IV - A New Hope and remember what we will be arriving at. For God's sake, use your imagination.

		<shortDescription>Historically inaccurate...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although entertaining, this 1977 film which depicts the Star Wars employs too much artistic licence to be considered a historical epic. Telling the story of Luke Skywalker (who was far from an innocent farmboy as depicted here - he was a thrillseeking billy the kid type actually, read "Skywalker, Thrillkills and Military Drills" by RM Housebottom) Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope begins with the infamous boarding of Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher) diplomatic mission returning to Alderaan by Darth Vader and his Stormtroopers.Stowing plans to the Empires new weapon aboard an escape pod in the care of droid R2 D2, Leia is captured by Darth Vader and intorrogated. R2 D2 lands on Tattoine, where he meets Luke Skywalker and the adventure to rescue the princess begins.Now, to point out some historical flaws with this film:1. Inaccurate portrayal of stormtroopers - In reality, there were a vast number of Stormtroopers who disagreed with Vader's "use the force" policy and openly mocked him behind his back, some even inciting rebellion in the ranks. None of this conflict was depicted in this film.2. Inaccurate portrayal of jawas - These tribal people were far from nattering little things in overcoats, they were a deeply spiritual people who would never go around selling scrap metal....that was just bizarre. Andas for that language? Everyone knows the jawas spoke Latin.3. Laser guns - um...bows and arrows people. The real Luke Skywalker fought with his bare hands, like Captain Kirk. The old fashioned way.4. The Death Star - was never actually called the death star, that was a rebel term given to it. To the Empire it was known as The Recreation Ball, and it was a centre of shopping and fine dining for many of the Empire's middle and upper class. In this film it is depicted as a planet killing sphere of death...which it did occasionally, but certainly not as often as this propaganda would have you believe.So, in conclusion, if you want an accurate representation of some space war of the distant past, rent Steel Magnolias, with Julia Roberts. Great, underrrated sci-fi flick that is just the antidote to a night of "Star Wars"...lame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 1977</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Lucas' 1977 science fiction epic Star Wars was a great film that I consider to be a masterpiece that is also one of the best movies ever made. The movie tells the story about Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) who joins forces with the Jedi, a cocky pilot, and a wookie to help save the world. This was a groundbreaking achievement for it's time and it still is. Writer- director George Lucas really knows science fiction just like a few other directors like Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and James Cameron, and Stanley Kubrick who crafted masterpieces like Alien, E.T., Avatar, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Lucas uses a great cast for this movie besides Hamill which includes Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, David Prowse, and Alec Guinness. Not only that but it was a film that deserved all of the Oscars that it was nominated including Best picture and best director for Lucas.</fullReview>

If you know someone who hasn't seen Star Wars please sit them down and make them watch it. Whether you start with 4-6 and go 1-3 or 1-6. It doesn't matter. Star Wars is a beautiful work of art and imagination. I love A New Hope and I think I am going to watch it now. This movie will forever stand the test of time.

		<fullReview>More than 30 years and probably 10 watchings (this time blu-ray) I can say - boy, what a crap! Even three stars are too much now. I know, being much younger and all in those times this movie was like "end of the world". I didn't notice incredible stupidity lines (yes, Sir Alec was right; see trivia), horrible (if any at all) acting and lame sfx (some of them were quite good, though - x wings for instance). Also, if you watch this movie now after first three parts, it's even worse. "Old friends" Obi Van and Anakin behave almost like they've never met before. Luke and Lea are twins like a kangaroo and a shark, and whatsoever have no resemblance with their parents Padme and Ani. In this "fourth" part technology is deteriorated beyond belief (nothing to do with sfx!), as the Star Wars universe went couple of hundreds of years backwards compared to the Revenge of the Sith (episode III). The casting is also lame but was probably good for that time ("hey, guys, who wants to star in a movie and probably get paid?"). I never thought much of Mr. Lucas as a director and this movie proudly proves it. Someone (not George Lucas!) should remake the second part of the trilogy, and patch all the holes (of which many are wider than the Solar system). Try to save what could be saved and make these movies proper and balanced sequels. Kids will always buy stuff like this. It will always be a cult and a favorite fairy tale. And a soap-opera for grownups, of course. And yes: over- weighted rebel pilot's name is Porkins :) Oh, I forgot the spoilers mentioned above! Here they are: spoilers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent classic science fiction film. The movie has the illusion of a high dollar film for a low budget price tag.I saw this film when it first came out in 1977, I was a mere 5 years old, but it made an impression in my memory that I still cannot shake to the very day. No one back then knew that the movie would become iconic - but it did.What George Lucas created is extraordinary - even considering the fact the budget was limited (and you would never know it by watching the film). The special effects and costuming are phenomenal for the time era plus factoring in the limited funding to create the film (even by today's standards). The sets and ships appear elaborate yet there was not much to them.The story is captivating and well executed by the actors playing the roles. I will not rehash the story for those that have seen it nor will I ruin the film for those who have not.It is a must see movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To fend off any instant murder threats let me begin with the fact that I do acknowledge Star Wars importance in the history of movies, it was a milestone and forever changed our movie experience. It is today a classic connected with fond memories for a lot of people.However I grade movies compared to current movies, that's the way I do it and to be frank, Star Wars (IV, V and VI) does not deliver comparably in this day and age. I am not a Star Wars fan, nor am I a Star Trek fan, but I do love a good science fiction movie or series.That special effects, sound and visual quality are not any longer top notch, despite several brush ups and remixes, well that's just the way it goes with movies that age. It is fully natural, although I must say that for a movie that's soon 30 years old it is not as bad as you would expect. On the other hand that's the remixed and re brushed editions I'm talking about, the ones out on DVD. These drawbacks is however far from my main concern and definitely not why I consider the original Star Wars trilogy to be overrated. No, the main problem as I see it is what they _could_ have done when they actually created these movies. Acting, directing and dialogue.Acting and directing is definitely sub-par, to say the least, and I find myself sighing through most of the scenes. Dialogue is just as bad and definitely does not help the situation, to be blunt it is usually downright idiotic and dumb. And this combined, well they make the characters appear to have an IQ lower than their shoe number, at least with the exception of Chewbacca. I just cannot help myself from getting the feeling that I'm watching a really cheesy budget Hollywood production. The type you realise in less than a year, the type that goes straight to video.That being said, Star Wars is a great adventure, it has a fairly good story overall and some ship designs that I'm really fond of. Something I would love to hear is a remake being in the works, let's hope Lucas is as money hungry some keeps saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly there are movies that define their eras. Star Wars, is a 70's movie, that relates well to other time periods, while at the same time losing meaning as time goes by. it doesn't help that George Lucas has decided to ruin the meaning of his film, by adding the first three chapters --- which take the mystery away from BOOK 4 and takes away from the joy of the subsequent films.I never understood the great hoopla behind this film. I first saw it in college, but I felt, that although okay, it was not great science fiction. and although I do appreciate that the film was the "thing to do" in 1977, I don't think it held any special meaning to me in 1996.Great Science Fiction fascinates, it asks unanswerable questions. This is not Science Fiction, it is Fantasy, and as a Fantasy piece, it has been replaced by The Lord of the Rings as the best Fantasy movie series out there. I'm sure The Lord of the Rings will be seen as a turn of the 21st Century film, that clearly only speaks to that era --- but that's the way it is. Star Wars is a great movie. Just not one of the true greatests.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best film ever made, period! Allow me to take a contrary view. Not the best film ever made (Les Enfants du Paradis, The Godfather, The Bicycle Thief). Not the best science fiction film (2001, Bladerunner, Gattaca, Code 46) Not even the best film about periods (Carrie).Star Wars brought two things to the audience for the first time; decent sound and visual production and mass marketed toy tie-ins. The first is laudable; the second is where you suspect George Lucus' real talent lies.Like most adults in their early thirties, I got my first taste of Star Wars when I was too young to know better. We were too poor to afford the cinema then, so I watched it on the small screen and still liked it. But now I know better. Star Wars contains some of the hammiest, crummiest dialogue ever uttered by respectable actors. "Feel the force, Luke!" Yeah, whatever. If that wasn't enough, Lucas then went back and mucked up that tiny amount character consistency which made it out of the first cut.Star Wars, made at the height of the Cold War and the nadir of American foreign policy, is the good ole story of good ole America spreading its good ole values against a dark, satanic empire. Sound familiar? It's also the story of a poor orphan boy who runs away, rescues a beautiful princess and saves a kingdom from an oppressive tyranny. Sound familiar? Oh yes, and on the way he meets an old man with strange powers, an untrustworthy adventurer and a band of rebels hiding in a forest. Sound familiar? Of course, there is a reason for this. A simple reason. A long time ago in, well, America, Mr Lucas picked up a copy of Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces. This book outlines the fact that all stories have a core of elements in common. Indeed, at a plot level, most stories are essentially the same. Excellent, thinks Lucas, that means I can legitimately rip off better films like the Hidden Fortress and the Dam Busters, better stories like Hamlet and Robin Hood and bastardise Buddhism and Confucianism into the bargain. No need for any original thought whatever, in fact.And thus it was to prove. From the ghostly mentor to the father bearing a terrible secret, Star Wars rehearses every conceivable cinematic (and indeed sub-literary) cliché. Along the way, it inflicts upon us some truly awful dialogue and a paper-thin plot.But these are not the biggest crimes of the film. The worst is that Lucas did not even copy effectively. He forgets, for example, that perfect characters are uninteresting. Mark Hamill may be a fine actor, but his goody-goody clean-cut character grates after just a few minutes of screen time. Harrison Ford fares rather better as Han Solo ? so why does Lucas go back and make him fire second in the space bar? It's not just petty, it's puerile.Possibly I should relax, hang loose, go with the flow and not get so uptight. But I just can't help getting irritated. Star Wars is puerile nonsense of the worst kind. The best you can say of it is that it brings the McDonalds experience into the cinema. The worst it is a borderline insult to everyone's intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, Star Wars is such a part of media culture that it's hard to not have heard much about most of these characters, and about the storyline. I honestly thought "I am your father!" would happen here, oh well. It certainly took me long enough to see it, but it's hard to resist this film. The characters really do make it what it is though, and the actual "wars" is probably the least interesting part of it for me. It's a simply drawn narrative and plot, but it's a testament to the quality of the writing here that the characters are able to simply click and instantly give us the emotional satisfaction that they require. This is of course, a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of fantasy or sci-fi. I have yet to see any Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings movies, but I am a film buff. I remember going to see Star Wars when it first came out, and unlike my friends, never saw the fascination with it? Basically, the guy in white fights the guy in black, along with the goofy sidekick ( Solo &amp; Chewbacca) to save a damsel in distress. All this with the slapstick character actors being C3PO and R2D2.If this not a total rip-off of many B westerns &amp; Knights in shining armor movies? Another local boy does good thing? Yes, enjoyable to watch, but nothing outstanding here I have always felt?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was younger, and I saw this film for the first time, I thought it was pretty good, not great, but good. But having recently seen it again with a much more critical eye, I've noticed that its actually quite poor. The special effects didn't really hold up well, and the plot is pretty standard. The acting is laughable (I was literally laughing at some points). Perhaps, when it came out it represented something new and fresh, but time has not been kind to this movie, which does mean something, in my opinion. So, I give it a 6 out of 10, even though I'm inclined to give it a 1 because its score is awfully inflated.</fullReview>

Ok, it was ground-breaking once, it changed the movie industry as we know it forever, it captivated the imagination of the millions, it became a cultural phenomenon, blah, blah, blah. I love fairy tales, fantasy and science fiction, but I just cannot bring myself to really love the Star Wars movies.The acting is abysmal, the main characters are shallow, uninteresting cardboard cut-outs, the script is laughable and the pacing is sluggish for the most of the film. The special effects were probably awesome back in the 70s, but they don't seem like anything special now. There're just two things I like about this movie: John Williams' terrific, rousing score and Darth Vader - a truly memorable villain with a real presence. You could argue that it is essentially a kids' movie, but I've seen a lot of children movies (like Toy Story and its sequel, which made me feel like an awe-struck, wide-eyed kid again) that are ten times funnier, sharper, more imaginative and exciting than the Star Wars.</fullReview>

To say it is a fun film, fine. To say it was visually dazzling, great. But to proclaim from the treetops that it is the pinnacle of film, and that we should all bow down and worship the mighty Lucas for creating this wonder is simply dumb. Lucas set out to do two things: A) pay homage to the old Buck Roger's serials, and B) utilize the basic storytelling archetypes from the myths of old. (Joseph Campbell can tell you more about those than I). I feel he accomplished both of these goals. Unfortunately, he failed to insert an intelligent story along with it. For all those who say that film should be merely lighthearted entertainment, I say balderdash. You only think that because you've been brought up on things like 'Star Wars', which is just mindless laser battles and funny robots (nowhere near as good as its successor, 'The Empire Strikes Back', a film I really enjoy).</fullReview>

There's not a decent hand to hand fight in this or its sequels.The light sabre duels are pathetic,just middle aged men waving torches at each other.And if the events in "THE PHANTOM MENACE" take place twenty years before "STAR WARS",how come the fighting abilities of the protagonists are at least ten times faster and more proficient than the heroes in the original trilogy. As for the space battles,so what? Just an elaborate reworking of World War 2 movie dogfights and they were boring too.Admittedly John Williams' rousing score is one of the great movie themes and the final prize giving scene is great but what did they do that was so heroic......Now if only Harrison Ford had been involved in some Indiana Jones style fisticuffs,then what a movie "STAR WARS" might have been.Sorry Mr.Lucas.Nice try but no cigar</fullReview>

Here is a simple plot line for those alien people who haven't seen it yet. The Empire covering a whole galaxy is tracking down the last of a peace keeping force known as the Jedi Knights. The leader of the "hunting party" trying to catch the princess, a rebel, is Darth Vader, a second in command type of person who works for the Emperor. He is a cyborg, but that is made up for by him being very strong and talented with the use of a light saber. He and the Emperor along with the Empire have created a large space station known as the Death Star. Luke Skywalker, a young man from a desert planet, destroys the Star when he becomes a hero working for the rebels. I rate the film 4/10. The special effects are great. Acting i would class as in between blooper stage and good stage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I`ve never really thought much of STAR WARS . I remember when it was released in 1977 everyone was going bannanas as to how good it was . I finally managed to see it when it was broadcast on television in 1982 and was very disappointed with what I saw , okay it was entertaining to a certain degree but I didn`t believe for one moment it deserved the hype or massive audience figures . One other thing that sprung to my mind many years later is that it`s unoriginal!!!! SPOILERS TO THIS AND LOTR !!!!I can`t help thinking that Obi Wan Kenobi has been based on Gandalf from LORD OF THE RINGS . They`re both wise old men , they both " die " a heroic death and both come come back as etheral beings in the trilogy and both are played in the films by Knights of the stage. However whereas Ian Mckellan gives an outstanding performance as Gandalf Alec Guinness has little impact as Obi Wan . I do not say this lightly as I rate Guinness as the greatest actor of the 20th century . In fact as one reviewer has already pointed out none of the actors give much of a performance except Harrison Ford who is the only member of the cast who went onto become a household name . Compare the performances of the cast of the LOTR trilogy who could all easily pass as Knights of the stageI`m not saying this is a bad movie - it`s not . It is entertaining and does have a sense of humour and the costume design is excellent especially the stormtrooper uniforms but what I`m saying is it`s not a great one either and certainly doesn`t deserve to be in the IMDB top ten movies .And as a footnote is it just coincidence that Christopher Lee was cast in ATTACK OF THE CLONES after appearing in LORD OF THE RINGS ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film with its campaign of spin-off toys, T-shirts, mugs etc created hype as we know it and set the pattern for the hype surrounding Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and He-Man. No wonder Mel Brooks spoofed it in Spaceballs ("Spaceballs, the flame thrower"!) It's one of the most overrated films ever made. It came top in Channel 4's list of the 100 greatest films but frankly Star Wars coming top in that poll and The Godfather coming No2 is a bit like Joe Dolce's Shaddapayourface beating Ultravox's Vienna to No1 in the UK music charts in 1981. It is not that great a film and the people who let it take over their lives and boast about having seen it tens of thousands of times are very sad. As Carrie Fisher says "It's a great movie, but get a life". George Lucas said he was wanting to recreate the spirit of the old Flash Gordon serials and he did to a degree succeed. Looking at it now, it looks as dated as Flash Gordon. The art deco spaceships in Flash Gordon exude the air of the 1930s and there are some hairstyles and clothes in this film that are very reminiscent of the awful fashions of the 1970s.The scene where Luke and Han Solo are shooting at the enemy spaceships has the look of a 1970s arcade game. Like Flash Gordon a lot of the dialogue is very corny (in fact it dismayed Harrison Ford when he read the script). The cheesiest line has to be when Luke Skywalker sees the hologram of Princess Leia and says "Who is she? She's beautiful.".It is so overpoweringly cheesy it is like having your nose shoved in Stilton. OK, there's no denying Carrie Fisher is a very nice looking woman but "beautiful" is a bit extreme. Mind you I think if the film was being made nowadays Luke would say "Who is she? She's hot". Sir Alec Guinness didn't like this film either despite receiving a sizeable chunk of the profits. He would discard any fan letters he received that made mention of Star Wars. There must have been lorryloads of discarded letters leaving his house every day when the film first came out1</fullReview>

The problem is that not only is the film a tad boring but it suffers from bad acting from the likes of Alic Guinness who's performance and obi one is embarrassingly comical and has nothing on Ewan McGregor. Carrie fisher is supposed to be the main female character but she is no Natalie Portman and that's in both her performance and her look. Mark Hamil is great as Luke Skywalker and it's hard to fault the rest of the cast. The worst moment in the film is the lightsaber battle (if you can call it that) between obi one and Darth Vader witch is the most ridiculous and embarrassing thing I have ever seen. Star wars is overall a bad film when you compare it to the likes of the empire strikes back or the fantastic prequels. The only use of the film is that it is needed to complete the entire saga.

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I was blown away. The space ships seemed so real because they weren't shiny and bright, but dirty and worn. I'd never seen a weapon as cool as the light sabers -- that, and the Jedi mind-trick made the film seem like science fiction mixed with a sword and sorcery world. The comedy from the androids, and Han Solo was also great, and to a young kid, the anti-hero behavior of Han Solo made it seem genuinely real.I loved it.Looking back, I think it was a great film for its time, well deserving of a place in movie history. But today, we can see it, very clearly, that what truly carried this film, was its special effects. It was the Matrix of its time, utilizing amazing techniques never seen before. Apart from that, the film really doesn't have much going for it. Compare Star Wars with Kubrick's 2001, which was made several years before it. It is clearly a superior Sci-Fi film.The biggest tragedy about this film is that George Lucas did so little with his career, apart from this string of Star Wars flicks. In my opinion, American Graffiti was a far better film - I may not have considered it to be so when it was released, but in retrospect, it clearly is. It showed that Lucas really could do interesting things. Instead, he squandered his talents on remaking the same flick over and over. If Spielberg had done the same, we'd be left with no Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Color Purple, ET, or Jaws, but just an endless string of Indiana Jones, or Jurassic Park flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never understood the fascination with this film. The special effects aren't that impressive (simple mat-shots done on black-screen with inanimate objects) even by 70s standards (Superman's were far superior as they required matting a moving person). The story is practically plaguiarized from Kurosawa's "The Hidden Fortress". The characters play like a cheesy soap opera, with bad dialogue to match. The only person in the film with onscreen charisma is Harrison Ford (which explains the directions of careers after the SW films). The fascination that "Warmongers" have had with this series of movies (this one, in particular)is beyond my meager understanding: It's obvious to anyone who isn't a sick freak obsessed with these movies that Lucas &amp; co. made it all up as they went along (no epic master plotline as many mongers wish to believe--Lucas was on a journey with no destination), which left them with each successive production to try and write their way out of the box they'd previously written themselves into (luke i am your father-but you killed my father-only in a manner of speaking--what nonsense is that?).Sorry, gang.

		<shortDescription>It is a awful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watch this movie a few weeks ago in television. Theard that it was a great movie from my friends, but I don't think so. It was so boring that I had to drink coffee to keep me awake during the movieAt first, it spreads the minds of violence. The people in the film were always fighting to solve the problems. The show of fighting skill is good. However, many children were watching the movie. They might confuse that only violence can solve problems.After that, the whole story was unrealistic. At the last battle of the story, the main character use "the force" to destroy the Death Star. It is not scientific. In the world, there are no energy make you shot a specific object without measurement.Lastly, the audience were confused about the content of the story. This film is the fourth episode of the story, but the producer made it first. There are not enough explanation of the whole story. The audience may not know what is happening when they watch the movie.This is a movie that is a waste of time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people give this movie a 10 out of 10 because they don't consider the movie but rather how happy they were to discover it as a child but now, in 2005, it has become obviously outdated, the script is quite bad and the acting is even worse. Alec Guinness himself asked Lucas to get killed at the end in order to get rid of the awful dialogs and the bad acting. I am sorry I cannot just keep on lying about this movie: this is for your kids but in now way should it be put among masterpieces. IMDb is a web site about movies, not about cult and self-proclaimed nerds or geeks. You have to determine how good is a movie according to artistical criteria, neither to your gregarious instinct nor to your "attitude".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most over-rated movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is easily the most over-praised science fiction film and one of the most over-praised films of all time! The plot is childish and barely existent, the characters are poorly developed, the acting (except for Alec Guinness) is stone, the story has no substance and the special effects are NOT timeless (if you want effects that still work by today's standards, rent Kubrick's 2001, made 9 years earlier). I really hate to ruin this for you, but A New Hope is as superficial and special effects driven as The Phantom Menace (though the latter is even more childish than A New Hope). About the only reason I can recommend this film is because it lays the setting for two good sequels. There, I said it, now you can attack me with your light saber toys and TIE Fighter models if you want, but Star Wars is an awful movie only valued as a classic for its now dated special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what is so great about this film that bores. So it was released in the 70s, that time there must of been better films. It has this stupid villain Darth Vader that irritates with his voice. If he is so powerful that he can kill with his mind. Why doesn't he just kill off the Heroes in that way, then wasting time. This movie is very childish, full of boring characters that annoy. There is a fight scene where Harrison Ford is shooting at 100s of Robots with lazer guns. Not a single shot gets him, how is that possible. I have worked in a cinema for over 2 years and witnessed the release of Revenge of the Sith. I am shocked that all these hundreds of people like this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie when it first came out. As a teenager, I saw it about seven or eight times (there was nothing else to do on weekends.) About twenty years went by before I saw it again, on cable. How time dulls the memory! "Star Wars" now has an odd, nauseating effect on me: the 70's haircuts, laughable costumes, cheesy dialog, fake visual effects, corny music, uninteresting soap-opera plot... (I could go on and on.) I sat there, before the flickering screen, enveloped in "Star Wars'" suffocating stupidity, wondering how in the hell I could ever have liked this thing. I finally came to my senses and turned the channel after hearing John Williams' irritating "Darth Vader" theme for the 600th time in the first 40 minutes. Why George Lucas decided we needed to hear this high-volume musical cue EVERY time we see Darth Vader on screen is beyond me. Maybe he just thinks his audience is extremely stupid and is incapable of remembering that Darth Vader is supposed to be evil. I don't know...It would be easy to dismiss this movie as nothing but fluff to entertain kids (because that's all it is, and all it was ever intended to be) but unfortunately, for many people, this thing has become their religion. Folks, get a life before it's too late! It's just a movie.</fullReview>

This is just a basic kid's story about good vs. evil, with a princess, etc. some good moments - the death star, the desert, but too few to warrant such hype. also, why do all star wars fans slate the new ones, which are infinitely better?

The only redeeming feature in it's favour were the special effects. The plot (if there was one) was paper thin and the characters for the most part were totally unbelievable and shallow.

		<fullReview>Star Wars is no "masterpiece of synthesis" or "triumph of American ingenuity;" it is a fraudulent copy of several good works of literature. Lucas steals the ideas of Frank Herbert in his work entitled Dune and plagiarizes even more off of unknown novel I cannot recall as it is so obscure, he felt no need to give it credit. I have heard arguments which claim that The Lord of the Rings is just as childish, but those arguments ignore the fact that The Lord of the Rings is a blatant and outright statement, a parallel to the horrors of the First World War. Additionally, the acting is phenomenal, the characters have depth, and the story has meaning. The authors of such arguments clearly view the battle scenes as similar to Star Wars, only having appeal because of the special effects. But things such as the gigantic war elephants actually represent something, whereas nothing is representative of anything in Star Wars. These elephants represent tanks, the new and deadly weapon that were finally used more frequently in war. I can overlook the discrepancies, such as the fact that the first time the Death Star was used it took but a few seconds to fire, but when the are attacking Yavin, they must maneuver around the planet to reach the moon, as there are such discrepancies in most movies. However I cannot ignore the lack of depth each of the characters has: Luke is like Dakota Fanning in War of the Worlds--he is paid to whine, and whine, and scream, and whine. "But Uncle Owen, I was going to go the Anchorhead Arcade, I don't want to work on the droids." His character is painfully dull, and the actor, Mark Hamill, lacks any sort of talent. None of the characters are relatable, none of them have any complexity. They are all straightforward representations of archetypes, with no combinations of emotions--in fact, they seem like the have no emotions whatsoever. Everything is superficial--I enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture ten thousand times more than Star Wars, and The Motion Picture is one of the most painful movies I have ever watched. Watching Star Wars, I can picture each actor--if they may be so honored by such a title--with a script in front of their eyes. It seems they are only reading; a common acting saying goes, "Show, don't tell," but I have never been told a more boring story. Besides the painful, shallow acting, the plot is poorly written. There are no twist or turns, no interesting facets or components which one does not expect to appear; everything is predictable, everything is as plain as can be. Star Wars is "a masterpiece of synthesis:" I don't think I have ever seen a movie so perfectly blend plagiarism, horrid acting, a lack of depth and emotion and complexities, and so many other despicable aspects. As for its "ingenuity:" well, if plagiarism and poor writing, acting, and characters constitute ingenuity, then this movie deserves a 10 out of 10--if not, Star Wars most definitely deserves nothing but scorn. Why so many have found this movie so enthralling I will never understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is the script. It just never rises above the level of a Flash Gordon episode. The camera work is pedestrian. The pacing is glacial except for the last ten minutes and the back and forth storytelling (a problem in all the Star Wars movies, but especially those directed by Mr. Lucas) never lets any momentum build. Like "Phantom Menace" and espcially "Attack of the Clones", Lucas just doesn't know how to write a "scene". What we get is like a quilt of little bits that are cobbled together. Each with basically the same pace. The saving grace of "Star Wars" is some of the acting. Alec Guinness really brightens up the screen whenever he's on. And Peter Cushing brings some genuine class and star quality. I saw this movie again recently and I was stunned by what a big bore it is. I can't imagine how anyone over the age of 20 could be thrilled by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul to the Corinthians - 'when i was a child, i thought as a child and played as a child; but when i became a man, i put away my childish things.' i was living near new york city when this film was first released - i think this was a test release in the new york area; the original promo suggested a serious science-fiction story, along the lines of the cult-favorite 'dune'. it bombed. shortly afterward, on re-release Lucas got the promo he really wanted - part fairy-tale, part Jungian Ur-myth, part retro-serial - and the rest is history. but the history of what -this film marks the beginning of the end of serious film-making in America. fairy-tales are for children; the old serial films were fun, but badly made; and 'Jungian Ur-myths' constitute a debatable psycho-babble theory; thus what Lucas was really telling his audience, in both film and promo, was that we all needed to be children watching bad films written by Carl Jung - or at least Jungian literary theorist Joseph Campbell, who was actually hired as consultant on this film.humans, to maintain their self-respect, need to grapple with difficult moral issues, we need to mature, and to learn how to relate to other human beings in complex and sometimes difficult situations; and we need the freedom to think for ourselves in such matters, to risk our own happiness and to live with the consequences. no one is saying that children should not enjoy fairy-tales, and perhaps they really do need these for psychological development. but even eventually children need to 'grow-up' - to stop being children.'star wars' would not have been so damaging to this culture if it had presented itself as a children's film. but Lucas was quite explicitly targeting, as audience, burnt out hippies, participants of the failed 'cultural revolution' of the '60s; and in doing so, he began steering them toward the political decisions that would at last put our culture and its economy, and its future, into terrible jeopardy - voting for Reagan, selfishly demanding tax cuts, mockery of dissent and dissenters, and flocking into paganistic 'fundamentalist Christian' churches seeking 'spiritual awakening' and, as many now proclaim, apocalypse.well, obviously, just one movie isn't going to accomplish all that. what the success of star wars did was to distract adult attention from ethically mature films where moral choices could be examined in their complexity; to such an extent that Hollywood - never all that supportive of such films, anyway - simply stopped making such films for a time. the bottom came in 1985, when the 2 best films to use truly cinematic storytelling to wrestle with mature choices were from japan - Kurosawa's 'ran' and 'Godzilla 1985'. and you know the world's doomed when a big green lizard has to be the one to make you ask important questions about the ecology, and history, and whatever place in the larger universe our tiny species finds itself.i mention Godzilla not simply for rhetorical effect. like the old fairy-tales, Godzilla is best appreciated by the young and the young at heart; like the old serial films, the Godzilla films are filled with gaffs and silliness; like the typical Jungian Ur-myth or archetype, Godzilla calls to some deeper part of our psyche, which is why we are entertained by his appearance.but unlike star wars, the Godzilla films never insist that they are the only show around - or at least the only worth viewing. and unlike star wars, they never pretend to be better than they are, or that they're accomplishing some necessary cultural mission. and unlike star wars, they do not insist that we remain 'forever young', only that we respect our having once been young, and that we respect the youth of others. and unlike star wars, they are inherently democratic - not because they insist we all be individuals, but rather that they insist that we all are already individuals, and yet to survive, we must come together and learn to depend on one another - democracy only has value to a collective of individuals, a human society. rabid individualists are monsters - rather like Godzilla's most intractable foe, king ghidorah.well, that's the big argument. for those who prefer simple solutions - star wars is a crude, fascistic, socially-retarded scam that the ex-hippies foisted on what was once a great culture. whether it will ever achieve greatness again - or whether it shall have cinema when it does - remains open to question.'now we see as through a glass, darkly, but then face to face.'</fullReview>

And these supposedly "weird" other worlds look an awful lot like Missouri and Oklahoma. And the big spacecraft - isn't that some Ford factory they closed down in Minnesota a few years back? What's alarming here is the sad lack of imagination. Really, you need to have taken too much meth and stayed up one night too many to be able to appreciate this film - to be allow Lucas and co. convince you that there's a film to watch here.An old Republic matinée western remade as a Saturday morning cartoon by/for survivors of one acid trip too many - or too few.Save your sanity; find something real to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I wouldn't write such a bad comment about any movie, but Star Wars is simply such a mentally irritating movie that it is simply chutzpah. I don't know if the pure cynical attitude of the creators resulted this disaster, that they thought the public can digest a movie easier if it has no plot, characters even below fairytale standards told for 3 years old children, and a lot of laser-lights, or they considered this one and the whole franchise seriously. The only one respectable effort in the movie are the special effects, but be sincere, now it is quite outdated and looks rather funny even when compared to Star Trek TMP came out just 2 years later. I would gladly criticize the storyline, but I can't figure it out, what was this movie all about except hunting down a big white sphere with an enormous satellite antenna attached to it, from the space (maybe this results that Darth Vader can't watch the Superball, and become lethally angry?). I particularly like Harrison Ford, but I simply can't believe he started in this one, and to tell the truth he doesn't gives an outstanding performance compared to the other leading actors. About the leading actors, well there is an obvious reason why they couldn't make other serious movies. Even the music lacks imagination. If you sit into a piano, and start to play randomly on the white keys, in 3 minutes you can play down the main theme of SW. OK the theme for the goods are accomplished, now we need some theme for the evil, what to do? Hoorah, there are black keys on the piano as well. Start to play on them, and in 3 minutes you can play down the Imperial March. These two is varying over the movie. OK, make these two grandiose, well what to do? Yeah of course, use trumpets and clarions. Did it really worth an Oscar? Even movies like King Kong, Godzilla, Tarzan, or any '50s Dracula or Frankenstein movie, or the worst zombie movies look intellectually challenging masterpieces, full of remarkable characters and imaginative script, compared to SW. Respect for Lucas, he made the Indiana Jones stories quite well, but SW is simply a humiliation of human intelligence. Recommended for masochists.</fullReview>

I love Old Yeller, but I would hardly call it the greatest movie ever made. The second was better - the battle scenes at the beginning, the "freezing" of Han and the battle between Darth and Luke. The third one was unforgivable. Ewoks and that cheesy ending that would make Frank Capra vomit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I loooove mindless action movies. Usually I'm all for senseless violence in films. And usually, I like little furry creatures. But here's what I hate- STAR WARS STAR WARS STAR WARS!!! This is the a silly, hugely over-rated, egotistical, boring, contrived, joyless, cheap and morally bankrupt piece of garbage. There is simply nothing entertaining about this movie, or any of the trilogy. The acting is silly and self-indulgent. The story is a very tired hairball hacked up from the throats of who knows how many fairy tales (save the princess, save the universe, etc.). I wouldn't be so vehement if it weren't for the fact that Star Wars is soooo popular and it's evvveryone's favorite. *hack* And people say Titanic is over-rated? Hello? People aren't going to be jumping up and down over Titanic 20 years from now. People are still screaming about Star Wars, but this film/trilogy is anything but something that could be considered a classic. Lucas is NOT a genius, Darth Vader is a candy-a** villian, and, gentle reader, Luke Skywalker is a putz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this when I was younger, and I don't get what the big deal is. Extremely boring movie. Sure the special effects were great for its time, but nonetheless....BORING. The other Two as well. I won't even watch the newer ones now because of this. Probably the only thing I actually liked, was Princess Leah. She was hot. Carrie Fisher really had it going on back in the day. Luke, looked like a wuss. They should have got a better actor to play Luke. That moron couldn't act if his life depended on it. Darth was cool. He should have won. Everyone else should have died. Why do movies usually end where the good wins. Very rarely do you see evil win. I really HATE, Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Immature Minds Only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After wanting to see this for nearly 2 decades I finally got around to watching it...pathetic. First off, I actually did feel excited during the yellow bordered title sequence, I mean the theme music kicked in and I thought I was really in for a something special. My God was I wrong. This film is unwatchable. We have this tin can going around beeping every friggin two seconds. Easily the most annoying thing I've ever had to endure since seeing Julie Andrews (a grown woman btw) actually skipping while singing a song about confidence in the Sound Of Music. Then the dialogue sets in and let me tell you, I've never in my life heard anything so juvenile. Like I cant even revert my brain back far enough to an age where this dialogue would seem even remotely interesting, fantastic, or fun. The whole movie, script, costumes, story is just one tacky, immature mess that absolutely stunned me in its awfulness and I'm being completely serious. Turkey/5 Recommended for fans of Sesame Street, bandwagons, and all things overrated.</fullReview>

They did it well enough that this junk food has squeezed pretty much everything good off the menu. The pic is just mediocre, but the trends it started have been horrid. Cornball plotting and dialog is one thing, but the simple-minded good vs. evil masquerading as some sort of authentic spirituality is vomit inducing. The sequel, with its Freudian undertones, has some real conflict and character development and is actually a pretty good popcorn movie.

		<shortDescription>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I loved the first three star wars movies. They were great with really good special effects and acting. Also the cinematography in the first three movies was really good.Episode 4 in comparison is a big borefest. It looks like the budget for the fourth movie went downhill as the special effects become lame and unimpressive. The story is small with very few characters. In my humble opinion the lasersword battles were pretentious and slow. Another stupid thing about this movie are the sand people. They are annoying with the sound they make. Also the scene they were in ended with Lukes aunt and uncle dieing (the only good scene in the movie because of the music and good acting).The actor that plays Obi Wan Kenobi in the first threee movies is replaced by some stupid old man who doesn't know how to act. Also anakin skywalker is now Darth Vader but way less cool. In the final battle I missed scope. There were hardly any good explosions and the drama was no where to be found. A good movie should have a profound story with good action and a lot of emotion. I think this movie will disappoint any true film enthousiast on all fronts. My advice to all is to watch the first three movies and don't bother with episode four. It is all downhill from here.</fullReview>

When you consider all the facts it was made in 1977 graphics were added in the 1990's. i know this is an old movie but you think they would do this again it is 2010. yet everybody still loves this movie. How popular will it be 2077 when its 100 years old. CW (Clone Wars) is 2 years old. i bet in 2108 when its one hundred years old it will be held as one of the greatest movies of all times.

		<fullReview>being , as i am , a fan of classics such as the seminal Howard the duck and the outright classic water-world(surely Kevin Costner's finest hour) i was thoroughly disappointed on viewing the so called classic that is the messed up patchwork disaster that is star Wars episode 4. Just one example of this dire movies trademark is the 40 second panning technique, which everyone knows, when used in the wrong context (not too mention poor lighting) only drags the film into anti-climatic sequences with little reward for the viewers patience. the poor use of English grammar is also abundant with the Cookie being most guilty of this crime .... i for one could not understand a word that this thing said , and yet i am supposed to believe that the rest of the cast could as they freely reply with so called humour to his comments. I could comment as to how bad the casting is in much length; for the sake of time i will merely mention just what a terrible choice Harrison ford was. HARRISSON FORD??? why, when there are so many other talented actors out there, delroy lindo for example would have been superb as the swaggering space pirate Han solo. also , who made the crazy decision to replace the voice for Darth Vader to James earl Jones , when anyone who knows anything knows that the Cornish accent is brimming with menace and merely chose to steal proses finest hour. the plot is a complete pile of contrived rubbish as of the like i have never seen in any sci-fi, for instance anyone with only a rudimentary knowledge of alpha based gravitational upper physics would know that the destruction of a planet would have serious ramifications for the Eco system of any star system within at least a billion flighty years (and par secs don't exist). as a closing comment: if you would like to view a truly outstanding piece of sci-fi cinema, with amazing special effects, humour, fantastic action, superb cast and thrilling plot, then i refer you to (the always awesome) ice pirates, starring the charismatic Robert Ulrich (froms TV's Vegas).</fullReview>

"The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here" now here is probably close to a far away planet where they what only Dark Veither or what ever his last name was. I better watch The Lord of The Rings Trilogy a lot better and one more romantic movie which for most people is funny that I even say the name because they are people who don't understand good movies I am talking about Titanic.

The one thing it does have above the others is FANTASTIC special effects and production values - in this sense it was kind of ground breaking for a sci-fi film (though nearly 10 years earlier 2001 was doing much the same).What Star Wars DID do was start the story line for some of the best sci-fi films, and certainly the best sci-fi story line EVER. Without doubt its sequel (Empire) IS one of the best sci-fi films ever - multi-layered and dark story line, fantastic characters and a script that is a cut above the "boys own" story that star-wars had.</fullReview>

Just take a quick glance at the list above: Greedo? Jabba the Hut? Who in their right mind comes up with this stuff? Therefore our argument boils down to this: George Lucas is insane, his films reflect his mental state. Its a scary world of Gay Robots, Phallic Slugs the ultimate metaphor for aids: the force. It's not even as if this insanity is presented through good direction, great acting, stunning music and outstanding CGI, that would be OK. But it just isn't. The weak, clichéd and teenage male sexual fantasy plot provides the rotten structure that the entire saga is based around, its cheesy, poorly written tripe coupled with a sci-fi backdrop. Only in a George Lucas' crazy little world can a line like: "I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home" make any sort of sense. Bad news George it doesn't translate well out of your crazy little head. The hype born from the fact that this mess of a film was another 'first' of its generation continues to boost the movie up to seemingly everyones top ten list, don't believe this hype.

I think the "are you a Star Wars fan?" question should be asked on job interviews, because an affirmative answer is going to pretty much give you an idea on the maturity level of the applicant. -"Well, I'm an ambitious and hard working professional, I've been trained at blah-blah,...no, I don't have any children...Oh, and my friends at the Star Wars fan club call me Solo, because I kind of look like him..." - OK, that would be all...And one more thing - girls love to hear the deep and wise Yoda and Emperor quotes, too.

		<fullReview>Frankly, I think "Star wars" is a great movie. It was in a way the first of its kind and was very impressive. However, I also believe that many people are turning this movie into one of the best of all-time for nothing. I don't remember having been hit by anything surprising except for the fact that everything was in space and that people lived in battle ships. If you ask me, I think "The return of the Jedi" was the best of the trilogy (I don't include the one that came out recently since I haven't seen it). However, I won't deny the fact that there is an incredible lot of imagination contained in this classic and that one of the reasons I probably enjoyed "The return of the Jedi" the most is because of some of the questions that remain unanswered and are answered in the sequel or the third. Some of the best scenes of the trilogy are in my opinion held in the first and if George Lucas hadn't invented the story that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, "The Empire strikes back" and "The return of the Jedi" probably would not have been as good as the are. So all in all, "Star wars" is still the best of the trilogy and is a real must-see.</fullReview>

Pseudo-religions are not amusing, no matter how well dressed-up - and this film wasn't even all that well-made for it's day, it was really out-dated when it first came out.Look, go play all the computer-games you want, but spare yourself the agony of having to sit through this pretentious exercise in boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why everyone loves this stupid movie just for kids, and WHY in God's name is in the first place of ACTION MOVIES and SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES... first of all, a good action movie just can't be rated as "PG"... and come on! this is the new Millenium! now the science fiction is not just sable lasers,laser guns and all that crap which has the Word "laser" on it. Today a good science fiction movie has a GOOD plot ("the matrix"), GOOD acting ("the matrix") and something that everyone is related with (please just watch "the matrix"). I think everyone likes just because it was "great" in 1977, just because it has "great" special effects (and it really depended on them for it's success)...Now if you want to see a good Sci-Fi/Action movie watch the matrix, it is not just special effects folks...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overbloated garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really know or really even care why this film is considered such a classic. I figure if trash like Titanic is treasured so is Star Wars. It's pretty bad considering it's a remake of Akira Kurosawa's superior The Hidden Fortress. It pushes all the right buttons and tries to sound overdramatic.. When Obie Wankanobe loses, it is supposed to be some sort of holy moment. .I really didn't care.. This movie is not total garbage but just nowhere near the phenomena it deserves.. for me, at best it deserves 2 stars or a 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate Common Joe Schmoe movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had it all for Common Joe Schmoe. It had explosions, high tech special effects, plot twist, and even a comic book style story line. I can see why so many like this film, it was made for the lowest common denominator. Don't get me wrong, I thought the film was quite entertaining when I first saw it. But it seems this film has become more than a entertaining movie with groundbreaking special effects. To some this was an epiphany. An enlightening experience. I can see why an adolescent would find this to be such an experience, but an intelligent, mature person would take this film for what it was, entertaining and a visual treat as well as one of the better action/adventure films out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge letdown from the prequels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so sick of folks who think they're sophisticated film critics castigating Lucas for a) writing poor dialogue in the prequels and b) relying too much on CGI.This movie is a HUGE LETDOWN!!! What do we have? 1. NO JAR JAR BINKS, but a man in an APE SUIT named Chewbacca.2. Instead of a "whiney" Anakin, we've got a "whiney" Luke ("I was going into Tashie Station to pick up power converters!!!" Waaaah!) 3. Special effects that were so bad they had to be cleaned up in 1997.These sophisticated reviewers claim that Lucas "can't write dialogue." Is that why this film contains SO MANY quotables, not the least of which is "MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU"???? These people who condemn the prequels are disingenuous; do you honestly believe that they had rather Lucas never revisited his masterpiece? PLEASE!!! The prequels aren't perfect, but neither are the originals. Along with a man in an ape suit, we've got lines like: VADER: "They'll be nothing to stop us this time!" Luke: "I only wish... Ben were here." (After having met him only a week or so earlier) LEIA: (kissing Luke on Death Star) "For luck..." HAN: "You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark." FOR GOODNESS'S SAKES!!! The originals certainly didn't have the greatest dialogue ever, but no one's complaining. My guess is that-it's a matter of rose-colored glasses tinted by childhood.The prequels are very good...But you wouldn't know it by listening to these 30-something nerds who somehow think they could have made a better movie or movies than Lucas.If I were George Lucas, I would just release the TRULY AWFUL "Star Wars 1978 Special" on the big screen, and watch as all these sophisticated critics line up and give me their money, because they're addicted to Star Wars.As far as those who think Lucas has made the prequels "for the money..." That's preposterous! It's like saying the Rolling Stones continue to tour for cash. The fact is that both Lucas and the Stones were comfortable decades ago. They continue to practice their craft because of passion; when you're THAT rich to begin with, money has nothing to do with it.When I watch the prequels, I am vastly entertained. Now, I watch the originals and feel that they're nothing but cheap, late-70's- early 80's crap that could have been better presented in the first place.In the final analysis, stop with the moaning, and enjoy the whole thing as a fun diversion. I know this will be difficult for a nerd who thinks he/she could have done better, when all he/she could have accomplished with the prequels were it left up to him/her would have been a carbon copy of the original trilogy with (perhaps better) dialogue, but this is what Lucas has given us, and it's good enough for me.Too bad "Star Wars" doesn't live up to the hype set by its three predecessors.</fullReview>
