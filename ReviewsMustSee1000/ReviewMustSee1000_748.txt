		<shortDescription>Grim, but not entirely hopeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Middle Ages: Antonius Blok, a Swedish knight, returns from the Crusades only to find his country dying of the plague, religious fundamentalists taking over and Death himself wanting him to come along. Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess and is meanwhile driven to desperation because of the absence of God. This description sounds like a very serious, philosophical and dour film, and actually it is serious, philosophical and dour; but there is also a little warmth, hope and humor, maybe not for Antonius, but for the viewer.When Blok and Death interrupt their game of chess (due to the plague, Death is very busy), he meets two actors, Jof and Mia, with their little son, the most human characters of the film, and I don't think it's a coincidence that there names sound very much like Joseph and Mary. These people may be a little dim, but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.But the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters, as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake, as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God, religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal.Another reason for the impact this almost 50-year-old film has still today is the acting: Max von Sydow's face always seems to reflect what Antonius Blok is thinking, Nils Poppe's performance as the naive actor and caring father is priceless and Bengt Ekerot's Death became a part of film history and survived all its spoofs (the best one being in Woody Allen's tremendously funny "Love and Death"). But the best performance is done by Gunnar Björnstrand as Antonios Blok's misogynist squire, dryly commenting all their encounters even in the face of death.The Seventh Seal is not subtle in raising it's questions, that's for sure. But it makes you think about these questions nevertheless. It's disturbing and grim most of the time, but at the end it gives you the hope that it might become better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling, audacious, and awe-inspiring. An undisputed masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mysteries of religion and death have long been a popular focus among artists of all media, including film. And while many films question these mysteries, they seldom provide any real insight into the world of the unknown. In Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL, these mysteries are not only questioned; they are dissected, splayed, and scrutinized.THE SEVENTH SEAL could very well serve as sort of a manifesto for existentialism. Its deep acuity and haunting imagery is powerful enough to jar even passive viewers out of their complacency and force them to examine their own reality. The delicately crafted story centers around a 14th century knight named Antonius Block and his ongoing game of chess with a shadowy, hooded figure: Death. Bergman uses this allegory not just to personify death, but to illustrate the lengths man will go to in order to avoid it. In the end, however, Death is a much better player than any of us, and though he may humor some of his opponents by letting them think that they have the advantage, the end result is inevitable: Death always wins. No matter how skillfully we plan our moves or how determined we are to win, we can never beat Death.In Antonius's search for answers, he encounters a variety of very unique characters, each with their own outlook on life, death, faith, fear and love. Their commentary on such matters is often dryly funny and always brilliant, continuously and effectively challenging our perceptions of the world around us. For me, the dialogue was definitely the high point of the film, as it was extremely thought-provoking and carefully constructed throughout. Almost every line spoken is, in one way or another, daunting and unforgettable. Jöns's description of love as "the blackest of all plagues" is a quote that will forever be engraved in my mind.THE SEVENTH SEAL truly is a remarkable accomplishment in the world of cinema. It is a deep, mesmerizing, and darkly beautiful work of art. More importantly, THE SEVENTH SEAL is one of those rare movies that doesn't just entertain, but also has the power to change the way one thinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the magnificent 1957 classic The Seventh Seal by Ingmar Bergman, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning home from the Crusades with his squire Jöns (Gunnar Bjönstrand) meets Death (Benkt Ekerot) on a lonely beach and challenges him to a game of chess. If he wins, he lives. While the game goes on, he gets a reprieve. It is the 14th century and suffering and pain abound. Penitents flog themselves, seminarians rob the dead, people go mad from fear, and witches are burned at the stake. It is the time of the Black Plague and Death has his hands full. As in the Greek legend of Kronos and medieval folklore, Bergman depicts Death as the Grim Reaper, a man clothed from head to foot in a black habit and hood. In The Seventh Seal, however, Death is not frightening or sinister, just an old man performing his job with a wry detachment.The film opens and closes with the passage from Revelation from which it takes its title: `When he broke open the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour' (Rev 8:1). Bergman's message, however, is more about the silence of God on earth than in heaven. Block is tormented by the fact that God will not outwardly reveal himself. He says to a priest during confession, `I want God to stretch out his hand to me, reveal himself and speak to me. But he remains silent, I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there". But Block still senses the God within him and is tormented. "Why can't I kill God within me?" he asks. "Why does he live on inside me, mocking and tormenting me till I have no rest, even though I curse him and try to tear him from my heart' Block asks Death if he knows anything but he knows nothing. He even asks a woman being taken to the stake if he can see the Devil so that he can ask him about God but all she says is to look into her eyes. The Seventh Seal is not all heavy "significance", however. It has a good story with believable characters, wonderful performances, lots of comic relief and moves easily from drama to comedy as in the great Shakespearean plays. We meet an actor named Jof (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their infant son Mikael. Block looks with envy on the simple love of this family for their child. Both Jof and Block see visions of the spiritual world but Jof's visions are life affirming whereas Block sees only reflections of darkness. The film has unforgettable images such as a hawk floating in a cloudless sky, two horses standing in the surf, Jof's vision of the Virgin Mary caring for her child, and a frightening procession of plague-infected flagellants. Perhaps too melodramatic for modern viewers (it has been parodied), The Seventh Seal still touches a universal longing deep within us. Some view the film as a complete denial of God, but it seems that God does show his face -- only Block and his squire cannot see it. It is there in the wild strawberries, the fun of watching a troupe of players perform, the innocence of the little boy, the eyes of the young lovers, and the haunting visions of Jof. The film ends on a note of affirmation including one of the most memorable scenes in the history of cinema, the Danse Macabre, the Totentanz -- a string of silhouetted figures dancing in a line with arms outstretched as they are about to enter the unknown. In the magnificence of his vision and the timeless beauty of his art, Bergman has answered the question about God's existence simply in the act of posing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingmar Bergman questions the meaning of life, death, faith, and the existence of God in this masterpiece of world cinema...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antonius Block - "Who are you?" Death - "I am Death." Antonius Block - "Have you come for me?" Death - "I have long walked by your side." Antonius Block - "So I have noticed."The Seventh Seal, considered by some to be Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement, is the desperate prayer of a sensitive, introspective, and insightful young man confused by the horrors of the world around him. Ingmar Bergman's films are often very deep, full of symbolism, philosophy, spirituality, emotion, and thought. The Seventh Seal is classic Bergman. Expressing his fear of life with no meaning, death with no understanding, and faith with no validity, Ingmar Bergman takes us deep into the well of his mind.As the Black Plague ravages the world, a Antonius Block and his squire, Jons (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand, respectively), return from fighting in the Crusades. They find their homeland devastated by the plague, their countrymen mad with fear, and their cause lost. Antonius Block is confronted by Death (Bengt Ekerot). Block challenges Death to a game of chess to provide him time to seek answers to the questions that plague his mind as Death has plagued his country. Death accepts, knowing that Block cannot escape his fate, and the two begin their game. As the story continues, Block and Jons meet with several testaments to the agony that the Black Death has brought upon their land. They find a young girl who is to be burned at the stake for having been with the Devil. They find madness in the eyes of all they meet, as everyone is convinced that God is angry and is punishing the world with the plague. They also find a small group of travelling actors, who appear to be the only souls to have remained sane in the midst of all of the death and fear. Block and Jons move across the countryside in the hopes of finding safety in Block's castle, but Death is always around the corner, biding his time.Brilliantly conceived, and stunningly executed, Bergman's vision is brought to the screen through Gunnar Fischer's powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you for the rest of your life. Strong performances from everyone involved bring humanity to the film. Max Von Sydow's brave and conflicted Antonius Block matching wits with Bengt Ekerot's sinister, omnipotent Death is a microcosm of the forces at work in this breath-taking interpretation of the mortal struggle.A masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most extraordinary movies ever made. I cannot recommend 'The Seventh Seal' highly enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Seventh Seal' is universally regarded as a masterpiece. It's one of those classics like 'Citizen Kane', 'Rear Window' or 'The Godfather' that has subtlety entered popular culture, so even if you haven't actually seen it you recognize references to it in other movies, TV, magazines and everyday conversation. The thing is like the aforementioned and 'Rashomon' and 'Sunset Blvd' it isn't regarded as a masterpiece for nothing, it really is one. I think anybody who loves movies will be totally knocked out by 'The Seventh Seal'. It's still one of the most extraordinary movies ever made. Visually it's stunning, the acting is first rate, and the end result is mesmerizing. Once seen never forgotten is a cliche, but it's the perfect description for this amazing film. Max von Sydow brilliantly plays Antonius Block, a knight returning from the Crusades who challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot) to a chess match. He is accompanied on his journey home by his cynical squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Jons is my favourite character in the movie, and as good as von Sydow is Bjornstrand's performance is even better. I also was very taken by the traveling actors who become part of Block's entourage, Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and confess to developing quite a crush on Mia. I cannot recommend 'The Seventh Seal' highly enough. Don't be put off by Bergman's highbrow reputation, this is a movie that can be appreciated by anybody, especially by old school horror fans. While it isn't strictly a horror movie itself anyone who admires the James Whale and Val Lewton classics of the 1930s and 1940s will find much to enjoy here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Bergman Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that can be certain after watching the Seventh Seal, outside of being thankful for living in this century, is that Bergman knows his film-making- and imagery. He uses subliminal and not so subliminal techniques to convey a dying, frightened world, where making a living is almost impossible and the debate of god's control over life is discussed like un-rhyming yet fascinating poetry. The result is beautiful cinema, capturing the always foreboding fear and allure of the almighty and for the waiting death, appropriately staged in post-crusades, mid dark age Europe. Max Von Sydow gives an excellent showing as the opponent of Death (in a clever and meticulous chess game), yet the character of Death, played by Bengt Ekerot with chilling conviction, steals the show, if only for the alluring quality of the character. Even if the story veers it veers in good and interesting territory, focusing on people who convey Bergman's point and or style. I can't reveal what the bottom line point is (many newcomers to Bergman's work won't either, especially if you're not in the mood for soul searching), but one thing is for certain, an allegory on life and death is shown perfectly in the second to last shot of the reaper and his minions following in a dance across the field. This is one of the most pure of cinema's masterpieces and certainly Bergman's best cine. A++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Personal Rejection of a Religious Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Antonius Block is the story of an agnostic who has begun to doubt. Is life really meaningless? Is the only true ethic of life, to simply enjoy the moment? If God is there, why does he not answer? Why does he leave men with kind hearts and noble aspirations to fumble in the dark dying of the plague with no answers? Perhaps, Antonius reasons, the answers only come from Death.No wonder then, that as Death approaches him, he cajoles the spirit to play a game with him. His intentions are to win, but most importantly, to find answers. The little I know of Bergman's youth, the Paladin (Antonius Block) seems to symbolize Bergman's last struggles with his strict religious instruction as a child. Antonius' struggles, Antonius' angst, Antonius' withering agnosticism is a reflection of where Bergman was philosophically at this early stage in his life and career.The climax of the film is of course the final 'duel' with Death. Antonius attempts to cheat death and in the end, death cheats him. This is an especially crushing defeat for Antonius, because the answers Death gives him, about the knowledge within Death itself, is Antonius' worst fears come true.It struck me, that in the final moments, when each character faces there own mortality right in front of them, that the strongest and purest reaction of them all, is the one from the squire, the atheist voice in the film. I think if you are an atheist, this film is going to please you, because clearly the sanest characters in this film are either indifferent or deny God's existence entirely.Whether it was intentional or not, I think Seventh Seal is a very personal film. Bergman deconstructs his father's teachings to us openly. There's nothing sublime here; this is a clear rejection of religion and the notion that death somehow provides 'answers'. The only answers, according to this film, lie in life and not death. A message Bergman delivers to us in striking fashion. A message Bergman knows directly contradicts what he was taught as a child.I think this is why later in life, Bergman disowned this film. I think he saw too clearly, how much of a very personal statement it was and how in some cases it was a vindictive film against his parents. It's why I believe, Bergman, couldn't stand to watch it later in life, after he had reconciled with his parents.While Bergman disowned it, for the rest of us, we can admire it. For us, the Seventh Seal is simple genius. A dark, but beautiful film, that is pure and meaningful, because it is so very personal. I confess, I am a layman and I know little of Bergman's work and indeed have only seen this film once. But, I loved this film. It struck a very personal reaction in me, however uninformed that reaction might be. That reaction, pure and simple is that this movie is a very personal statement about life, God and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling Drama From Ingmar Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A compelling contemplation of death and the nature of Man's existence, Ingmar Bergman's `The Seventh Seal' is uncompromising, riveting drama that is every bit as striking conceptually as it is philosophically. In the Fourteenth Century a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), and his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), have returned after ten years away at the Crusades to their native Sweden, and are beginning their journey home. For Block, it is a pensive time; he is troubled by what he perceives as God's silence, and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life, as well as a resolution of faith, which has deserted him. Jons, meanwhile, is a study in jaded indifference, who believes in nothing beyond the present and whatever his senses and current circumstances dictate. Shortly after their arrival on the coast of Sweden, Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for Block. But Block strikes a bargain with him, challenging him to a game of chess, to be played as they continue on with their journey. As long as Block prevails, they will go on; if he wins, he will be released. And though Block knows what the outcome must inevitably be, he welcomes Death's acceptance of his challenge, for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill his quest, while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through a land being ravaged by the Black Plague. Von Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block, his very countenance bespeaking strength and poise. His subtle, stoic approach to this enigmatic character is captivating, and lends a depth and dignity that makes Block truly memorable. By contrast, Jons' strength seems born of his indifference; he takes things as they come, and is governed by a somewhat fatalistic philosophy. Bjornstrand, a gifted, eloquent actor (and veteran of numerous Bergman films), invests an earthy, gritty quality to Jons that plays effectively opposite von Sydow's more ethereal portrayal of Block. It is significant that in the closing scene the final speech, in the presence of Death, is accorded to Jons; for it elevates the character to a station equal to, if not surpassing, that of the protagonist, Block. The supporting cast includes Nils Poppe (Jof), Bibi Andersson (Mia), Inga Gill (Lisa), Gunnel Lindblom (Girl), Anders Ek (The Monk), Ake Fridell (Plog) and Erik Strandmark (Skat). Written and directed by Bergman, `The Seventh Seal' is a thought provoking, earnest meditation on faith and mortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images that will forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory. One scene in particular, in which the players link hands and, silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill, is breathtaking in it's simplicity. It stands (as does this entire film) as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top ten favorites. The Seventh Seal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seventh Seal (1957) is one of my favorite movies. I have to rank it up there with A Touch of Zen, Seven Samurai and Battleship Potemkin. If there ever was such a thing as a perfect film, this one would have to be a nominee. I've never seen such a picture (and I probably never will) that was so moving, well shot, written, acted and directed. The chess game between the knight and death is an all-time classic. Words cannot describe how great this film is. There will never be another one like it. Truly amazing piece of celluloid.A knight and his squire are returning home from the crusades. For the past few years he's been in the middle east fighting for Christ. On his trip home he notices a familiar face, one that he has seen many times on the battlefield. It is death and it wants him to come with him to his new home. The knight strikes a bargain with death, they'll play a game of chess if he can defeat death then he'll spare his life as well as the squire's. Death is amused by this unusual challenge and accepts it. But as long as the game is on the life will continue to live. So he uses this time to look back at life and realizes how precious it is. Along the way he meets a young couple, they're from a performing troupe. They have a baby and are content with life. The husband has visions and can see interesting things like the Virgin Mary and little Jesus. He can also see the darkness that lies ahead as Black Death ravages the countryside. Will the knight defeat Death? Can the couple weather the storm of chaos that lies ahead? To find out you'll have to watch The Seventh Seal, one of the finest films ever made.If Bergman never made another film this one would have made him a legendary film maker. But he continued to make even more classic cinema. This one however is his finest work.My highest recommendation possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's Brilliance Abounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes The Seventh Seal - an apocryphal and uncompromising fable of medieval Sweden - one of the masterpieces of Cinema ? Ingmar Bergman creates a believable world of dark happenings, wherein Death can play chess with a Knight, witches burn at the stake, with flagellants, and plague ever present. Through superb black and white images, each carefully composed for maximum effect, sets and costumes, his fine actors seem to truly inhabit this frightening world. Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bjornstrand, and Bengt Ekerot lead a marvelous cast. But its not all doom and gloom, as the Knight tries to determine in his quest, the meaning of life, and if God exists at all. There are moments of sheer happiness and peace, such as the sequence of the milk and strawberries at dusk, and a number of bawdy comic moments throughout the film. Which balances the darker side. It is unforgettable and I still remember seeing it on its first release, being stunned by the quality of the photography, and the performances. A restored version on DVD is recommended. Bergman is one of the great film makers of our time. Seldom today do we see such precise and considered images on the screen. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filled With Memorable Images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic is filled with a lot of memorable images - from the opening scenes on the seashore to the effective concluding shots, creative thoughts are combined with some fine camera work. There are several significant or interesting questions raised by the characters - from the imagery of the "Seventh Seal" in Revelation, to their simple but important concerns about eternity - but it is the way that the visuals play off of the ideas that make the movie so worthwhile.The recreation of the medieval world is convincing and effective, with a lot of detail to set off a varied assortment of characters with different personalities and perspectives. The characters are not necessarily very deep, but most are interesting, and are worth caring about. The ways that they deal with their discouraging situation make you wonder what it would have been like to live in their world. It's also a movie that in some respects is even better to watch over again, after you already know what has happened and can then pick up even more of the detail and imagery.No doubt the somber tone and slow pace will always keep it from being widely popular, and it's not perfect, but it's satisfying in a different way, and deserves its reputation as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent and accessible with incredible imagery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'I live now in a world of ghosts, a prisoner in my dreams', a line spoken by Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) in 'The Seventh Seal' is also a good descriptor of this critically lauded film. Directed by Ingmar Bergman, the film explores, through an allegorical fashion, human relationships and the struggle with ones own psyche. Block is a knight on his way home from the Crusades who becomes increasingly disillusioned while surveying his country, which has been ravaged by the Black Plague. Along the way he avers that he doesn't care about anyone, and questions the existence of a God who could allow these things to happen. In the beginning of the film he meets Death, who informs him that it is his time. Block manages to push off Death for a little while by distracting him with a chess game while he travels home; encountering several different characters, but Death is always following close behind until the inevitable end of the game. Bergman's style is not straight forward, rather quite symbolic and philosophical. The imagery at times is astounding, and I still (a month after seeing the film for the first time) see the image of 'the dance with Death' in my head when I think of the film. However, what I discovered was that this film carries with it a lot of intellectual and philosophical baggage that is not necessarily warranted. Nothing is really spelled out in this film, but it was much more easily 'accessible' than I thought it would be; I assumed I would have to put on my 'Affected Art House' hat on to watch it and nothing could be farther from the truth. Steeped in beautiful irony, the film, while having the pervasive specter of Death hanging over it, really celebrates life through its characters and their unusual circumstances. It is truly unfortunate that the powerful image of man playing chess with Death has become such a cliché, and oft repeated in some ridiculous manner or another. Bergman directed a thought-provoking and beautiful film with 'The Seventh Seal', and I personally look forward to seeing it again, this time not to grasp the story, but to marvel at the incredible images. I would recommend this film to anyone, but I especially highly recommend it to those who consider themselves students of film ? it will give you a lot to chew on. 8/10--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but far from Bergman's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it strange that "The seventh Seal" has always been widely considered to be the best Bergman movie and is so much more famous that all the others he made. Yes, it's very good, especially for its time, but compared with the real masterpieces Bergman made like "Wild Strawberries", "Through a Glass darkly", "Persona", "Winter light" and "Fanny and Alexander", it really pales in comparison. The ideas and the questions asked in this movie are pretty interesting and profound, but I feel that Bergman has done so much better in his later movies on similar subjects. The theme about the God's silence is much, much better developed in the famous "Faith Trilogy", especially "Through a glass darkly" and "Winter light". The theme about how to cope with fear of death is well developed, but couldn't really convince me. Also I feel that the film has too many "comic relief" moments. Many people have praised the cinematography in this movie, quite a few saying that it's one of the best ever. I beg to disagree. It's very, very good, excellent at times, but again Bergman has done so much better in his other movies. Personally I feel that the cinematography in Bergman's movies improved when he changed his director of photography Gunnar Fischer(who worked on this movie and "Wild Strawberries") with Sven Nykvist. Watch "Through a glass darkly" or "Persona" if you want a really stunning cinematography. But even "Wild Strawberries", made shortly after "The Seventh seal" and looking visually quite similar, is better IMO. Here the settings and the lighting looks too theatrical to me for most of the times. Of course, there were quite a few memorable images, especially the start with Death on the beach, the dance with Death at the end, the procession of the fanatics who whipped themselves through the village,etc. But still, something was lacking in many of the scenes. Bergman had to shoot the whole movie in just 35 days, so it's understandable IMO. After being so critical to the movie so far, it's time to mention its strong points. They are typical of Bergman's movies. Very strong acting(especially from Max von Sydov), amazing dark medieval atmosphere, really makes you think about the important questions. The music was very well and effectively used too. It's a great movie, no doubt, and it established Bergman as one of the all-time greats, which is big plus for a huge fan of him like myself. Still, my advice is: don't limit your Bergman experience to just this movie, watch his others, many of them are even better. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived and an acting mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this pretty excited. After all, it's far and wide described as one of the best, if not *the* best film ever made. Frankly, I didn't see it.The first problem I had with The Seventh Seal was the acting. The knight, Death, and the squire were highlights, but the rest of the cast had an almost pantomime-like quality that is very, very distracting. In fact, this may not simply be an acting problem - many of the set-ups of the film are pretty pantomime: there is a scene with the actors playing out a song involving a cock crowing while, behind the stage, another actor tries to seduce a girl, which is not only sonically grating but completely ludicrous. I tried to work out if it was intended to be satirical but it actually comes off more like the Benny Hill show. In another scene, in which one of the actors is made to dance like a bear on the table in an inn, the camera cuts to reaction shots of the crowd who burst into hysterical laughter in a completely non-spontaneous, false and bizarre manner. It just doesn't work.The second problem I had was the contrived nature of the situations the knight finds himself in: at one point self-flaggelists walk into the village in a long procession waving incense and everyone kneels and weeps. This has been set up in advance by an explanation of who these flaggelists are. And, because of the set up, it, again, doesn't work. Similarly, when the troupe are in the woods towards the end of the film, they are faced with a character (who has previously been shown to be a *not very nice man*) with the plague. Why, other than to have the troupe look death in the face and make the terribly unsubtle point about whether forgiveness should be given to those about to die, is he in the woods miles from anywhere? Once again, it doesn't work.Every question the film is trying to pose is given its own scene, so that the whole story plays like a series of distinct vignettes linked only by the knight character and two or three characters who are obviously set up to take a fall later in the film. *However*, Bergman sets up the film as a linear progression between the knight's knowing he is going to die and his ultimate death. You can't have it both ways - you either go down the vignette route or you go the linear route. You can't have the scene in the bar, the flaggelists, the burning of the "witch" all supposedly happening in a linear fashion, since they are all a little too random to gel together.And, for me at least, the result of all this is that this is not a film that could ever be described as "subtle". You see every question coming even before Bergman gives it its ten-minute moment of screen time. The only thought left in your mind is what weird contortion of the plot Bergman is going to put us through to get to that question. And, as a result, the film is very boring to watch. At times I found myself begging that Death would show up just to add a little spice. And that's without even mentioning how *excrutiating* the songs are....All in all, I'd say The Seventh Seal is very disappointing and I couldn't really recommend it. That said, though, any film that is rated so highly by so many people is always going to deserve at least a glance. It's clearly not trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have taken the time to read some posts on this movie before writing my review because I was searching for lots of answers. Didn't get many though, the popular thing fans like to say (and please, no pun intended) is that it just takes time to understand and appreciate this movie. To this I quickly reply that my perception of "Det Sjunde Inseglet" was that it is a rather dull, if not eventless, movie. It has some really nice moments (and for some reason I really liked the concept of a man playing chess with death itself) but in the end almost nothing is resolved except from the main protagonist who, at the brink of his death, discovers that it's love that makes people want to live ,very roughly put, I apologize, but even this revelation was hidden from the writer of this comment. And this is what bothered me the most, I couldn't read (for the lack of a better word) any of these important details, the movie very coldly rolled in front of my eyes and I just didn't get it! Now the easiest and dumbest thing to say is that this is all the fault of the director for not having a more universal way of film-making, rather the viewer has to decipher such information if he wants to fully appreciate his movies. I've just realized that I could say the same for Kubrick's visionary movies, I didn't like most, scratch that, none of them the first time around, they grew on me after a second viewing. And I dig Kubrick, a lot!!!I was also surprised with the admiration the cinematography received, it did not impact me whatsoever (and I am more so a visual that a sensual movie buff and love this kind of stuff). All in all, as Antonius Block, I am searching for answers, important ones. It bothers me a lot that I don't appreciate this movie, and I ask anyone to help me resolve my problem. What am I missing? What don't I get? What should I know about "The Seventh Seal", its meaning, its importance, its making, its director...?Thank you for your time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Folded Narrative Folding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Bergman is much loved because of his sheer passion, its intimate rawness and the ability to present it visually. He was able to sustain that uncomfortable ability for decades, but this film also has something else -- unique in his work -- a particularly complex narrative architecture.Ordinary stories are just there, with no recognition of being told: but those are remarkably uninteresting. Nearly everything worth reading, hearing or seeing has some sort of the recognition of telling, often by putting the telling explicitly in the story as in `Hamlet.' Sometimes it gets turned on its head when the telling element becomes the focus, as in `Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.'But here that notion of one fold in space becomes seven. The story we see is: a game, a collection of visions, a mural, a book of the Bible, a performance by players, an obsessive religious ritual, and the movie itself (the seventh seal). Each encapsulates the other. We have seven characters that advocate or represent each of these, apart from the `crusade' of real life.This is so complex and so finely woven it changed the entire world. Everything that came after sees it as perhaps an unwelcome spectral visitor, perhaps a template (see `Ninth Gate'), perhaps as a stack of parts from which one borrows. But everyone sees it and is changed.My favorite working filmmaker is Greenaway. He says of this, that when he saw it, he knew he had to be a filmmaker. I believe most of us who actually see this will be similarly changed. Bergman was never able to weave as fine a narrative lace again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie, but painful to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 15. I didn't get it, although I still thought it was amazing. Every scene stands out, but I was really blown away by one showing a procession of flagellants, whipping themselves while a priest shrieks at them, telling them they're worthless sinners, damned to hell. If Brueghel had been born in the 20th century, and made movies instead of painting, maybe this is what he would have created.It's a deeply depressing film. The main character, a knight home from the Crusades, tries to find God. In the end, he learns there is no God, only death. The only happy person in the movie is Jof, and the only time the knight finds any comfort at all is when he contemplates the family life that Jof enjoys. The movie hits you over the head with the message that God will never be found because he is not there. We cannot escape death. All we can do is have children and hope to live on through them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Antonius Block: "I met Death today. We are playing chess."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark, beautiful, meaningful, exploring the most serious themes of faith and searching for God, "The Seventh Seal" is known as one of the landmark Bergman's movies. One of the film's inspirations was a painting that Bergman saw as a young boy and was transfixed by: "There was everything that one's imagination could desire. Angels, saints, dragons, prophets, devils, humans. There were very frightening animals: serpents in paradise, Balaam's ass, Jonah's whale, the eagle of Revelation. All this was surrounded by heavenly, earthly and subterranean landscapes of strange yet familiar beauty. I remember Death playing chess with a Crusader, Death sawing at a tree to a branch of which clung a naked man with staring eyes, and across a gentle hill Death leading the final dance towards the dark lands" (Bergman in Hart). The film follows the journey of a knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returning from Crusades through Sweden ravaged by plague. The knight has lost his faith in the blood and horrors of the battlefield, "Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." On his way home, he encountered people dying from starvation and disease, being burnt as witches as well as Mr. Death himself who challenged him to play a game of chess and the family of a happy juggler, his wife, and their infant son. This family is happy because they love each other. They represent the simple joys and hopes of ordinary life. Everything about "The Seventh Seal" is extra-ordinary including acting. I especially liked Jöns, Antonius Block's misogynist squire - the best performance in the movie by Gunnar Björnstrand. His quotes about love are hilarious: "Love is the blackest of all plagues... if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love, but you don't die of it." "Love is as contagious as a cold. It eats away at your strength, morale... If everything is imperfect in this world, love is perfect in its imperfection." I know the film's reputation and I enjoyed watching it but it did not click with me completely the way the others Bergman's films did ("Fanny and Alexander", "Persona", "Smiles of a Summer Night") and I found myself bored few times. I keep thinking why? It seems to me that the movie is slightly overdone and overheated with its attacking images, abstractions and discursive dialog. I understand that it is a very serious film but while watching it, I could not help thinking how funny its images and dialog would look and sound in parodies. (Not as anything is wrong with that). Woody Allen obviously thought the same. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death takes knight, checkmate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose one has to view the reputed great classics of cinema to sort of test one's critical faculties against established standards and coming to this iconic film I was certainly aware of some of its famous imagery, in particular that of the soldier playing chess with Death, but nothing more than this. It does make for an arresting start to the film but after that I found it rather heavy going I must say.Once said soldier Max Van Sydow treks after the family of travelling performers, I struggled to make sense of the narrative as the film follows a picaresque trail of incidents such as as the backstage seduction of a fellow-performer's wife, the humiliation of the travelling husband at an inn and the death by fire of a young female witch. Where exactly are they all headed? Well, with Death silently and unobtrusively along for the ride, I think I get the inference; nobody lives forever.Mind you, I guess in all of it there's lots of stuff I'm still missing about faith, relationships, class, superstition and the human spirit, the meaning of life in short, but I'm afraid much of its symbolism passed me by. It is well shot in black and white and language-barrier notwithstanding appears to be well played with the actors certainly giving life to their individual characters, Van Sydow in particular, but I found the bitty, episodic development of the story as mystifying and unsatisfying as the higher allegorical meaning striven for.In fact the only really memorable scene for me was the chess match, which of course I knew about already, so really there was no need for me to watch the rest of it and I'm kind of sorry I did. Not my cup of tea, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seventh Seal (1957) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me make this pretty quick -- a friend brought this Ingmar Bergman "classic" to the house last night (on Blu-ray), and it was my first experience with this acclaimed filmmaker. All I can say is, I was immediately struck by the cinematography, and I started getting interested in the idea of a knight (Max Von Sydow) playing chess with "Death" himself, as a means of deciding the fate of his own soul.... but that's as far as it went.From then on, nothing made much sense and the noble core idea of the film (presumably about questioning death, and the existence of God) seemed to go out the window, as we spend our time with secondary characters I just could not become interested in. I wanted to focus more on Max von Sydow's troubled crusader and his crisis of faith, especially since I myself am presently going through some personal bouts of despair in my personal life with my own crosses to bear... but he was only sparingly used, and I just could not follow any type of coherent storyline to this thing, for all its pretty picture style. There was no story, just images... and it's not that this approach never works for me in other films, but it didn't connect for me this time. I can't say that this is going to be my last visitation with Bergman, but this is not a promising start, considering this is allegedly one of his greatest works, if not THE greatest. Apologies to Woody Allen. Okay, let the slings and arrows fly. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will firstly begin by stating that my full thoughts for this film could not be summed up in a review. I am finding it hard to elucidate my thoughts on a film that constantly has you in a moral struggle. In fact, The Seventh Seal is one of those films that can thrust you into a continual cycle of new interpretations and insight into what "it" all means. There is a level of profundity and simplicity established that few films prior had been able to capture nor have been able to match since.The Seventh Seal is about a disillusioned man, Antonious Block, seeking to discover answers to life, death and the existence of God as he plays a game of chess against Death during the Black Plague. I found the premise alone highly original and intriguing. Factor in that this was one of the chef-d'?uvres of acclaimed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman and it had sufficed me. This film, while overt at times, is subtle in displaying small moments of beauty ? a beautiful shot of a squirrel appearing on the top of a cut-off tree trunk, the moon glimmering as dusk falls rapidly. In a film oozing with metaphysical thoughts, these moments are cleverly placed, perhaps imperatively so, to remind the audience of the consolation in appreciating all the small beauty that arises in life. Akin to the usage of the river in "Apocalpyse Now", The Seventh Seal uses the chess game as a setting of both a literal and metaphorical journey ? a connecting link that will be able to guide the flow of the storytelling. Antonious will embark on a journey that, like a chess game, will see him analyze, reflect and understand as he tries to approach some kind of closure for his ambiguity. The inherently glacial nature of a chess game will allow Antonious's journey through his past to be broadened and fulfilling.The pacing in the Seventh Seal was slow at times, with many lulls present amidst the storytelling, making it less watchable for some. And yet, often it was these pauses, somber and still, that sparked the most introspective moments in a film that was constantly in pursuit of answers. The film's brilliant cinematography personifies the emotions of its characters and their surroundings ? dark, sinister, powerless. It is able to heighten the viewing experience by becoming that much more vivid, thought-provoking and perceptive.There is a very interesting long shot following the death of Raval, the discourteous theologian, where the camera actually stops, without any edits or movements for roughly 15 seconds. It feels like there is a freeze in time for that duration. It is so silent, eerily so, and, in those 15 seconds, a lot can be interpreted. Pauses in the story can be effectively used to give the audience, amidst all of the eccentricities, a moment to reflect about the themes being discussed at hand, something I am sure Bergman was fully cognizant of. Ambient sounds like a crackling fire or the whirling wind can be heard during a monologue. This film masterfully captures the smaller details others would neglect and in doing so presents much greater possibilities of its intended message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange, and intelligent film that you will love or hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with any film of this type it will appeal to some, but many people will not understand the imagery. So while this film is in many top 100 lists this does not necessarily mean you will enjoy it. This film caused much controversy when it was released, and still to this day, because of its anti-god and anti-religious views. For instance, the only divine being that we ever see is death. The character of death is well written and well acted, and scenes he is in a very memorable. The film can be very boring and seemingly shallow when you are not fully analysing every image, but if you think that it is not a bad film it is just a film that you will not enjoy, no matter how many times you rematch it. The camera-work though is very memorable, and I really like that the camera always still. It makes the world feel more empty, and this is really absorbing. My final impression on the film is mixed. I love the character of death, and I love the isolated feel of the world, but the film does have section where the film just slows down and even lacks memorable images, which is exactly what the film tries to achieve. I also do not like the massive character list, which makes the film feel stuffed and the 95 minute runtime means that each character has virtually no character development. I still recommend you watch it though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is developed in the Dark Age, when a plague of pest sweep throughout Europe raging all around.A dreary,sad and disappointed knight(Max Von Sidow)is returning from the Crusades along with his squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand).Meanwhile he meets Death(Ekerot)who challenges him and they play a chess game.The stakes result to be the following : If the knights wins ,his life and his companies will be spared.Death offers him a reprieve where he deals about discussion of the religion,God and his existence and personal demons.Besides he knows a troupe of minstrels constituted among others by a marriage called Joseph(Nils Poppe) and Mia(Bibi Andersson).The picture contains powerful and haunting images.It's plenty of scenes that stay in the mind as the appearance of Death, especially the flagellants parade,the torture and execution by means of a burning pole of an allegedly witch and the ending sequence.Stunning casting by Bergman's usual actors: Gunnarn Bjornstrand,Bibi Andersson,Gunnel Lindblon and an awesome Max Von Sidow as the disillusioned knight in his first international great success.Wonderfully directed is all strongest for being brilliantly photographed in an excellent black and white by Gunnar Fischer.It's a masterpiece who made his major impact gaining international acclaim.His realization is during a spellbinding golden period from 1957-1968 when Bergman made a memorable masterpieces : Wild strawberries,Virgen Spring,Persona,The communicants,The silence,Hour of wolf.Rating : Above average but is deemed by many to be the Bergman's best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A universal tale of faith and fate, of men hopelessly cheating Death, while insolently cheated by God...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A knight named Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returns from the Crusades, only to find his country ravaged by the Plague. He meets a strange, black robed figure (Bengt Ekerot) leaving no mystery about his identity, he's Death. Yet Antonius gets himself a suspended sentence by challenging Death to a chess game. Then comes the most iconic moment of "The Seventh Seal": the blonde Nordic knight and Death, face-to- face, a chessboard in the middle, and for us, viewers, readings as infinite as the ocean in the background.Ingmar Bergman doesn't just gratify us with one allegory through his personal take on the Grim Reaper, we also have the chess game symbolizing the eternal cat-and- mouse-like battle between men and death. After ten years of exile, fighting the Barbarians, Antonius must have cheated Death many times, but did that gave him all the answers to the meaning of life for all that? Did he perceived gratitude from the very God, in the name of which he expressed his bravura? With too many questions in mind, it is too soon to conclude his journey, a situation calling for a last attempt to cheat Death.The irony of Antonius' condition is that Death plays fairer than God on many levels, if only for its presence. We know Death, and God knew how to inculcate the fear and the knowledge of Death in medieval ages where you could either die by a sword, or a disease devouring your entrails. The context mirrors the pessimism that overflowed Europe after the Holocaust, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War. Being the son of a Lutherian priest enhanced Bergman's quest for answers transcending the rigor of burdensome certitudes, much more at a time that didn't leave much for optimism regarding the fate of humanity? or should we say, faith?Indeed, how can be Death so ubiquitous, when the only 'being' that can help you to accept it is absent or expressionless. The absence of God, a recurrent theme in Bergman's movies is the source of Antonius' torment, one that echoes a similar character Von Sydow played in "Winter Light". Reviewing the film, I concluded that the existence of God was a part of human civilization, but his absence part of human condition. From Bergman's standpoint, this is illustrated by the way each character's behavior and personality derive from a personal relationship (or lack of) with God. "The Seventh Seal" is also a character study, evoking many interpretations of the value of Death and life.And as the cynical relief of Antonius's interrogations, there's his disillusioned squire, Jons, played by Gunnar Björnstrand. Jons is a more disillusioned and careless character, the sight of a corpse inspires no prayer or religious questioning, only macabre humor and what is left of his faith is shaken when he finds a painter drawing scary portraits in a church and Raval (Bertil Anderberg) the very theologian who sent him to the Crusade, stealing a dead's bracelet and about to rape a villager (Gunnel Lindblom). The priest-turned-thief, dies later of the plague, probably infected by the bracelet he stole. Incarnating corrupted religion, as he got a taste of his own medicine, ironically proving that God (or Death) wasn't that senseless.The film features more sympathetic characters: Jof (Nils Poppe) actor and juggler is married with the beautiful Mia (Bibi Andersson) and together they have a little boy. The family provides a much needed escapism from an upsetting reality, and for the first time, makes Antonius smile and forget about his torment. Enjoying the sunshine, the sight of Mia and her boy, he savors some wild strawberries and a bowl of fresh milk. He'll remember that moment, he says, and at this time, it is impossible not to make a connection with a similarly existential Bergman's film of the same year "Wild Strawberries", illustrating the cathartic value of good memories. The two films, elevated Bergman's standing as a major international director and were also meant as personal catharsis, curing from self-questioning? at least, temporarily.Indeed, even a joyful actors' show is interrupted by a cortege of people whipping themselves, carrying a cross and planning to burn a witch, as purification from God's anger. And Antonius' quest for truth is so desperate that he even tries to find the Devil in the witch so he can question him, but he only finds terror and emptiness in her eyes. That's the most provocative and thrilling irony of the film, for all the supernatural presence of Death, of Jon's visions of Mary and baby Jesus, for our total suspension of disbelief, God remains Silent. The closest to his representation is the very title of the film, an extract from the Revelation, evoking the silence of God after the lamb opened the seventh seal. And that Seventh Seal is the start of what would become the backbone of a colossal oeuvre, a photogenic brainstorm about the meaning of existence. Some would call it 'pretentious'? Actually, Bergman has no pretension to bring any satisfying answer, except that we should enjoy the suspended sentence given by life. Not everyone who encounters Death in the film deserves it, not everyone reacts stoically, some protest, some are scared, others embrace it with an illuminated smile. But even within its haunting climax, Bergman doesn't forget to keep a cinematic effect, and manage to cheat death in order to provide a sort of 'happy ending'.Because "The Seventh Seal' is also a cinematic journey, whose first and penultimate shots, (parodied countless times, becoming in fact a trope of art films) translated into cinematic language the moral turmoil of centuries, still relevant today in a world of doubts and uncertainty. Actually, the film might be still relevant in a future as distant to our present as Middle Ages is now, if there's still humanity at that time, this is how timeless and universal "The Seventh Seal" is. And how essential it is, because it asks essential questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal may bore those who are too familiarized with the modern film era of constant action, but for me: I loved it. I found the performances to be fantastic; Jof in his goofy, fatherly role; Jons with his sarcastic, straight-faced demeanor; Antonius, passionate in his never-ceasing pursuit for knowledge of the existence of God; and Death--how could anyone forget Death? Ubiquitous, cunning, clever Death.My only problem with the film was that the promised thought-provoking religious and philosophical viewpoints were replaced with meaningless comedy scenes. I would have preferred to watch an intelligent film controversially prodding at said religion and philosophy, instead of tolerating the disappointment of only slightly funny comic reliefs.That said, I stand by my original statement; The Seventh Seal is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death match Medieval</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After ten years of futility in the Crusades Antonious Block and Squire Jon return home to be greeted by the plague and Death in its most recognizable human form. He has come for Block and the disparate group he travels with but is held up from this task when Block proposes a game of chess to avoid annihilation. Encountering communal responses to the plague as they travel along Block buys time clumsily attempting to stall the match after unwittingly revealing his game plan. This cinematic milestone may have lost a touch of its lustre over the years with a number of sharp homage parodies by the likes of Woody Allen and The Pythons but on it's own it remains a provocative examination of the meaning of life and ultimate fate seen from a variety of viewpoints. It is a film that begs introspection and while you may not identify with any of the characters it forces one to examine their own fate.Director Ingmar Bergman's script and imagery are rich in symbolism and his stock company of actors (especially Gunnar Bjornstrand's profane and cynical Squire Jon) up to the task in conveying their purpose of character. Bergman moves them like pieces in a game of chess but preserves their humanity through his signature close-ups and moments of occasional frivolity. Over half a century after it and a handful of other exports came to these shores and changed the way Americans looked at film The Seventh Seal today may show some of its age but it still retains the capability of being a very interesting conversation piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widely Considered the Greatest Bergman Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story set in medieval times (presumably Sweden), with a knight who faces death (literally), a young couple, and some other characters. Fate is coming for them, as they live in the time of the plague.Film historian Ivan Butler sees elements of horror here (as he does in much of Bergman's work), pointing to the instances of "death, plague, religious fanaticism, intolerance, torture" and singling out the scene with Joseph is "forced at knife point to stand on his head, to climb on the table and dance like a bear." How much this is horror and how much it is everyday life in medieval Sweden, I really could not say.Ebert, meanwhile, says this film "has more in common with the silent film than with the modern films that followed it", and that "All of Bergman's mature films, except the comedies, are about his discontent with the ways that God has chosen to reveal himself." On that first point, this is decidedly so; Bergman has strong, stark visuals almost needing no sound at all to carry them. As for the latter point, this is an interesting interpretation and I do not know Bergman's work well enough to comment.I actually first came across this film indirectly, having seen "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey" and not being aware of the reference. Next, I came across it in "Last Action Hero". Those may not be high culture, but the fact that this film touched such remote genres really gives support to the strength of the work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human Existence Inside a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Ingmar Bergman's classic meditation on God, the viewer follow the return of knight Antonius Block and his squire, Jons, from the crusades. The world they return to is filled with death and ugliness, as the Black Plague rages through and flagellation has become a way of life. Block then meets Death and what follows is the now legendary game of chess between a mortal and the Grim Reaper. While the game lasts, Block remains alive, so he travels on.It's a grey, lifeless world, so much the better captured by Gunnar Fischer's legendary cinematography. It's a humorless world too, in which wandering artists are not seen with kind eyes. In the course of the movie, Block meets the company of Jof and his wife, Mia, and son, and protects them. Block's grim reflections about God and his existential doubts meet their opposite in Jof's wonder at the beauty of the world, in the love he feels for his wife and son, in the pleasure he has playing his art.All the actors are excellent in this movie, in particular my beloved Max Von Sydow. In all the movies I've seen him in, no matter how bad they may be, he's always captured the personality of his character. Gunnar Fischer's black and white images are unforgettable too, and some of the most beautiful ever put in a movie. One need only remember the dark rocks at the beginning of the movie, or Death's first apparition.The Seventh Seal is a movie that will never grow old because it contains all the varieties of human existence: darkness and light, lightness and seriousness, hope and despair. To say that this movie has grown old, to say that this movie no longer speaks to mankind after 50 years, is to say that humans have stopped being humans. If there is a movie that reminds people about the wonder and difficulty of being human, it's this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This stunningly photographed tale of a knight (the always-reliable Max Von Sydow) returning home from the Crusades is now universally recognized as the film responsible for Ingmar Bergman's international breakthrough. As the knight begins his famous game of chess with Death, the two players start pondering over the meaning of existence and religion. The chess game is bookended continuously by various scenes involving a group of traveling performers. While generally regarded as a drama, the film overlaps into horror and many scenes (the witch-burning; the grotesque processions) have a potent shock value. All the way through, the film retains its menacing atmosphere and the whole movie can actually be viewed as an experimental horror epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to make you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman gave us an incredible film here. A knight goes wit to wit against death in a game of chess to buy himself more life. The movie takes a very philosophic bend, and takes us through the thoughts that every human has thought since nigh on the beginning of mankind. Is there a God? Why can I not perceive him with any of my senses? Yet, why can I not rid myself of the thought of God? No point in this film can be looked at with a glance; every scene is a deep well of meaning, and every character meant to show us a different way humanity deals with the inevitability of death. There isn't a moment to miss. Set in medieval Europe, we are confronted with a world obsessed with the end. Religion is at its peak of making noise; the plague travels the land and leaves nothing but death, boils, and terror. Amid this horror, a knight returns from the crusades convinced that the ten years he spent there at war were worthless, and left with no faith in God. Death comes knocking, but the knight cleverly challenges him to the ultimate game of wits, chess, since he had heard in ballads in tales that Death plays. During a reprieve in the game, Death gives the knight a chance to do one last deed on earth to search for meaning. I feel a bit bad giving out perfect scores, but what really lies at fault here is that I decided to see an amazing movie. There's nothing else to do with Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece than to give it a perfect score. The lack of technology cannot take any points away from it, and the story is both gripping, entertaining, and more meaningful than I care to talk about at any more length. This is a movie you must see, take an hour and a half to sit and consider your own life, because as Socrates said, the unexamined life is not worth living, and this movie forces you to consider your life and how you handle its end. Even the simple painter in the film knew this was important, and you would be completely remiss in not seeing this complete 10/10 classic. This was a snippet from my full review.

		<fullReview>This is the first film by Bergman I've watched, and I definitely do not intend to make it my last. The plot is smart and interesting, and it is compelling from start to finish. During a game of chess between The Grim Reaper itself and the man he has come to take, subjects like faith, life and death are explored. It's rather compelling, and ought to inspire many a healthy debate about aforementioned broad topics. The open and seemingly ambiguous nature of the movie allows the audience to interpret it for ourselves. This is funny at points, once or twice from absurdity, and it never tries too hard. It comes naturally, the clever and witty material as well as the black comedy. The acting is excellent, not a single performance is off for a second. It's really cool to see Sydow, by all respects a great talent, in his native tongue. This is beautifully shot and skillfully edited, if the sound can be a tad excessive at times. The music does also get loud and over the top a little, though it does not put much of a strain on the viewing experience. There is disturbing content in this, as well as brief violence and a few gruesome visuals. The DVD contains an introduction with Ingmar himself, which is three minutes long. I recommend this to anyone who is mature enough to appreciate it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, the Middle Ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a compelling film. First of all, we have the backdrop around the time of the Crusades and the Black Death. People must live their lives in constant fear. Of course, the ones flourishing are those connected to the church. When people are desperate, that's where they end up. There is no moral sense at work in the land because death is literally around the corner, played by a round faced character in a black cowl. Max Van Sydow's knight is a fine character who manages to play a game of chess with Death and put off the inevitable. During that time he encounters a group of scoundrels and some very nice people who don't deserve their fate. Bergman's images are incredible. He does more with black and white film than darn near anyone. There is a preponderance of religious symbolism. Most of what I remember is that amazing power generated by the church, the burnings and the fear tactics. When Death comes, after the fear has been exhausted, there seems to be a comfortable acceptance because the life on earth is certainly not worth much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, the contrast of it all. The Knight (Max von Sydow) constantly looks for answers that are not there and, at the end, falls to his knees pleading as the most simple supplicant.Ingmar Bergman has crafted an extraordinary tale of faith and superstition that causes one to reflect deeply into their own knowledge and belief. It is a magnificent allegory set in strikingly beautiful locations with splendid lighting and effects that dare you to take your eyes from the screen for a brief moment to blink. I dare say that I could not. I was captivated by the sights and sounds like nothing before or since.Gunnar Björnstrand was magnificent as the squire who provided the framework for what was happening all around him. Nils Poppe was a joy to watch in his simple innocence. Bibi Andersson, who has been acting almost as long as I have been alive, and is still doing so, was pitch perfect as Poppe's wife.Summaries of the film are available in many places so I will not go into that, but suffice it to say that it is one film that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember where I was and the time of night when I started and finished this movie, it left that deep an impression."No Country For Old Men", ends with questions this film tackles and dispenses with, in far more humorous, insightful, and interesting ways.A knight comes home from the Crusades, only to find the black plague, religious fanatics flailing themselves in contrition, and Death himself who he challenges to a chess game, where if he wins he may live, and if he looses....Bergman created the perfect visual metaphors, for death, man's limitations and hopes, faith, skepticism, and weaved them all together into a sumptuous philosophical feast, that anyone could watch (provide they don't mind sub-titles and black and white).In my opinion Bergman's most solid film, and successful film, none of the visual flash of "Persona" or the raw emotion which encapsulates his later work, but indispensable for people interested in movies.Life affirming in a strange way...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max Von Sydow is Antonius Blok, an errant knight returning to his home with his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) after 10 years of fighting in the Crusades, only to find the Black Plague has gotten there first. On the edge of the shore, he meets Death and to delay his passage to the afterlife, challenges him to a game of chess, while traveling home.This is the second Bergman film I have seen, having just watched Jungfrukallen (1960) a few days before. I was struck in that film by Bergman's meticulousness, and a technique with the camera and a whole feeling of it being a play, but a play that seemed real. I found the same with this one. Each character plays a specific role; each scene tells an important part of the story; and it gives an overall feeling of watching a play, of a sort of fantasy world...but at the same time, the incredible picture draws you in and makes it seem real. Fascinating, compelling and full of wonder.The film raises lots of questions about the nature of evil and suffering, the existence of God, man's mortality and the struggle to outwit Death (always doomed to failure), but it also gives a ray of hope.I was completely taken by the main characters (Blok, Jons, Maria, Jof, Death himself) and the young woman about to be burned at the stake for witchcraft. Wonderful character development.Overall, an incredible film. I'll watch it again, and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing more of Bergman's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful and thought provoking movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely such a both great looking and thought provoking movie comes around that makes such a powerful and lasting impression. "Des Sjunde inseglet" has some great and thought provoking themes in it and is also beautifully made at the same time, by Ingmar Bergman and his entire cast and crew. The movie questions and debates several issues concerning the meaning of life, religion and death. Of course this movie provides no answers to any of that because of the simple reason that nobody knows the answers to these questions and everybody interpret life and belief on their own way. This movie can also be seen as a free interpretation of those subjects and it triggers the mind of its viewers, which is also the reason why this movie can be interpreted in many different ways by many different people. It makes "Des Sjunde inseglet" a rare really thought provoking movie.But the movie is not only just about this depressing and heavy subjects, it's also about hope, if you at least look deep enough into it. Also the movie is way more accessible to everyone then it might sound. The themes and entire subject of the movie might sound a bit off and difficult and certainly will scare of a large group of the average movie-watcher but the movie is perfectly watchable for basically just everyone. I think that the great surrealism of the movie is a reason why it works out so way and is perfect to watch for basically just everyone, regardless of age, race or religion.The movie has a great look in which less is more. The movie chooses a simplistic and more warm approach, to keep the story real and as involving and thought provoking as possible. It gives the movie an unique look and atmosphere and also provides the movie with some beautiful images. The cinematography is really first rate and so are the costumes and sets for the movie, that all adds to its atmosphere of the time period the movie is set in.The movie is filled with a couple of beautiful looking sequences that also make a lasting heavy dramatic impression. It's a powerful movie to watch that both provokes and is easy on the eyes.All of the actors also did a great job and the movie features some of the best Swedish actors of that generation. Of course most are unknown today by the general public but the movie also features some 'big' names that are known around the world, of which Max von Sydow is of course the best example. I enjoyed watching him in this early movie role, especially since we mostly only know him as an 'old' man, every since his "The Exorcist" role. It was refreshing to see him as a very young man and as a beginning actor. Bengt Ekerot is also perfectly cast as the scary looking 'death' itself. His appearance is the best known element out of the movie and is even known to persons who've never watched this movie. This really says something about the impact his appearance makes in this movie.It's just a movie in which everything adds up; the cinematography, the music, the atmosphere, the directing, the acting, its themes. Everything is first class work and every little element of the movie enriches the movie and adds up to its total brilliance. The fact that such an 'old' European movie is so well known- and is still being watched all over the world should say enough about its quality and universal themes that are of all time that are handled in it. 10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man's existential agony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. In my opinion it aims at and successfully displays not only man's fear of death, even when some of the characters believe in an afterlife, but more importantly, man's various emotional and intellectual strong reactions of living life with the great uncertainty of what happens after death, and what's more, the meaning of existence and suffering if there is no God. The sensual squire seems to take the question of life (and death) with an atheistic calmness, while others, particularly the knight, agonize over the absolute senselessness of life if there is not God. It must be remembered that the film takes place in the 14th century during the murderous intensity of the brutal Black Plague, which heightens the question of the meaningfulness or pointlessness of life at all. I think all thinking people, including but certainly not exclusive to Sartre and Camus would enjoy this film. Is life and suffering of any value in what might be a pointless and absurd world. "To be or not to be" is really the underlying question here and, just like Hamlet, neither answer is satisfactory.</fullReview>

I went out for the night, came back very late, and thought I'd put the film on for a few minutes before hitting the sack. From the opening scene I was spellbound. An hour and a half later when the credits rolled I had the sensation that I had just watched something truly special. I was captivated by the beautifully constructed, hauntingly quiet scenes and the understated sense of foreboding that lingered throughout. I am pleased I had never before heard of the scenes of the knight playing chess with Death as for me they took me by surprise and were a delight.

		<fullReview>This may be because I've seen other 'talks with Death' movies such as Meet Joe Black, but I find this movie as mediocre at best. Yes the world depiction hit its mark very well, making the audience feel like they sunk into the gloomy world. But for me that's because the whole black and white color and the recurrence of the Death character. The main plot with Blok feels like it'll make this movie a challenging watch to those who pride their faith. What made me rate it a score f 4 is the sub plots that makes this movie look simply stupid. Again maybe this is a cultural gap issue between me and 1950s Sweden, but I fail to understand how Plog's stupidity can have a good impact to the whole story. One thing to add is that I tend to agree with the opinion about the acting. Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot did a splendid job in their roles here that helped a lot in setting up the movie's mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is filled with thoughts that seem to be begging for an answer. Antonius Blok (Max Von Sydow) is a knight coming home from the Crusades with his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjonstrand). He starts to question the existence of God after being disillusioned from the war. He comes in contact with Death (Bengt Ekrot) who comes to take him. But Antonius makes a deal with him. They play chess as Antonius is going on his journey, and as long as Antonius is winning he lives. Along the way Antonius and Jons comes in contact with a number of other characters. The most important of which are Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) a married couple of stage actors who accompany Antonius and Jons as they move. The good things about this movie are plentiful. The story is excellent and the way that Ingmar Bergman tells it is also great. The other really good thing is the cinematography. This film has numerous famous stills. Even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably seen the iconic shot of Antonius and Death playing chess for the first time. It's part of movie history. I recommend this movie highly.</fullReview>

Characters that are weird (to put that mildly) and strange religious tones that I'm quite sure didn't fare well with the church ...While dialogue is a strong point (as has been said by other reviewers already), it's also the imagery that Bergman puts on display. Not really an easy film to follow (though might still be considered as pretty straight forward), this really has quite a lot going for it.

		<shortDescription>What They Say Is True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could I possibly say about Ingmar Bergman's 1957 masterwork The Seventh Seal that hasn't already been methodically and unabashedly recorded by film scholars whom spent decades studying this truly powerful film about a knight facing off with Death, and the chess game they wage. But as scholars and fans of the film might suggest, and rightfully so, this film is so much more important than the sum of its parts. It is a film of the highest quality, dealing with questions of the most immediate importance. The film deals with, of course, that of life and death. Spirituality and fixations. Good and Evil. Perhaps no other film, Birth Of A Nation, Citizen Kane, and 2001: A Space Odyssey maybe-- has been so heavily researched, discussed, dissected, and studied. Of course the time spent researching the film is justifiable, Bergman really seems to have uncovered something here, he really seems to have made a film that people cannot only connect to but seek answers in their own private lives from. Now, I do not believe that by understanding Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal' you can automatically unlock the puzzles of existence, but I do believe that the questions Bergman proposes here are vital, as well as important, and that the story itself is in the shortest amount of words, a remarkable and humbling experience. An entertainment of the highest value. A film of the highest quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this for the first time in Los Angeles and emerging from the theater shocked, scared, and thrilled, as if I'd just viewed my first autopsy. There had never been anything like this allegory before, although there have been imitations and parodies since -- Monty Python, Woody Allen.A thoughtful knight (Max von Sydow) and his tough, cynical squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand) return from the Crusades to find their Scandinavian state in a terrible mess. The plague is sweeping the land. The plagues all seem far away now, but one of them knocked off about a third of the population of Europe. That would be more than a hundred million Americans today. The deaths were horrible.Death comes for the knight and squire, dressed in a black cloak and hood, with a pasty white face. (Only Ingmar Bergman could pull of a cliché like that.) Death is proud of his talent at playing chess and agrees to the knight's challenge to play a game over the next couple of days. If the knight wins, he goes free, and if Death wins, the knight goes with him. Of course, at the end of the game of life, the same player always wins. Or, as Walsh McDermott put it in a slightly different context, "the dice of the gods are loaded."Along the way, the knight and squire pick up some fellow travelers, including a family of cheerful itinerant players, a blacksmith and his unfaithful wife, and a young lady of the village who may or may not be retarded. They witness flagellants parading through a village lashing themselves and lugging crosses made of heavy logs, smothered in smoke from swinging iron censers. They watch an insane girl burned at the stake for a witch. Some of the incidents are comic, some are violent, all are revelatory. You know, kind of like real life.What a movie. It begins with a vulture almost stationary against an overcast, and it ends with a dance of death. In between Death saws down a tree in which a man is trying to hide. We see the trunk fall and the camera fixes on the raw white stump, then a squirrel with hairy ears leaps onto the stump and begins to chatter. I can't imagine that you'll ever forget some of these images.But then, I don't know. "The Seventh Seal", like the Bergman films that flooded the theaters in the following years, was a product of its time. I'm not at all sure that many of today's viewers would have the patience to sit through a black-and-white movie with subtitles. In the 1960s Stanley Kaufman wrote an article predicting that future students would know the history of film the way that they had always known literary history. Twenty years later, he took it back. Maybe too much MTV, too much immediate gratification, too low a threshold for boredom. In another comment, the complaint was made that Bergman didn't supply any answers, just questions. That's an example of what I'm getting at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond simple description or words.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot rate this film on a simple 1-10 scale. I can barely find the words to type down here and now. What Ingmar Bergman has done through the past two films of his I have seen, Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal, is brought to visionary life my hopes and dreams of the possibilities of film. I just had no idea these films existed long before I ever become involved with cinema.Plunging us straight into the Black Plague-era of the Middle Ages, the story of a knight playing chess against Death while attempting to reach home from the Crusades is the backdrop for what conspires to be a film full of symbolism, representation and discussion of some of the biggest and most important questions and issues that human beings can raise. This was Bergman's breakout film in many ways, mostly because it was the first instance where he held nothing back and went fully at the ideas and themes he truly felt within himself. Here, he blatantly questions the idea of God and whether or not he exists in this cold, seemingly meaningless world full of death and sorrow. The hero, the knight (Max von Sydow), would like to think so but his down-to-earth, cynical squire (Gunnar Björnstrand), claims to see the truth.What is truth? Where can it be found? Bergman continuously pounds us with questions and it is understandable that some would reject this film as simply Bergman filling out 96 minutes with existential tediousness. Yet, he was also a masterful director, continuously raising the bar of what was considered acceptable and worthy. The cinematography, editing and musical score all radiate here and make themselves worthy of mention. However, above all stands the writer/director himself who penetrates to the deepest part of the human soul with issues and concerns we all have but mostly are afraid to confront. As Americans living in this dollar-driven film universe, will the mass audience pick up on Bergman's ideas of questioning and attempting to understand the origins and foundations of our existence? One can only hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Medieval Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back from the Crusades (where he no doubt carried out some unspeakable acts in the name of God) Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), discovers his homeland ravaged by the plague as he struggles with a crisis of faith. As if that wasn't bad enough, he also runs into Death on the beach, and challenges the reaper to a game of chess to buy himself a little time as he wrestles with metaphysical conundrums. The duel, played on a beach beneath lowering skies, provides us with one of cinema's enduring images and, perhaps, misleads us about the true nature of Bergman's film. I'd always assumed it to be a grim, dour affair with dull, lengthy periods of intellectualising. Well, the film is certainly bleak, but it's also completely absorbing and rewarding.Block travels the countryside with his squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and finds on his journey a country in the grip of a religious fervour that promises nothing but damnation and offers precious little in the way of comfort. Burnings and ritualistic acts of flagellation are carried out in the name of a God who is conspicuously absent, which does nothing to help Block resolve his inner torment. They meet up with a number of characters: Jof (Nils Poppe), a juggler, his pretty wife Mia (Bibi Andersson) and their small son Mikael; Plog (Ake Fridell), a blacksmith whose wife has absconded with the leader of the tiny travelling theatre of which Jof and Mia make up two-thirds; a girl saved by Block's squire from Raval, an evil former monk who, ten years before, duplicitously persuaded the squire to join the Crusades and who ultimately comes to a distasteful end. Each gives Death an opportunity to add them to his list as they encounter one another on various routes that ultimately lead to the estate of Block and the wife he hasn't seen in ten years.The bleakness of the film is offset by the endlessly fascinating scenarios created by Bergman ? many of the incidents are inspired by a mural the director would study as a child while attending his preacher father's lengthy sermons ? and a flavourful taste of the dark ages. Block's crisis is always the motivating force behind the story and the incidents that take place within it, but is never allowed to dominate or control. As Block searches for some sign of God all he witnesses is the devil's work. He questions a young girl sentenced to burn for sleeping with the devil and bringing the plague down upon the countryside. He asks her if the devil exists, for he must surely know God. 'Look into my eyes,' the girl replies, 'The priest and the soldiers could see him there. They wouldn't touch me.' 'I see nothing but terror.' Block remarks, and you can feel his desolation.The subject of God, his existence, and the ways in which his presence is made known to us, were an abiding obsession with Bergman, and formed the core of many of his films (comedies aside). This, one of his earliest films, is by far the most direct in its probing, as is probably befitting of a young director at the beginning of his career. For this same reason it is probably also one of his most accessible films. Even those untroubled by the questions that obsessed Bergman so completely, should find enough going on to take something away from the film.As The Seventh Seal begins with an iconic image, it also ends with another: Death, carrying his scythe and leading his party of seven on a macabre dance against a brooding sky. It was a spur of the moment decision to film it, and exists only because Bergman and his cameraman were taken by a dramatic cloud formation in the distance. In fact the decision was so impulsive that the figures aren't the actors at all, but members of the crew and a couple of curious tourists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film as an art-form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal is considered on of the best Swedish film ever, and Ingmar Bergman is certainly the most famous filmmaker out of that nation. The Seventh Seal is easily a great example of art-house film making done right.The Seventh Seal take place in Medieval period in Sweden with the Black Death is sweeping the land. Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) has returned from the Crusades and a black clocked man who says he is Death (Bengt Ekerot) says he comes for him. Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess, saying if he resists then lives and if he wins he is free. Antonius is allowed to travel and he goes with strong, clever, but less philosophical squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand). On the way Antonius and Jöns form a entourage, including a husband and wife acting team Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their one-year-old son Mikael, a deaf girl (Gunnel Lindblom) that Jöns saves and a blacksmith Plog (?ke Fridell) whom wife just left him. As the game continues Death watches and tries to trick Antonius, and he takes an interest in the young family. Antonius needs to save the family so their could live their lives.This is a very thematic film, with a focus on the ideas of loss of faith, debates whether God exist and of course, the continuing threat of death. They is excellent dialogue in throughout the film, some of actually a little witty. It also looks at the issues with intelligence and in detail, but in a accessible manner as well. Bergman takes great care with the imaginary in the film. He uses the art of Albertus Pictor who was influenced by the aftermath of the Black Death: his painting often focused on death. He also took great care with his scenes, often using long continuous shots, allowing them to evolve naturally. Bergman also picks the 14th Century as his setting. This is not pretending to be historically accurate film like Braveheart was making itself out to be. But it adds to then scenes of death affecting the world and how pessimistic people were. It also had interesting sub-plots and ideas like Flagellants going to the village. Bergman's direction was excellent through out the film, and shows that he was a real artist.The acting is excellent. This was on of Max von Sydow's first big roles, and he shows the disillusionment in this character. Gunnar Björnstrand was very good as strong, loyal character who didn't think about the grander scheme of live. He just continues with live and had a decent heart, but is willing to use violence. Bengt Ekerot had a good sense of menace as Death.A excellent, tort film that is a must see for film fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to deciding the forefathers of emotional, psychological cinema that deals with potently devastating topics, one of the films that definitely comes up is Ingmar Bergman's utter masterpiece "Det sjunde inseglet". We begin by seeing it as a small, independent film from Europe that may be interesting to observe if only for the culture and the obvious linguistic differences. By the end of the last minute, we can't believe how such a seemingly small film has been able to move us, and how it has been able to force us into thinking about heavy and potentially disturbing topics that we've all come to wonder about at some point of our lives...and it does so with such precision and searing accuracy, that we wonder how we couldn't have noticed such a gem before.The film deals with a 14th century crusader (Max Von Sydow) who's returning from the Holy Land after many years of endless battle, and on his way home, he encounters the Angel of Death on a long-forgotten beach. Death has, obviously, come to claim him at last, as He has been known to do so for quite a while, what with the Plague finishing off most of Europe with the pest. This particular crusader, an important and intelligent man, decides to challenge Death in a game of chess: he forestalls his demise until the game is over, and if he wins death will move one and let him live for many more years. If Death wins...well, you'll see.As the crusader fights an endless game of chess with Death, he travels with his faithful but constantly reproaching squire back to his castle. On the way, they meet a number of interesting characters that help (or, actually, make up) the plot of the film. Each character embodies a different take on the religious aspect of the Dark Ages, and provides, each in his/her own way, a particular point of view on the themes of death, the afterlife, and moral correct-ness.The crusader himself has doubts about this, doubts that never let him sleep and that are troubling his existence: What is there in the afterlife? Is there a God and a Devil? Is there even an afterlife or is there simply nothingness once you die? Death is, naturally, vague about these topics and refuses to relinquish any information as he plays chess with the crusader, but the characters he meets provide their own hypotheses to these questions and add to his infinite wisdom. Our crusader decides that he will die only until he has corrected some wrongs in his life and, more importantly, until he has performed a good deed that will finally make his existence on earth valuable.But these are very difficult questions to be answered, and Ingmar Bergman makes a point of heightening the difficulty by placing the moral and emotional struggles smack down the middle ages and their obscurely slovenly society. The dialogue and reflective monologues from the characters establish the ideas that torment the characters, and the images that are presented heighten the intensity of the topics (unflinchingly) to astronomical heights, involving the viewer not only in the story and development of the film, but on the director's point and art as well.The images seen are some of the most famous and remembered in all of cinematic history; they're short episodes the characters witness, and they're burned into the viewer's mind forever: a procession of martyrs who travel around the country in self-flagellation and pleading for God's forgiveness; a woman who has consorted with the devil and has her hands and feet stoned and broken, and is finally burned at the stake; a poor and kind-hearted juggler who dances like a bear to save his life from an amoral and sodomite crowd; the Virgin Mary walking with her naked infant in a meadow; a joyous picnic between newfound friends (the scene that, I believe, anchors the point of the film and upsets the general angst and "normalized" horror the rest of the film presents); and, more importantly, the scene where the crusader confesses himself to Death, exposing in a very well-organised monologue the pain and insecurity humans feel towards nothingness and their man-made need to believe in a God that gives sense to our trajectory in earth and our possible entrance to the Next World.I won't go into analyzing the characters the crusader meets. Even though they're crucial to a thorough examination of how the moral dilemma is augmented and supported, I'd have to discuss a large list of spoilers that would do nothing to the reader's understanding and enjoyment of the film. Let's just say that, without even seeming to try, these characters move precariously through these dark and dangerous times, sometimes understanding the supernatural world they live in, sometimes overwhelmed by it's implications and finally being able to do nothing about it.The screenplay is an obvious masterpiece, but so is the photography (which is all-inclusive and treats the scenes with a special ominous foreboding that keeps us on the edge of our seat every single minute), and so is the acting (which, even though is melodramatic to a large extent, always remains balanced and adequate).This is a difficult film to try and explain. It was treated with an exorbitant amount of acuteness and love, and the topics were so well-presented and developed, that I could write page after page about what I learned, what I think, and how each minute of the film could only advance my wonderment. But, thankfully, it is not my job to detail my analysis, but to review the film...and, in conclusion, I find it to be a perfectly made movie that will always be embedded into my memory. See it at all costs! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nothing escapes me" - Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) has shipwrecked on the shores of Sweden with his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand) having returned from a Crusade in the Holy Land. In these shores he meets Death (Bengt Ekerot) and challenges him to a game of chess. If he wins, he will not die. The atmosphere back home is that of death and decay; it is the 14th century and the Plague is rampant.The Seventh Seal is a meditation on the various philosophical and theological implications of death. As the story progresses, Block's deadly game unfolds, during which time he enjoys a reprieve. Death is a cunning opponent; sneaking up on Block repetitively when he least expects it.Block is tormented with the notion of God, he wishes God to show himself, he yearns and thirsts for knowledge of God. His words when he believes to be confessing to a priest in the church reminded me of the narrative of Kirilov in Dostoyevsky's Demons, when he speaks of "killing God within himself", God as fear, fear of the unknown, fear, ultimately, of death. He refers to it as a "mocking presence that won't go away". In the end, though, he seeks God (he falls in prayer at the last hour), yet his faith is not gratuitous and without rationale; in this he is like Fyodor himself. His squire Jöns is, on the other hand, a cynic, and refuses to believe the folklore, as he tells the church-painter Albertus Pictor (Gunnar Olsson).We are also introduced to a family reminiscent of the Holy Family: Jof/Joseph (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia/Maria (Bibi Andersson) and their young child Mikael. They are an acting troupe, and are also the only characters in the film that, despite the reigning atmosphere of terror and chaos, remain joyful, calm and kind. The innocence of their child cries similarities with Jesus Christ, "for such is the kingdom of Heaven". Jof has visions of the Holy. Through his eyes we see the Virgin Mary teaching the baby Jesus to walk, and the Danse Macabre.An aspect that makes The Seventh Seal work is the fact there is a tangible and believable story, told in the most simple terms - even if every ounce is charged with the most weighty moral questions and ponderings about life and death - with much comedic relief thrown in, and a deluxe set of actors. Not a single performance in the movie is mediocre. There is also exemplar use of lush scenarios and scapes, which intermixed with Nordic chants with low basses create scenes more chilling than any modern CGI-oriented atmosphere with all the high-tech.There are memorable scenes in this movie, such as the squirrel eating at a tree-trunk recently cut down causing the death of one of the characters, and the parading mendicants, lashing themselves and those in front of them, carrying the Ark of the Covenant and the Cross, with raving friars in tow. Even the young girl "witch" (Maud Hansson) who is used as a scapegoat "she is believed to be the cause of the Plague", a soldier tells Block upon his questioning, is shocking in her look of confusion and innocence, as well as madness. God is not one to chastise, however, as we see in Block's movements, giving the witch something "for the pain", that she may not suffer. Another epic scene is that in which the troupe is enveloped in jest on the stage: Bergman is faithful to what is known of the rural acting and theatre of this time, as well as the scene in the drinking den, where Jof, innocent, is made a fool of, and the common folk are seen debating what they believe to be the impending doomsday which "is at hand".Some have hailed The Seventh Seal to be a movie denying God - this does not appear to be the case. The silence of God, a recurring motif, leads one to consider the role of faith "And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour" (Revelation 8:1). The film is a rumination on matters Godly and surrounding death, and it does not give any one answer to the questions it poses: without forcing any conclusion on us. What it does do is treat its viewer with respect; we are shown both sides of the argument: Jöns and Block, Jof, Death, and left to fend for ourselves in this intellectual dilemma.The Seventh Seal is a masterpiece of modern cinema. Anyone who considers himself to know film does not until he has seen this. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a film student and have been watching some of the classic films throughout this summer. I've looked at On the Waterfront, 2001, Citizen Kane, High Noon, Seven Samurai, and tonight I watched The Seventh Seal; I can honestly say I have never been this affected by a film. While the aforementioned are undoubtedly great in their own right, this movie addresses mortality, faith, and opposing world views in an incredibly powerful fashion. Though it is very theatrical for a movie, it works because the ideas are so widespread and perennial. Also, the writing is fantastic. Though this movie may not be for everyone, it certainly will hit home with anyone that has ever questioned their own existence or the meaning of things. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Whatever You Always See"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both plot lines, the knight Antonius Block in search for god and/or Satan and a juggler family on tour through medieval Sweden, were started separately until they meet at a performance in a village. The knight and his squire find rest at the caravan of the family and this is the key scene of the whole film. The woman serves her guests with simple bounties of nature, with strawberries and milk. She takes life as it comes and in her companion with that joie de vivre, Antonius finds deep peace. He explicitly commits that he'll always remember the happiness of this moment, the bowl filled with strawberries, the milk, the conversations he has with this charming actor couple Mia and Jof.I think, exactly this is the quintessence of the film: Such happiness and fortune can't be known as a permanent condition, but answers the question "What is the meaning of life?" Because of moments like this peaceful rest in harmony, sympathy, joy life has its value (a concept Bergman also explains in Wild Strawberries and Cries and Whispers). And that is why the closing scene also belongs to Mia and Jof. Jof sees a Dance of Death at the horizon, but Mia wipes off his visions with the words: "Whatever you always see."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seventh Seal, The (1957) **** (out of 4) The black plague is sweeping through Sweden and a knight (Max Von Sydow) challenges Death to a game of chess so that he can try to understand the meanings of good, evil and who God really is. Another remarkable film from Ingmar Bergman would probably be my second favorite of his behind Persona but this one here would probably get more viewings from me. The film is dark, dirty and downright depressing but that's what makes it rather unique. I guess you could also call the film ugly in its subject matter but Bergman's masterful touch makes it all very poetic.</fullReview>

This film is still incredibly relevant to today's issues and also has great irony of depicting people's fear Y2k by showing the massive fear of apocalypse from the year 1000. Aside from political relevance it also has religious relevance through "Christ metaphor" inherent in some of the characters in the film. The imagery from the opening sequence and final sequence of the film are also unforgettable as well. Extremely thought provoking film and also proof that it doesn't take special effects or 100 million dollars to make an amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A miracle. The greatest work of art of the 20th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Seventh Seal" goes beyond the notion of movie. For me it is a miracle. Much simply said, the greatest work of art of the 20th century. The abyssal depth of this film is stunning. The greatest questions that have shaken the human mind and soul from the beginning of the species, Death, God, Love, Evil, Meaning of Life, Desperation, Hope, are here faced with sound courage and outstanding intelligence.No doubt that the director Ingmar Bergman was a genius. But his other works, though many of them extraordinary, were just movies, while in the "The Seventh Seal" he reached the level of the greatest artists of human history. The images are worth of Duerer, Bosch, Bruegel. The script, the psychological study of the characters and the poetry are worth of Shakespeare and Goethe. The depth of the philosophical and theological investigation is worth of Spinoza and Swedenborg. The Middle Ages of Northern Europe are recreated with the accuracy and care for details of a great artist. The monk's sermon on sin and repentance grates to our modern ears, but we realize that it is perfectly coherent and realistic for the Middle Ages. The knight and his squire see the witch executed on the stake. They are disgusted, but they accept it and do not interfere. That's the way people were in those times. And the disturbing scene at the tavern, were, for no reason, the innocent, meek tumbler is abused and everybody laughs at him, is fully realistic, as well. That was people's sense of humor in those ages. The ancient Nordic culture is represented in all its terrible splendor: the plague, the flagellants, the witch hunt, the mystic visions of the tumbler, the encounter of the knight and his skeptical squire with the wandering actors, the fool girl, the reading of the Apocalypse. And, of course, the chess-match with the Death, one of the most powerful symbols in the history of art. Among uncountable instances, I record a wonderful subtlety of the script. The knight says to the Death "I don't fear to die, but, please, tell me: is there a God?" But not even the Death can answer. He just knows his own dreadful existence.Since, after all, we are speaking of a film, let me remark that there isn't a single moment of bore in "The Seventh Seal", in spite of the profound problems it deals with.Are the above enthusiastic comments somehow exaggerated? I don't think so. Watch "The Seventh Seal" and merge yourself into Art at its highest level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exalted romp with serious intentions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's strange for such an exalted film to have such a left-field plot. A medieval knight literally plays chess for his life with death, and while the game goes on, falls in with a travelling troupe of actors, death stalking them along the way. If it was not for Bergman's quite undeserved reputation for austerity and solemnity, it would be clear this is a playful, comic film.This film is the best representation of Bergman's middle style, stressing theatricality and pictorialism.Bengt Ekerot is suitably striking as death, and Max Von Sydow is about as close a modern actor can be to a medieval knight, towering in masculinity, a natural intelligence and stature, with his unworldly distraction. And Bibi Andersson is both beautiful and striking too as the actor's wife.Still, apart from being a good, high-value romp, I can't quite see how this was so lauded at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark honest look into our souls as humans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has inspired me more than any other to care about cinema. The story of a knight that starts to honestly ask questions about the existence of God, while death roams all around him. Literally, Death (the Grimm Reaper) appears and is actually confronting the knight as the instigator, the opponent, and the helper,so they both sit to play chess. The Black plague is all around and the knight has compassion on a family . It's been a long time since I saw this movie but when I did I new I just witnessed something very rare in Cinema. Satan also reviles the concept of God, and in the movie the Devil shows up to say "He doesn't exist!" Most of us think the quest for what is in a mans soul as a afterthought but Ingmar Bergman makes the observer ask, "Where do we go, after we die?" Do you believe in a cold god, A Satan. If you believe in the devil then you need to think there is a God, the Judeo/Christian Bible Is the first to mention Satan thousands of years ago. So I'd like to think we are looked after by a God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly thought that would be hard for a movie to move down in my mind/heart how I feel and think about Rashomon/2001 and movies related the search for ourselves. The 7S is sublime. I fell in love with Bergman's aesthetic since Smultronstallet. But this one is not only visually perfect. It has the best original script I've ever seen. This knight, representing what is nothing but the very human kind itself, gives us such a deep vision of his own sins. This is the ultimate redemption movie. The knight... confronting the most terrible and hard fight against the most powerful enemy that we ever had- the death. So, how face it? How much of our life do we spend thinking about it? Is somebody out there who really cares that? Is someone waiting for us when we are gone? This is not a simple knight. This is the entire human race, questioning the very foundations of what we are, or what we are not. Can we defeat death? Can we win the match? I think we can. I think... that... there HAS to be a moment in our lives where... we HAVE to questioning, we have to DOUBT what we are doing. What are our goals. We don't have time. The death is... just there. In our back. Watching us... waiting with the most terrible of patience. I think Bergman, in some point, questioned all this... and tried to tell us his vision. How he felt, what he felt when he asked to himself "What would I do if I could defeat death?" We can't, at least for the moment. So, the main subject is to me- Do something in your life that made it have sense at the end. We might have not the chance. We might don't have that last match.Det Sjunde inseglet (1957) 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plague is ravaging North-Europe and the grim reaper is coming to reap the souls without regard to whether they are in bloom, seeds or actually have reached the proper time for its harvest. Antonius Block has just returned from the crusades and encounters Death, but instead of seeing a cul-de-sac he tries to win time by playing chess with him. As Death is very busy he has to run in and out of the game. Meanwhile Antonius tries to find out if there is a God that can save him, for which a clear answer he of course is not given. On the way however he stumbles into a acting couple that experience true happiness that makes him forget for a little while what he's running from. 'Det Sjunde Inseglet' is typical for Bergman full of clever allegories and questions. It takes more than a lifetime to answer them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaging Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies, like Seven Samurai, where you watch it for the first time, following one character, and suddenly not-quite-midway through you realize that every character is important and intricately linked into the progression and exposition of the story and themes, so you know before you've even finished that you need to watch it again.One of the more blatantly philosophical films out there (which is a good thing in this case, by the way, don't think that I'm using the term "blatant" as a negative indicator), Ingred Bergman's The Seventh Seal basically is a contemplation on Death. I'm sure you've read that already, on the back of the Criterion DVD box, on the synopsis written for it at any site where it's listed, in the many reviews, both critical and mundane, and everywhere that even mentions this movie.So I'm not going to go so much into the focus of the characters on Death, as it were, because you know it all already, even if you haven't seen it. Instead what I'll focus on is the idea of presenting Death or, roughly, imaging him. One of the key things that sets the events in this movie off is that the knight asks Death to play chess and, when Death asks him how he knows he likes chess, the knight answers, "I saw it in a painting." Throughout this movie are shown many different artists, philosophers, and people trying to present what Death is and looks like via different media such as painting, theatre, prayer, actions, and discussions, and yet the main memorable image of this film is precisely the distinctive image of Death himself, the man with the thin lips and large forhead who holds his arm out to envelop on the front cover of the Criterion DVD. A film that invests its interest in Death needs a way of presenting him in a way that isn't completely stuck in the inspirations of other presentations, else focusing an entire work on Death becomes merely repetitious to what has all been said before. Thus we have a very original and thus very compelling image of Death that becomes the inspiration instead of just being an amalgamation of other's ideas.Thus this movie brilliantly shows Death personified and characterized without holding all the dialog towards Death as a person but Death as a force. By showing that other people "draw" Death in various forms and different symbolic ways, the subjective viewpoint of who Death is is reinforced without having to be stated, which can be condescending.Then we are so pleasantly allowed to sit back and watch the other characters all invest their energy into their ideas of Death, to mix them together and come up with a complete idea of how Death affects us profoundly and psychologically.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After spending ten years in the holy land fighting in the Crusades, the knight Antonious Block and his squire Jöns return to Sweden. However, instead of a warm homecoming, a country that is being ravaged by the Black Plague instead greets the two men.While resting at a beach, Antonious is visited by Death who says that the time has come for the knight's life to end. However, Antonious is not ready for his life to end. It is not because he is afraid of death, but because he wants to gain knowledge of God. With his faith hampered by ten tears fighting in the crusades and by the fact that his countrymen are rotting to death because of the plague Antonious wants to discover if God truly exists or not. Therefore, in order to gain some time, Antonious challenges Death to a game of chess that the two play throughout the film.The main struggle within Bergman's film is the conflict one feels when one wants to have faith in God in times of trouble, however, because God is silent and lets his people suffer one truly wonders if such a God truly exists. However, because one has believed in the God for his or her entire life, one cannot extract go from one's heart and mind thereby making one's wavering faith a source of pain and conflict instead of the bastion of hope it had once been.A slow, meditative film, The Seventh Seal brings to the fore the extremes some people will go to in times of strife. With its depictions of flagellates, those who beat themselves in order to repent for their sins, and witch burnings the film is obviously not a very happy film, but it is one that will make one think of the unknown and whether or nor within this vast unknown is there anything there or is it empty?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about a really cryptic movie is that it can fork numerous interpretations. This is what I thought the movie meant.The time is up for every major character in the movie. Jof, Mia and Mikael escape death because Antonius sacrifices his game for their sake thereby distracting death while they escape.Death asks Antonius whether he has made good of his respite for which he answers 'yes'.Earlier in the church he confesses that he wants to use his respite to accomplish one meaningful act. Saving them from death was the meaningful act.Central idea:This movie challenges religion. The reason for the crusades is constantly questioned. In the end it is not God that saves them(Jof,Mia and Mikael) but a mortal(Antonius).In the same line we can see a good deal of time being devoted to show blind beliefs in people(people inflicted with plague flogging themselves, the girl who is burnt).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophical With Strong Point Of View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect from this film. The figure of Death on the cover in high contrast of black and white is disturbing yet compelling.While the plot in this movie is rather basic, the philosophical ideas are presented in a very engaging way. This taps into the primal human fear of death and search for answers. Not only the search, but the sometimes seemingly hopelessness of existence.Death plays a literal role as well as being a prevalent occurrence.****Spoiler**** When the young crusader starts talking about how God cannot exist with all the horrible death as a result of the plague it made my spine tingle. Very real and direct observations of faith versus immediate reality are made.For the crusader to do something meaningful as a last chance of figuring it out. However he never does figure it all out. He is content at having tricked death before he goes.The scene where the two characters are talking about women after the one's wife disappeared to cheat with the actor was funny. Here we have two guys talking about how women are useless, how you should kill them after a short period. Yet the men are weak because they are so dependent on the idea of having a woman. Then for the wife to pull it off later by being all sweet to her husband. Then she agrees to have the actor killed. This to me just shows the shallowness of both sexes, at least those two characters as husband and wife. The whole sanctity of marriage throne out the window. One portrayal of "good" religious folk being hypocrites.Also the portrayal of the religious fanatics burning the witch. When the "godless" crusader has the most humanity and compassion in not wanting her to die. He does not see Satan in her, just a girl hysterical like the men ready to burn her at the stake. ****End Spoiler***I think this movie is powerful in its ideas and not afraid to present them in a "in your face" way. The basic plot is rather dull but it doesn't matter because the ideas make you think. Some of the imagery and happenings in the movie are surreal in presentation.I would definitely recommend this movie if you like something different from your standard movie fare. Intelligent, well written and pretty interesting material that will make you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most aesthetically powerful and amazing films in the history of motion pictures!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you remember the grim reaper, the image of death himself, coming to claim those who have died? Where did that image come from or originate? Well, here it is! I'll always remember the image of death, because it is something, or in the case of this film, a figure that we will all one day, face at some point in our lives. And it's really beautifully expressed, because although death can be very frightening the first time we see it, we realize that there is nothing to fear, and that life is something that is very precious and beautiful, once you learn to enjoy it. This film is not so much about death as it is about life. Life is a gift, and I don't think people should waste it. If you waste it, when death confronts you for the first time in your life, you will feel regret and wish you could go back and make the most of your life. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen. But fortunately, those left alive still have a chance to make the best of what life they have left to live. The image of the people dancing with death at the conclusion of the film, shows how little we have to fear and that those who are dead are in a better place than they might have been. Both life and death are places that people are going to go in their lives, yet they will not be unhappy or scared once they get there. That is the real beauty of this film. There's no avoiding it, but there is nothing to be afraid of. Life is a wonderful, beautiful gift that we will one day lose to death, as does the man who loses the chess game with death. And the game of chess with death clearly shows that there is no other way of conquering death, other than dying. "The Seventh Seal" stands out as a powerful message for people, as well as a majestic piece of artwork that can never be repeated or duplicated in other films as finely or as masterfully as this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am attempting to capsulate the best film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the best film ever made, be it Swedish or American. It goes beyond the normal bounds of film making to bring a profound, often harrowing, message to the viewer. The philosophical implication of death and the existence of God is toyed with. The eerie portrayal of Death with a black cape has become a symbol within itself. When the crusader plays Chess with Death, in the hopes of prolonging his life, so he can do that one good thing--I was on the edge of my seat. The mesmorizing confessional scene is cinemagraphic genious. There are many gems, for movie makers, in this film. It is a great display of cinema art and philosophical "de profundis". The Seventh Seal crosses all boundaries. It is a film both endearing and frightening. I can watch it again and again, and be blown away by its magnitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull and Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To go straight to the point, I was not impressed. This film is currently at #130 out of IMDb's top 250 list and to me is extremely overrated. It wasn't that bad of a film, it is just not very enjoyable or appealing to watch. It brought up some interesting topics and philosophies but was really not that deep or intellectual as many claim. I liked the symbolism of a man interacting with Death and the excellent scene of the plagued people and their march through the town, but the majority of the film was simply dull, dreary, and boring. I have a feeling that it is rated so highly because of a strong atheist or agnostic following simply because of the subject matter not based on the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fully deserves its rep as a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one amazing film, and in my view Ingmar Bergman's best. Visually, The Seventh looks wonderful, the bleak scenery adds much to the mood, the cinematography is beautifully composed and skillful and the lighting is atmospheric. It also has many memorable images like with the flagellates, the hawk flying in the cloudless sky, Jof's vision of the Virgin Mary and the milk and strawberries in the dusk. Bergman's direction is superb, Erik Nordgren's score is resolutely haunting and the dialogue is some of the most thought-provoking I've heard with some nice bawdy humour with especially the squire that doesn't feel misplaced. The story is like an allegory and meditation of life, death, love and fear(amongst other things), and it is dealt with in a very intelligent and careful manner. Again there are some timeless scenes like the ending, the scene of the girl about to be burnt, Death being challenged to a game of chess and with the jester. The acting is also exemplary, Max Von Sydow gives one of cinema's finest performances, stoic yet always commanding with a face that speaks volumes about what he's thinking. Bengt Ekerot evokes chills as Death, while Gunner Bjornstrand is suitably dry as the squire. All in all, a really amazing film, fully deserving of its reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

They run into numerous encounters in a very changed land.

		<shortDescription>The Pain of Questions Left Unanswered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This simple precept for this flick is confounded by the abstruse questions such a subject is forced to face. Fighting in God's name for a decade, our heroes return home only to find that death and despair have infested their homeland. The contradictory nature of man, wickedly intelligent and self-aware on the one hand, a stupid, superstitious and easily manipulated idiot on the other, is what makes the plight of our heroes so simple and yet so profound. In essence, we are asked to respond to God's silence in assured faith, a contradiction to common sense that has somehow has manacled our essence from time immemorial. What is more, this flick flirts with such conundrum by account of the simplicity of not seeking answers but instead a purpose. Indeed! This flick is at times a cacophony of relentless imagery punctuated by wonderful humor and witty dialog. The acting was simply aces on all accounts. Ingmar Bergman's direction hits the bulls eye here, crafting an impossible concept into a convincing and highly enjoyable flick that cannot help but move any human with breathe still gracing his lungs. How our players accept their fate, and the final image of that fate, leaves an indelible stain that only the commerce of celluloid could faithfully employ.

		<fullReview>Welcome to my blog. It is not without reason that I have chosen this film as the first post ever, certain it will bring good vibrations our way. In any case, what a better way to start, than with a master!The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's 1956 gem of a feature. I don't think I am really suitable to give an impartial opinion on this movie, because I simply love it in an almost morbid way. Maybe because of its landscapes, barren and desolated; maybe because of its close-ups: paintings, section-views of a human's spirit; maybe because of the beauty, angelical, yet full of vitality and passion, of the female interpreters; maybe because of its hieratic stillness, alternated with the utmost dynamicity, the timeline blurring at the edges, both in the movie, and in real-time; maybe because of Antonius Block and his obsessive quest, exemplar of the struggle we face against fake spirituality, and his all-consuming receipt of the final strike of the scythe.Block is a noble knight, returning to his native Sweden after ten years spent fighting in the Crusades, with his faithful squire, who shares the same whole-heartedness, only to find a country ravaged by the Black Death, and people trying what they can to save themselves from what they think is a divine curse. We come to identify with him, and we come to love the simple goodness of Jof (Joseph) and Mia (Mary), and their symbolic role in this allegoric tale, which grabs us by the throat from the start, with the scenes of desolation in a plague-ridden Sweden. The realism of the small countryside village where the story first develops is proof of Bergman's mastery with the alternation between wider frames and close-ups, between general and particular, between society and inner individual life, and their collision, a theme dear to the Swedish master, as we can see in later films, such as Persona.But I'm digressing now. It's time for you to enjoy the show: whether it is for the first or the tenth time, I know you will...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, a true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that requires attention from the viewer. It is metaphoric, not about medieval times but about all human beings, at all times. The story is simple, a Knight (Max Von Sydow) coming home from the crusades to a land ravaged by the plague. He encounters death and challenge him to a game of chess. He is not really seeking to prolong his life instead he is really seeking answers. He has seen death in the crusades and he is facing more death as he comes home.The scene with the Knight and Death playing chess by the seashore is one of the most haunting scenes in this movie. There are many of them. Ingmar Bergman really pulled out all the stops to create a movie which will haunt you and at the same time make you ponder. It's not just about a Knight on a pointless game but about all human beings. The Knight represents all human being asking the same questions.The scene that affected me most is the scene when the knight arrives at a monastery and is confessing to who he thought was a monk or a priest. The questions that the knight asked are the kind of questions that we all have asked and the response that he gets is pretty much the response we will get. The movie delves into the question of mortality and the meaning of existence. Anybody who has thought about it will understand the Knight's frustration and despondency, for the answer is perhaps nonexistent. For me the brilliance of this film is that it asked the important questions early and left us with no real answers. By asking the questions, scenes in this movie are not just images but they have underlying meanings. Meanings that we the viewer then create for ourselves. What was the scene with the strawberries and milk mean? If it had any meaning at all. I find myself thinking that that scene is about joy of simple pleasure and being with pleasant people providing us with good feelings and memories that we will treasure. I have to admit I have rarely seen a movie that affected me as much as this movie. It was one of those movies I personally would like to have seen again back to back. The movies that I frequently would watch back to back were light weight stuff comedies or action films. Rarely do I wish to see serious drama again back to back.Right now I will have to admit it barely missed being in my top ten greatest films. I have a feeling that the next time I see it again I will have to move it very high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the definitive pinnacles of twentieth century cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this review after the death of Ingmar Bergman at the age of 89. It's fitting then that I should now return to a particular work that the legendary filmmaker wrote and directed fifty years ago, which expresses in explicit and philosophical detail, his overriding fear of death, and how this particular fear is one that is has been used and exploited for centuries by the Church for it's personal and ideological gain. As a result, The Seventh Seal can be described as an abstract allegory pertaining to the notion of life and death, as an expressionist horror film rife with iconic imagery and a foreboding atmosphere of Medieval torment and savage, plague-ridden doom, or as an almost sardonic satire on the catholic church, on war, and on organised religion in general.I suppose at this point in time the film is most famous for it's central motif, in which a noble knight returning home from the crusades plays a series of chess games with the black-clad figure of death in an attempt to win back his life and return to his family. The games appear at different intervals throughout the film, which is structured episodically, taking in a scene of tranquil reflection and eventual performance from a group of travelling actors, the appearance of a religious procession marking a disease ridden town as unclean, and a scene in which a young woman is burned at the stake as a heretic. Thusly, the film is structured to become darker and more foreboding as our central character and his assistant make their way closer to home; taking the travelling actors along with them and trying to cheat death at every single turn.Even without that central motif and iconic series of shots in which the knight, Antonious Block sits cross-legged across from the grinning, white-faced visage of Death and tries desperately to best him with every trick in the book, the film would still be a completely fascinating experience from beginning to end.Speaking personally, I first saw the film at the age of 18, having already seen Bergman's more difficult films, Persona and The Hour of the Wolf. Both of these films confused, confounded and greatly irritated me on first viewing, almost turning me off Bergman before I'd even been turned on. Later, I saw the underrated Virgin Spring and my faith was somewhat restored. Regardless, I came to The Seventh Seal expecting the worst; expecting some sort of seemingly ponderous bleak essay, filled with all manner of alienating cinematic tricks and a detached quality to the writing. Instead, I found a film that told a fascinating story, had marvellous characters, and was beautifully shot, edited and scored throughout. Above all else, though; the film was entertaining. It's still as bleak as Bergman is known to be, but the story never drags, and the moral of the piece never becomes too obviously. It is simply a great film; one that I could watch again and again and still find elements to enjoy on a number of different levels.Even after my first viewing I could understand how it's legacy had endured over forty-so years; with the ideas behind the plot, the power of the imagery and the integrity of the performances creating something that is entirely universal. This isn't one of those films that you can consign to the rubbish bin marked "art house extravagance", or even as being part of the ponderous pretentious image that many people have of Bergman as the stereotypical, black beret, polo-neck wearing intellectual who crafted bleak, expressionist art dramas in retina-scorching black and white, and ladled with bursts of torturous religious guilt and searing personal angst.For me, it's one of the greatest entries into the pantheon of twentieth century cinema you could ever hope to find (and that definitely isn't hyperbole). A continually beguiling, rewarding, interesting and sympathetic drama that weaves numerous strands and sub-textual layers of personal reflection, satire, philosophy, performance and the art of cinema itself without ever becoming preachy, affected, or disappearing up its own back passage. As I said before, it is simply a GREAT film; one that should be experienced by all admires of cinema in it's purest form, and not simply as a two-hour diversion while you forget the complexities of life. The Seventh Seal, like all great works of cinema, asks its audience to approach with an open mind and to actively question the philosophical and satirical points that it raises throughout, whilst rewarding you with a great drama, with great performances, great direction and a number of seriously unforgettable images.INGMAR BERGMAN (1918-2007)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A snapshot of the Middle Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Seventh Seal" is Ingmar Bergman's film depicting Sweden during the 14th century in the time of the bubonic plague. The film starts with Antonius Block, a knight and his squire returning from the Crusades to Sweden. Antonius is pursued by Death in corporeal form, and challenges him to a high stakes game of chess. From there the film explores the lives of a number of characters within Sweden with the chess game as a recurring element in the film.My favorite of the characters was Antonius Block, the pensive knight in a crisis of faith played skillfully by Max von Sydow. Also particularly memorable were Gunnar Björnstrand as the snappy and cynical squire and Bengt Ekerot as Death himself. All of the performances in this film were first-rate.This film is very effective as a snapshot of the Middle Ages and includes a mix of humorous and somber scenes to chronicle the age. This film covers a range of topics pertinent to the Middle Ages including the effects of the bubonic plague and Crusades, crises of faith, self-punishment as atonement, love, stage performance, the arbitrary punishment of a "witch" and naturally, death. One of the film's notable scenes was when a soothsayer from the church bombards a public audience with a message of doom. All of these themes are considered with striking characterizations and sharp dialogue.The idea of having a lingering Death figure to represent the uncertainty of the time was an excellent one. The dialogues between Block and Death proved among the most interesting moments of the film, even though they only represent a fraction of the film. My only regret of this film is that Bergman didn't include more interplay between Block and Death, but overall "The Seventh Seal" is very engaging and interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tough work of storytelling. The Seventh Seal tells of a visionary knight's existential struggle as he journeys through plagued Denmark. Famously, the knight bargains to extend his life for the length of a game of chess with Death himself; the game lasts throughout the journey. The knight's encounters are at once solipsistic and allegorical but also very real and human, making for a satisfying essay on the nature of faith, compassion, love, life and death.Phew. Luckily Bergman is nothing if not big-hearted and the film has plenty of good humour to it. Principal amongst them is the fool-composite of Jof (Nils Poppe); unlike a Shakespearen fool, his clowning has little meaning and only we are party to his visions. His is the unifying aspect of the film.Beside him is a solid cast headed by a fine double-act. Max von Sydow is the serene but anguished knight; his urbane, manly squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand) is a tough counterpart. Such close, subtly complimentary roles are the hall mark of the film whose script and set-pieces never do what you might expect. Punctuating the journey is the ubiquitous Death. Played with remarkable merriment by Bengt Ekerot, he is difficult to measure until his hideous final line.In addition to the vision of the director there is fine music and some impressive photography. If I have one criticism it is that Bergman sometimes doesn't do enough, relying on the cast to create the cinematic melodrama. But the story is well-told. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Profound and Important Films I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal has an odd tone. It feels cheery and comical, and yet it's themes and statements are so serious and profound. Bergman's blurring of comedy and tragedy is very effective, because considering what the movie is saying, irony in feeling and mood is vital.The plot seems as if it's a glum farce, as a knight plays for his life in a chess game against personified Death. It is weaved gracefully and mysteriously with symbolisms and metaphors in seemingly very direct scenes of great power, about whether death is escapable or not, and though one can plot against it, the plot may only be a stall for time. The film's tragicomic duality is projected throughout the film, as it has very prominent themes of denial of the prospect of God's nonexistence against the darkly satirical setting: The end of the Crusades in a naive, plague-torn village, a time when faith in God was something stringently and daftly policed.The Seventh Seal leaves a great impact upon me, and the cinematography, as subtle as it is, is one of the things about it I love the most. The silent symbolisms, the quiet effects, and especially the silhouetted dance of death on the hill are quite powerful. This could also be one of the best performances I've seen from Max Von Sydow.It is one of the true deservedly hailed masterpieces of the movies, and I will see it again several times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I can only echo the fulsome praise that this film has received and clearly deserves, I'd like propose that what makes it so great a work is its perfect balance between on the one hand the knight's grim, existential battle with death and on the other hand the prelapsarian idyll represented by the travelling players. This kind of double narrative is found across art-forms and time of course, with Tolstoy's Anna Karenina being perhaps the most perfect example in literature. In that novel, Anna and Vronsky's journey to hell accompanied by Levin and Kitty's journey in the opposite direction. For all its grimness, with the Black Death and Death himself, The Seventh Seal is a celebration of the life, love and humour which fill the scenes with Jof, Mia and their little child.It's not that death can be cheated or overcome, rather that in life and among people we can find a respite from the cold cruel necessity of a meaningless universe. Whether we do so or not is very much up to us, and not the province of religion, state or other authority figures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What else could be said about this larger than life masterpiece? The visuals, the acting, the beautiful script, everything connects here and gives birth to the brilliant tale of a knight's quest for the meaning of his life.The plot is well known, a knight who returns from the crusade faces Death, but instead of accepting it, he challenges it to a game of chess. Antonius Block, the knight, will be alive as long as he does not lose. He continues the journey home while he plays chess. Pretty simple.Nevertheless, what Block(played by wonderful Max Von Sydow) will find in the journey home is a long series of questions and answers about life, death &amp; God. With his loyal squire, Jöns(Gunnar Björnstrand), he will be part of a series of events that will serve as catalyst to Block's meditations(and ours). Jöns' particular cynicism and Block's bizarre(for the time) view of life contrasts with the traditional way of life of the age, and the innocence represented by Jof and Mia, a couple of traveling artists who also joins them in their travel.As many critics and historians have pointed out, the visual imagery used by Bergman in this film has become an immortal image of the history of cinema. Since the very beginning, the image of Death(Bengt Ekerot) is at the same time Haunting and mesmerizing. Bergman understood very well the language of images and created a beautifully shocking image.Max Von Sydow and Gunna Björnstrand shine in the lead roles, giving their characters a personality of their own. The mere look in the eyes of Block give a very powerful insight of the man's emotion. Max Von Sydow really gives one of cinema's greatest performances.Finally, I can't stop recommending this movie. It may be boring at first, and maybe difficult to understand; but certainly it's an experience that will stay in the collective mind of humanity for many years. It's a true masterpiece.10/10</fullReview>

Is it the image of the Knight playing chess with Death on a beach, the breakers rolling in behind them? It it the incredibly haunting cinematography? The extraordinary acting? All of it? I first saw this movie when I a girl of 13 (a whole other story). This was the time in my life when I thought Troy Donahue in "A Summer Place" was the final word in great movies. And yet, "The Seventh Seal" reached down into my subconscious and hooked me like a hungry fish to a lure.There's nothing to criticize, unless you just can't tolerate this genre. Honestly, I too will almost always choose a lighter movie over a heavier one. "The Seventh Seal" is an exception to all my rules, all my usual preferences. If you have not seen it, see it.

		<shortDescription>Why is Bergman out of favor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having discovered Bergman as a teenager in Philadelphia, in double-headers at the old TLA cinema on South Street, and having such a hard time these days "selling" him to my film history students, and why he seems to have come out of critical favor. As for my students, it's more than the usual black and white, strange language problem that all film teachers now recognize. It seems to me to be part of the post-modern "understanding" that all meaning is as random as any other meaning, and that the search for God is a fake. In many ways I accept that notion, as it does fit in with the way the universe seems to be. My students watch Antonious Blok, and don't understand what his problem. (Bergman did understand that view, and created the character of Jons the squire, as a fill-in for the modern cynic.) Each time I show the film, and see it again for myself, I ask myself if in really is more than my own 60's romanticism, when we were discovering life. There are some films which I stop showing. However, my appreciation for "The Seventh Seal", and for Bergman, grows, and I feel it is time for a renewed interest in his films, in spite of our post-modern cynicism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterpiece. No doubt about it.It was my first Bergman film, and I was a bit anxious, as his works are considered difficult, and deeply psychological. And it's true, but this one has such an amazing mood that you're in it within few minutes.Some of the images will stay in your mind forever: the frightening parade of the ascetics, the eyes of the dying witch, empty village. But what is amazing is that Bergman within this dark and pessimistic movie managed to put lighter elements (conversation between Antonius and the actors at the sunset) or even humorous (seduction of blacksmith's wife, Death cutting down the tree), which make "The Seventh Seal" more absorbing. He put two opposites: cynical and pessimistic Jons and Antonius versus Jof and his family, common people who live a simple life, and therefore are close to God (Jof has visions of the Virgin Mary); and somehow gives answers to Antonius' questions.If you don't know any of Bergman's films start with this one. It's not his best, but the best for newcomers.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**possible spoilers** Beautiful, grotesque, disturbing, inspiring, tragic, funny, deeply spiritual, shockingly anti-religion. All of these describe Igmar Bergman's unique film about a knight (a young Max Von Sydow), returning from the Crusades, who has lost his faith. When Death (a living, breathing being in Bergman land, played with sardonic humor by Bengt Ekerot) pays the knight a visit, the knight challenges him to a game of chess, which continues throughout the film, as the knight, his cohort (Gunnar Björnstrand) and their various followers travel back to their homeland, witnessing the horrors not only of the black plague, but the church's opportunistic exploitation of it as an excuse to burn heretics and undesirables. The end is a somewhat ambiguous one, which one can take as either tragic or triumphant, depending on your viewpoint. Whether Bergman wishes to inspire hope or despair in his audience is a secret that he himself knows, though, my guess is he is happy either way. They don't make movies like this anymore, not even foreign ones, really. Most movies these days are cut and dry, 1-2-3, but this one allows us to make up our own mind as to what the point was, indeed as to what the movie was ABOUT. May not be of interest to those who see movies as an escape from thinking as opposed to a chance to exercise our minds. More patient, open-minded and intelligent viewers will be given the gift of a richly rewarding cinematic experience. A classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some previous comments have said that the knight attempts to cheat Death, but is ultimately cheated himself. Maybe I'm wrong on this one, but from the church scene on I never got the impression that the knight intended to win. When Death takes his knight as they play shortly after meeting Jof and his family, Block replies "...as you were meant to." No one so far has commented on this line, but it seems to me to be talking about a bit more than one move in a chess game.Later on, when the knight attempts to reset the game, I think it was a last-ditch effort to get for time. Once he sees that he's accomplished his goal regardless, though, the knight finally feels ready for closure. He still pines for answers, but the fact that he followed through on his deed allows him to rest a little easier and accept his fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal is the first Bergman movie I have seen. I chose to see it first because many consider it as Bergman's best film. It is one of the best movies I have seen. I consider it a visionary experience with a touching story that got me almost at the verge of tears. The Seventh Seal is about the search and silence of God-which is an unanswerable yet meaningful quest.The movie is set in medieval Sweden. Two men, a knight named Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), just returned to Sweden after ten years of fighting in the crusades. Sweden is currently being swept by a plague. After ten years of seeing carnage and warfare, the two men has lost faith in God. Jöns lost his completely but Block admits that he still cannot take God off his heart. While Block is on a beach, Death approached him as a man in a black robe. Death is about to take Block when he suddenly challenges death to a game of chess. If Block wins, Death will let him live. Block admits that he is not afraid to die, but he decided to delay his death because he wants to look for answers. Answers about God. In a confession booth at a church, Block says, `I want God to put out his hand, show his face, speak to me. I cry out to him in the dark but there is no one there.' Before he dies, he wants God to guarantee him that God exists.As the two men ride their horses to Block's castle, they pass through a village and meet a variety of people. They encounter village people who are carrying wooden crosses and whipping themselves for penance and to ask God to stop the plague; Block and Jöns believes that they are doing it for nothing. They also meet a married actor and actress named Joseph and Mary who has a young child. After the performance, Block speaks to them, and they ultimately offer Block food. Block enjoyed their conversation claiming that `I will remember this hour of peace. The dusk, the bowl of wild strawberries, the bowl of milk, Joseph with his lute.' When Block resumes his game with Death, he was smiling because he has just seen what makes life worth living. The characters in The Seventh Seal are vivid and have their own set of problems. Their problems are just the simple problems of everyday life except for Block who wants to know if there is a God. When they encounter a girl that was about to be burnt on the stake, Block sees that the girl is not afraid because of her strong faith, but at he moment before death, she was terrified because she saw emptiness. Bergman raises many questions about God and life in his movies. And the question in The Seventh Seal is why is God silent and not showing himself while death is something we are sure of and see. At the end, Bergman never answers anything, but he shows enough images to let us know how he truly feels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seem already to be a lot of good comments (although some may be overstated). The only thing I believe I can really add is an interesting note about the circumstances of the film: it's one of Bergman's earlier films, and Bergman later almost disowned it (along with "Wild Strawberries") because he believed that their subject matter was unimportant. He was "much happier," he said, after he left behind the agony of the quest for God and became a secular humanist.For me, this simply underlines the intense difficulty with which one truly confronts the search for God. It is, I suppose, to be expected that Bergman had to leave his search behind, since it caused him so much pain-- a pain which is beautifully crystallized in his film. But I hope his movie remains popular, if only because I believe the struggle is an important one in the human legacy, one which every man must confront.Few movies can even begin to approach the subject of religious agony without tending either toward the disgustingly sentimental and revisionist (a la "schindler's list") or the stupid "cool" atmosphere that seems to pervade movies these days. Ingmar Bergman does it in what is quite possibly the best way: taking a minimalist approach, he doesn't veer toward flashy camera techniques that dazzle, nor toward lingeringly emotional scenes. There is just enough of everything: just enough plot to tell us what is going on without confusing, just enough cutting to relieve us from longer shots without jarring the eye with too much motion, just enough dialogue to convey a singular tone that has both focus and depth. This film reaches an "arete" that is rare in cinema: its subject meets the medium perfectly, and the stark purity of the cinematography is met by the lonely nature of the ideas which it deals with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truely a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age where special effects capture the eyes and screenplays are weak it is easy to overlook this masterpiece. Before "Life is Beautiful" and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" where hailed as foreign masterpieces(and also terribly over-rated) there was "The Seventh Seal". This picture contains the greatest screenplay ever. The poetry and symbolizism that is hidden in this film amazes me. How people hail "The Matrix" as a movie that is able to do this confuses me(I hate The Matrix FYI)? The Seventh Seal proves that special effects are not needed nor will they ever will be to make a masterpiece. The image of death haunts me, with his pale white face and long black robe. This is picture filled with the horrors of life, the apocalypse, for the black death has come and few can accept that. Before you go out and cast your vote for modern films, it is suggested you see this, for it is truely the greatest foreign film ever made.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's mastepiece &amp; Sydow's ultimate acting performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No argument, no doubts, no reservations! This film is a genuine masterpiece of the highest quality.Not a particularly difficult story but Bergman adds to the common strand a morality &amp; immorality of God's existence along with the eternal contradictions of what the purpose of man's existence is upon this sacred Earth.After returning from the Crusades hundreds of years ago, Sydow (Antonius Bloc) and his squire return to a plaque ravaged Sweden where people are dying a horrid death and the sinners tour the country pleading to be exorcised of their sins.Bloc is confronted by the Grim Reaper (Bengt Ekerot) on (of all places )a beach. But before Death takes his soul Bloc offers him a game of chess for his life.The chess match continues throughout the film and as we do we see Bloc's tortured mind unravel as his rides between towns seeing the misery the plague (and its owner, Death) is causing. And he wonders why God is punishing these people so harshly.In addition we see other characters living their humdrum lives playing very close to the 10 Commandments, where individual steal, murder, lie &amp; betray. Very gradually these sad but doomed individuals all gather along with Bloc and end up in a great castle where their ultimate fate awaits them.You really have to see this movie at least twice to unravel the mind of both Bloc &amp; the director, Bergman, for although the story is relatively straightforward, its the intellectual philosophising &amp; existentuality that you really have to understand.Each character is nothing more than a symbol or parody for some human weakness or foible. Each character believes in God but sees him in a different way when it suits them and often don't realise until its too late that Death doesn't just reach out for the old, sick or the sinners of their world.But it is to Sydow's grand Knight that the real pain of human existence is focused upon. Having returned from the many battles of the Crusades, preaching the word of God &amp; righteousness to foreigners he returns to his homeland to find a country ravaged by a plague that knows no social condition: young, old, rich, poor, believer or sinner, they are all doomed.Sydow character is racked with so many feelings of guilt &amp; hatred for both God and Death. Yet he wonders why he should die so soon when he has done God's work and is still left with so many things to do.Bergman is the master when it comes to magnifying our human frailties; his characters are nothing special, just ordinary people and yet they, like us, hide so many sins, that eventually we will pay for our crimes.Bergman doesn't have to hurry the film along, although you sometimes feel nothing very much happens between scenes. But everything is timed &amp; framed for a reason that is not immediately obvious but only becomes clear later in the film.And of course filming in black &amp; white gives the story a very bleak feel, and could also be seen as an allegory of life/death &amp; good/bad. I was especially moved by one scene near the beginning where Death &amp; Bloc play their first moves with the sea in the background &amp; dark clouds surrounding both of them like a deathly shroud.To some THE SEVENTH SEAL will appear too pretentious to really appeal; and I suspect a lot of the symbolism &amp; reasoning will not be recognised. But its a film to be patient with, it deserves our respect because when we see these poor innocent characters waiting for their Calling, we are in fact looking at ourselves!!!*****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, now, what can we say about this movie. It is a cinematic experience, to say the least, with the total satisfaction from the wonderful actors, and with Bergman's immortal directing. Though, I can't believe why this movie is, by so many, slow and (even more) boring. From the start to finish I was on the edge of my seat, it was entertaining from the opening quotes and views to the final rendezvous with Death.The most magnificent about the movie is the fantastic mix with all the different stories. The unhappy Antonius, who is frequently followed by Death, but keeps him waiting with chess. Jöns, the brave knight and all his life-happiness and filosofy, the blacksmith with his cheating wife and the acting-family's life wich Antonius at the end find more worth than his own.When I turned off my video after experience this movie, it took a while to get used to life. I zipped around 'Ricky Lake' and 'Days of our lifes' and thought "what is this?".See DET SJUNDE INSEGLET, experience the Ingmar Bergman mastermind, and you just might get the same feeling. I can honestly say that if you get this movie as you should and carry around it in your mind, it will change your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly one of the great films - a miracle of compression, symbolism, and parody.The movie encapsulates the period of the Black Death in Scandinavia in an entertainment form common to that era - the symbolic Passion Play. The Knight (as Everyman), the Squire, the Fool, the Black One, and others are all represented with the main theme of contention - the dilemma of man's disillusionment/distance from God and the events which impel the desperate resolution of that disillusionment/distance before death.This theme is played out brilliantly through the various scenes and characterizations - the chess game between the knight and Death, the priest turned vagabond, the turncoat wife and her lover, the actor/seer and his hopeful young family. All are rendered impermanent and hopeless within the void in which Death resides. And, within that void lies the answer that all are seeking.The historical element is presented as realistically as any film that I've seen on this period, with only a few anachronisms. The group of actors performed in many of Bergman's films and brings his vision to life.See it in a theater if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swedish director Ingmar Bergman needs no introduction at all for a cinema fanatic.It is ignominious that today's young generation is hardly aware of his great works.He will be hailed as perhaps the only genuine cinema artist whose films changed the way films are watched. Most of his films have provoked heated discussions from cinema fans regardless of the fact whether they have liked them or not.If one observes Ingmar Bergman's career closely it would be revealed that almost all of his films were based on themes which were close to his heart.No artist in the history of mankind has efficiently tackled death,faith,religion,male-female relationship,memories,suffering etc as it was done by Ingmar Bergman.Det Sjunde inseglet is one of those eclectic films which give hope,joy and trust in human faith.The Seventh Seal has been called an existentialist classic.This is true to some extent but for Bergman it was simply an affair of reaffirming his faith in the influence of religion on ordinary mortals.His influence was so great that even death had been given a human face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With The Seventh Seal, Bergman is taking movie realism to whole new level, something he started with Wild Strawberries, which already was quite realistic movie if you ignore the cheesy ending, and some other bits.The movie does lack some elements which might be considered standard like no comic relief, but it is essential to leave out these elements for Bergman to achieve his vision as to what The Seventh Seal should be, a sexy, sleek, intense action movie that in should no way parallel Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon. Yes there is less action, but all the action in this movie is much more satisfying than in a ordinary movie, I don't recall seeing so realistic gunfights in any other movie. There is no real beginning or ending in this movie, the viewer is just dropped into middle of it, and it's just seamless realistic experience. No vaporous comedy.I'm not sure why there is so much hate in reviews for this movie? This movie takes you on a slow ride, a very subdued slow burn that never goes over the top. If you went expecting over the top, say like some people would think "BAD BOYS" you will fail to enjoy this film. This film makes Hollywood action films look like cartoons compared to this its dark and gritty realism - at some points I felt I was watching an uncensored episode of COPS gone bad-ass.Believe the hype, this movie deserves its high spot in the top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal is a very difficult film to review, it is a very powerful film that raises a lot of questions for the viewer to consider and it achieves that aim very well, but it doesn't really do much else. The Seventh Seal has a large cast of characters who all come together within the film's vague plot (a Knight returning home from the crusades, who plays a game of chess with Death along the way), it does feel as though some characterisation has been lost somewhere as a result of the little screen time given to each one, personally I would have liked to have got to known these characters a bit more, but it is not really necessary for the viewer to do so for the film to achieve it's aims. Which is basically for the viewer to examine himself and ask questions about what will happen when we die. With the main character of the Knight taking to asking most of the questions, as he is desperate to find out where he will go when he succumbs to Death's checkmate. As, ultimately, these questions are not answered in the film, it means that a lot of the impact The Seventh Seal has takes place off screen, in it's prompting of the viewer to ask this for themselves. Can it be that all that's waiting for us is nothing? One of philosophy's most asked questions, and to be honest, one that most human beings have asked themselves from a young age, so most of the dialogue on this subject can hardly be called especially profound. The dialogue is quite philosophical heavy, as you might expect, and does help provide a good amount of interest in the film, the cinematography and acting too, are very good, most notably Max Von Sydow's performance. Not one to watch to entertain your mates, The Seventh Seal is a well made philosophical piece that will give the viewer something to think about, ultimately they have thought about it before so it's nothing new, but more a cold reminder that Death is waiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Det sjunde inseglet" (or, as the English-speaking world knows it, "The Seventh Seal") is one of those movies that doesn't have any clear purpose; in a way, it's not supposed to. More than anything else, it looks at the questions that surround people in their lives, and shows that they don't necessarily have clear-cut answers. The ever-imposing Max Von Sydow plays Antonius Block, a Swedish knight returning home after having fought in the Crusades. He and his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) meet Death (Bengt Ekerot). The not-so-Grim Reaper is of course planning to take the men to the afterlife, but the knight makes a most unusual deal: he and Death will play chess, and he will get to stay alive as long as he wins.Whether or not Antonius wins is not the point. The movie is a philosophical look not only at how the Bubonic Plague was affecting Europe, but probably also at how certain things are always creeping up on us. The final scene affirms this, and the movie affirms Ingmar Bergman as a director unlike any other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unarguably one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first taste of the work of Ingmar Bergman came late last year, when I first saw The Virgin Spring. My initial reaction to that film was one of bewilderment; being new to Bergman, I just wasn't sure what to make of it. The second Bergman film I saw was Persona; again I just didn't fully grasp the film and in my naivety, belittled the staggering work of art I now hail it as by saying that it needed to make sense. I know understand Bergman's work a little better, and understand that The Virgin Spring was Bergman's least personal film, and one that he accepted as a director for hire. Persona on the other hand is often credited as the director's most complex and experimental film, open to interpretation and definitely not a film for all tastes. Now I have seen my third Bergman film, the classic of art-house cinema that is The Seventh Seal.The Seventh Seal is everything a great film should aspire to be, a joy to watch from start to finish and filled with a mixture if wonderful performances and haunting images. It was also nice to see a much more simplistic story after the mind bending Persona. Here Bergman's key concerns are not psychological mind games and disintegrating personalities, instead he looks at the themes that would in later years become synonymous with his cannon of work, religion, and death (or waiting for death, as illustrated in Cries &amp; Whispers as well as here). The film follows knight Antonious Block (Max Von Sydow) and his companion Jöns as they return from the crusades. Death has long since walked besides Block, and now the hooded figure believes it is his time to go, Block however has other ideas and challenges Death to a game of chess, if he wins, his life will be spared. This gives us the first iconic image of the film, possibly the first major iconic image of art-house film-making, as Block sits by the sea playing chess with the apparition of Death.As the film moves on, Block and his companion make their way to the nearest town, where a religious procession enter and warn the villagers of the plague. This is another key sequence in the film, and the way Bergman films the entrance is nothing short of genius. The cutting and camera angles (together with the naturally beautiful black and white film stock) evoke and convey the growing sense of dread that has been following our hero's from the outset. The key theme in this film seems to be not only religion, but also loss of faith. Antonious spends much of his time condemning the crusades for the pointless loss of millions, all in the name of god, and later it becomes more apparent that Block believes god to have abandoned him. This truly is a classic film, and a true work of cinematic art. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I genuinely feel sorry for people who can only describe this film as "boring." No, there are no explosions, car chases or sappy romantic scenes. `Lethal Weapon 3' this film is not. But that fact is only one of the many virtues for this film! I think that people really deny a part of their own humanity when they cannot look past the surface of things.I can't believe that any thoughtful and feeling human being who allows him or herself to recognize the passionate and profound themes in this film can help being somewhat moved by them. If you have ever pondered questions about life deeper than "What are we having for dinner tonight?" or `Should I wear white past Labor Day?' this film is for you. And the story is told with excellent imagery and symbolism that combines into an overwhelming experience for the senses and the intellect.Of course, some may be disturbed by the "answers" this film provides. I guess for me, I identify strongly with Bergman's thesis, that perhaps everything we utter about what lies beyond death is a mere projection; that, in the final analysis, we know nothing. But I also identify with the `silent protest' of the squire.One of the lines that sums up the film for me is:"I want knowledge. Not belief. Not surmise. But knowledge." -- Antonious Block</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Traveling back to his castle in Scandinavia Christian Knight Antonius Block, Max Von Sydow, has seen enough death and horror in the Crusade that he went on into the Holy Land, where he fought the last ten years. The Crusades took almost all the faith that he had in man as well as his belief in God out of him. Together with his squire, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Block found that his native land as well as the whole of Western Europe is being ravaged by the Black Plague that's destroying even more lives that the Crusades. Block begins to wonder if the plague is God's retribution to man for the evils that he committed over the centuries. Block and his squire have another person traveling with them through the hills and forests and along the coast of Sweden and he was with them throughout their entire journey back home from the hell-fires of the Middle-East Death, Bengt Ekerot. Sensing who he is when Block sees him at the seashore he knows that his time has come but talks him into playing him a game of chess to for stall his eventual demise. Even more to get from Death the knowledge about good and evil and the existence of a God before he ends up at the tip of the Grim Reaper's scythe. The chess game goes on and off throughout the movie "The Seventh Seal" and as long as Block stays in the game he stays alive as well as those who he picked up with him in his going back home to his castle where his lovely wife Karin, Inga Lanogre, is waiting for him. Beautifully and eerily photographed and directed by Igmar Bergman "The Seventh Seal" show us how we can be deceived into thinking that what were told is good can easily turn out to be evil, by those whom we trust and believe in. Like in the case of the many thousands of men like Block who believed enough to be willing to give up their lives for it. Later in the film we see Raval, Bertil Anderbern, stealing the gold and silver jewelry off the dead to enrich himself. Raval was the local religious leader who's fiery speeches to go to Jerusalem and drive the unbelievers out of that holy city and the entire holy land. Reduced to being a Godless grave-robber and unfeeling liar Raval ends up falling victim to the very horror that he profited from in stealing from the dead: the plague. As it begins to look that Death is slowly winning his game of chess with Block and the end is almost near for him he in desperation goes to talk to this young woman, Maud Hansson, who's about to be burned at the stake for being a witch by the local townspeople. Block trying to find out if it's true that she can see and even communicate with the Devil feeling that if the Devil exists God has to exist too. Since one can't exist without the other. Mercyfully giving her a potion that would ease her pain from the torch and fire thats about to engulf her all Block gets from the woman is a mindless and empty stare as she awaits the horror thats about to end her short and so mournful life. "The Seventh Seal" is considered my many to be Bergmans best film and since he made it back in 1956 he never came close to making another motion picture, with the many fine movies that he made over the years since then, as good as it was and still is even now. The movie not only makes you wonder if there's any truth that God as well as good and evil exists but also makes you think about yourself and that final journey into the dark and great unknown that we all eventually will have to travel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As has already been stated by numerous cineasts, the Seventh Seal is a marvelous film in many respects. However I find it quite amusing that so many american observers compare it to mainstream Hollywood movies, defining it as being "...not Lethal Weapon 3!", and generally referring to the Seventh Seal as an anomaly, almost underground. As a Swedish person, though admittedly co-bombarded by american/Hollywood "culture", I see the tradition in which the test-audience screened Hollywood type movies are the epitome as a special class of movies. Investment type flicks which serve the explicit purpose of making money. The Seventh Seal on the other hand represent what real, honest movie making is all about.

This movie has an existential quality to it and puts you at odds with knowing most of the people he meets will die, but whom? The movie shows the fears and ignorance of humanity confronted with the unknown and trying to blame it on anything and anyone including themselves. The movie serves your curiosity with it shot in black and white. The pictures taken of the sky look very ominous.

		<shortDescription>This does a lot right, but I was a bit disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like "Wild Strawberries", which was released in the same year, both films focus on someone coping with the end of their lifetimes. This movie has a really good concept for a plot, and despite being parodied several times, its plot still seems intriguing today. All it took for me to get interested in the film was by looking up what it was about. There's so much you can do with a plot like this so I was curious what Bergman would do with the film.After a knight named Antonius and his squire return home after fighting in the crusades, he meets Death on a beach who has come to take his life. However, he challenges him to a chess match to thwart him as long as possible since he wants to seek answers on life, death, and God and do one meaningful deed before he dies.The chess game that Antonius has with Death is used as a personification of death. Bergman uses it to show how the knight goes through great measures to avoid Death. At one point, Antonius tries to cheat his way out of death by knocking over the chess pieces, but even that doesn't work. However, Death eventually catches up with him in the end. When Death tries to cheat to help himself win, he prevails. Also, Death is a much better player than any of us, and in the end, he always wins. This is another reason why I think that its plot is very good. Bergman makes the most out of this creative plot.During Antonius's search to do a redemptive act, he comes across many people. Many of them tell him their outlooks on life and death. The conversations he has with them are definitely the high point of the film. Their responses are brilliant, interesting, and thought provoking. Each one of them continuously challenges your perceptions of the world around you. Almost every single line is unforgettable and carefully written throughout the film. Its dialogue gives you a lot to think about long after viewing it. On my first viewing, I just tried to get a basic understanding of what happened in the film. On my second viewing, however, I tried to pay more attention to the dialogue, and I liked the film a lot better as a result.A main aspect of this film is its haunting imagery at some points. The scene when a girl is about to be burned at the stake for supposedly consorting with the devil is one of the grim encounters that Antonius encounters in the film. It's a pretty haunting scene and it lingers with the viewer long after watching it. Another scene is the one where a huge crowd of flagellants interrupt a play of Jof and Mia, and try to convince the crowd that they are doomed. It's very direct in asking controversial and essential questions about the existence of God. Perhaps, the most haunting scene comes at the very end when the film shows a depiction of the Dance of Death. Fortunately, the film doesn't make it too straightforward, and the image at the end gives you a lot to think about long after viewing the film.Since the film's plot was heavily based on the chess game, I assumed that it was going to be a big part of the film. As I got more into the film, however, I realized that the chess game wasn't going to be in the film that much, and I was right. This may not be necessarily a bad thing for some people, but I was slowly starting to forget about the chess game as the film continued on, and by the time it was introduced for a 2nd time near the 60 minutes mark, I felt like it was being underutilized. It was a little disappointing, because Bergman could have done a lot with it if it was in the movie more. I understand that a lot of the movie should be focused on him trying to do a meaningful deed and the experiences he goes through during the time period. However, Bergman could've easily added roughly 15-20 minutes of the chess game throughout the film.The expedition Antonius went through in the film let us know about his questions on life, death, and God. However, I wish that the film informed us a bit more about himself as an individual and how he approaches life. That's not to say that I didn't care at all about him. In fact, his questions opened the film up to some great dialogue. However, that quest did not show us how he approached life on a daily basis. The only scenes which showed a bit of it were the way too brief scenes of him sharing strawberries and milk with Jof, Mia, and her baby. There should've been more scenes like that. Jöns, Antonius's squire, was a character who was more fully realized. I knew a lot more about him as an individual. As a result, I cared about his fate a lot more.In conclusion, this was a pretty good film. The chess game is a really great personification for death, the dialogue is thought-provoking, and it has some haunting imagery which sticks with you long after watching it. However, I was both underwhelmed and disappointed by this film as soon as it started focusing more on Jöns and the other characters he met rather then him. However, despite what I said, I am a bit interested is some of Bergman's other films, and I'll definitely be checking out more of his films in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few images in film surpass that of the knight Antonius Block playing chess with Death by the sea at the beginning of Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal'. Also fantastic are the scenes of him asking for knowledge of God in a confessional, and the danse macabre on the hillside at the end. This film established Bergman on the international film scene, and while it may not be perfect, it will always be one of my favorites.A knight (Max von Sydow) and his squire (Gunnar Björnstrand) have returned from the Crusades to find Sweden ravaged by the plague. Under the torpor and ignorance of religion, the people flagellate themselves and blame and burn a witch. Death is all around, even in the form of a mask used by a troupe of circus performers, which include an innocent young married couple (Nils Poppe and Bibi Andersson) and their small child. It's the Dark Ages but the things we find are timeless: cruelty, hypocrisy, lust, and yet also the simplicity of love and the quest for God, however ridiculous His absence may seem. We see the knight faithful to the end, trying to give his life meaning by saving others, and his squire cynical of it all. "I could have purged your worries about eternity," the squire says, "but now it's too late. But feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive!" Death is a certainty and he makes his presence felt, but where is God? Death himself has no answers to this, and wisely, neither does Bergman. Life simply goes on without us, and we must hold fast to sweet memories while they last. Magnificent.A couple of passages? This is the exchange at the confessional: Block: I want to confess as best I can?but my heart is void. The void is a mirror. I see my face?and feel loathing and horror. My indifference to men has shut me out. I live now in a world of ghosts?a prisoner in my dreams. Death: Yet you do not want to die. Block: Yes, I do. Death: What are you waiting for? Block: Knowledge. Death: You want a guarantee. Block: Call it what you will. Is it so hard to conceive God with one's senses? Why must He hide in a midst of vague promises?and invisible miracles? How are we to believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves? What will become of us who want to believe, but cannot? And what of those who neither will nor can believe? Why can I not kill God within me? Why does He go on living in a painful,humiliating way? I want to tear Him out of my heart?but He remains a mocking reality?which I cannot get rid of. Do you hear me? Death: I hear you. Block: I want knowledge. Not belief. Not surmise. But knowledge. I want God to put out His hand?show His face, speak to me. But He is silent. I cry to Him in the dark, but there seems to be no one there. Perhaps there is no one there. There life is a senseless terror. No man can live with Death and know that everything is nothing. Death: Most people think neither of Death nor nothingness. Block: Until they stand on the edge of life and see the Darkness. Death: Ah, that day. Block: I see. We must make an idol of our fear?and call it God.And this while eating strawberries with milk, the sweetest scene in the movie, with Block remembering his youth and pledging to remember this moment with his new friends: "We were newly-married. We played and laughed. I wrote songs to her eyes. We hunted, we danced, the house was full of life. ? To believe is to suffer. It is like loving someone in the dark?who never answers. How unreal that is in your company. It means nothing to me now. ? I shall remember this hour of peace?the strawberries, the bowl of milk?your faces in the dusk. Michael asleep, Joseph with his lute. I shall remember our words?and shall bear this memory between my hands?as carefully as a bowl of fresh milk."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Read how this was a classic, and I can attest to it. Very strong film. It's been targeted for a so-called pretension, which honestly is uncalled for. The acting is very good. There are enough characters and sub-plots that this film has lots of life and depth to it; and speaking of depth, the very synopsis of it serves as a beautiful metaphor, not at all pretentious but rather deep in a sober, simple kind of way. The philosophical questions sit just right within the plot and within the veins of the various scenes, never too verbose but yet really saying something, asking relevant questions. The whole idea of the film is excellent, and beautiful, and very well executed. This is humane, strong cinema, with something real and meaningful to convey: purpose. What everything in this life is all about. Purpose. Excellent piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seventh Seal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Seventh Seal" is a film that stares death in the face (literally and figuratively) asking many questions but receiving no answers. It's a film not only about death, but life, love, suffering, and faith and how they all relate, and it does it with grace.Antonius Block is a knight that begins a chess game with Death himself, searching for answers. He's lost his faith, and is beginning to think God and Heaven and Hell are only things created in order to give us hope that there is something after Death, anything. He cannot have a girlfriend or get married due to his knighthood and he only has himself and no happiness. The film reveals the fact that death is hovering above us at all times, and it could strike at any moment. As the tree sawing scene shows, even when we believe we're in the safest possible place, death could take us with no warning. It shows that there is happiness and beauty in life through the actor and actress that have a child and genuinely love life, but it also shows that this happiness is only a distraction from their inevitable fate. It shows us that love can be suffering, but at least it gives us purpose. It shows hopeless humans putting themselves through torture for faith to give themselves hope for their coming death. But when the moment finally comes where Antonius stares Death in the face and asks him if he will reveal his secrets, Death responds by saying "I have none". Death is final and death is all there is, and if that sounds depressing, just know that the very end affirms that there is still life for those who can truly find joy in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate example of a film that gives an insight into the mind of the filmmaker !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Seventh Seal' is probably the first film that made Ingmar Bergman a hugely renowned figure in the art house film circles of Europe and America. It is the film that introduced him to the world. Along with 'Seven Samurai', this is also probably the most renowned foreign language art house film in the west. Even people who don't follow art house cinema are somewhat loosely aware of it as the one where someone plays chess with 'Death'. It has been made fun of and parodied on numerous occasions mostly because of Bergman's overt treatment of his themes. But I consider Bergman's overtness to be an asset for the film. I will echo Roger Ebert's opinion in saying that 'The Seventh Seal' is an example of a film where the filmmaker is not shy to pour out all his fears and angst on screen. I think once someone watches 'The Seventh Seal', he/she comes in contact with Bergman's ideologies and thoughts.Bergman explores some of the most universal and profound questions of life and death. I found no problems in relating with the character of Antonious Block and putting myself in his shoes. We know that he had gone to fight in the crusades and must have witnessed the horrors of violence and war. After returning home he doesn't get any respite from the horrors as he has to witness the effects of the Black Plague. So the fact that he is losing faith in God and life is very believable. He knows that he is facing inevitable death. But he stalls his death by challenging the manifestation of death to a game of chess, just because he wants his questions answered. He wants to know whether heaven exists. He wants to believe in the existence of God, but for that he wants proof. There is a beautiful line where he states 'I want to have knowledge, not assumptions'. But over the course of the film he learns that his questions and doubts will remain unresolved. So, he realises that the best thing to do before his death is to do something that is meaningful.While Block is a very intense, layered and troubled character, Jons on the other hand lives his life in the moment. These questions of faith and death don't bother him at all. He has abandoned religion. He is hedonistic in nature and has a contempt for women.Then we come to the two most sweet and lovable characters in the entire film - Jof and Mia. They live their own simple lives with their baby son. They are actors and move around trying to make people laugh. It is their simple, jovial outlook to life that gives Block some solace and helps to make his mind up about what to do before death gets him. There is a beautiful scene in the film where Jof has a vision of Mia and his son in the form of Mother Mary and baby Jesus which thematically says a lot.Another very important element of the film is the way in which Bergman attacks the church. His contempt for the church and its functionaries comes to the forefront through the way he treats the character of Raval. Clearly Bergman thinks that the church didn't have an answer to the questions that troubled Block, but to somehow ensure that the masses didn't go away, they perpetuated the spread of silly superstitions that involved burning of 'witches' and processions of flagellants. Bergman wants to say that living your life like Block can be very tough. Block carries with him the burden of wanting to have faith in spite of everything. He wants God to come to him and show himself and give him knowledge. But in reality, all his calls to God will probably remain unanswered. So in a way, this film is pessimistic and bleak as Bergman contemplates the thought that maybe there is no God and maybe life has no meaning and maybe death converts you to a state of nothingness. But Bergman gives the viewer as well as Block optimism and a sense of hope through Jof and Mia. Death will take us someday, but the best we can do is to enjoy the little time that we spend on the earth to the fullest and love others and be loved and then 'dance' our way to death.The film as I have mentioned is brilliantly written and directed by Bergman. The cinematography and framing of the film is meticulous. There are multiple scenes that will stay with me always like the very first scene on the beach and the confession scene in the church and the scene of witch burning and the final shot of the film to name a few. The acting is brilliant from everyone. Max Von Sydow is astonishingly good. He was only 26 at the time, yet he exudes the world-weary and tired aura of a 50 year old. Bengt Ekerot also deserves a mention. Even with the daunting task of having to play none other than 'Death', he succeeds to blend comical sarcasm with fierce intimidation. The film would have been 10 in my books, if only Bergman had eliminated the characters of Plog and Lisa. I guess he was trying to infuse some comedy in an otherwise very serious film by using them, but their scenes I felt fell completely flat and didn't work at all.To end, I'll say that although I have a problem with two characters in the film, I still have no problems in calling it a masterpiece. This is an audacious and brave piece of filmmaking. No matter who you are or whatever you do, if you watch 'The Seventh Seal', you will find yourself asking the same questions that Block asks in the film and that's where Bergman's mastery lies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so the headline above makes it seem like I liked the film more than I did. I do think that it makes its themes mostly relevant and effective, and states them well. I think the final act is easily the strongest, but I also think much of it is sort of silly (even for that time) and it meanders way too much. The pace isn't too slow, but the plot summary of the film had me really excited for it, and maybe because my expectations were just too high was I disappointed. This isn't bad though, and it's still solid. I think the performances are fine and it does have some truly great scenes (most of them are the ones that are now iconic). Still recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a wonderful film. A knight's returns home from war. The most important aspect of his life seems to remain unanswered. He searched for truth .He hasn't found it yet and it's getting clear through the film it's not going to happen.The question of the existence of god and the relation of humans to him is one the most important issues in history. This film has deep roots from existentialism. Are we alone in the world or not? Is there any hope to feel the God through our life in any way? This film could happen in our era too it has the same questions yet we haven't found. Symbolically the knight tries to find out some things about beyond life and death from the death which playing by Bengt Ekerot. The death only carries out his duties. He kept his silence and only follows the light with loyalty.Ingmar Bergman let us free to judge about knight's concerns. The film gives us no clear answer. We are that entire knight too who seeking for the truth.It is one of the most interesting movies I ever saw. Ingmar Bergman has many great ideas to talk about. If someone likes to see a movie which could help him to think more about himself and the world around him, I suggest this film.Also the power of humanity is evident in this film. At the end of the film we see that small family comprised of three who escaped the death and saw the others leaded by the death to the end of their destiny. They are plain and good people which don't have complicated ideas about life. They only want a simple life to live. It's clear they are somehow similar to the father, Christ and the holy Mother and this could be one of the reasons why they didn't go with dead. Life goes on ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death is an inevitable fate we will all succumb to. Learning to live life joyfully and seeking answers for the innumerable questions we have is what gives life its worth and essence. "When" our time ends is out of our hands but what we do with it is something we have control over. It is the dynamic idea of "freedom of life, yet constraints of time" that this movie explores. In this film, a knight and his squire return from a crusade. Once back, they begin questioning the purpose of life, the existence of deity and begin a long journey with Death at their footsteps. Life is rough. After visiting home after years of fighting for an unfounded cause, the knight feels desolate and detached from others and seeks for the light in life that he once had. The time at which we pass away will be when we least expect it. Throughout this movie, we see the knight playing Death in chess. He tries to gain time by cheating and evading death, but in the end, we will always lose the battle. This movie does a masterful job in demonstrating mortality and how our lifetime is to realize the significance of our placement here on Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: A Knight, Antonius Block, returns to his homeland Sweden with his squire (Jons), from a ten year long Crusade, only to find his country in the clutches of infamous plague--the Black Death (mid-1300s). On his journey home, he encounters the physical form of death itself (Bengt Ekerot) and engages him in an intriguing game of Chess to actually buy some time for some purpose of his.In this Swedish masterpiece the director, very artistically, collaborates tragic events of Europe caused by a widespread plague (bubonic plague-symptoms include a Swollen gland) with the "Book Of Revelation" primarily focusing on Apocalypse.The main characters have been chosen such that they represent various personalities and mental states of the sufferers. For example, the knight represents a delusional person who isn't sure if his Crusade had any point to it, his squire--a good man at heart--wonders where is God in this hour of need, the priest represents a power hungry man who instills fear in the society for his own benefit. The young actor couple and their child represent a God loving family who will survive the calamity.The whole country is suffering and there is confusion everywhere. People are punishing themselves to achieve absolution.Among all this hardship there still are people who are jolly and enjoying their lives to the hilt. Some of them are realizing their true selves. Even the Knight finds a purpose to his life and saves the young family from the clutches of Death. He eventually, with his wife and followers, dances with the Death.This 'dance' has become an iconic image of world cinema.A definite must watch.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's take on religion and death. The film follows the story of Antonius Block, a knight who is returning home after having gone through the crusades. The country is now dominated by the Black Death and he ends up facing the grim reaper himself during his trip. The scenes between both of these characters are often intriguing, chilling and even comical. Block constantly questions the meaning of life and tries to accept his fatal destiny. The scenes with the witch character were very moving and illustrated how merciless and radical people could be at that period. I have one gripe with the film which is basically the acting. While most of the cast provides great performances (Especially Max von Sydow and Bengt Ekerot), I found some of the secondary characters like Jof, Mia and Blacksmith Plog annoying at times. Bergman uses a lot of theatricality here and I felt that there were scenes involving these folks, which were too repetitive and a bit dull. However, the overall result is mesmerizing and a definite must-see for those who are fans of Bergman's work or everyone who just appreciates a quality introspective film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Existentialism and the Seventh Seal I was surprised to learn that I had actually seen this movie before, though I was drunk of the Raven's wine and its deeper vision escaped me. The Seventh Seal is the search for meaning in the absence of a present and firm God and aligns to Jean Paul Sartre's ideal of atheistic existentialism. How does the knight know Death is Death? Death appears as a man in black's cloak. He says he is Death, but offers no proof of his power. The Knight seems to intrinsically know the mask of Death. Does the Knight wish to see Death and thus calls Death to him? To the outsider, the meeting is unknowable, but to the Knight the meeting is with Death. This suggests and with accordance to Sartre that visions are defined by what they are decided to be. The acrobat sees a vision of a woman with child. He takes her and him to be the Virgin May and the Babe of God. I did not make this interpretation, and saw only the visual of the acrobat's vision. Is it possible to interpret our own visions impartially? If a man comes in black calling himself Death, should I operate under the principle he is Death or not Death. I can play the game under the pretense Death is Death, but I should always remain skeptical of Death being not Death. In this way, I can be part of reality and also I can be the third party viewer who provides a source of skepticism.Death- "Will you ever stop asking questions? But you get no answer." Death is neither God nor the Devil. The Knight recognizes Death is the emptiness left by the absence of God, yet he is compelled to probe emptiness. What does the Knight learn from his probing? He learns terror. He learns his meaning is found with his waiting wife. Sartre would be proud of the Knight, who pushes even through emptiness to find meaning in what was already there. He learns to treasure and become his memories, joy from strawberries and milk.Is this the fate of man, to believe in visions and signs of God founded in our own minds but sublimated unto the world? The Black Plague was caused by man's fear and elimination of cats that did not eat the rats of decay. God must be a cat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's best-known film is not all angst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Seventh Seal" is one of Ingmar Bergman's best-known films. It was released in 1957 and showcases the considerable talents of Max von Sydow as Antonius Block (the knight), Gunnar Bjornstrand as Jons (the squire), and Bengt Ekerot as death. I'm sure doctoral dissertations have been written about "The Seventh Seal," but I'll see it as a movie. The movie is set sometime in the Middle Ages. Block was convinced to go to the Holy Land and fight for the Crusades by a certain Raval, apparently a monk or cleric. After ten years of battles, they return home, and Block is utterly disillusioned. Jons apparently was never illusioned, so he has neither qualms nor questions. The film is motivated by Block's questions about the existence or not of God. Arriving home in the midst of the plague, Block sees more death even than in the Crusades, where he lost his faith. During their wanderings, Jons comes upon Raval robbing the dead and preparing to rape a woman. The reason for their going on the Crusades is, it seems, a sham.We follow knight and squire on their way back to Block's wife and home; as they travel they pick up various followers, including death. Block challenges death to a game of chess, which they play desultorily in the pauses of Block's travels. The knight's goals are to find the answer to his doubts whichever way it goes (God or no God) and to do some meaningful act before he dies. Block asks hard questions as he sees the panic caused by the plague, the burning of alleged witches, the mud and muck of the best life had to offer back then. Even death offers no answers. The scene where Block confesses to the monk is excellent and telling.* But Block finds no answers. He does, however, manage to sneak in a meaningful act, saving the lives of a couple and their child.If you haven't seen this since your college years, it's more interesting now. Block's questions are very astute, and Jons's answers are funny now that you're old enough to appreciate his sarcasm and cynicism. There's a lot of humor in "The Seventh Seal," but you have to have some history of life to appreciate it. Each character in the film represents some various philosophical and religious position: doubt, faith, atheism; so "The Seventh Seal" is in some respects an allegory like "The Pilgrim's Progress." Jons is a great foil for the knight. Witty, smart, and sarcastic, his scenes are equally meaningful. Instead of angst, the squire faces life with the assurance that there is no meaning. His songs are obscene and silly, just like his life. The squire is smart; maybe smarter than his knight. It was an act of genius for Bergman to make them equals in merit, so that their differences play off each other more meaningfully.In two scenes the religious overtones become most obvious. Block shares wild strawberries and milk with Jof and Mia** (parents of Michael), and the knight is clearly moved by the loving relationship of the couple and their baby. He speaks at length about what sharing the food means to him. I take this to be a discourse on what may be the true nature of the eucharist and whether the sacrament is restricted to the church and the priests. Block draws great comfort from the moment of sharing the milk, wild strawberries, and fellowship. The second scene is at the end when all the travelers have finally reached the knight's home, and his wife prepares them what is to be their last supper. Once death has appeared and announced the end of their lives, the last line of the scene is by one of the guests: "It is finished." The unanswered, and in this film unanswerable, question is whether life is as Block says a senseless horror.*In ancient times, before giving absolution the penitent was required to be shriven or perform his or her penance. Sometimes the penance was a pilgrimage, often a recitation of a number of prayers, but the penance was to be completed before the absolution was given. In extreme circumstances - if the penitent was dying or condemned, for example - the penitent was given short shrift, then absolution. In this scene, our knight was given no shrift, and there is no absolution.**I am confused about who Jof, Mia, and Michael are or represent. Jof is the familiar diminutive of Joseph, Mia is the diminutive of Maria, and Michael means "who resembles God." I would assume they represent Joseph, Mary, and the baby Jesus, but Jof has a vision of the virgin Mary and the Christchild (shown as the same age as Michael). And we later see Mia and Michael in exactly the same pose (Mary holding the child as it learns to walk). Jof also sees death, the only one to do so but for Block (at least till the end when death comes to claim the group). Jof says he sees the other reality, not the reality everyone else sees; I take it he means spiritual reality in addition to physical reality. They may represent only simple human goodness, embodied in a loving family. As presented, they have no deep questions, just love and kindness. Maybe they represent the real answer - don't ask.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death laughs last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a land ravaged by pestilence, superstition and death, Max von Sydow plays chess with a personification of the latter; this is what everyone knows about Ingmar Bergman's legendary film 'The Seventh Seal'. What comes as a surprise it that the movie's most iconic image comes in the very first scene; that the philosophical debates take the form of wisecracks; and that Max von Sydow's character is actually among the least interesting in the story. Indeed, with a measure of (deliberate) overplaying, a mediaeval setting and some surprisingly bawdy and direct humour, the film even resembles one of Shakespeare's comedies, albeit an unusually black one. The sub-plot about a group of actors making a play about death, a story within a story, seems especially Shakespearian. I'm not sure this is really a great film, but it manages to be consistently bold and surprisingly entertaining. Even though death, played with superb understatement by Bengt Ekerot, always gets the last laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Becomes Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In middle of the 14th century, knightly Max von Sydow (as Antonius Block) and squire Gunnar Björnstrand (as Jöns), "after long years as Crusaders in the Holy Land, have at last returned to their native Sweden, a land ravaged by the Black Plague." Mr. von Sydow is immediately confronted by creepy, black-cloaked Bengt Ekerot (as the Personification of Death), who has appeared to claim von Sydow's soul. Instead of going quietly into the final night, von Sydow challenges Mr. Ekerot to a game of chess. "Death" is in a playful mood, and accepts the contest; if von Sydow wins, he and his friends may avoid the Plague.Director Ingmar Bergman had an amazing 1957 (in Sweden, anyway), book-ended with "Det sjunde inseglet" ("The Seventh Seal") and "Smultronstället" ("Wild Strawberries"). The latter film definitely has the edge, story-wise. Still, the former is full of beautifully morbid images, killer camera-work from Bergman and Gunnar Fischer, accompanying a thought-provoking script. Von Sydow and the cast, including Bibi Andersson (as Mia) and Nils Poppe (as Jof) are great. Ms. Andersson's preparation of some "wild strawberries" seems to portend the next film. Death is not too subtle. Your move.******** Det sjunde inseglet (2/16/57) Ingmar Bergman ~ Max von Sydow, Bengt Ekerot, Bibi Andersson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that lasts for all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "The Seventh Seal" in its original Swedish without the benefit of subtitles. Although I do not understand the language, I found Bergman's tale of religious skepticism, with undoubted echoes of medieval and Renaissance dramas, morality plays and famous western classics such as "Dr. Faustus" absolutely riveting. Bergman was the master of the mise-en-scene; his ability to create cinematic pictures using the minimum of cinematic resources was unrivaled. Unlike today's directors of period dramas, he realized that to recreate an historical period was not simply done by spending thousands of dollars on sets and costumes, but rather depended on the selection of individual props and the telling focus on individual images (for example, the horse standing in the background in several scenes, or the moment involving the flagellants singing the "Dies Irae"). In terms of cost, the film is low-budget, strongly reminiscent of the B Pictures produced in Britain and the US during the middle part of the twentieth century. In terms of style, however, the film is the work of a genius. I confidently predict it will stand the test of time for another half century to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religion Vs Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Seventh Seal' is a complex movie. After having fought for 10 years a 14th century crusader (Max Von Sydow) starts questioning the existence of God itself and decides to go back home. On his way back he meets death. Von Sydow challenges death to play chess with him. If he wins he lives else death can claim his life. While this game is going on Sydow meets a singer, his wife and his son. Singer has power to see supernatural things which even his wife doesn't believe in. Sydow sees the impact of religion on normal people and misery of a common man. By the end of the movie he is shown losing to death. I don't want to give away the end of the film although it's so weird that you might see it in a different light altogether. It's a very responsible cinema. Despite the fact that movie asks an orthodox question "IS there God?" It comes out without answering the question but in a convincing way. The whole of actor's track is in layers. My interpretation of the actor being able to see supernatural is that artists have a better sense of life and so they have an ability to interpret regular incident in a more comprehensive way. I am sure there are other interpretations too. Stage performance followed by a Christian procession is a powerful sequence. Bergman has tapped the insignificance of art in Europe in the 14th century in this track. Movie becomes slow after a point but reaches at a well deserved climax. For me actor's track is the highlight of the film. Crusader, death and religion have been talked about in several movies but its one rare movie which talks about importance (rather lack of) of art during the dark age of Pope Mafia. It is a must watch for a person who wants to understand the negative impact of religion on the 'herd' psychology of people. This movie made me wonder what would have happened if Renaissance didn't happen. This is one of those movies where 5 persons come out with 5 different statements about the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. Ingmar Bergman profits immensely from medieval iconography, traditions, events and beliefs to draft a wonderful example of existential cinema. It's a pity that Death as a character is so underused nowadays; there's so much strength in the image of the Grim Reaper talking with its victims, trying to decipher the meaning of all of this.The Black Plague provides an excellent scenario for the exposition of the very contemporary questions about the existence of God, the meaning of life, the fear of death. This seemingly apocalyptic event must have really seemed like the End of times, and the horrific images of infected people whipping themselves, of supposedly witches being burnt as scapegoats, do an amazing job in telling without the meaninglessness of life, the darkness that wraps us all once we know we'll eventually die. Unless we have faith, of course. But, as Antonius Block says: "Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call."This movie is full of memorable quotes. It's one of those movies where the dialogues have no interest in seeming realistic, but rather, like in a theatre play, aim to show the language skills of the scriptwriter. I shall keep many of this movie's lines with myself, "I shall try to remember them. I shall carry this memory carefully in my hands as if it were a bowl brimful of fresh milk. It will be a sign to me, and a great sufficiency."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First films were art, then sound was added. Now they are art again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "The Seventh Seal", directed by the fantastic Ingmar Burgmann, is a film that is a long and moody rumination on religion and what occurs, if anything, when one no longer adheres to one's religion. Set in medieval Sweden the main protagonist is Antonius Block, a knight returning from the crusades, an ostensibly religiously pursuit. But this is the return trip and fighting shall not be found. Consider the opening scene: a close up of Block with his eyes closed, seemingly asleep at the coast. This is followed by the camera panning right to his squire Jon who is equally prone but making faint stirrings. Form here the camera is pointed towards their horses, albeit, briefly, only to return to Block who now strides to the ocean. It is this blending of reality and the fantastic that occurs repeatedly throughout the film. Consider the following dialog between Block and Death himself?gendered no less: Antonius Block: "Who are you?" Death: "I am Death." Antonius Block: "Have you come for me?" Death: "I have long walked by your side." Antonius Block: "So I have noticed." Death: "Are you ready?" Antonius Block: "My body is ready, but I am not. " Never had so much been said with such succinctness. But here in lies the problem with the film: so little is left out that the audience can become lost or disinterested as this is an art film and not subject to the usual film trope of problem and conflict resolution as is often found. This combined with music whose function is to invoke tension and foreboding in the extreme. All of this for the audience means one thing: work. This is a film requiring effort to view, understand and ultimately fully appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I watched The Seventh Seal, I think that Ingmar Bergman isn't my favorite director.I said that I never like movies about religion, include Christianity and Islam like The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), Ben-Hur (1959), Fanny and Alexander (1982) (another movie of Bergman) and A Separation (2010) because I'm Buddhism.I like the song that described the emotion, the feeling of characters. But I can't understand the ending of the movie: +The girl's feeling and her face. +The appearance of the Death. +The scare of Antonius, the Danse Marabe. +The happiness of Joseph and his family when they saw the Danse Marabe.So, who can explain me the ending of the movie and why almost people love this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>allegoric masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterful and timeless pondering on mortality and faith produced in the late 50's, Det sjunde inseglet (The Seventh Seal) is undoubtedly one of the most introspective films, with deeply self analyzing characters all coming to terms with the sudden realization of their own death. Block, a knight returned from the crusades, is faced with the imminent threat of death and struggles to find answers to his questions, all deeply connected with faith. His curiosity leads to a game of chess with Death itself. With stunning contrasting visual the allegory comes to life in a very theatrical manner with death itself personified. The eternal and frustrating try of self understanding is at the core of the film communicated by deeply dramatic dialog, aided by stunning medieval iconography and symbolism such as the famous danse macabre. There's also a heavy contrast between characters like Block and Jof. Jof represents the simple minded, uncomplicated, serene, with a certain ease in living and loving. While the other characters are absolutely consumed with the though of death, Jof and Mia remain care free for the most part. This dichotomy presented in so many other characters gives the film a theatrical and allegoric feeling but still accessible meaning. The imagery is remarkable with some of the most recognizable shots in film history, from the beginning to the ending frames.Heavy contrasts both in character, philosophy and cinematography make the film an unquestionable 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Master piece of classical cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its time, Ingmar Bergman's iconic "The Seventh Seal" was revolutionary for its blatancy in showing the absence of God but the presence of Death. Much of what comprises this film; is not what those who know of it would attribute to it, visually speaking. Most people can only think about the visual of a knight on a beach, just back from the Crusades, the ocean suddenly silenced when a dark figure reveals himself on the horizon. It is Death, cloaked all in black, his white washed face standing out against the backdrop of pure nature. They play a game of chess for the knight's life, and so the film begins. Past that most people don't know much about this film. For one thing, there is very little chess featured in this film. For another, the knight has a comrade who he travels with. They go through the countryside, where the Plague has laid siege to all peoples. Everyone has become mad and frightened at the prospect of death, and belies religion's influence for some help in the matter of their mortality. A large amount of people believe in the religious fervor that is sweeping the countryside, and lend themselves to self-abuse, crucifixions, and murder. Others try to steal from the dead and help themselves through the devastation of the illness. Everyone seems to be trying to find answers to why there is war, poverty, and illness when God is supposed to protect them from their woes. A girl is captured and confesses to consorting with the Devil, which she says brought about the plague. She is only an innocent, content in turning from her God because of his absence, but not really a conspirer with evil. The film encourages exploration and takes a step back from theology by showing the very evils it inflicted in the past. Still, there is a call for people to also keep their faith in the face of Death, even while he's playing chess across from you. There's also a young couple who are very friendly and giving, and their fates are sealed thanks to their faith and love for one another. Bergman may not have known the infinitesimal questions that come from exploring your own doubt and frustrations with life. Though Bergman continually questioned himself in his later films, there is never an answer, only the freedom to question at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Icon of Cinema History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are moments in the Seventh Seal that are as good as anything else in cinema history. Images so striking and memorable that they linger with you always. Moments of dialogue that fit absolutely perfectly that hit you with a sudden power. This film is one of the most poignant reflections on life, death, and Religion. The mood of the film reflects that, moving very swiftly from joy to dark fear.I will say that some of the scenes come across as slightly ridiculous and overblown, and the costumes too haven't aged quite as well as other films, however these are minor criticisms not difficult to overlook. I don't feel the performances are consistent across the board, with some doing much better than others. Despite these criticisms, where it's at it's best, it's truly astounding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the middle of the 14th Century. Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) is a knight returning to Sweden from the crusade with his squire. The land is ravaged by the black plague. Death approaches him on the beach to take him but he challenges Death to a game of chess. Block can win back his life . He continues on his journey back home playing the game. He is disillusioned and encounters various people.I really love the idea of Death as a character. Max von Sydow has superior presence that elevates his character. The strict Christianity and the intense stuff are very compelling. I'm not as interested in the other characters and I wish the movie stays with Block. It's a bit uneven and slow at times. Nevertheless, it has some fascinating aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talking specifically about this title we should mention first the serious part, which I see in the deep commitment to God's Word. It is not by chance that the time in which the action takes place is the Middle Ages - as if the only intelligible world of man then was then religious one. And I must mention the burdens finale in which death refers all.Indeed, the theme of death is also central and serious, but as in life - to her we give our last thoughts. The action starts on the beach (a symbol of transition to infinity or origin of life on earth), where the main character causes death, that came for him, at chess. The idea is to win some time to buy someone else's life.Death is presented as a mystery, as the deadline which is pressing and tormenting our conscience. It is difficult to find higher instance before which the protagonist to kneel, to feel guilt. The only time he decided yet to do so, it appeared that confession was before death. So it turns out that actually the manifest was in front of himself, but in his last hour (death).Here eminence is given into the hands of intelligent people and artists, then the religious and finally to the ordinary people. The plague rages in the Middle Ages putting to test the faith of believers and asking questions about the meaning of human existence. However, there are many rays of light, saved young lives, there are people who happily lived their lives. Such people exist today and there will always be.A playful Bergman film which is for true connoisseurs of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A philosophical clear movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seventh Seal doesn't have the strongest cinematography. It was made in black and white in the time when there was color film available. I know it was probably done on purpose but while it may help the message it does not help the visuals. The shots are not grabbing, not on their own.Also, the sound effects are not synced well. Quality of the recording is average. The music consists more of effects than of actual melody, which again maybe works for the message but definitely not for the aesthetics.What this movie has going for it are interesting themes, dialogue and good actors to speak it.The film is raw and direct. Has a feel of movies like Conan the Brabarian (1982), but with realism and intelligence replacing the action. It is about life, death, love, sex and cruelty, all set against the medieval time period. The dialogue consists chiefly out of the discussion of those subjects and has a poetic colour to it but not overly so. However, you must be prepared for a theatrical feel to the whole thing. Indeed many actors in this film are heavy theater performers.What is really good about Seventh Seal is that it is one of the, unfortunately, rare occasions when art is not pretentious or arrogant. You do not have to wonder hard about the spooky imagery. It does not try to patronize you with its poetry. It is perhaps cliché to even mention the scene that is most remembered about this film, that of the protagonist playing chess with death, but it is a good example. What is a more straight forward metaphor than that? This whole film is that way - straightforward.The downside of the story is that it does not have a lot happening in it. The storyline is mostly about the characters traveling through the countryside and meeting other people. There isn't one centralized structure to the story. But this does not stop the movie from being interesting.Max von Sydow is the main protagonist. To start with, this guy has an interesting face. He looks like a medieval knight, in fact almost like a caricature of one, with his underbite and long crudely carved face and short haircut. And he is a good actor on top that.Bibi Andersson who plays one of the side characters is possibly the prettiest woman I have seen in a very long time. She is conventionally pretty, but that is OK. And the film puts her in such poses and in such dresses and her blond hair shines in such light?.in short, I experienced a brief crush on an 80 year old actress.But Gunnar Björnstrand, whose name I had to copy from IMDb for fear of getting an aneurysm trying to type it, is the true protagonist as he gets the most lines and gives them his best. Max von Sydow is more of an observer, while Gunnar is the workhorse.Seventh Seal manages to be funny and grim, smart and blunt. It is totally worth the watch, especially if you are afraid of watching it because you got the impression of it being an overly artsy film. It isn't.</fullReview>

Acting is very solid, much better that in other movies from 50's 60's period. It has such a great theme, images, ideas that you truly won't shake it easily after you will witness "Det sjunde inseglet". One particular scene at the end (no spoilers) walking through the field when we see them in the distance is one of the most haunting scenes i have ever saw.Overall, a very solid 9/10 for "Det sjunde inseglet" - this one of those movies, where ideas are in front of everything else - this is why it's never gets old. The craftsmanship of this movie is superb, there are images that you won't see in current cinema, and they are really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Disillusion Confronts Medieval Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's world acclaimed 'masterpiece' as a "self written and self directed allegorical film" (Bosley Crowther, New York Times) is among the most discussed movies that provokes controversies. Although more than half a century has passed since its premiere, we can bravely quote Peter Bradshaw (The Guardian) that it is still "an untarnished gold standard of artistic and moral seriousness." THE SEVENTH SEAL turns out to speak to the minds of modern viewers even more powerfully than it did in the late 1950s.MEDIEVAL? Set in the Middle Ages, it seems that the film has much to do with the spirit of the period. Yet...this "piercing and powerful contemplation of the passage of man" (Crowther), "Bergman's spiritual quest" (Roger Ebert), "a new dramatic idiom of its own" (Bradshaw), "Bergman's medieval drama of the soul" (Steven D Greydanus), "magnificent and compelling, brutal and beautiful examination of mankind's strengths and weaknesses" (Carter B Horsley) is not at all a movie about the Middle Ages but, what remains 'medieval' are two supreme concepts the film is built upon: image and contrast. Let me develop these two aspects before I move to performances because most of its power and charm is, indeed, hidden therein.Three concepts prevail in the image of the film: people, nature and death. Actually, all of them are embodied in the characters and stand for their feelings, emotions and varieties. However, all of them are made vibrant by unpredictable, surprising depiction. People carry a wide range of psychological sophistication; nature evokes symbols, manifests the interlocked circle, provokes impressions of different kinds; death is, perhaps, the weirdest incarnate. It is not the Christian 'Mors Porta Vitae Aeternae' (Death as a Gate to Eternal Life) nor the hero of medieval danse macabre but "an enigmatic emissary of the unknown" (Greydanus), a gloomy character of certain demonic features, the only real representative of the supernatural world that is, anyway, never made accessible to humanity. Nevertheless, Death in SEVENTH SEAL is the only character personified that leads the movie to the "uncompromising subject" that defines in "Bergman's spiritual quest" (Roger Ebert). But what would it all be without certain contradictions.Contrast, a basis of medieval thought and reality, seems to be predominantly present in many aspects from the protagonist through the modern vs. medieval (sometimes on the cost of historical accurateness) to the very autobiographical traces of the director, Ingmar Bergman himself. Foremost, however, this contrast is inside of man, outside of man and among men.CHARACTERS: Bosley Crowther basically called the movie "provocative" and it occurs to reveal itself most in the protagonist, Antonius Block (played marvelously by Max Von Sydow), an excellent, almost model embodiment of a disillusioned, modern character set in the Middle Ages who embodies the contrast inside of man. He asks questions that could practically never be asked, even thought of in a crusader's mind simply because his vision of the world, of faith, of the afterlife was deeply affected by creed. His character addresses the very silence of God developed in the Greydanus' essay; he is on his way to catharsis but also on the way to the state of absolute nothingness that Bergman himself believed in at a later phase of his career. He is a man of seeming decadence searching for meaning. Here lies his curiosity. He is a man losing his religion because he tries to grasp the supernatural with pure intellect. Here lies his vanity. He is a man locked within the four walls of his 'ghosts and dreams' Here lies his selfishness. Reminds me of Marcello in Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA who cannot fully understand the genuine and cannot communicate with the world of innocence and simplicity (note the aspect of an Umbrian girl in Fellini's movie). And where is this world of innocence in Block's life?BERGMAN'S 'HOLY FAMILY'? Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) with their baby son Mikael have inspired a variety of interpretation from many film scholars. Some found the allegories to daring religious manifestations. The meal they are having together as the 'eucharist of natural products' or the family as the Holy Family of Nazareth. I think that the point is elsewhere. Jof and Mia manifest simplicity, common life, austere joys, pure humanity, heart over intellect. That embodies the contrast among men and, along with other characters like a troubadour Skat (Erik Strandmark), contrast outside of man Antonius Block confronts. THE SEVENTH SEAL with its impressive symbols, outstanding imagery and greatly versatile characters leaves many questions unanswered, many dreams unfulfilled, yet many hopes disillusioned in its doom. Nevertheless...it is an important movie significant in its appeal and rarely understood. Believers will find it, perhaps, too daring; atheists will find it thought provoking; cinema freaks will love its atmosphere and Bergman fans consider it the essence of the director's world. With the unforgettable finale open for interpretations, THE SEVENTH SEAL provokes modern disillusion and its pessimistic silence confront the medieval reality and its mysterious dance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dies Irae</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided yesterday to re-watch this masterpiece of Ingmar Bergman's because when I was in this group recalled the movie we just watched it immensely, and I was not wrong.The story follows the knight Antonius Block at which death occurs but he begged to give him more time because he has to know some of the questions, she religious themes about God and the arrangements with her to play chess and that it does not affect all death while in the game. The story takes place in medieval times, and he has shown a visual characterization of the characters on the level and what most adorns this movie are philosophical, religious and ideological issues. Although the ideology and thoughts are not typical for this time it does not bother the viewer because they are of exceptional quality and encourage us to thinking. Some religious issues, particularly relating to the God, are still current today, and they are probably all of us at least once asked some of them. The film has a great selection of music led the Dies Irae (Day of Wrath), whose verses possess tremendous strength and also makes you think.Bergman was the inspiration for the film found in a medieval church saw the portrait in which a man plays chess with death. Also, Bergman said that he is this movie helped to overcome their own fear of death which, I believe, most of us possess. It is almost unbelievable that Bergman and 1957th recorded and Wild Strewberries along Seventh Seal who possess enough common ground and are thematically very similar and connected them as follows: The Seventh Seal Mia offered Block and his squire with wild strawberries while in Trivium Isak Borg brief stop in my room staring at the chess board.Also, one of the then scourge of the plague threatening the population and what is the color. Well illustrated and then show clergy that is, from superstition or fear pf enforce control the population that they blindly believed. It consisted of burning witches and various individuals who were punished. Execute them so for their crimes. This is one of the few films that can not be found, and that just wants any mistakes and I believe it is perfectly artistic and cinematic achievement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one it's certainly going to my list of favorites. The Seventh Seal manages to mirror a moment of society we're desperation leads people to act in extremes for fear of death. In a parallel way we see a group of people that share the same world, exposed to the same risks but instead of giving themselves to death even before being caught, they continue to live their life and worship it. The main character specially prefers to understand it instead of letting himself be scared by it. The entire story, the characters and the scenario make this movie brilliant and a gift for those who love cinema. The fact that it's in black and white gives it a certain mystery that nowadays movies sometimes lose. This movie is a perfect example that aren't big scenes, big visual effects or famous actors that make a good movie. I most certainly advise it but for those who aren't accustomed to see this kind of movie, keep your mind opened to different ways of presenting a story and ending it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak beauty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. "The Seventh Seal" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm.Ingmar Begman seems to be very fascinated with God and faith. This is a film that shows you the burden faith can bring. I believe that Bergman directed this film by channeling his own inner struggles into his art, like many great artists have done and still do. The main character of the film is on the verge of loosing his faith in God, he wants to believe, but he does not see any proof backing God's existence. This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but "The Seventh Seal" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it)To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand "The Seventh Seal" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it "The Seventh Seal" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who "hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles." The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choices?as is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a deep and dynamic contemplation on death, god, and purpose. The story follows Jons and Jof as they return home from warring through the crusades after 10 years away. On their return Johns encounters Death, who he challenges to a game of chess, wagering his life for the win. Throughout the story characters contemplate what is the meaning of life in all of the suffering that is going on around them. Jons, as does the character Socrates, wonders what is the true meaning of his existence. He questions the purpose of the war he has fought. He questions why the God he has fought for will not speak to him and show him meaning. This movie was a truly memorable experience and anyone with any interest in philosophy should check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbolism-filled Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endlessly imitated and parodied, writer/director Ingmar Bergman's landmark art movie The Seventh Seal retains its ability to hold an audience spellbound.The film features Gunnar Björnstrand,Bengt Ekerot,Nils Poppe,Max von Sydow,Bibi Andersson,Inga Landgré and ?ke Fridell. Set during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death, who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play Wood Painting. Here the motif of silence refers to the "silence of God" which is a major theme of the film.A knight named Antonius Block is wearily heading home after ten years' worth of combat. Disillusioned by unending war, plague, and misery Block has concluded that God does not exist. As he trudges across the wilderness, Block is visited by Death, garbed in the traditional black robe. Unwilling to give up the ghost, Block challenges Death to a game of chess. If he wins, he lives and if not, he'll allow Death to claim him. As they play, the knight and the Grim Reaper get into a spirited discussion over whether or not God exists. To recount all that happens next would diminish the impact of the film itself; we can observe that The movie ends with one of the most indelible of all of Bergman's cinematic images: the near-silhouette "Dance of Death." This is an uncompromising film, regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero.Essentially intellectual, yet emotionally stimulating, too, it is as tough and rewarding a screen challenge as the viewer will face when watching it as it is consist mainly of 90 minutes of iconic imagery, some deep questions and a surprising amount of humor.But nevertheless,this is Art with a capital A, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining at the same time, which only makes its artistry even greater.A symbolism-filled classic film indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be rather complicated although still an interesting film. It doesn't seem to make much sense, even though it kept me entertained from beginning to end. A complex film with a complex philosophical dialogue.It's set on medieval Sweden and the protagonist is a crusader that is returning to his homeland to find it infected by plague. It doesn't seem to have a well defined plot, besides a protagonist which plays chess with Death himself during the course of the film and in the end finally looses the match and is sent to the next world.The characters aren't complex, they are not emotionally developed, but that's not the point of the movie. It's not a movie about a plot and characters. Though that detracts from my film experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man's fear of death and his struggle with the existence of God. Subjects for your consideration in Ingmar Bergman's art house cinematic milestone, The Seventh Seal. Did i think it was any good though? Well, not at first. I almost feel guilty admitting it, but in some cases, and in order to form a well rounded opinion, a film needs time to be digested and this symbolism heavy experience is a perfect case in point. A knight (Max Von Sydow) returning from the crusades is visited by Death (Bengt Ekerot). As a last request, the knight challenges Death to play him at a game of chess, the deal being if the knight wins he gets to keep his life. Death accepts and the film begins. In many ways it's a fascinating study on the evolution of film. There's the iconic visual imagery that's been referenced by artists such as Woody Allen, and in popular culture like Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey. It's an unsettling film that aims to get under your skin by questioning the fragility of life and mysteries beyond it. The knight desperately questions the existence of God, "How can we believe in the faithful when we lack faith? What will happen to us who want to believe, but can not? " while Jof, a local villager and family man is accepting in a child-like way of his visions of angels. At no point did i feel as though the film was stating any right's or wrongs, simply asking questions to which we have no logical answer and how within that, there exists a sense of creeping loss. For any serious film buff, it's essential viewing. It might not be to everyone's taste, it's grim with an uneasy sense of foreboding and doom hanging over it, but there's no denying it's striking, symbolic imagery and it's importance in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Salutations from the dawn! Words aren't enough to describe how powerful is the experience of testifying "Det Sjunde Inseglet" ("The Seventh Seal") but I'll do my best. Ingmar Bergman's most celebrated work, admired and indirectly copied by many (the figure of Death created here was imitated in countless productions), remains as an essential work, one of a kind. It's something that will never lose its importance, it'll always be relevant no matter the decade, the century or whatever because it works themes that are the main doubt of the human race since its existence, the issue that few are open to discuss all knowing that is going to happen one day: death. Even though it's not everyone who can admire films like these but certainly no film lover out there can't miss such precious treasure. The Apocalypse is coming or so it seems to be. In a medieval period the plague is devastating an entire population, that part of the world is crumbling to pieces and there's no much love and compassion among people. It's there in this world that also lives the knight Antonious Block (Max von Sydow, brilliant) and his loyal and sarcastic squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), both returning from some hard battles in the Crusades. But when Death (Bengt Ekerot, fantastic and very memorable) appears to take Antonious to the other world, the knight decides to challenge Death into a Chess match, trying to bargain his staying on Earth. If Block wins he'll live longer; otherwise he'll die, the most frightening thing that can ever happen to a living being, his end. Between this game, there's plenty of moments with the knight exposing his doubts and fears, his confusion in trust between God or Devil, to whom appeal in order to stay alive, putting his faith in a complete doubt but still praying, wishing, wanting answers. "I cry to Him in the dark but there seems to be no one there" painfully cries this noble knight, trying to believe in something, just as much as when he searches for a so-called witch responsible for bringing the Black Plague to the city. The man is pure agony and he desperately needs to know his destiny (just like we all do since the pre-historic man). Posing infinite questions and providing very few answers, Bergman makes of the first apocalyptic film ever made a remarkable study that resonates like a Shakespeare work whose main purpose is to better reveal our human condition, our anxieties, our fears, our everlasting wishes for a purpose, and our doubts between this and that, all of this marked with poetry, passion and a complete artistic view of things. It's an relevant and poignant work dealing with real issues but perfectly adding supernatural elements to the story. It is an melancholic, dark, grim, somewhat depressive film that doesn't go easy on the viewer. The harder the better, more views you'll wanna do it (and you'll love doing so). The author talks about faith and God without evoking religion or certain beliefs and fanaticism (even though the main characters fought in the Crusades, so there's some Catholic perception here but that's it), and we can't blame this quoting Bergman was an atheist. And if so, he was perhaps the most believer between the atheists (check his remark about God in the last lines of "Through a Glass Darkly", the finest description of what God's love is, so far from what priests and others tend to tell people about). In short, "The Seventh Seal" works controversial themes without being controversial, without causing hysteria or angered reactions by audiences. About the film as a work of art: splendid from minute one, with that famous opening with Death appearing to Antonious on the shore, where he receives the warning that he must die, evolving to the chess game. The beautiful yet oppressive cinematography of Gunnar Fischer, the way he uses darkness, lighting and effects are a must-see. Also the formidable and very expressive casting, all outstanding. Special credit must be given to Bengt Ekerot and his terrifying (at times very humorous) appearance as the scariest of all presences among the living, very tricky, with soft voice but wrapped in darkness and mystery. The screenplay is fantastic, very enigmatic and very thoughtful, drenched in poetry, lyricism, fantasy. And we all smile at the ending with this wonderful job. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like a fool for not loving this classic examination of the existence (or lack thereof) of both God and the meaning of life more.I appreciate it, with it's stark, lovely photography, attention to detail, marvelous performances, and sly dark sense of humor that balances the portentousness of the subject matter, and makes the film much easier to watch than my teen film-class memories of it. On the other hand, while I appreciate the film's importance in cinema history, and the bravery with which it tackles the biggest of issues in a head-on, intellectual way, I find it just that ? a very intellectual experience, devoid of much in the way of emotion. I also find some of the writing painfully preachy and on the nose. Yet, in the end, I admire what it accomplished in its time, and how well it holds up 53 years later. And seeing as I went from not liking it at all, to liking it quite a bit on my 2nd viewing, I'm open to what a third seeing might bring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the first time, and was amazed at how good it is.This is not a Michael Bay film. There are no explosions, and really no action. Yet it is powerful. Much more powerful, in fact, than most loud and violent films.There are many strong and emotionally laden scenes in the film, but the "witch" burning scene and Antonius' reaction there was particularly strong. It was as if he had seen the futility of intervention with death on his heels, yet couldn't quite stop himself from doing something.All those little moments..Von Sydow is simply amazing, as is all the main cast, strong script, beautiful cinematography, and a very effective use of sound and music (as minimalistic and bleak as everything else in the film).The sad part is that if this film had been released today it would be seen by a handful of movie enthusiasts and would never get a wide audience. Instead people pay to see Transformers 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Blok and Death interrupt their game of chess (due to the plague, Death is very busy), he meets two actors, Jof and Mia, with their little son, the most human characters of the film, and I don't think it's a coincidence that there names sound very much like Joseph and Mary. These people may be a little dim, but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.But the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters, as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake, as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God, religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first full Bergman film even though I have seen a couple of scenes of Cries and Whispers. The Seventh Seal is all about death. The only certainty in life is death and death escapes no one. I have been scared of death in my childhood, wondered even more in my teenage years and now I am numb about it.The question of what happens after death is intriguing. The main actor asks - what happens to those who believe, what happens to those who don't believe, what happens to those who want to believe. In the end, he hopes and hope is all he can do.The narrative style is excellent. A lot of stories are mixed in but you never feel lost. It is perfectly coiled together. You see various people of different levels of intellect, insecurities and lives. Every one is overcome by death in the film except the actor who sees visions and his family.The movie is perfectly edited, with brilliant camera work and shows what a true master Bergman is. I am truly in awe of his direction and the way in which he handles the narrative. The last half hour of the movie is a bit depressing as death encapsulates people.Death itself has no answers for the main actor. Is there life after death? Is there God? Is there Devil? Death doesn't have the knowledge and the protagonist is kept in the dark about what happens after death. The family which escapes death is the part I didn't understand. Is Bergman trying to some how be optimistic in all the pessimism? I thought the film asked a lot of questions about death and areas surrounding it but it could have explored more. Half an hour more with more questions and I think it could have been deeper. I am okay with the length though as the film passes in a jiffy. Well edited as I said. I can't wait to watch more of Bergman. 7.5/10</fullReview>

Unfortunately we have lost him. Too bad there's not another director of his caliber to take his place.Everyone should see this movie at least once in his or her life!

		<fullReview>Death is a beautiful thing. He stands upon a rocky beach shore ? tall, proud, inescapable ? his gaunt face staring expectantly towards his next victim. War-weathered knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, "The Exorcist") is not surprised to see him. The Black Death has already descended upon Sweden, killing all in its path, inciting terror in every village. "I have long walked at your side," proclaims Death. "That I know," is Block's reply. He understands that his time has now come, but he fears death. He cannot undertake what he does not understand. Is there a God? Following death, will he experience the rewards of Heaven, or the vast emptiness of nothing. Block likens faith in God to "loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." His faith is lost; he cannot move on until he has decided upon his beliefs.Desperate for several more days to come to terms with his faith, Block challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot) to a game of chess. His opponent is actually quite a skillful chess player, but the knight hopes to be able to hold him off for long enough to acquire the "knowledge" that he so desires. And so Block, accompanied by his brave and loyal squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), strikes off to see his wife just one final time, each day bringing him several moves closer to the end. Meanwhile, a small travelling troop of actors, comprising playfully-natured Jof (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), their one-year-old son Mikael and partner Skat (Erik Strandmark), try to make ends meet through their theatrical performances. The paths of these two parties will eventually meet, and all those who travel alongside Antonius Block will risk suffering the same fate as he, should the fateful chess game prove unsuccessful.This being my first film from Ingmar Bergman, I was immediately astonished at how beautiful the film was. Whether it be the unforgettable close-ups of Death's ghostly white face and captivating gaze, two horses drinking solemnly from the ocean's edge, the ghastly procession of bloodied penitents who haul hefty wooden crosses and sacrificially flog themselves or the distant image of Death leading his followers in a Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) across a grassy mountain-top, 'The Seventh Seal' is brimming with beauty.The acting is absolutely stunning. Max von Sydow, the only name I recognised due to his significant later work in such films as Friedkin's 'The Exorcist (1973)' and Spielberg's 'Minority Report (2002),' is superb as Antonius Block, the knight who must decide who or what he believes in before his time runs out. Of the many representations of Death in cinema, Bengt Ekerot's portrayal in this film must be one of the finest ? with his icy black stare, his arrogant and merciless manner and all sorts of devious trickery up his sleeves, 'The Seventh Seal's' Death has to be one of the most memorable villains of all time.Though not subtle in its symbolism by any standards, this directness is one of the film's strengths. By regarding good and evil with the same physical simplicity as its hero does, we are forced to make up our minds either way. Stunningly beautiful, endlessly thought-provoking, chilling and mesmerising, Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal' is a masterpiece of existential cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the first Ingmar Bergman i have seen.Bergman is a very revered Swedish director.i wasn't sure what to expect with this film,but i had wanted to see it for some time.basically the story is about a knight named Antonius Block(Max von Sydow) during the time of the Black Plague in Europe.Block finds himself visited by "Death" himself(Bengt Ekerot),who reveals that Block's time is soon up.Bock himself already has suspicions so is not surprised,and in weird way,is resigned to his fate.and yet,to avoid or at least delay the inevitable,he challenges "Death" to a game of chess.if he wins,Death will leave him alone,at least for the time being.of course if he loses,his time is nearly up.as the match unfolds,we are shown various people who struggle to deal with the plague and its devastation,each in their own way.also,during breaks in the game,Block goes on a personal journey,to try to find some meaning in life in general, and in his own life.we see he is a very conflicted, tortured soul and longs to believe(that is have faith in God).the movie is very low key,very dramatic,yet really is compelling.i did not understand every nuance of the movie,not knowing what to look for,and the movie is subtitled in German,which makes it a bit harder to follow.this is mainly due to the fact that the subtitles sometimes omit parts of pertinent conversation. at least,it seems that way.either way,this film demands a 2nd viewing,which should fill in things missed the 1st time.one thing i do know is that Bergman is a very passionate director,and that shows,although ironically in subtle ways.the point is,although the movie is melancholy at times,i did enjoy it.For now,a strong 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searh for truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Seventh seal is a wonderful movie. A knight's returns home after years. But the most important aspect of his life seems to remain unanswered. He searched for truth and hasn't found it yet and it's getting clear through the film it's not going to happen. The question of the existence of god and the relations of human to him is one the most important issues in history. I think this film should be considered as pictorial manifest of the existentialism. Are we alone in the world or not? Is there any hope to feel the God through our life in any way? This film could happen in our age too, because it has the same questions yet we haven't found. Interestingly, no one will forget the face of death in this movie which was played by Bengt Ekerot. The death only carries out his duties but no one knows is there any one to order him to do that? The knight never find out if god is out there or not even when he asked death about it. The death is not able or allowed to answers to the knight whether anything really exists beyond life or not. If there is emptiness or something else beyond it? What happens then? He remains mysterious and silent about these questions all over the film. I think Ingmar Bergman let us free to judge about these matters and there is no clear answer to them. We are all that knight too who seeking for the truth.It is one of the most interesting movies which I ever saw. Ingmar Bergman has many great ideas to talk about. If some one likes to see a movie which could help him to think more about himself and the world around him, I suggest this film.Also the power of humanity is evident in this film. At the end of the film we see that small family comprised of three who escaped the death and saw the others leaded by the death to the end of their destiny. They are plain and good people which don't have complicated ideas about life. They only want a simple life to live. It's clear they are some how similar to the father, Christ and the holy Mother and this could be one of the reasons why they didn't go with dead. Life goes on ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OUTLINE. It is the year the Great Plague hits Scandinavia. A seasoned knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) returns from some ten year's long late crusading venture to the Holy Land, to which he went out a Believer, where he became a Denier, and whence he now comes back a Seeker. He is followed by his loyal squire, the coarsely cynical, still brave and righteous Jöns (Gunnar Björnstand), with whom he keeps a strong bond and an implicit debate going on. During the journey, he encounters various people and events, all with a particular bearing on the Knight's all consuming Quest for God's Existence and the Meaning of Life; first of all he meets Death himself (Bengt Ekerot), but he contrives to postpone his end by challenging by his sinister opponent to a game of chess, which he intends to win, though he really can't, as he himself in the final analysis knows. Then, we see, among others, the na?vely charming family of entertainers, Jof (Nils Poppe), his loving pretty wife Mia (Bibi Andersson) and the infant Mikael, later we see the unrepenting Witch on her way to the stakes (Maud Hansson), the primitive blacksmith Plog (?ke Fridell) and his trampy wife (Inga Gill), the silent peasant girl (Gunnel Lindblom). Many join him to a following on the route. Finally they reach his home castle where his noble and faithful wife Karin (Inga Landgré) courteously receives them all. He has by now lost his game; and the same night Death comes to claim his harvest, and in the culminating scene they all confront Death with a display of their respective true personal nature. Then follows a short epilogue, where the juggler family, having escaped Death, moves away in a state of happy innocence.JUDGMENT. This film combines simplicity and complexity in a way never surpassed. The themes, the motives, the characters, they all have a popular and universal quality easy for everyone to recognize and understand; the dialog is simple, terse and exact; but all these general, iconic and "archetypal" elements of the story are brought into an interplay producing amazing complexity and subtlety. Consequently, an enormous richness is exemplarily condensed into a minimum of size; in this film nothing is redundant, and one may well argue it's a culmination all the way. It's tragedy; but pastiche and comedy just as well. It's a "deep" film if any; and still gorgeous entertainment. In short, this film is, in my opinion, more close to Perfection than any, and the multiplication product of Quality and Interest is simply sky high.HIGHLIGHTS. Many scenes have been famous: those moments at the chessboard, that "Totentanz" end procession on the ridge; the frightening appearance of the flagellants. So, I would like to point out a few scenes no one else here has mentioned: the wonderful little absurdist song show by Jof and Mia at the stage before being interrupted by flagellants' arrival; the calm and surprising reply by Death, when queried about the Mystey he hides and represents: "Secrets? I have no secrets. I am unknowing." - and the ecstatic face of the peasant girl, kneeling and hailing Death at the end scene in the castle: "It is finished!" - it's here the film really, so to speak, explodes somewhat koan-wise into a sudden Illumination, how come so few reckon this??The acting is great all way through, von Sydow (what terrific makeup, making him so statue-like!) and Björnstrand are those generally appraised, and quite rightly so; but in my opinion they are both eclipsed by the brilliance of Bibi Andersson as Mia, here fusing beauty and acting ability in a way just knocking me out; just watch her inspired, perfectly burlesque "body language" in that silly song performance, it couldn't be more accurate. She's simply phenomenal. - Inga Landgré is perfect as Karin, and Maud Hansson an unforgettable Witch.DISCUSSION. Some keen observations have been made by other members, but I am surprised finding so many fine points missed. Some dicern an anti-religious tendency, but this is inadequate. The knight Antonius in the end let's it all go spontaneous desperate prayer, at last running into fierce confrontation with Jöns, to the end the staunch Atheist. We must not forget the crucial part played by Jof, the Fool proving the Wise Man when put to the ultmate test, the only one seeing what it's all about, thus being able to save his his family at the last moment, sparing them for that lucid end scene; and Jöns' words to the peasant girl he caringly looks after, winning her confidence: "Don't you see I give you solace?" and - again! - this enthralling Enigma of that face, and those words in her one single line in the manuscript. This film does NOT argue Atheism, but a positive Agnosticism tinged with a, though tiny, maybe, still bright note of Hope.MISCELLANEOUS. It's said Ingmar Bergman has "disowned" this film. That isn't so. As he himself explains, it's a painful thing for him to recall the agonies of past works, he made this movie as a self therapeutic treatment for his personal haunting fear of death, he probably feels having succeeded striking a precarious balance he is now recalcitrant to jeopardize by some reexamination. Ingmar Bergman himself regards The Seventh Seal as one of his best films, but he does not enjoy talking about it.The story is generally presumed to take place in Sweden - but the two towns mentioned, Elisinore and Roskilde - are Danish, not Swedish.This film is a literary masterpiece as well. The incisive, powerful language used in it represents the Swedish language at a very apogee of it's high potential of purity, clarity and beauty.The film is included in a list of films officially approved and recommended by the Vatican.IN SHORT. Not a few people regard this film as the best ever made. I think I am one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern sensibilities don't seem to appreciate the gallows humour of this film, going by the reaction of the other students today. The people of the mediaeval world, (I feel) would have reacted more knowingly to its depiction. Death was a familiar to them to an extent our cossetted society cannot begin to imagine. Its personification was a given. The humour also runs counter to the rather bleak image that we have of Bergman and his oeuvre, but serves its purpose in this masterpiece. The sardonic sidekick unconcerned with the loftier ideals underpins the nobility of his master. He knows the true nature of their 10-year journey that has led them nowhere but back to where they started. The allegorical tone of the duel with not only death, but futility in all its guises, elevates the conflict of self-realisation in the knight to philosophical levels that resonate still. The answers to these questions elude us even more today, than they did in the world of an omnipotent Church. The very fact that we still ask them imbues the film with a timeless majesty. I felt, never having seen this before, that its depiction of the mediaeval world was cinematically groundbreaking as far as I am aware. The gritty and lusty picture of the lives of the ordinary folk is in total contrast to the Knights and stone fireplaces in garish chivalrous codswallop churned out by Hollywood. I think that the only film produced by the American studios that ever dealt in any real way with the lives of ordinary people in that era was The War Lord in 1965. The concern with the inner questions of moral and ethical fortitude as plague sweeps the land is handled realistically, unlike the kingly power struggles and ethereal romance of your standard post -Arthurian romp. Perhaps the Victorian fascination with the works of Sir Walter Scott et al didn't resonate in dour windswept Scandinavia, and their recollections of the period are far more prosaic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is a thought-provoking film that Christians (like myself) and non-Christians should see. It tells of a story of a knight coming home from the Crusades and wagers his life on a game of chess with Death.The film is much more than some guy playing chess with the Grim Reaper; it tells of man's existence and purpose for life as well as the existence of God and God's purpose in the lives of mankind. Bergman includes several Biblical references in the film such as the film's title, "The Seventh Seal," the names of two actors: Jof (Joseph) and Mai (Mary), as well as their son, Michael. In Bergman's film, there is no right message and he leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether or not God exists.4 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately I believe it was never the knight's intention to really try and beat Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent Swedish film, directed by Ingmar Bergman. A knight and his squire return from home the crusades to Sweden which is being swept by the plague. He is approached by Death who's come for him and the knight challenges Death to a game of chess to spare his life. Not knowing, I expected this movie to be focused on the game of chess, when it's really more telling the story of how people dealt with the tumultuous times dealing with the black death that is killing off the people. I'm glad this was the case as it is what really drew me into the story. So many interesting elements. Seeing how the religious officials were blaming people for their sins and telling them it was punishment from God. The most telling scene in the movie was when they were talking to the girl who was about burned alive for being involved with the devil. There was one scene that amused me, probably more than intended...when Death was cutting down the tree with a saw. I really enjoyed the lighter scenes that contrasted the serious ones in the movie. Ultimately I believe it was never the knight's intention to really try and beat Death, but to try to prolong life as long as possible in hopes of accomplishing something positive...in this case helping the couple and their child. This is my first Bergman movie, but it makes me anxious to explore more of his work. While watching, it was easy to spot many parts that have been borrowed/parodied in future films...it was good to finally see the source.***1/2 (Out of 4) Rank: #3 in 1957</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All great movies by definition are about our experiences or our anticipations, otherwise we wouldn't be able to recognize them as great. Significant part of this movie is about the way we die, which is of course a consequence of the way we live. Meet a searching agnostic (the knight), a self-assured atheist (the squire), a pious meek believer (the girl), a deluded Satan worshiper, a religious hypocrite, and a couple of characters who do not give a squat about god's existence. Send them on a journey through medieval country and watch them live and die. This is The Seventh Seal. There is also a model family, which walks off into horizon. It is this sugar coated bogus family, which slights the movie for me. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to describe this movie. Definitely the pinnacle of filmmaking history. Almost certainly the best movie ever made (only 2001: A Space Odyssey or Bunuel's Phantom of Liberty compare as far as I'm concerned, but I still think it's the best). If you're reading this, then you probably already have a fair idea of the plot. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT. Bergman poured every ounce of talent (and he has a lot of it) into this movie, which more or less launched Max von Sydow's career. The black-and-white cinematography by a true visionary, Sven Nykvist, compliments the film perfectly. Bergman creates a doomed, almost apocalyptic atmosphere to the dark times of the middle ages. The last shot of the film is probably the single most powerful camera shot ever put on celluloid. In swedish, maybe they have a word for this, but in english, the closest I can think of is: UNBELIEVABLE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brief summary of an all-time classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disillusioned knight and his trusty squire return from the crusades to find their homeland swept by pestilence and hysteria. Stalked by the figure of Death, they roam the countryside searching for some touchstone of meaning or spiritual redemption. Finding that traditional sources of understanding are distorted beyond recognition, they seek sanctuary in the company of a traveling circus troupe until their presence brings unwanted attention to their new friends. In Medieval Europe, Bergman finds an appropriate setting for his philosophical and religious torment and avoids being too cerebral with an economy of expression that is wonderfully poetic. Sardonic humor blends seamlessly with unspeakable pain in a true classic that is as stirring today as when it was originally released. (Memorable scenes: The knight unknowingly confessing his religious doubts to Death in the confessional; The unforgettable image of the silhouetted figures merrily dancing into the afterlife).</fullReview>

It is truly difficult to describe the pure perfection of this film and all it symbolizes. Sven Nyvist provides such a wonderfully gloomy atmosphere that Bergman's direction and script are absorbed into the environment, and top- of- the- line actors like Gunnar Bjorstrand, Max Von Sydow and Bibi Andersson bask in the darkness with heart rendering performances. The chess game with Death has got to be my favorite cinematic construction ever. I HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the cinema, and I hope in time it will regain its reputation as one of the great films.

		<shortDescription>Surrealism from Thoughtful Classic Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Det sjunde inseglet" isn't the first movie from Bergman that I watch. It's the second movie, after "Persona". I know it too well of appreciate the movie. You can just watch the high-rated movie and feel the beauty in it when you can't enjoy the middle-rated movie. From this site, I know that "Persona" rating is lower than "Det sjunde inseglet", so at the first I just learn to love the lower one. And from that, I can enjoy the higher rated movies from Bergman more. Imagine a baby, at first it is fed by breast milk, next the porridge. Until its teeth grow, it can eat bread, even meat. There are always some stages in life, and in movie's appraisal too. I just want to grow my teeth first. And then I can "eat" the other Bergman's movies. So, if you can't enjoy this movie, don't get too resistant, try to be more tolerant. It's old, Swedish, and very different from the nowadays movie, from the content to the cinematography. Like I said before, grow your teeth first, learn to enjoy unusual movie like this. I recommend this for you who want to takes cinema rather seriously. I mean you can get entertained with all kind of movie when you mastered it. And I limit it only for highest rated movies. I mean, why waste your time watching bad movies. Seems perfectionist, but it's my way.What I can say for this movie is very surreal. Yes, fantasy, enough fantasy combines with the Black Plague atmosphere. I just know the plague from "Plague" painting (1898) by Arnold Böcklin. A painting represents thousand meanings. And "The Seventh Seal" (1957) by Ingmar Bergman is just another kind of art which also contains thousand representation. The point is the fear of those society face with unidentified disease. That era, when only Bible is read, the book that's the source of all thought, people think of the end of the day. Witch, sins, all have the connection with plague. That is the protagonist who questions everything in that era. Yes, anti- mainstream idea of what actually life, God, and death are. Man that age just accept that concept in the raw. Of course, Antonius Block knows it is inquisition. But, what is the meaning of refusal when his personal idea contrasts with the society's idea, the religion. He just think, all those sins, witches, don't have any significance of plague. He actually thought of philosophy, the root of science. He isn't wrong, but his time is come, the Death. He just extends his dead-time to define who actually God is. And sure that death doesn't have any resemblance of God. A provocative idea, even until now. At the end, he just realizes it's wasting time to question all that thing in that era, he pray and beg the pardon from God who he doubt for. God is true, Death is real, that is the end of his idea.Yeah, that was all I see. What an amazing thought from that movie. The surreal aspects just to deliver those messages in an entertaining way. Of course, I also admire the very natural acting from that time. It's not exaggerating. The idea of Grim Reaper plays chess game is just the seasoning of this great motion pictures. The critical movie for society until this day, classic one. I personally amazed what Bergman try to say from this movie. "Surreally" beautiful drama!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artful, philosophical spectacle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, "The Seventh Seal" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, "The Seventh Seal" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: "I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me," he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (?ke Fridell), squire Jöns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of foreign cinema's finest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a mainstream film, or any type of film for that matter, were to tackle as many themes and morals as Ingmar Bergman's legendary Seventh Seal, it would most likely be an uneven, unpolished work, and not even come close to the realm of depth this film can accomplish so elegantly and calmly. This is the kind of picture that, when it's done, you want to immediately rewatch it because you know there are things that you missed.Our story concerns a disillusioned knight named Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, who gives one of cinema's finest performances) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), who return home after fighting in the Crusades on an empty, desolate beach. Sweden has been victim to the plague, meaning those that have it are dying right before people's eyes, and those who don't have it are engulfed in fear. It isn't long before Block encounters the personified "Death" (Bengt Ekerot), who appears pale - in a black cloak - much like early, vague illustrations of the Grim Reaper character. Immediately, Block, confused about life and death itself, challenges Death to a game of chess, where if he wins, he will be spared his life.Block and Jöns, en route back to their castle, encounter Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son, Mikael, who are stage actors in a play. From here on out, the film takes us on an unforgettable ride, as we follow both Block and Jöns's journeys throughout the middle age time period and what unfolds than is a rousing commentary on religion, life, and death.The film has the look of a period piece, but with the contents of serene drama and utter bleakness with the nice surprising inclusion of black comedy. The Seventh Seal too asks existential questions about the world around us in a manner that isn't indulgent, and offers many assumptions in its underlying text. Frequently, we see our character, Block, as hopeless and seemingly unimportant in life. He questions religion so much, and with all the mentions of death (even the appearance) we begin to wonder if he is inherently godless or atheistic in his personality.Often, the film provides us with tonal inconsistency, but it has to be the smoothest tonal inconsistency I have yet to experience. It isn't abrupt, and Bergman successfully manages to hold onto the flow of the story, never becoming too tied up with one of the underlying contexts over the other, and is fair and balanced in his work, including much of his dialog which is not cloyingly absent or annoyingly expository. It is perfectly handled and structured with elegance and purity.The Seventh Seal is one of the strongest foreign works of all time, and a film with enough on its plate to develop three or four movies. Ingmar Bergman's sharp director, distinct and graphic writing style, complimented by the cinematography of the great Gunnar Fischer bring the energy, sophistication, and true delight that is The Seventh Seal. And even with all of these heavy topics at hand, never is it depressingly grim or overly optimistic.Starring: Max von Sydow, Gunnar Björnstrand, Bengt Ekerot, and Nils Poppe. Directed by: Ingmar Bergman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comments based on the Criterion Collection DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the weight of a Shakespearean tragedy and deserves its iconic status. While the main story line is rather grim, there is comic relief and brief moments of joy.In 14th century Sweden Antonius Block and his squire Jöns are on their journey home from the Crusades after a ten year absence. Their trip is played against a backdrop of the Black Death. Block and his squire represent two very different takes on life. Block constantly anguishes over the question of the existence of God--he looks for signs, but sees none. He makes the comment, "Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." Jöns doesn't particularly bother himself with religious matters; he comments, "Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up." The screenplay contains much sharp dialog, as these comments illustrate. The interplay between Block and Jöns is engaging. Of course the signature scenes occur between Block and Death, incarnated here as a black cowled pasty-faced wraith with a stern visage. The most intriguing scenes have Block and Death playing a life-and-death game of chess, but Death makes frequent appearances throughout and is ever-present in the mind.It is startling how directly and seriously this movie takes on the topics of faith, life, meaning, and death. I was thinking that such a movie could probably no longer be made, but then I thought that "The Tree of Life" (2011) could fall into this category, albeit presented in a totally different format.Block wants to postpone his final appointment with Death so that he can accomplish some meaningful act before the end. He is able to do this by distracting Death while a young couple and their baby escape. This made me think about what sort of meaningful act I could accomplish if I knew my time was near.Not being all that knowledgeable about the latter Middle Ages in Europe I cannot judge if this is an accurate representation, but it has the feeling of authenticity. Until further study I guess this will be what my concept of the era will be.Bergman has assembled an admirable cast. Max von Sydow and Gunnar Björnstrand are particularly good. It is hard to believe that von Sydow was still in his twenties at the time--his gaunt body and severe look make him perfectly cast as the knight.The scene at the end where Death makes his entrance into the castle and the diners slowly turn to him is masterfully done.The Criterion Collection DVD contains a pristine print. There is probably no more striking example of high-contrast black and white than this movie. Any lover of black and white films will delight in seeing this work of a master. In addition to a commentary track narrated by Peter Cowie, the DVD contains a wealth of extras: a short introduction by Bergman, an 83-minute documentary containing revealing interviews with Bergman, an audio interview with Max von Sydow, a tribute by Woody Allen, a Bergman filmography, and an afterward by Peter Cowie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death never takes a holiday...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm not going overboard in extolling the virtues of THE SEVENTH SEAL, I do think it has some striking imagery and had the potential to be the ultimate work of art Ingmar Bergman was obviously striving for. But do I think he achieved it? No...for the simple reason that it leaves us unenlightened on the subject with no new knowledge.Bergman really has no answers to the age old questions we all have about life and death and what happens in the hereafter. And giving Death a human face seems to me the wrong decision on Bergman's part. He should have kept him a hooded spectre and nothing more--faceless and unknown within the shadows of his hood. Humanizing him doesn't work, at least not for me.A cruel streak runs through some of the more boisterous moments, such as when one of the actors is put through some hazing by a sadistic man who later gets his comeuppance. Everyone laughs and applauds as the man is humiliated beyond the endurance of this spectator for the sake of bawdy humor which seems forced and contrived, as does much of the clowning by the group of actors.But there are so many good things about the richly photographed film, that I don't want to give this review an entirely negative impression. But the truth is it offers no new insights into the age old questions of life and death. It's all presented as an allegory with religious symbols (flagellation, the cross, the witch burning) and we suspect that among the many utterances we hear from The Devil will be something to ponder and think about. But no. There's only the hopelessness that Death offers when the plague is rampant over the land and is something which cannot be avoided by man, no matter how clever he thinks he is. The chess game that the Black Knight proposes is a ruse that the Devil sees through from the start. And we suspect near the end that he knows the young couple with the infant have escaped since he says that he knows all that is happening, even behind his back. The young couple will be doomed too, eventually. Death will consume all.But Max van Sydow is excellent as The Knight questioning his reason for being and his reason for dying. The B&amp;W cinematography evokes the Middle Ages with striking scenes that stay in the mind afterwards and the film, while bleak and disturbing, is always riveting to watch.It's a very engrossing film, but there are many weaknesses. I don't consider it the masterpiece that so many others label it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . loved to throw Oscars at Swedish director Ingmar Bergman back in the day, but even they couldn't bring themselves to appease the "arty" crowd by awarding him a Gelded Gnome for the SEVENTH SEAL. Though Revelations is a favorite Bible book for many rich people, coupling it with a real-life plague that is killing off the poor and wealthy alike might not be the smartest ploy to win the mogul vote. While the Muggles apparently burn a "witch" mid-film, the famous chess match between Max Von Snydow's knight and Death is a big let-down. Even the James Bond series has done chess better than this. The "medieval" felt costumes look like they've been put together by a home economics flunk-out mom for kindergarten Halloween. Maybe all the philosophizing about God and mortality here is epic in SEAL's original Swedish. If so, it's mostly lost in translation (which is a significant negative, when less than one per cent of movie watchers are fluent in Swedish). Perhaps SEAL can be enjoyed best by turning off the sub-titles, and constructing a story in your head to go along with the occasionally interesting pictures. (That way, you won't be driven to marry your own daughter as dictated by SEAL's "anything goes" mantra.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seventh Seal is another great work of the excellent Sweden director Ingmar Bergman. Not only it's deep discussions about the fear of the death are extremely interesting,actual themes(the middle age was used as a allegory of the world 'situation' in 1957, when all the persons feared an imminent death, due to the cold war), but is also vastly rich in meanings at every single shot. I mean, nothing in it seems to be there without any reasons or a deep meaning. Maybe i'm reading too much on it, but maybe not. Remember that we are talking about Ingmar Bergman. And technically it is, as well, a very well made film. A beautiful film, in fact. The cinematography is stunning, with some wonderful shots, it has an impressive work in the edition as well, a very macabre soundtrack, which adds a certain dark(even darker) atmosphere to the film. The acting is impressive, a bit over the top, but still good. It may be not 100% entertaining all the time, but I'm sure that it can be an easily watchable experience even for those who don't have that much interest in this kind of films. Also, we have one of the most remarkable moments in cinema history here, when the cross soldier plays chess against the death. Absolutely fantastic. If you haven't watched it yet, i highly recommend you to do so. Deserved 'classic' status. 8.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts with a very unusual ploy and the story seem to be going to be in all possible directions where you will feel disoriented all the times. For the first half I could not properly figure out as to what was going on but in the second half the film got some sense. This is one of those films whom you do not like much but when you explore in depth, you find no proper points to criticize it.PROS: You will somewhat attach to the film in a very weird way. I could not figure out as to what was the desire inside me for the film. I did not hate it although the plot was unusual. In the end you will feel as if there was no meaning to the film but the film actually made you sit whole time with the help of its mysterious and sometimes haunting scenes. The soundtrack is also commendable.CONS: The important thing in any film is a nice story, but here I did not found the story impressive or rather I should confess that the depth of the story was beyond my understanding. The characters at a time looked to me too much and it was a bit complicated again to understand what was happening under all that chaos.May be I should see again to get the proper understanding of the film. But I would say that you will not be bored in the first viewing.MESSAGE: "Cannot escape death."VERDICT: "Watch only if you are a huge fan of cinema."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>25.07.2012: A film that forces you to feel something about the concept of death and what it means. It is up to the viewer himself to make up their own minds to what that is. Personally i believe in the very thing Max von Sydows character is afraid of, "nothingness". But as far as the film is concerned isn't death appearing as a person proof of the afterlife? It is not just a bleak film since it has some genuine humor in it. For one i thought the blacksmith was utterly amusing in his acts and dialog. In fact all the characters was amusing in a sense in their own way. So far this is the best Bergman film i have seen. But i have only seen between 5-7 titles thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austere Meditation on Death, Suffering and the Existence of God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Commonly regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, Ingmar Bergman's "Seventh Seal" is a profound meditation on death, suffering, God and hope set during the turmoil of the Middle Ages and, more specifically, the years when the Black Death stalked Europe.The central character, Antonius Block, has returned to Europe after the Crusages. As a knight, he would have brutally sent many people to their deaths but now, facing his own mortality, he encounters fear. He could (misguidedly) kill in the name of God with an unflinching, black and white faith but now as he sees the true nature of death, he begins to experience doubts as to whether God exists at all.The film's simple but striking technique of showing death personified of course recalls the portrayal of the Grim Reaper throughout the art of the medieval period and the idea of death playing chess with those he stalks is a striking and simple one. The fact that the chess scene takes place on a beach, a meeting place between two worlds (land and water reflecting life and afterlife) is also subtle yet profound.Bergman's trademark austere cinematography is at its best here, highlighting a bleak world largely devoid of a human population. The bleakness reflects the lack of hope in the era and in the character's spiritual struggle and serves to undermine any idea of the Middle Ages as a romantic time of chivalry. Block's character, shawn of such a facade is shown to be a man who has committed great evil as a member of the military and now struggles with his guilt and his mortality.His dialogues with Death are profound with the scene in the confessional being particularly well-realised. Even when trying to confide in a priest does death stalk him and haunt his thoughts. Perhaps this shows the futility of a religion (medieval Catholicism) that caused such horrors as the Crusades to occur in the first place.Likewise, flagellates roam the land but they, too, have no answers. They merely reflect, and add to, the horrors around them.As he searches for signs of God he overlooks the simple, hopeful life of the naive members of the traveling theatre troupe and, especially, their joy in their new child. Inarticulate, they cannot express philosophical truths but they live them. Their banal, low cultured performances may not bring much respite to the surrounding villages but their joie de vivre despite all that is happening life a faith. Furthermore, the male troupe member's visions point to something more beyond this life.Ultimately, God is everywhere, even in this ravaged landscape but unlike Death, he does not show his faith. He is hidden in the love and hopefulness of the young couple.</fullReview>

I Was Surprisingly Amazed As To How Much I Liked This. I Feel Utterly Powerless Reviewing This Because Everything Everyone Said About This Movie Complimenting It Are True. The Only Complaint Is That It Proves That The Oscars Are Full Of Crap Because There Wasn't Even A Nomination For Best Foreign Language Film When I Say This IS The Best Film Of The 1950's, Seven Samurai Is A Close Second.Ingmar Bergman Is Also The Only Director That Lives Up To His Reputation And One I Would Also Watch Another One Of His Movies The Only Other Great Director That I Would Also Say That With Is Alfred Hitchcock However The Only Bad One Is Steven Speildberg Because In My Opinion His Films Are All CGI Effects - Just An Opinion.This Film Is Also Underrated, The Dark Knight Does Not Deserve To Be Higher, Oh Well I Guess Chris Nolan's "All Visuals And Death On The Set" Is Nothing Against Powerful Storytelling From Bergman.

		<shortDescription>Compellingly addresses art's toughest subjects: life, death and God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Seventh Seal" is a very literary film, one weighted by philosophical dialogue and thought-churning imagery. Swedish director Ingmar Bergman bravely goes where few filmmakers have ever dared to go in their lifetimes: contemplating death and the existence of God. So few would feel comfortable meditating on such heavy subjects, but Bergman does it uniquely and without coming off as pretentious or preachy.Taking place in the Middle Ages, this black and white 1957 Swedish film follows the knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) on his way back from the Crusades in the height of Europe's Black Plague. There might not be a grimmer time in history for Bergman's story, perfect for bringing Death in as a character, depicted in his black robe with scythe in hand. Antonius, who sees Death coming for him, challenges him to a game of chess in attempt to prolong his life and get some answers about existence before he dies viewing life as a complete waste.The film's language is dense, though not quite Shakespearian. All the characters appear to play a critical role and there are many: Antonius' squire Jons, the happy family of traveling actors, Jof, Mia and their baby Mikael, another actor Jonas Skat and the Blacksmith Plog and his promiscuous wife Lisa. All of these characters' lives are in jeopardy from the plague and each brings something knew to the very fragile and contemplative Antonius. Much of the dialogue speaks directly about life, death and longing for knowledge of God -- there's definitely no surprise that Bergman made his story a play first.There are lots of Christian and Medieval Christian tones to the story, with the title coming from a revelation and flagellants whipping themselves in belief that the plague was sent as God's punishment. It's a bleak film with the exception of the young couple with their baby performing musical acts and expressing their love for each other. In Bergman's posed questions about why we exist, it's clear his own thoughts on the answer revolves around love and its mysterious power and eternal optimism.Light-hearted and comical at times as any good Shakespeare will do, "The Seventh Seal" offers multiple avenues for some serious and enthralling discussion. It definitely requires attentive eyes and ears, especially for those not fluent in Swedish, because at times it's nearly impossible to both watch Bergman work as a director and soak in the meaning of the words. It is quite easily one of film's more intellectually stimulating movies.</fullReview>

It's about all the fears of a world we think is gone--a world where death seems to lurk--ready to open its arms and lead us away at any time. It's been a while since I watched The Seventh Seal, but what I remember about it is that one must consider life and death and be ready for either. There are meanings in this film that run deep.

		<shortDescription>One of the great classics of European cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal is undoubtedly a great film that is unlike any other great film that I ever seen when it comes to the story, of which is one of the most fascinating stories ever to be put on film. Bergman's film tells the story of a knight named Antonius Block (played by Max von Sydow) who is trying to get answers about life death, and God's existence, while playing chess with the Grim Reaper (played by Bengt Ekerot) in order to save the lives of the people who are infected with the Black Plague. While watching this film I said that this was not a film that Hitchcock would have wanted to do because it would have broken his suspense guidelines, and that is why I do think that nobody else could have directed this film better than Ingmar Bergman did. One of the directors that I truly admire Woody Allen who did some good films of his own I thought had the perfect choice to select this as one of his all time favorite movies, and the same thing goes with me as well. Also not only that this film made me love movies even more than I ever did before, though the plot is complicated I still completely understood it, and that not only it is one of the great classics of European cinema it also proves that movies from different countries can be worth watching as American movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking and profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SEVENTH SEAL is Ingmar Bergman's meditation on Christianity and death, told through the tableau of a medieval setting and a mixed bunch of players on the stage. Max von Sydow headlines the cast as the Crusader knight who famously challenges Death to a game of chess, and the film follows his ruminations as well as the lives of others caught up in the same time and place.This is certainly an original film, I can't think of one quite like it, and one that's tough to describe. It has an almost episodic feel in places, and there's no real thrust to the narrative; instead it's more of a depiction of everyday life, exploring interactions between various folk. But despite the lack of obvious focus, it's never less than utterly watchable. Melodrama it might be, but it's good melodrama.Bergman has a way of directing that reminds me of Kurosawa; he doesn't do anything obvious but his film nevertheless looks stylish and carefully composed throughout. The Swedish cast members are all very good and there are lots of powerful moments, from a jester being bulled in a wayside inn to the ultimate fate of a hapless witch. The ending employs a classic bit of imagery that left me feeling chilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal is about a Knight ( Max von Sydow, who later went on to greater fame playing Father Karras in The Exorcist), who returns home from the crusades. The black Death has ravished his homeland, so in disgust he challenges Death to a chess match. If he wins Death will stop killing people. If he looses Death will take his sole. Death foolishly gets cornered into a zugzwang position and is defeated.This movie has very Kierkegaardian themes on death and thus is quite existential. It also can be viewed as a metaphorical allegory of the Vietnam War. This is an truly amazing piece of cellulite. This film was Directed by Ingrid Bergman, who was Swedish and is dead. Co-starring Loni Andersson, who was a regular of Bergman's and was his ex-wife. Also recommended: :"Wild Strawberries", "The Dark Knight", "Searching For Bobby Fischer", "Andre", "Last House on the Left (1972 and 2009)", "Hostel 1&amp;2", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre Saga plus 2003 remake and The Beginning", "Videodrome", "Grindhouse", "Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead", "Vampire Hunter D", "Tetsuo: The Iron Man", "Making Contact(a.k.a.

Of course, there are some weaker movies he did; nobody's perfect. But when he was at the height of his game (which was more often the case than not), Bergman's films were incomparably profound and honest.And this one surely is probing as hell! All those haunting images (the final one being one of the most famous in film history); all the unforgettable scenes of bigot monstrosities and those few good-willed people (mostly) helplessly confronted with the mischief surrounding them; all the deep existential contemplation, neither cynical nor humourless, usually found in high literature... it's inexorable personal cinema of the highest order.

		<shortDescription>Perfect movie, and the perfect starting point for Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first film I watched by Ingmar Bergman, and in my eyes it's one of his very best. Ingmar loved to ask whether God exists or not, and while he may have devised more subtle ways to ask that question in later films, his directness in "The Seventh Seal" is one of the film's strong points. Antonius Block returns from fighting in the Crusades (Max Von Sydow) when he gets a visit from The Grim Reaper himself (Bengt Ekerot). But Antonious is not ready to die, and in order to buy himself some time, he challenges Death to a game of Chess. The Black Death has also taken hold of Antonius' hometown, and the villagers have been plunged into fear of the plague (The Black Death and the Crusades did not occur at the same time in real life, and this film is not meant to be historically accurate) The game of Chess continues throughout the film, and it even manifests itself through other characters in the film (one of the very first corpses found in the film could very well be an early pawn taken during the game of Chess). As Antonius travels through a village, along with his Squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand, who steals almost every scene he's in), he meets a variety of people, the most important two people are Jof and Mia, a couple of travelling artists very much in love, who also have a young son. Sven Nykvist may not have done the cinematography, but this is still one of the best looking films you could ever see. The dark and moody atmosphere is brilliantly reflected in the dark clouds, sinister forests and wonderful use of smoke throughout the movie. The soundtrack really adds to the mood, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. "The Seventh Seal" is only 90 minutes long, and Ingmar Bergman manages to say more in this film than some directors can say in over twice the running time: The existence of God, man's mortality in limited time, the damaging effects of war on a man's faith and an artist's importance to humanity. "The Seventh Seal" is a dark, thought-provoking movie on the human condition. Not only is it classic Bergman, it is classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first frame of 'The Seventh Seal', it is extremely clear that this is a film that successfully strives to be beautiful. The film opens with a brilliant shot of the bleak sky, accompanied by appropriately despairing choral music. The iconography gets better from there. Every single frame is a work of art in itself; from the image of two black horses standing in a wild sea, to the now immortal side shot of Antonius the Knight engaged in a game of chess with Death.'The Seventh Seal', beyond its visual seamlessness, is a profound and incredibly rich narrative. The doomed protagonists are placed in a bleak, death-ridden environment crawling with the plague and religious extremism. Here, director Ingmar Bergman pits them against the metaphysical; Max Von Sydow's Antonius questions the silence of God in a world which needs him more than ever, Jof the actor witnesses biblical imagery whilst remaining secure as part of the most likable, optimistic family ever faced with such relentless misery, and Antonius' squire dryly and humorously provides a commentary on death and the plague-ridden environment.This film is quite literally a masterpiece, both visually and philosophically. It boasts imagery that will forever be synonymous with classic cinema and some of the best performances an audience will ever have the privilege to witness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece (did you really expect me to say anything else?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Seventh Seal" seems to be the average person's concept of a foreign art film. Its been lauded so many times by intellectuals and critics that those seeking mere entertainment in their films are completely scared off by it. However, this is far from a lifeless and dull film. First off, its prized by intellectuals because it really is a complex film with multiple interpretations, many of which are completely viable. Also, "The Seventh Seal" is far from the cold and uninvolved experience some have made it out to be. The characters are all sympathetic and there's even some moments of humor, even slapstick, here and there. Even if you can't read into the subtext, its guaranteed to make some resonance with the viewer on an emotional level.Ingmar Bergman's direction is fantastic as usual, but even more impressive is his screenplay. He touches on topics regarding theology and metaphysics in a manner thats both ambiguous and intelligent. The final product is a film thats both nihilistic and spiritual. It deals with what man does in a world where God doesn't seem to care anymore and the constant search of life answers. The acting all around is very good, particularly Max von Sydow's mature performance as the knight. No wonder he became an international star on the strength of this performance. Even more memorable however is Bengt Ekerot's idiosyncratic portrayal of Death. The film is much more than just a knight playing chess with Death. Its an emotionally powerful and complex film that demands to be seen again and again to attempt to uncover the true meaning. Its dated a slight bit, but you really can't hold that against it. Anyone with an interest in cinema needs to see this. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>artistic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To summarize this movie I would say it is not entertaining at all, but as a piece of art is surpasses most movies I have seen in a while. I would describe watching this movie being similar to going to an art museum and studying original van goghs. Not exciting, but still beautiful none the less. I watched this movie when I was really tired and missed a lot so I decided to watch it again. But because it is really unentertaining it took me a while before I could bring myself to put it in my DVD player. But when I did it was one of the most rewarding movie experiences I have had in a while. The only reason I did not give it a 10 because it was not that entertaining and the scenes with the people whipping themselves lost some of its power (because I have grown up so accustomed to violence in movies). So let's try to start from just the substance of the movie. To even tackle such a hard subject with a movie was extremely bold, but the duologue was so good it almost felt as if I was reading it out of a philosophy book. The desperation of not knowing really pushed this movie forward and it was interesting to see how each of the characters dealt with death and not knowing the end. The fact that death did not know was brilliant and on every level in term of substance it was perfect. There were also some really good shots. The shot where Jon approaches the camera in the empty village was very well done and with live animals very nicely done. Actually one of my favorite shots was a simple one of the Joseph and Mia with the baby and the way the camera above them with Joseph in the front left and Mia in the back right on the tree branch. Not to sound like an ass but the shot felt very organic. I actually loved how he did death here and how he had a sense of humor and loved a challenge making him human. The confidence he exudes was perfect and when he says that he does not know the answer it almost feels as if it is because there is no answer. I like how he used a lot of black in shots of peoples faces. It was really well done and gave that sense of emptiness. My favorite point where that was done is the scene in the church with Death and Block. This is also my favorite scene and I feel as if one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The set up where it feels as if death is in a prison cell to see that Block in indeed the prisoner. The shot of him through the bars where you cannot see the back ground was perfect. I loved all the acting and even it was silly at points (by our standards) it was supposed to be. Even the one guys death scene was meant to be that way. It is interesting that I believe that Joseph and Mia were supposed to die, but Block was able to trick Death, but Death did not know he was tricked. So death can go one thinking he is perfect and has never been beaten. Such a great movie and I could go on and on about it, but I am tired of writing this. Everyone should see this movie and keep in mind that movies can be beautiful pieces of art.</fullReview>

The stunning opening with the appearance of Death is one the most impressive ever seen on the screens. The confession sequence is so simple and deep and moving: you feel the essence of your entire, small, brief life vanishing with Blok's words. The arrival of the flagellating pilgrims in the village is visually astonishing, like the unforgettable ending scene with the "danse macabre". Cinematography and acting are outstanding, and the transfigured Middle Age renders an angst sensation during all the film. Characters are very well assorted and the film has aged very well.A true high peak for the cinematic art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quintessential 1950's metaphysics and introspection of the rapidly rising director Ingmar Bergman, the "The Seventh Seal" assaults the senses with fine black and white cinematography; horrors of a plague infested Europe...plunges into questions of God and the meaning of life--familiar themes that to this very day find relevance in many global reels of celluloid. This, and a cluster of films from this era mark one phase of Bergman's inquiries...and probably his best. The film is worth several screenings especially when viewed at a theater. The horror of the young girl suffering false accusations of being with the Devil and consumed by the purging flames is etched in the mind. All the usual iconic symbols are here: Faithfulness, curiosity, innocence, revenge, ignorance, and greed. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit out there, even for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a big Ingmar Bergman fan. I've seen snippets of his more far out films here and there, and have heard a lot about how existential he and his material is, and can be in his films. But, even so, I figured I'd give The Seventh Seal a shot. Afterall, it's supposedly one of his more grounded and "conventional" films. Read that as a film not requiring a masters in religious studies, with an emphasis in symbolism, to interpret the film over a cup of java at the local café.That, and there was a knight in it. A knight? Cool! Swords and armor! Hook me up with that! Well, as expected, no sweeping panoramic shots of armies colliding in the holy land. Instead we get a very intimate allegory about life, the universe, and everything... even God. Wow. I mean, not to be too flippant, but that's pretty heavy stuff, considering that the middle ages were a time of great strife, and death was almost a sport. To ask those kinds of very introspective questions, even in a Bergman film, seems a little disconnected.I liked the film for what it was. Bergman's stuff isn't always my cup of tea, but this film at least had a clear narrative (unlike a lot of his avant-garde stuff), and had some tangible characters and settings, however slightly inaccurate they may've been rendered.If I had one complaint it would've been the costuming. Max Von Sydow's knightly garb had no gambeson underneath his armor. As a result his thin frame looks like a mannequin for an 11th or 12th century blacksmith. The only thing missing is a fashion runway for him to strut his stuff. Knights of the period wore more protection than Sydow is dressed in, ditto with Squire Jons. But never-mind.I know this is going to sound like heresy, but, to myself, there's room for improvement. To me this film seems to have been slightly rushed, or better yet has a real raw feeling about it. Almost as if Bergman wanted to get the message out into the film before he forgot about it. If he were to re shoot one film (an unlikely event at his age) this would be the one I'd like to see redone with him behind the camera, but with better setups.The film's visuals are stark, as can be expected, but somewhat ambiguous from shot to shot. It's almost as if Bergman wasn't sure how high to set the camera for most of the film. Then again maybe I'm misreading the film.If I sound a bit boorish regarding Bergman's more famous and recognized work rest assured it's done with tongue firmly implanted in cheek. However, that being said, I'm not so sure the mixture of conventionality and avant-garde is a complete success in this piece, however likable and successful, because, for myself, it misses a greater opportunity to spread its message even further with greater aplomb; and do so without all losing its high minded gist.Just my thoughts. More later as bulletins warrant.</fullReview>

I rented it nearly 3 months ago and still have been reading reviews of it and just trying to analyze all the different subtle aspects of it. I was so shocked to see a movie that could weave the concepts of life vs. death, the existence of God, etc. and do so in such a clever manner.The dialogue is so witty and some of the images are so striking, as in the "Death march" that I haven't been able to forget them. I am going to try to watch "Wild Strawberries" but none of the local stores have it.But again, if you are a fan of classics or like to ponder something deeper than Vin Diesel's next big role - you should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a rare blend of boldness, substance, and restraint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I frequently complain about heavy-handedness in films. Very often I'll find my admiration for a thematically substantive film tempered by my frustration at how mercilessly the themes are propounded. What impresses me the most about The Seventh Seal is that Bergman's startlingly bold symbolic choices don't result in this kind of excess. We see Death himself - playing chess with a doomed mortal, no less - and yet we (or I, at least) don't at all feel that Bergman has gone too far. The dialogue, even when it deals with such weighty topics as the existence of God, seems honest and natural. (The possible exception is Antonius's musing on how meaningful is his experience with Jof, Mia, and the bowl of strawberries.) Max von Sydow is perfect. He and Ekerot's performance in the confession scene magnificently complements Bergman's masterful dialogue and cinematography. The Seventh Seal unquestionably deserves its status as a masterpiece.</fullReview>

The cover of this movie has always caught my attention at the video store,,with that creepy old grim reaper in black and white.

		<fullReview>Only in such a film as this (and very few others), does the 'colors' of black, white and grey clearly define a whole spectrum of feelings.From the fact that Antonius's life end is approaching, from none other than the personification of it, to the life-happy travelling actors, all the thinkable archetypes is shown in great detail. But, as the only colors are the three mentioned, it all gets so much more precise. As the human faces, skies, and all things in between get 'cut-out' with hard precision. Bergman paints this canvas with a grey but lively brush. And comments on it through the actors with a low but powerful voice all the way to the end.Watch it, and wait for it to sneak into your senses.</fullReview>

After the movie was over I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. Its theme and idea paralleled a struggle in my own life. I love this movie. It is not just another flavor of the week I am praising. It has already joined my top 10. It is so good that I have managed to convince my girlfriend to watch it.

		<shortDescription>Metaphorically epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bergman's 1957 masterpiece, The Seventh Seal, is my second favorite film next to Citizen Kane. WOW! When I first saw the piece, I was amazed about how much one filmmaker could make his screenplay and his direction work like sex. The screenplay is dark, I mean, it only as a character called Death in it (literally, Death is death), and it displays the isolation of the Middle Ages just like Larry McMurtry's book, The Last Picture Show, describes the isolation of the 50's. So, how does the direction work? Well, it shows us how human beings cope with death. All the fears and all the hopes of death are dealt with through this fascinating work of genius. Now, don't use the comparison to McMurtry's book to an extreme. I mean, with the circus performers and musicians in this film, the characters are alot more cultural than the awfully horny teens in The Last Picture Show. The isolation is within. Take Jons, the knight, for example. He's trying to escape his own death, which is like escaping humanity. Sonny, from McMurtry's novel, is also trying to escape his life, which goes hand in hand with death. That's where the real epic is in this film, the coping with life and death. A character study at its finest. The direction is dynamic. There's a whole lot of still shots, but then there's a few scenes that are like a 50's style of the D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan. There's also alot of Hitchcockian zooms and pans and close-ups, especially the scene when Death confronts everyone in Jons' castle. Amazing stuff. This is the second greatest movie that I've ever seen and easily one of the most profound. I can't wait to see other works my Ingmar Bergman (especially Fannie and Alexander).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite foreign movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Foreign movies can be so cool. Being an 18-year-old film fanatic from America, and trying to rent the best imported movies from the local video store isn't as easy as I wished it would be. Not that foreign titles are hard to find, but you aren't always in the mood to read subtitles through-out a film, no matter how great it is (and I despise dubbing).Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL, a sweeping journey into the last days of Max von Sydow's crusader's life as he tries to find many answers before he is taken away by Death (Bengt Ekerot, in a magnificent performance). Among these questions is the reason behind God's rapidly migrating Black Plague throughout the country. Is it a punishment to the mortals, a comeuppance? von Sydow tries to prolong his life in the film's wittiest scene, by playing a game of chess with Death.The medieval landscape is a very romantic quality to this drama, though the dreaded undertones of seriousness keep your feet to the ground. You are always aware that death is around the corner, that the Plague is a serious issue, that people are looking into the skies for answers from a Creator who has supposedly cursed them.The film is shot entirely in black and white, which adds a little whimsy into the tale. Especially in the scenes of the beach (it is always interesting and surreal watching a knight admire waves which the viewer familiarizes with surfers and beach bunnies). There are some other cool allegory scenes like Death sawing a man down from a tree as the man tries to escape him. No matter how hard you try, you can never escape death. But the most magnificent scene is the end, where the troupe of passersby seek shelter in a castle and are approached by Death, who takes them to dance upon the hills. Finally, the Black Death has confronted our heroes, and the game of chess is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early masterpiece from one of the greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the most intelligent films ever made. The script is phenomenal and the cinematography is exquisite, as one would expect from Bergman. Max von Sydow is another plus for the movie. It is a tale of a knight and his squire, recently returned from the crusades. The knight discovers that Death has come for him, but challenges Death to a game of chess for his life. This game is then played intermittently as von Sydow and his squire walk their native land for what could prove to be the last time. In this film we are given a slice of life, a picture of the human condition. Von Sydow plays a man tortured by life, by man's ignorance and cruelty. He searches for reason and order and agonizingly finds only chaos and chance. Perhaps the highlight of the film is when he asks Death why, and Death responds that he is too simple to have a reason, stop searching for one. Things happen because they happen. It is interesting to draw parallels between that time and our time and see that we our struggling with these same timeless questions, and still getting no answers. If any answer is to be had from the film, it is that there is no greater plan, and we must take comfort from each other and make the mostof what we have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: The knight Antonius Block and his squire has just returned from the crusades. The country is ravaged by the black plague. And on the shore Antonius meets Death, in person. Death tells him his time is due, but Antonius challenges him to a chess game, during which he is permitted to live. He searches for an answer, he wants to know if there is a God, if there is a reason why. The question haunts him. But on his journey home he meets the actors Jof and Mia, and their little son Mikael. They offer him some wild strawberries and for a few moments he find respite and peace, and when Death threatens Jof, Mia and Mikael too, Antonius knows that his chess game is their only chance.Comments: A legendary movie from a legendary director. This is a movie that created the stereotype of Death that has inspired, been reused and spoofed countless times. This is a must see movie, one you should have seen at least once in life. So I decided to watch it, despite the fact that my previous impressions of the Bergman movies I've seen have been less than favorable.My impression of this can be summarized in one simple word; dramatic. The story plays out in the frontier between life and death, the dialog is dripping with fate, and the black and white is very black and white, the contrasts being very emphasized. It's on the brink of going over the top but manages somehow to stay on the right side of the line. Antonius Block's mindset of the haunting fear and angst is evident throughout every aspect of the movie.I'm not really sure of how I feel about it. The rating and praise from the critics seem to be too much for me. It's not that good. But it wasn't bad either. It was not very entertaining, but it was interesting. It was dramatic.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Medieval/Cold War allegory that asks all the right questions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just bought this film on DVD after having seen it for the first time many years ago at Berea College. (It was shown in a literature class called "Romance Through The Ages," and yeah, I was one of about two other guys in the whole class... I took it because the Tolkien literature class was full.) Having been forced to watch it, and fearing it would be pretentious art/crap, I was prepared for the worst and surprised by the very best. It's allegory readily translates to any era, and it's characters are at once both sympathetic and engaging. Bergman has Francis Ford Coppola's visual sense, (or vice versa... I've got my cart before my horse here!), and therefore, his movies are very artistic to watch. (I've often said I could turn off the sound on any given Coppola film and just LOOK at it... same goes for this movie.) Like most hapless folks of my generation, I was weaned on vapid hollywood tripe, testosterone engorged, brain-dead action and the usual bevy of unattractive splatter films. Imagine my surprise at realizing that not only could a movie be moving and intelligent, but it could be ART! What a treat! This film should be on the "must see" list of everyone who has a philosophical bent or who has ever questioned the current "conventional wisdom" about life, death and meaning. Thanks to this film, I've discovered other classic cinema greats like Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welle's, Stanley Kubrick... the list goes on and on. Movies are fine, but give your eyes and your brain something of substance and treat yourself to some real cinema every now and again. More directly portrayed cold war films which I heartily recommend are Dr. Strangelove, Failsafe, Seven Days In May, The Manchurian Candidate and The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hype behind this one is that it's one of the greatest ever. After having seen for the first time, I'm not so sure. I take films strictly on their own merits, not the vision of the director, what caused the actor to give emphasize a particular word in his climatic speech, etc; and based on that, The Seventh Seal falls a bit short. It's a decent movie, a good film, but one of the greatest ever? I'm not seeing it. Scenes involving the Death character were the hight point of the film, while the actors (all the little songs) and the blacksmith tended to drag along. And on a side note, what is it about Max Von Sydow? He appears to look 70 at the age of 28, but apparantly has held that appearance for 40 years. This is the fifth film I've seen him in, the others being The Exorcist (1973), Flash Gordon (1980), Needful Things (1993), &amp; Minority Report (2002), and he appears to have aged 8 1/2 years between the first and the last. He must be better at chess than we thought.</fullReview>

Every shot loaded with meaning and, surprising enough, humor. Not a moment of rest and I was left with the sensation I had missed half of its meaning. If it was a ping-pong game between Bergman and I, he'd have scored every point. I only hope some Hollywood producer never get to buy the rights.

		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal is a truly unique film. Few movies have successfully taken such a direct approach to the questions of life and death. Rather than subtly hide it in some other story, Bergman creates a character who openly wonders about these questions.A knight, Antonious Block (Max von Sydow) is returning to his native Sweden from the crusades. Finding his land in the midst of plague, and thinking about what he saw in the crusades, he begins to wonder about life, death, god, and so on. He meets death, who has come to take him. He challenges death to a game of chess - if he wins, he goes free, and if death wins, he takes him.Technically, this movie is magnificent. The lighting, the camera angles - everything is superb. It is a masterpiece simply as a period film. Everything from the sets to the costumes is top notch. The setting of the film - medieval Europe suffering from the plague - is well suited for to handle the themes portrayed in the film.Most of the film is symbolic and allegorical. It features little action, but rather contemplation and questioning. While it is not what I would describe as accessible, it is certainly more accessible and entertaining than most of its kind. Highly recommended for anybody who questions death and our existence, not for somebody who wants to see lots of blood and explosions.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SEVENTH SEAL (Ingmar Bergman - Sweden 1957).Max von Sydow is the weary knight Antonius Block returning from the crusades in plague-ridden Sweden. The knight's time to pass has come and "Death", a black-clothed figure, has come to collect him. Antonius delays his own demise by challenging "Death" for a game of chess , and over the next several hours, Antonius is confronted by some who are unconvinced of God's existence (a Knight's agnostic Squire, played by Gunnar Bjornstrand) and some who are (a wandering band of performers).The initial encounter with "Death" is still overwhelming, and when Antonius Block suggests a game of chess to "Death", he answers with a kind of wonderful understatement, I've never seen in any other film, 'Yes, I'm actually quite a skillful chess player.' This was instantly hailed as a masterpiece at the time and was perhaps one of the first true "art-films", but fifty years later I can only watch this film with a certain detachment. Its qualities and innovations in film-making are obvious. Bergman's gives us one breathtaking image after another and the acting is top-notch, but no matter how astounding some of the images in this film may be, this is very inaccessible material.Camera Obscura --- 7/10</fullReview>

If you've seen one Bergman film, you've seen them all. The poor man put a lot of effort into exploring life's BIG issues but never seemed to get any closer to an answer about any of them. As I've become a more sophisticated movie watcher, I find Bergman's style nearly intolerable. His films are airless and stifling, and hopelessly pretentious. It's been a long time since I've seen "The Seventh Seal," and maybe I would have a better opinion of it on a second viewing, but frankly, I would rather watch "Snakes on a Plane" than watch this film again.One of the famous images in this film is the shot of the Reaper leading a dance of death across a stark hillside.

		<fullReview>I like movies that engage the intellect, or those that have honest, persuasive emotional content. This movie does engage the intellect with its intertwined narratives and complex metaphors. I have no doubt that Bergman was totally honest in this act of catharsis, to purge his fear of Death. Yet, I'm left cold. The inspiration is Albertus Pictor's art, who Bergman casts here as a character. Medieval art is typified by certain characteristics (abandoned in the Renaissance): geometric shapes do not have a vanishing point; figures are depicted hierarchically in order of religious importance. If Bergman had played with these cinematic ideas, if he had relocated us in relation to the image, if he'd framed the actors hierarchically, he'd have done something for me. See Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" for a period example of how to align the subject with the visual narrative through perspective.Maybe my own 'perspective' is ruined. I can't look at this without immediately thinking of all the later borrowings I've seen...my personal favorite has nothing to do with movies...Seinfeld's "The Nose Job" episode (Jerry's penis vs. Jerry's brain in a chess match over whether to pursue or dump a physically attractive but vacuous actress).*Spoiler/PS*...My own interpretation is that Von Sydow and co. were dead all along, and were only returning to a haunted land...ideas later used in such pop examples as "Jacob's Ladder" and "Sixth Sense".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Existential angst from Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Existential angst from Bergman; and a somewhat entertaining story of a knight (Max von Sydow) and his servant returning from crusades. A story which doesn't advance much but merely serves as a medieval backdrop for the protagonist's spiritual journey - in this film Bergman asks if God exists.The film is supposed to take place in 14th century Sweden during bubonic plague (aka The Black Death), which fits the theme perfectly. However the costumes and props are rather low quality which doesn't make the film credible outside of its metaphysical introspection. Camera work is mediocre at best; the scenes consist mostly on static one camera shots focused on narrow view. The lack of production values is quite apparent while it was shot in one month, mostly inside a studio and with a budget of 150k dollars. In other words you can't make great panorama takes if there are only two medieval mock up shacks inside the studio...The story is somewhat entertaining, not as boring as I expected from essential art cinema. The dialogue is often intellectually interesting and some images are very artistic, mainly on the scenes where the protagonist struggles with theological issues. So those are strong points of the film: dialogue and occasionally impressive, haunting, images.On the meaning of grim reaper and chess, the talking point of the film... I wasn't quite convinced with grim reaper following Sydow's knight in first place - he seemed in perfect health to me, as did other characters. Yes, the knight had cheated death when returning alive from crusades but still. Perhaps the point was people seeking answer whether God exists from death while the grim reaper doesn't have the answer either. If this was the meaning then that would make it an atheistic film, or agnostic the very least. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Existentialism in The Seventh Seal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in "Existentialism is a Humanism." Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering "What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?," early in the film when he ponders "Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society." The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes "He if anyone" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that "In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering." In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must "limit" himself "to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will" and not that of others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's career of brooding cinematic successes was practically borne here, in an amazing study of Doomsday travelers in 14th century Sweden confronting their mortality. In the age of the Black Plague, the streets are filled with pagans, drunks, artisans, performers, religious zealots, and volunteer witch-burners; a knight and his squire, home from the Crusades, stop at the ocean, where a most benign Grim Reaper tells the knight he has been at his side for a long while. They engage in a winner-take-all game of chess, though the knight is just biding time to save the friends he has made from Death's clutches. The barbarism and cruelty aside, writer-director Bergman does show a streak of pithy black humor, resulting in some amazing sequences (such as the juggler cut down from a tree by Death and his scythe). The overlay of brutality in the name of Christianity, the torment of Faith, and the heavy symbolism are sometimes tough to wade through, though the metaphor of the chess game has left the picture open for parody, some of which has been very successful. Thus, "The Seventh Seal" is a film which must be seen by lovers of all genres, as it encompasses iconic imagery along with its themes of the eternal struggle. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considered Bergman's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an OK movie, if you ask me, but it is very overrated. I did not think it was as good as everybody says it is. I thought it was technically good, but the message was overdone. If you like Bergman, you will probably think this is his best. If you are not a major fan of his, then you will think it is dull and overdone. I thought the performances were very good, especially Von Sydow as the knight Antonius and Ekerot as Death. This is very symbolic (there is a family of actors where the husband's name is Joseph, the wife's Mary, but the son's name is Michael, which is strange). The cinematography and camera-work are extremely well done, but if you are a Christian, you will not like the overall message it sends.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things that separates a great artist from a lesser one is his ability to switch forms, themes, and the like, yet still imprint that unmistakable essence that lets a viewer know which artist they are dealing with immediately. Rarely has there been a greater and more vivid example of this reality than in comparing the two films Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman released in 1957: The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries.The first film, which is the subject of this essay, is stark, cosmic, spare, allegorical, and unremitting in its view of life, whereas Wild Strawberries is rich, personal, realistic (even if it uses symbolism), and open to several viable interpretations. Both films starred many of Bergman's 'stock actors from the 1950s: Max Von Sydow as Knight Antonius Block, Bibi Andersson as Mia, the wife of Jof the jester (and utterly gorgeous, as opposed to mere cuteness in Wild Strawberries), and Gunnar Björnstrand as Block's squire Jöns, a pragmatic Sancho Panza to Block's spiritual Don Quixote. While Björnstrand is nominally the third lead in the film, behind Sydow and Bengt Ekerot as the personification of Death, in truth he is the dominant lead character, with by far the most, and the best, lines of dialogue. And while this film is an allegory loaded with symbolism, it is also a very simple story of a middle 14th Century knight's return to Sweden from the Crusades of the Middle Ages?. The acting is uniformly excellent. Sydow is utterly transparent as Block. We see every cranny of doubt and belief written on his face. Poppe, as Jof, shows what Roberto Benigni might be like, if he had a dram of depth, Ekerot's Death is frightening only in his pomp and banality, but Björnstrand gives a truly great performance in the most difficult of the roles- treading between comedy and drama, realism and absurdism, as the squire who seems to be the wisest of all the characters. While this film was made at the height of the early Cold War, and many early reviewers took the Plague as an allegory for nuclear war, the film is far more than a simplistic political screed. At 96 minutes it also is not tool long that it batters the viewer with its message, nor too short that it slips quickly by. This film proves why black and white is still a vital tool in film-making. Had it been shot in color its dreamy quality would be rent, for shadows and depth are far easier to portray in black and white, and are far more suggestive of moodiness and inner turmoil. One problem is that the DVD version of the film I have, from The Criterion Collection, errs in allowing the black and white English words to be used, rather than colorizing them for clearer and speedier reading, thus detracting from the visual cornucopia on screen. This is why watching the film, a second time, with or without comments, is recommended, for many visual subtleties are revealed that are lost in a first viewing's necessity to read the dialogueAll in all, it's little wonder why speed-addicted, and Lowest Common Denominator afflicted American viewers have never taken to films like this, of such high quality. Yes, the writing is spare, but it is not meant to be realistic, and some of the imagery, and acting is straight out of silent German Expressionism, which only reinforces the revery-like feel of the film. And while Americans are noted for cherishing their dreams as hopes, how few ever recall their dreams as theater?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, dark but with a ray of hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)It really is impossible to consider an Ingmar Bergman movie without immediately running to an interpretation. At least for me that is the case. In particular The Seventh Seal seems to demand that we ask what was Bergman's intention. Was it to show that Christianity and superstition are brothers in arms? Was it to suggest a kind of fatalism that allows some to live and others to die without rhyme or reason? The story, set in the 14th century during the time of plague, concerns a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) and his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) lately returned to Sweden from the Crusades. Bergman combines realism with supernatural elements, such as the appearance of Death (Bengt Ekerot) with whom Antonius Block plays a game of chess, and the visions that the traveling troubadour, Jof (Nils Poppe) sees that nobody else can see including his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson). Block is haunted by death and has been assured that death is imminent, but hopes to put it off by beating Death at chess.Meanwhile the inhabitants are also in fear of death and seek to blame someone. They seize a young girl (Maud Hansson) and brand her a witch for consorting with the Evil One. They hold her in a pillory prior to burning her at the stake. Notice that instead of denying that she has been with the devil, she tells us that she reaches out and touches him everywhere. The only bright spot in the movie is the family of Jof, Mia and their infant son.Antonius Block goes to confession only to discover that the priest behind the window is none other than his adversary Death, to whom he inadvertently reveals his strategy in their game of chess. Block is searching for the meaning of life. He is trying to find God, whom he complains is always hiding. Instead he finds Death. Can they be one and the same? Jons is able and cynical and sees through humanity's many delusions. Jof plays at life and sings. Mia is filled with love for life. Guess who lives and who dies.But of course the plague was the great leveler. Persons of stations high and low were brought within its compass, but Bergman gets to pick and choose who shall live and who shall die.As usual with Bergman we have the most incredible study of human faces. I particularly liked the close ups of the women. The face of Gunnel Lindblom, who plays the young woman ("Girl" in the credits) that Jons saves from being raped, is particularly striking and intense. I recall her from The Virgin Spring (1960) in which she played Ingeri, the Odin-worshipping servant. The face of Bibi Andersson is a delight with her quick, pretty eyes and her engaging smile.But Bergman also concentrates on the faces of the bit players, in the mead hall and at the burning and as they watch the traveling players at their song and dance. With Bergman people are intensely real, up close and always personal. And he knows what they think and how they act. He shows us here, as he does in all his films, human hypocrisy and stupidity, human love and frailty. The landscape is bleak, the shadows are dark and life is harsh. Humans take their quick pleasures and then they die. That is the message I think that Bergman is sending to us.No student of film should miss this, one of the most talked about films ever made, and perhaps Bergman's first great work of art. He died only recently in 2007, not long after being voted (In Time Magazine, I think) as the greatest living director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman! Bergman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bergman along with Andrei Tarkovsky is among few selected directors who engage themselves and the audiences in the deeper search of the soul, meaning of life, being human, and truth and this all through the medium of films and which for them are extreme form of art. In Bergman's own words "No form of art goes beyond ordinary consciousness as film does, straight to our emotions, deep into the twilight room of the soul". Through his art he made many thought provoking movies and The Seventh Seal is one supreme example among others. It is a movie about a knight who plays chess with the death king in order to avoid his own death and win life instead. The setting is medieval Sweden hit by the severe plague. So the knight sees death all around him and takes into a journey with his squire Jöns to get answers about God and life. He comes across some people like circus group and finds out how they are dealing with death and life, and witch all of them helping him in some way in his quest. In some way he even helps some to survive the death over them. The dialog's in the movie are really good, thought provoking which engages us in our own journey for answers about god and life, if not for long at least for some duration after the movie ends. I like many dialog's but the one I really love is the one when Jöns tell at almost end of the movie and is "But feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive." Everything about the movie is very good be it acting, script, music, dialog's but Bergman's direction is astounding. This Bergman classic is a must watch for anyone wanting to enjoy art in its best form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disagreed with philosophy but deserves no less than 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal tackles death in a fashion which must have seemed horridly confrontational at the time but now seems too specifically Christian to me. The prince is gripped with existential angst about being unsure if he can meet God or Satan. In the world of the film, neither is there to comfort him; Death is the only sure thing. To some this may seem like a cause for despair, but to me it smacked of forcing the universe into small-minded Western forms. God, Satan, and Death are all names we have ascribed to the general metaphysical mish-mash; even the corpse they meet at the beginning of the movie is only "dead" insofar as it is clear from context that it was once a living being but is no more. When it becomes a fertilizer for the grass it will hardly be dead anymore. The judgments we make and feelings we attribute to these things are our own invention. If the prince were Buddhist he'd be handling this subject from quite a different approach.Nevertheless, the imagery of the film still earns it the title of masterpiece. The use of black and white is unlike anything else. A lesser artist would simply cover the screen in blackness when Death arrived on the scene. Bergman knows better how to make a contrast a contrast. Death, in his pitch-black cape, stands in the midst of physical scenery. His whitened face is genuinely spooky. The flagellants and monks are also portrayed with overwhelming boldness. The emotions of the characters are starkly real, very Swedish, and never trip up. The fact that I did not find the philosophy engaging will not stop me from recommending this movie to anyone who wants a chilling and powerful experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seventh Seal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers withinBergman made a movie about himself here, or about someone like him. A man with a very real fear of death who desperately seeks the truth ultimately surrender to the ignorance and sacrifices himself to save others. Although Bergman hasn't surrender himself - or perhaps he has, he obviously has a great fear of death. This stands clear when watching other of his films, 'Saraband' for example. To me it seems that this has been a subject of torture to him. In the film, Antonius makes us understand that he's been searching everywhere for the truth, but hasn't found it. A bitterness towards Christianity, religion and the society is portrayed. It seems as 'intelligents' are quick to answer as to why Christianity doesn't work, but they never dig into it, they never search for the source. This i found interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an historicist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot in the 'Seventh Seal' is very intemporal. As in many Bergman films the 'libretto' is psychologic and/or autobiographic. The medieval time ubication is (in my way of seeing it) more an excuse for expressing philosophical issues, than a reproduction of the times.Even the music in the film is not very faithful: the music outside the stage is used as an emotional highlight for the text, and -althrough inspired in medieval music- is based in a post-romantic musical language. The in-stage music is not medieval music, but is very efficient.The theatrical (yet not expressionist) acting and lighting are very efficient when dealing with this 'non historic-but psychological' plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, like many others, had heard the total praise heaped upon this movie from any and all sources, and finally, yesterday, I felt it high time I saw what it was all over.I was not disappointed. This is not only one of the best renditions of the Middle Ages I've ever seen on film, but also a sublime comment on the futility and folly of human endeavor, most of all the search for God. This search, ironically enough, can only be ended by surrender to that which we most fear -- Death. And death is not to be denied, no matter how good a chess player you are.Being myself a devoted atheist, this was one of the most personal films I've ever watched, and I'd recommend the same sublime experience to anyone. Even if you don't agree with the message, there's no denying the skill with which it's conveyed.</fullReview>

Arguably enough, this is considerably the Swedish director's most revered masterpiece. In it, Max Von Sydow (lightyears before appearing in summer blockbusters such as MINORITY REPORT) plays a knight just returning from the Crusades with his squire, only to be constantly dogged by Death itself. The Reaper challanges the knight to a game of chess. The stakes? The knight's life if he loses. As the game precides as the two travel along the country side, thenotion of death still lingers, eventually motivating the knight tosee the darkness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but no longer a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An earlier reviewer said that the film is inaccurate because crusaders were a feature of the 11th century, and the black death is a feature of the 14th century. The crusades to the Holy Land were mainly in the 11th century, although the so called "King Peters crusade" to Egypt took place in 1365. Throughout the 14th century though Scandinavian and German knights were crusading in the Baltic States against pagan slavs. (With the Livonian crusading order wiping out the state of Riga for example). The Black death caused a resurgence in crusading, and indeed in religious activity as a whole. Either way its irrelevant to your enjoyment of the film!I found this film dark and slow. I can understand why it was considered a masterpiece when it was first released, but it has been parodied so much that the "shock" value it must have once had is now largely lost.That said, it is still well worth watching provided you come to it with an open mind, and are not disappointed by seeing a good film rather than the masterpiece that you were led to expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting, Thought-Provoking Swedish Classic On Death, Life, Faith And Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In medieval times, a knight and his squire return from the crusades to a homeland filled with pestilence and suffering. Death appears, and the knight bargains with him for some more time to make sense of his life and his sorely tested faith in God. They play a game of chess, with his life as the stakes ?Perhaps Bergman's most famous film, Det Sjunde Inseglet is inaccurately thought of as a terminally gloomy and depressing piece, when in fact it seems to me to be quite a funny, almost life affirming film. It has some dreary moments (the flagellants' procession) and the central conflict between the pious Block and the atheistic Jöns is a little heavy going, but there are also many humorous observations and some outright comic scenes, like the one where Death cuts down the tree Skat is hiding in. As with all of Bergman's work, it deals with love, regret, relationships, a search for meaning and the absurdities of human nature. Each character is profound in its own way, such as the mute girl who can only summon the courage to speak when she knows her life is about to end. Björnstrand is terrific, as he is in so much of Bergman's work, and both Von Sydow (who was only in his mid-twenties) and Ekerot are hypnotically iconic, their chess game surely one of the most powerful and enduring visual metaphors in all of cinema. What impresses me most about the movie though is its seamless atmosphere. Much of it is cold and foreboding, but a lot of it is also sunlit and optimistic, such as the strawberry picnic scene. There are about fifteen main characters, each following a little plot thread of their own. It should all fall to bits and be disjointed, but it's not; under this gifted director's hand it all flows together beautifully, leaving a profound impression. This is one of those World Cinema classics which is essential viewing, and is never dull or a chore to sit through. Note the appearance of the medieval hymn Dies Irae, used to great gloomy effect in many fine movies (for example, Metropolis, Obsession, The Shining). The seven seals of the Bible appear in the Book of Revelations and generally symbolise the end of the world. A great movie and extremely influential (see Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life particularly). English title - The Seventh Seal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films that become legends. Few people see them, but many people know of them. The Seventh Seal is one of them. Full of images and iconography from medieval frescos, it tells the story of Knight and his squire returning from the crusades and their journey home across plague ridden medieval Sweden.However, death has come for the Knight, but is challenged to a game of chess.So gloomy and full of despair.....not!!! This is a movie full of life. Life is children, beautiful women, death, pain, evil, sex, singing, fear and so on.This not a movie about death, except to say, death is part of life. The knight has a desperate desire to beat death, but in truth he knows all he can buy is time. This is the great truth of life and of this movie. (Of course Bill and Ted beat death in Bill and Ted's bogus journey by challenging death to a game of twister, me I would go for Rock Scissors Paper).In modern terms it can be seen a good little movie, brilliant in its time, but perhaps nothing too special today. However, any wanna-be film maker must see this movie.</fullReview>

If we can still be playing this life game ,trying to get some meaning for our existence, we can cry on this movie. Ingmar shows us one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in arts, the full expression of feelings, and he shows us we can't try to find something we think will bring the meaning of our lives, who feel this meaning will feel it forever , who don't feel it , just can't feel it, and will be despaired by encountering death and will be despaired by encountering life too. We can't pretend we're happy, if we're happy, we're just happy and nothing more, there's no explanation for this, except one: Life is in the little things of our day by day...!

		<fullReview>This is a strange movie--period! However, it is also one of the most parodied films and for that reason alone it is worth seeing! Now, on to explain the part that is parodied: A man is returning from war in the time of the Reformation and the plague is about the countryside. The man meets the Angel of Death and is told it is him time to die. The man asks if he can first challenge him in a game of chess--if the man wins, then his life will be spared. The Grim Reaper, not wanting to be a spoilsport, agrees and they play a game that starts and stops again and again. This exact same contest has been used in Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, the cartoon series The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and an experimental film De Düva: The Dove (starring Madeline Kahn among others). In the Bill and Ted movie, they did not play chess but a series of games including Battleship and Twister! In The Dove, it was a badminton game! I can't remember what the game was in the cartoon series, but instead of their deaths, the children played the Grim Reaper over the soul of their pet hamster! Isn't is weird how this art film has appeared again and again and in the silliest of places! Give it a try to see the FIRST death-match and because it is a good film--with excellent performances all around--from Max Von Sydow to all the supporting players. Also, do not give up on the film too quick--I did and only saw it all years later when my sister-in-law convinced me to give it another try!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know about you but there are still several films that everyone and his Uncle Max seems to have seen but me. On the other hand I am gradually making headway via DVD, revivals, festivals, etc. Time was I felt deprived because I hadn't seen Citizen Kane, Casablanca, It's A Wonderful Life, The Wizard Of Oz, for God's sake but like I say they're all now safely under my belt and I feel the better for having caught up with them eventually. In the case of Bergman it's not just The Seventh Seal but practically everything he ever made that, for one reason or another, I haven't seen; in fact off the top of my head I can recall seeing only Smiles Of A Summer Night and Autumn Sonata. Nor, if I'm honest, have I made any great attempt to watch him, most of the films are now available on DVD but I'm not exactly breaking a leg rushing to Virgin, FNAC or HMV but now The Seventh Seal has just opened commercially in London so, along with 8 other people I checked it out, exactly 50 years after it was released. The first thing I noticed was that it's not quite as grim as I had supposed and nor is the celebrated chess game given that much screen time - from all I'd read over the years I'd imagined a fairly static movie with these two symbolic characters trading moves for 90 minutes. Taint, so, honey, taint so. Following some portentous music we find ourselves on a craggy beach where the knight, Antonius Block, is resting. Beside him on a piece of fairly flat rock a chess board has been set up. This is a pretty unrealistic image with which to kick off a non-comedy film because no normal person would set out a chessboard in such an inhospitable place where the more or less constant wind would scatter the pieces every which way in nothing flat. So now Bergman has to get us past this incongruity and I guess that having 'Death' appear in human form and accepting a challenge from Block - who can forestall his date with Death for the duration of the game and even cancel it altogether should he win - is as good a way as any. We then accompany Block and his squire as he returns home after ten years away from his wife - he's been to the Crusades if anybody asks you - which immediately reminds us of Agammemnon returning home to HIS wife after ten tough years in Troy and the Fall of the House of Atreus is as nought compared to the angst that visits Block. The images are striking at times, the acting is more than accomplished and in fact the only jarring note is just that, in fact not just one note but the several that make up the score which has a habit of SHOUTING at us when it wants to underline something instead of employing a more subtle approach. It's nice to be able to cross it off my list but I won't be breaking my neck to see it again and nor am I likely to buy the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my first Bergman, not my last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I feel self-deprived at having avoided (procrastinator that I am) Bergman films this long. Although not perfect, this work succeeds on multiple levels; I found the actors and their characters engaging, the cinematography stunning, the plot, the imagery, and the messages therein worthy of deep consideration. In sum, Bergman gives us a grand treatment of medieval life and existential philosophy. In the hands of a lesser director, the imagery could easily have degenerated into something overplayed and hokey. Instead, we have a subtle movie for the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far be from it for me to even think of trying to comment or judge this film, I can only say that it's one of the most incredible, awe-inspiring and mind-blowing experiences I have had. Like other films of Bergman that I have seen, this again is a reflection on death and its relevance to life. Taking the context of plague-ridden medieval Europe Bergman discusses various aspects of human existence - religion, happiness, faith, god - against the backdrop of omniscient death. There's really no point in trying to give you the plot summary and stuff like that because this is not about story or characters or drama, it's essentially an illustrative discussion of Bergman's existentialist philosophies and has to be actually seen and absorbed in toto tobe at all understood in the right perspective. Which is not to say that I claim to understand it completely (I could never feel confident enough to say that about such a magnificently erudite piece) but even the slight glimpses I get of superbly constructed theological questions that Bergman raises through his film are overwhelming enough for this sadly lesser mortal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seventh Seal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The iconic image from this film is Max Von Sydow playing chess against Death, or The Grim Reaper, it is spoofed in Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey, so I was most looking forward to seeing the whole thing, from director Ingmar Bergman (Smiles of a Summer Night, Persona). Basically knight Antonius Block (Sydow) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand) have returned home from the crusades, where the Black Death is spreading. Antonius comes face to face with Death (Bengt Ekerot), literally, who tells him his number is up, but the knight challenges the dark figure to a game of chess for his life. This game continues throughout the film as cultural turmoil ensues around Antonius, and there are quite a few dark references to the existence of God and the Devil, and the very essence of faith. Through the film, you see travelling actors doing some weird voodoo play looking as though their praising the Devil, a Witch (Maud Hansson) is burned alive, violence is used to stabilise order and a few other dark occurrences. But the dark stuff is balanced out by a few light hearted and spiritual events, you can see Jof / Joseph (Nils Poppe) and his young wife Mia / Mary - Jof's wife (Bibi Andersson) with their infant son Mikael are meant to represent the Holy family. As far as I remember, Antonius gives away his idea for a winning move, as he knows he is most likely to lose the chess game anyway, and I'm guessing he does. Also starring Anders Ek as The Monk and Erik Strandmark as Jonas Skat. Being a Swedish film, it wasn't easy to understand most of what was going on, but looking back I can understand the religious messages that director Bergman (father of Ingrid) was trying to get across, and it is a most watchable classic period drama. It was number 70 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrowing Question, Harrowing Answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>50 years have passed since Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal" was released to worldwide critical acclaim. And after 50 years of cinema; how many films have tried to put into debate these same questions that "The Seventh Seal" did before. Some of these films have succeeded , others have fallen on their faces flat. But "The Seventh Seal" has not aged or it's power diminished a single bit after half a century. So what differs "The Seventh Seal" from other films in the same category and importance, thus making it great? It lies with Ingmar Bergman. Our story is set in the Middle Ages when the Plague was ravaging across Europe. Two men lie in a beach, a knight and his squire (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstand), have just returned from the Crusades. They are scarred from the battles and the knight's faith fading. His search for meaning has not come up with an answer as he lies in doubt. Is there really an answer? While the throbbing of the beach waves subside and degrades into silence and Death (Beng Ekerot) is standing in front of the knight. "I've been at your side a long time?" remarks Death, as the knight, physically confident yet emotionally and spiritually deprived and frightened, tries to accept his fate. The two shall play a game of chess for the knight's soul. The game continues throughout the film.Bergman has a particularly great talent of representing the world and its characters. And no surprise, The Seventh Seal is filled with many major/minor characters. First of all, the acting troupe comprised of the pleasure-seeker Skat ; and the husband and wife Josef and Mia with their infant Michael. The latter two characters are keenly important to the world of this film; they provide warmth, sanctuary and grace, contrary to The Seventh Seal's cold story. The minor players include Plog , a blacksmith, his wife Lisa , Raval , a seminarist; who sent the knight and his squire to join the Crusades. Raval, a Bergman stereotype of man of God, who is deplorable to the world around him. Also, a witch is included to this big dramatis personae; she casts doubt and anguish to us and especially the knight. And, in my opinion, the most important minor character is the mute girl . She somehow ends up in every scene in The Seventh Seal after her entrance. She remains a big presence (ironically, a presence like Death). This ensemble gives the film a lot more than the original storyline: humor, gentleness, vulgarity and etc. Leaving The Seventh Seal creating its own dynamic setting which we are engulfed into.Going back, I suggested that Bergman has a definite answer to the subject of the film: the meaning of life; which has left many critics to many interpretations. But the answer is said plainly in the film; and tragically this response is somewhat fatalistic albeit pessimistic . Almost in a cruel way, Bergman burdens his answer throughout the film until the end. There is no room for sentimentality . Bergman's film and answer is cold, down-to-earth, and truthful . The Seventh Seal is Bergman's fatalistic , to-the-fact revelations hardlined by some of the most stark and beautiful images in the art of cinema. The best example of this is the scene which in the knight goes to church to confess; a hooded figure is standing waiting to receive the knight's anguish. With Gunnar Fischer's black-white, deep-focus cinematography, the knight's faith in God in balance, he pours out his entire soul to the hooded figure, perhaps, waiting for a response from God Himself. In agony, the knight goes as far as telling the figure about the game with Death . The hooded figure in curiosity asks how will he defeat Death. The knight, forthwithingly, tells his strategy. The hooded figure turns to the knight, he is in fact Death himself. No one is there to hear the knight's confession except nothingness, who is Death. From that point onwards, the knight is doomed, and the film has just passed its 25th minute. This is the beauty of the Bergman cinema, his images are as powerful as the story's theme, mostly about the absence of God. These scenes are Bergman masterstrokes, masterstrokes that are one of the most poignant and poetic in the history of cinema, to depict his fatalistic ideals . These scenes of gloom n' doom like the one mentioned lets the audience carry the film's burden even further. But the knight's quest for the meaning of life has not yet been extinguished. Then... he meets a witch about to be burned at the stake, and the knight ironically questions this Devil's servant about the knowledge of God. She tells him to look into her eyes... the knight sees nothing but terror. The witch goes into bragging about her relationship with the Devil, the knight looks down disheartened. As the witch is being burned at the stake, her eyes, the eyes of terror, open up as she fears for her life and with this sight the knight has given up his quest. It turns out the witch was looking at Death. The knight has come to his second dead end, he has tried to talk to God about his search, instead, Death is the one who answers him. Here, the knight tries to talk to Satan but to no avail. Only Death answers yet again this time through the dying witch. It seems Death is the only supernatural force in this world. From the march of the flagellant to the death of one of the minor characters, this scenes of immense poignancy and the meaningless is what makes up the bulk of The Seventh Seal and Bergman's worldy answer. But what about Death, does he know about any saviors? Like a cruel punchline, Death remains ambiguous to us. He remarks, "I am unknowing".</fullReview>

Perhaps a film about a man avoiding taxes would have been more amusing. This film is episodic rather than having a narrative flow. It seems Bergman made a checklist of all the important themes and made sure he touched each one: love, marriage, infidelity, family, society, crime, punishment, and, of course, god and death. It is populated with Bergman regulars, including von Sydow as a knight who spews platitudes every time he opens his mouth. The cinematography is impressive. Otherwise, it's tough going for those who are not Bible scholars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mostly I use IMDb reviews to decide whether to rent a film, so I feel philosophically that a rating and a review should reflect how the film does in the context of the modern day.So with that caveat, the look &amp; feel of this film -- which is grainy and black &amp; white -- can't earn more than a 5 out of 10, which is my rating.To be fair, I'm an action movie guy. I don't have the sophistication or film school background to be able to enjoy the makeup or sets if the plot and characters are awful. But I do enjoy an intelligent film, and (with the proper mindset that I was viewing a very old film), I found the Seven Seals quite accessible and powerful.Which is to say that it wasn't very, but I can see how when it came out it must have been a wild sensation. It's original, has something real to say about life. If you're going to watch one of the old classics, and want to know where that scene with Death comes from in "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure", you should be able to get through this film.Who should see this film:-- art buffs &amp; drama fans with a flair for classics: a must-see-- regular people like me who can see watching a film like this sort-of like visiting Taiwan or South Africa. Fascinating place, not my kind of thing and wouldn't want to live there, but glad I had the cultural experience.I'll give The Seventh Seal a showing its age but still packs a punch 5 out of 10. And if you ever get a chance to see the short film "The Dove" (1968) that parodies this film -- it is totally hilarious and worth every effort to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's Best ...But Very Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently returning to his beloved Sweden after participating in The Crusades, young Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, DUNE) finds himself on the beaches of his country, not really safe and not very sound. Death (Bengt Ekerot) follows him and tells Antonius that his time is up. Not willing to go until he finds out the truth about the afterlife, Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess. And it's a winner take all game (life and death).The game takes a few days to play, and as Antonius travels with his trusty squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) they encounter other wayward souls looking for life's meaning. Most notable among these is a band of traveling actors; a man named Jof (Nils Popppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their infant child (thinks Joseph, Mary, and Jesus and you'll be right on target). Jof is a juggler, but also a visionist. He can see strange things, and although this is made slight of during the early portions of the film, it is later a pivotal catalyst to the entire movie's machinations.Antonius and his band of vagabonds drift through Sweden as The Black Death sweeps across the nation. Death is very busy, thus giving Antonius more time to make it home to his wife (whom he hasn't seen in years).But once home, Death catches up with Antonius, and he has to come to terms with the afterlife, whether he wants to or not. When Death knocks at the home of Antonius Block, everyone inside has to decide what awaits them on "the other side". Antonius prays for enlightenment about God (if there is one) and hopes to receive a sign (which never really comes).In the end, his efforts at delaying Death help Jof, Mia and their infant child escape the unknown of the hereafter, thus giving a sense of meaning to Antonius' life.It is noteworthy to mention that this movie has a seriously stilted screenplay. The actors' lines often seem strange and even out of place, making the viewer shrug in a mind-boggling way. Anybody who's seen an Ingmar Bergman film probably won't be bothered by this, but it is something to definitely prepare yourself for if you haven't.Often heralded as one of Bergman's best films, it certainly was ...up to that point.Being severely dated by today's film standards, the low budget is achingly present but not overly intrusive. The sets, make-up and acting are all well-played. But the biggest star is the lighting and camera angles. Careful use of light and shadow gives a terrible sense of foreboding with a minimal soundtrack. The perching of cameras in trees and on odd angles gives the film its own original look, honoring this film with several award wins (including the Cannes Film Festival's Special Jury Prize ...actually it was a tie that year but we won't go there).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows the society of the Middle Ages in a very exact way. However, I must say that there's a completely forgivably inaccuracy. Bergman mixed up two different centuries: the 11th and the 14th. The 11th century was the time of the Crusades impelled by Urban I; so the knight that comes back from the Crusades can only be placed in the 11th. And the 14th was the century of the plagues in Europe, the plagues that scares so much everybody in the story. Obviously, this is not a mistake; creators can adapt some parts of history because they have a superior artistic mission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has not aged well, doesn't look remotely medieval. It looks like a low-budget production in modern Sweden, which of course it is, but it shouldn't *look* like it. All the actors are perfectly clean with (especially the women) lots of makeup, flawless faces and teeth, perfectly coiffed hair, plucked eyebrows (only the women); the clothing includes 20th-century halter tops. The pigs and chickens are obviously 20th-century breeds. The musical instruments are ridiculous.There's too much of this stuff; it's very distracting. And there are other things that are merely poorly thought out. Why are the horses drinking salt water at the beginning of the film? Why is Jof having trouble juggling with two balls? How do the tavern customers manage to drink out of empty cups (the cups are cracked all the way through, so must be empty)? One commentator here suggested that the story isn't supposed to be literal, that the Knight might be dead at the beginning. Some parts are obviously allegorical - playing chess with Death - and the movie works better if the entire thing is view as an allegory or a fantasy or a hallucination. But it can't be a medieval fantasy; the most charitable explanation is that it's the ravings of a modern (and possibly dying) "knight" (whatever that means) about a Middle Ages that never existed outside the movies. A less charitable explanation is that the film was made too cheaply and quickly to make any visual sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The idea remained abstract</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the plot of The Seventh Seal years years before, I sured that when I get a chance to watch it, I would be definitely impressed. The idea of playing chess with death is very inventive, brilliant, but if you put it in a good story. Ingmar Bergman was the best director to do that in the best way, but this time, impossible to accept, he could not turn the idea to good account. The movie's content is not about playing chess with death, this is very important. This is just a sub story. Yes, the film is not about the fellowship of two chess players anyway, but when I read the man who plays chess with death, I supposed that the story would be like: one day, a crusader encounters death. Death requires a chess game, if the man wins, he is set free, if the death does, the man dies. The chess game continues for months and till the game ends, his questions about life, death and God are answered. In the end, the man loses. The whole movie focuses on this deadly chess game with certain intervals. In these intervals, you also can show us the villagers who are suffered from plague. It might sound weird, but this had been my expectation. After the first thirty minutes, the story is scattered, collapsed, then we loose our attention, because the movie changes its route. As a result of this, the potential of the story gets out of hand. We are forced to forget the crusader, the crusader's situation. Bergman is not interested in this character enough and also the chess game that seems the heart of the movie, but it is not and it should have been. The chess game cannot be named as a metaphor, because, this is not the point, thus the image which the man who plays chess with death exists as just an image. The crowd make a celebration, they start to sing a song, there is a husband and wife, I mean we see pictures desultory from each other. Those pictures are like theater, but in contrast, not dramatic, not impressive at all. This is the story of 'black death' more, not death. As for direction, only one sentence can summarize the film: the way of storytelling is not powerful. By the way, the crusader encounters the death and the death says I am death, look at the reaction of him; nothing. He is like OK, what's that to me? Sorry, but the name of this is not art. It is stressed that he is a nihilist? However, it looks unconvincing at the end. This is not so important, but this scene deserves to be dramatic. I watched The Virgin Spring and Smultronstallet after The Seventh Seal in order to rehabilitate and I did. Lastly, almost everyone writes the same thing: the film questionnaires the meaning of life, death, faith and the existence of God. Some films have a repetitious sentence and The Seventh Seal's sentence is this. Another commonly used word for the film is symbolism. I cannot give a movie 10 out of 10 owing to only its symbols and themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's use of theatricality shoots himself in the foot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could have been the best movie of the 1950s is mitigated by not sticking with what it did right. Bergman could have documented the effects of the plague on citizenry of Sweden with a harsher, more real tone and had the religious issues be discussed, but instead he reversed that, and a much weaker movie is the result. (The hideous plague is simply not established strongly enough: one corpse, while a nice quick scare, doesn't establish enough since so many other people just seem to go about their business fine, never mind that roughly one fourth of them are supposed to be dying) The extremely moody opening: waves, rocky beaches, barren, a a knight drained of strength sprawled on the beach, a great attention grabber. And then, the appearance of a dark caped, white faced man, and BANG, the movie hits a huge snag.This death character, which seems to be the most memorable aspect to the movie for most, is a grave blunder. He might resemble some folkish rendition from Swedish tales and icons, but that doesn't make him totally wrongheaded. His face makes him far too human, and too obviously an actor walking around. Concealing his face, if nothing else, until the very end to show that perhaps death is not a thing to fear, works much better, and embarrassingly, the Monty Python Meaning Of Life presents a much more interesting rendition of him, and it's their worst movie. YThis character is also far too clean: death is decay, the rot, often very slow: he shouldn't look like he just took his rob from the store this morning.Also a great problem is the fact that this totally wipes out any ambiguity: death is revealed to be a force that actually takes you somewhere, hitting the audience on the head that there is some aftrelife, as opposed to just a body that doesn't function and decomposes.A voice or a similar device would have served such purpose, since it might potentially just be the Knight's own cynicism working against him.Then the knight and Death begin playing chess. Even if you don't count the fact that Death said five seconds before they start playing that he grants no reprieves, this is a transparent McGovern, just a way for us to know that this movie has a structure and is going somewhere.More problems spring up as more characters make their way into the movie. There's the Knight's Sancho-type assistant, whose character simply isn't as interesting as Von Sydow. We get a travelling troupe, who are supposedly very important because of their biblical names, but frankly, do little more than stop the movie for a painful, irritating performance which is then paralleled with a bunch of wandering, chanting Christians in a scene so staged and pompous it seems to be begging for you to be glib about it. There's Odious comic relief in the shape of a woodsman and his cheating wife, which just goes to show, as good as Bergman is, the man is not capable of putting comedy on screen.There is one subplot that struck me as really powerful: the girl said to be a witch who will be executed. Here is more of Bergman showing the skill that he is so famed of: we (well, certainly I) pitied the girl, and the fact the Knight doesn't seem interested in her except as someone to ask questions makes him seem more like a cold, layered human than just a whining agnostic. She is the only one who doom is believably hanging over her head.If only Bergmna had made more of the movie in this vein....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny when it tries to be serious and vice versa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My problem with seeing this movie is that I saw all the parodies first. It's hard to watch those scenes involving Death without half-expecting Woody Allen, French and Saunders or the Monty Python boys to pop up and start wisecracking. It's not hard however to see why this film has been parodied so many times: it's completely ridiculous! It consists of a series of pretentious allegorical scenes, laden with ponderous and overwrought dialogue ('I want to confess as best I can, but my heart is void. The void is a mirror. I see my face and feel loathing and horror...'), all about Life, the Universe and Everything (forty-two, Ingmar, forty-two!!!), alternated with 'comic relief' that is desperately unfunny. The seduction of the actor for instance looks like a reject from a Carry On-sexcomedy. The only thing I liked was Gunnar Björnstrand's deadpan performance as the knight's squire, who comes up with the movie's most profound truth:- What are you painting?- The Dance of Death- Why?- To remind people they must die.- Won't cheer them up.*1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well.... its OK.. Quite unique and deep. It has a meaning somewhere if you look really hard....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman is HIGHLY overrated!!! Sure it has its highlights. Like when Death kills the actor in the tree by sawing it down... Yea... why kill them in the end!? Only Ingmar knows that one. Maybe! In his movies you can watch a woman stand and stare into the camera for one minute!! THATS A BOOK!!!! He make the plot out of the characters thoughts... that is not right for a movie. I have to watch his movies at least 5 times to make sense out of the thinking, metaphorical mess.. He think his stories are 10 times more interesting than they are. And i certainly don't get the quote: "Are you ready?" "My body is frighten. Not I" THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION YOU .... (Dont know what it is in the English version so i translated it myself..) It says a lot about Bergman himself, though. And thats interesting. He admitted that he made this movie to help with his death-thoughts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iggy Does His Little Dance in Hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat through three other films by Ingmar Bergman: the girl in The Virgin Spring was a spoiled brat; the old man in Wild Strawberries was a whiny fart; the adults in Fanny and Alexander were selfish a**holes! Yet the critics' were beside themselves, Bergman had so defty tapped into their egos. Hence, every time Iggy took a dump, the critics raved like a bunch of Pavolvian dogs!So when Death, looking like a Marilyn Manson fan, makes his grand entrance, I wasn't expecting any profound insights from Iggy, and I wasn't disappointed:Block: Who are you?Death: I am Death. (duh!)Despite his claim that he is "quite skillful" at chess, The Grim Reaper blows chunks. "Beating" Block centuries before "The Mad Queen"? LOL! And his "I'm just doing my job" shtick when asked about the Divine was a total cop-out! When Block didn't bitch-slap Grimmy and give him a weegie, I knew I was in for a long night!The confession scene was a hoot! Block whines about how God doesn't answer him, wishes he could purge Him from his heart. Now you know the "monk" is Death, but because Iggy isn't half the filmmaker he thinks he is, he lets us in on it before Block (who's a few fries short of a Happy Meal to begin with) realizes whom he just blabbed his "brilliant" chess strategy to!If Block not trying to save the girl was supposed to get us to relate to his world-weariness, sorry, all it did was make me lose all empathy for him. Block's filthy, God-hating sidekick is the real hero of this opus. In his one act of heroism (unintenional, I'm sure), he saves a girl from the man who talked Block into going on the Crusades (huh?), then tells her that she better come with him because he hopes his wife is dead by now and he could have just raped her! How sweet!Jof was just weird, and not because he has a vision of Mary teaching her Baby how to walk. He's a juggler, but can't keep two balls in the air? All I kept think was how did a dolt like that land a hot babe like Mia?Dentistry back then was non-existent, yet the peasants have perfectly pearly choppers. The girls' faces are scrubbed clean, and have no unsightly body hair! And shouldn't the horses be sick from drinking sea water? But I digress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must certainly be the most overrated movie of all time. Practically everybody I meet who is anxious about conveying an image of themselves as culturally minded, praise this movie, but gives few reasons why. The fact is, this movie is much too long, and could have been a much better product had it been condensed to around 3 minutes. It could then contain the shots the self-proclaimed "cultural elite" talk so much about: The beach in the beginning; the introduction of Mr Death; the game of chess between Block and him.One could make it even more appealing by converting it into a music video. One would have people in traditional Swedish clothes playing folk music at the summer solstice celebration(midsommar in Swedish), while Mr Death chases Block around the midsommarst?ng, in the end catching up with him.The great problem with this movie, is that there is hardly anything interesting in it. There's only a number of long, meaningless dialogues without any real connecting story. My version would at least not cause you to fall asleep.Even though I'm an educated person, having read among other classical works the Bible, John Milton's "Paradise lost" and "Paradise regained", I only find this movie pseudo-cultural boredom. Don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm simply too stupid to "get it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly love black and white films and this is certainly one of the best. One of the best looking, that is. Yeah, lots of really cool looking images but they just don't add up to anything. "The Seventh Seal" is the very definition of what's known today as "Independent Film". It looks good enough that people believe that there just has to be some substance floating around in there somewhere, but I'll be darned if I'll ever be able to point any of it out. Because of Bergman's recent death, I once again had a chance to see it on TCM. And once again I barely made it past the "famous" opening scene with Death playing chess on the beach. I finally do have one thing figured out though. The opening scene is the best known scene from the film because hardly anyone can get beyond it. Oh sure, the Black Leather Art Crowd will tell you they watched the whole film, but don't believe it. They watch that stupid Death plays chess on the beach scene, rate the film a "10" and then post a glowing review here on IMDb to prove they know art when they see it! When it comes to Bergman films though, I'm simply too stupid to "get" them. So please don't flame me for my obviously ignorant opinion. After all, my misguided views DO give the whole artsy black leather wearing community someone to shake their collective heads at while muttering "He just DOESN'T get it!" BTW, there's a great parody of the chess scene in "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey" with Death challenging the boys to a game of Battleship. Very funny indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a load of Richard Gough!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching this film. Well, finished watching what I can remember of this complete and utter pretentious pile of twaddle. If you want to be bored to sleep, and I certainly was, then i recommend this film. Maybe your kids are crying and you're starting to fizz a bit. Well, pop on this bad boy and they'll be out before you can, 'Black Plague'. If you want some real entertainment, why not rent Eddie Murphy's 'Boomerang' from your local library. At least you'll get a laugh and your mates won't fall asleep at your terrible choice of film. I nearly cracked my back after I woke up during this film. it's the kind of film you put on to impress a foreign lady and then both of you get drunk and realise it's just philosophising for the sake of it. I did not feel better after this film and it has kind of put me off chess as well, and any film that can do that is pretty much a no-brainer. Avoid, like the Black Plague. That's unless death wheels up to offer you a game of chess. Also, death looks too much like 'Robocop' with his mask off for me to take this film seriously. If you watch it, then enjoy your sleep. If you don't watch it? Enjoy any Eddie Murphy film you've wisely chosen instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8.4/10! That is Crazy,this Movie IS NOT ALL THAT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got this from my library and just watched it last night. After reading the reviews full of praises for it,I am disappointed! It is only a "so-so" movie in my opinion,certainly nothing great or even "special" in my opinion.(((( Spoiler Ahead)))) Especially a let down is the fact that the knight never does get the satisfaction of discovering the answers to his questions about God! Very disappointing ending,as well.I sure don't see what all the praise is about!I most certainly would not pay over $6 for this! It is not a movie I even have any interest in adding to my collection. If you have a good library,or can get it through an inter-library loan system,take my advice and satisfy your curiosity that way. I am so glad that I did not waste my money buying this. It did not impress me in any way. I only gave it the 3 rating,because it is "different".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oh, the horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i watched this with high expectations years back since it was rated incredibly high(above 8.5 i think). but it turned out to be crazy boring. BORING, LET ME SAY IT ONCE MORE B-O-R-I-N-G. oh my gosh, this movie was so boring i was stunned, i mean, oh my gosh. OK so there was a plague in Europe in ancient times, what of it? it's like the director is an opera director and is having trouble adapting the thing on film, hello, you're suppose to make the film interesting and emotional. horrible horrible. i get it, people are falling like flies during the black plague, is there anything else you want to show? death? a guy with a black robe? DON'T WATCH THIS, PLEASE DON'T. horrible! nothing happens, absolutely nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Favorite Of The Pseudo-Intellectuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just laugh out loud when I read national critics gushing over Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman and his films, particularly this one which they love to label "his greatest work." Do you know why? It's because Bergman liked to show God and Bible believers in a negative light. Since almost all critics are Liberals, they love this kind of thought so, like Martin Scorcese, he can do no wrong. It's as simple as that.Basically, this story is nothing but one man's diatribe against faith, and why the man lost it. He lost it - get this - because God didn't audibly answer his prayers. Since he didn't hear a booming voice from a burning bush answering his prayers then, he surmises, there must be no God. Unbelievable. Anyway, all of this sounds good to atheist/agnostic film critics. However, I believe Bergman might have been more of a believer than he let on because God was a topic in a number of his films. At least, he was wrestling about His existence, and that's not unusual. Too bad that in none of his films does he come up with a pro-God answer.Even if all the "religious" talks means nothing to you, I think most people would find this film way too boring so the entertainment value is not going to be there. For honest questioners of Faith and those who would find the visuals and direction intriguing, I have no problem with it. I just think it's overrated because of the reasons I stated above, and the fact it IS a boring movie with unappealing characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God!I watched this movie a few days ago and I think this is the worth movie I've ever seen. I can't believe that someone gave a 10 to this S*it! Awful! And I can't believe that only 883 people gave 1. In my opinion everyone have to give a 1 to this film. Here is my list about the movie:Actors: Not bad! 10/7 Story: Play chess with the death?? I'm notstupid 10/3 The best scene of the film: the end credits--I was so happywhen it's ended.I hope that I will never again see a movie (Is that a movie? I think that's more like s*it)like this. And finally here is a little joke for you: -Where do horses live? -In neigh-borhoods</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, depressing, and irreverent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film I thought, given the praises it has received, the entire production might have been out of my league intellectually --still a possibility. But even those with highly developed intellects have to examine and observe what they have been presented with in order to form opinions and draw conclusions; and, since I really didn't get much out of it the first time, I would have to watch it again. And this is not a film I would watch twice, nor wish to discuss at any length, since I don't feel my life will be enriched by understanding it better. I found it irreligious. I found it to bear a very heavy one-sided agenda. And, now that it's behind me, I don't care to look back.Had Bergman not proven himself already before writing and directing this dark tale, I seriously doubt anyone would have been knocking his door down to produce it. Unlike what many others say, I also found the cinematography lacking, the score at best forgetable, and the lighting as amateurish as a home movie.Let me add that I have great faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ, so that definitely affected the way I reacted to this movie. I wish I could understand fully those who do not believe or have faith; but, regardless, what I can say to them is, unless you consider yourself a true intellectual, I would recommend other ways to explore the meaning of life since this film definitely doesn't reach the heights it aims to reach. And, if you want to see a beautiful movie written by Bergman, see Best Intentions, a fine film about his parents and their life before he was born.</fullReview>
