		<shortDescription>can you believe Leo is not brain damaged?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many have said, the first time I saw this slice of "unusual" life film, I was certain that the actor playing Arnie was mentally handicapped. This was the performance to end all. I have been around mentally challenged people who were the carbon copy of the character that Leonardo portrayed. I do no think that anyone else could have pulled this off without looking ridiculous. Our protagonist, Mr. Johnny Depp did his usual amazing work, but it is the performance by Leo that makes this film a must see. I just saw it again tonight, and was blown away again. Acting schools must have copies of this in their files!! Will always be a Leo fan for this one film alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that will never age and you will always have a place for in your heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of those little treasures that for the most part most people do know about, mainly due to Leonardo DiCaprio's knock out performance as Arnie Grape. But both he and Johnny had this great chemistry together that made what could have been a very boring movie into an extremely touching piece of film that meant more and more to me as I grew up. When I was a kid and watched this film, I just loved laughing at all of Arnie's jokes not realizing why he was so silly. As a teenager I could start to relate to having a little more pressure with a job and school. Then as an adult and having my mother become ill, I could relate completely to Gilbert in his frustrations of just wanting to be young and enjoy his life. I think that's why this film is special to a lot of people, those who have felt the added little pressures in life and makes you think on what's eating at you? This is the story of Gilbert Grape.In the small town of Endora, Gilbert Grape is busy caring for his mentally handicapped brother, Arnie. His morbidly obese mother, Bonnie has done little except eat since her husband died, and longs only to see Arnie live to the age of 18. With Bonnie unable to care for her children on her own, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and looking after Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the town water tower, while his sisters Amy and Ellen do the rest. The relationship between the brothers is of both care and protection, as Gilbert continually enforces the 'nobody touches Arnie' policy. A new "Foodland" supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery where Gilbert works. In addition, Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman, Betty Carver. The family is looking forward to Arnie's 18th birthday. A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when their car breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their possible romance. His affair with Mrs Carver ends when she leaves town in search of a new life following her husbands death,. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie and as she talks to Gilbert she begins to unlock some buried hopes, dreams and happiness. Later on, Arnie tries to run away yet again from his bath and in his frustration Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert takes the car and runs out without another word, fearing that he is leaving his family just like his father and brother did.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is just an incredibly beautiful and touching movie that will always have a special place in my heart. It makes you laugh, cry, and think about how precious life is. All the characters are relatable or likable in some way. Even in the smallest of all towns where it seems like it's just dead, there is life. That's what this movie is about to me, everyone has a story and everyone has an experience to share. This is just a terrific film, quality acting and a heart felt story, I very much recommend that if you get the chance to watch it. If anything for Leonardo DiCaprio's incredible performance and Johnny Depp singing to him "Match in the gas tank, boom boom!".10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Remarkable Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is marvelous. Focusing on the angst of an unwanted small-town life, the film follows the daily life of Johnny Depp's Gilbert Grape. He is sarcastic yet introverted, protective yet shy. His mentally-challenged brother, Leonardo Dicaprio's Arnie, steals the heart and full attention of the audience. His depiction of a teenager trapped in the inescapable bind of mental retardation is moving and real, deserving of the 1993 Oscar Award Nomination.Darlene Cates, who plays Momma, delivers a truly remarkable performance. Her display of motherly devotion, emotional turmoil and daily physical struggle are deserving of grand recognition.Gilbert's life is turned around by the unexpected introduction of Juliette Lewis's Becky. Becky's free-spirited and optimistic take on life greatly influence's Gilbert's own life. WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is deeply tragic yet deeply real tale of a complicated family stuck in a simple town. The performances of Johnny Depp, Leonardo Dicaprio, Darlene Cates and Juliette Lewis are unmatched and truly wonderful. It is a film woven together with comedy, drama, love and everyday emotion, perfected with beautiful cinematography and superb directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out slow, but after we get to know the characters and their (dis)abilities, we begin to place ourselves in their shoes and the action picks up. Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance ever, this movie is a true drama. The focus of the movie is of course Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp). However, there are really several focal points in the movie, all of which add to a powerful storyline. As the title of the film suggests, just about everything seems to be a hardship for Gilbert, yet, somehow he manages to come to terms with reality and in the end obtains a newfound respect for life.With good performances by supporting actors and actresses (Juliette Lewis, Darlene Cates, Leo D., and all the other "Grapes") and a nice comic relief from the city coroner (Bobby McBurney) and the local handyman (John C. Reilly), this movie should be seen by anyone who wishes to put themselves in a place where country roads and beautiful greenery give way to the perils and pitfalls of smalltown life.Overall great acting, a good story, and something with which we can all relate. "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is an excellent movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knocked me over!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the delights of having raised a family and having more time to yourself s that you get to go back and watch all the movies you missed. I am just now getting to explore the actors whose careers have been postponed, in our lives, by Ninja Turtles and Disney. I fell in lust with Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean and he made me a real fan in Finding Neverland. But in Gilbert Grape, he won my heart completely. This man can act with his eyes. The biggest surprise was Leo DiCaprio as Arnie. Amazing, and he was only 19 when the film was released. He gave an amazing portrayal of a boy who goes in and out of his own world. Juliette Lewis was a quiet storm in this film; she gave Gilbert an anchor of solid acceptance when the pain of his life almost got the best of him. The casting worked perfectly to create family dynamics that were so very real that they did not even seem brandable as dysfunctional. I appreciated that the mother was never portrayed as less intelligent simply because she was overweight. I loved that the kids did everything they could to protect their mother and their disturbed brother from outside influences and hurt feelings. They stuck together until the end which actually became the beginning. A hopeful and joyous film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a story about a dysfunctional family and how love conquered it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the best I've ever seen. However, as I was once Gilbert, I found little to no comedy. I found the movie to be an excellent portrayal of a torn young man, trying to cope with the hand that had been dealt him. Gilbert was torn between the love for his mother and his anger with her at her condition. He was upset over having to sacrifice what he felt was his own life and goals to care for a family who could not care for themselves. In the end, Gilbert was smarter and more mature than your average kid entering the world as a new adult. And his mother's death taught him that it is okay to be angry about the situation, as long as you learn from it and don't wallow in the self-pity.I read a review from a person that said that there wasn't a plot to this story. I must disagree. There was a strong plot about family love, anger, honor (all the usual family matters, more visible in a dysfunctional family) and a subplot of rebellion. This movie made me cry when others were laughing. This movie was about my childhood. Loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grateful for Gibert Grape!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remarkable film that once viewed, will leave an indelible impression on your heart, your mind, your spirit. Set in a run down, going nowhere town, amidst a population of largely rundown, going nowhere people, Gilbert Grape takes us on a journey through the everyday life of one family in which each member is struggling to find his identity. Johnny Depp as Gilbert is at his finest, sensitive and lovingly protective of his mentally challenged younger brother, Arnie, less understanding of the plight of his grossly overweight mother played brilliantly by Darlene Cates. Gilbert just wants a normal life, a life he seems resigned to being deprived of. He seeks solace in the attentions of a wandering housewife played by Mary Steenburgen. Enter Juliette Lewis as Becky, who captures his heart, personifying all the passion for life and freedom of spirit Gilbert aspires to. There are many memorable moments in this film, moments you cannot forget, but suffice it to say, What's Eating Gilbert Grape will leave you feeling grateful for everything you ever took for granted, especially those you love!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well-done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I wouldn't like this. I decided to see it because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp who appeared in some of my favorite movies [ Edward Scissorhands, Benny and Joon, etc. ] I knew what the plot was: a guy who lives with his 15 year old sister, his 18 year old mentally disabled brother who could die at any time and his morbidly obese mother always has to do everything for his family and something happens that changes his life. It sounded like it was a typical sappy drama. I usually hate dramas like that. Movies in which the only point is to feel bad for the characters. But this one was quite different. The plot in this movie is unclear, which makes it appealing in my opinion. There isn't a lot of events in the movie, really. It all revolves around Arnie's birthday and Gilbert's meeting with the new girl. The movie is very slow paced and doesn't rely on action and shock to catch his viewer's attentions. It's moving, but the dialogues are also very simple. You might expect this movie to be over-dramatic but it's everything but that. The situation and story are extremely sad, but I never felt overwhelmed by this. Keep in mind that I can't usually handle dramas very well.The movie is about partly about Gilbert, but it also describes life in this town very well. Gilbert's family often has a big impact on the other people in this town, so it's natural that they would be the family that the movie is about. What's also really nice is that Gilbert isn't portrayed as a hero in this movie. He has flaws, and he can make mistakes even if he's taking care of everyone. He is not the typical good-hearted young adult or teenager who's taking care of everyone and wants to give everything for his family. He actually has feelings of his own and he is trying to find himself. The whole movie is about his quest to find who he really is, if he isn't Gilbert Grape, the guy who's always running after his brother Arnie.Another good point about this movie is the way it was filmed. The visuals are great and the way the movie was made makes us feel like we're seeing life in a different way than usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The family that binds us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly, this is one beautiful movie. It doesn't go for cheap tears but in the end you must feel something, otherwise you simply don't have a heart. It's about a town, Endora, where nothing ever happens. In that town live the Grapes, a fatherless family that consists of a mother of elephant-like proportions, two sisters and two brothers (one of them being retarded).All the acting ranks from very good to excellent. Johnny Depp is so lovable as Gilbert Grape, the twenty-year-old son who tries to do good for everyone but doesn't know quite what he wants for himself yet. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply amazing as the retarded Arnie. He rightfully got an Oscar-nomination for his roll. At the time I saw this movie, I didn't know him yet, so at some moments I actually thought that he really could be a retarded actor (that's a big complement, isn't it?).The plot isn't too spectacular, but keeps you interested 'cause actually a lot of things do happen to certain character's in this sleepy town. A lot of things the characters say and do seem superficial, but actually aren't meaningless as they lead to other events in the story. And the arrival of Becky (Juliette Lewis) and her mother make things interesting for Gilbert. The ending is unexpected, very solid and sad. And then there's the little epilogue...This simply is a great movie: Good story, good acting, good directing. And that's all it takes. Watch it and allow yourselves to be moved by the Grapes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film, I had yet to know the name Leonardo DiCaprio. And I was stunned. Is that actor really retarded or what? His acting is so excellent, you don't need to doubt why he got to be so big.But all others perform real well also. I have always had an eye for Depp's acting, and Lewis is, like always, little. The new thing is that she's kind and caring.This is a great film, and if nothing else, watch it because a swede directed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trapped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small American towns nurture kindness and big hearts, as personified by Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), a twenty year old guy who heads a loving but difficult family of two younger sisters, a mentally retarded younger brother named Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), and their obese momma (Darlene Cates). These are humble, unpretentious common folks who do the best they can. But life in a small town in Iowa is hard, and it can be frustrating and confining. At times, you can feel ... trapped.The film's theme is explicit. Gilbert is trapped in a vexing family. Arnie is trapped in a body with a flawed brain. Momma is trapped in an obese body. A local woman named Betty (Mary Steenburgen) is trapped in an unsatisfying marriage. A young woman named Becky (Juliette Lewis) is trapped with her grandmother in the town by an RV that has broken down while passing through. Even a grasshopper gets trapped in Arnie's mischievous hands.Seeing good people trapped in difficult situations is poignant. The film really tugs at your heartstrings. In one sequence, momma must face gawkers as she leaves the courthouse. Her response is inspiring and majestic. Darlene Cates does a wonderful job in this role.Gilbert and his family live in a modest house. Its interior reminds me of the grim, depressing house in the movie "Silkwood" (1983). The dinner table must be moved each meal to wherever momma is sitting. And typical family conversation centers on preparation for Arnie's birthday party, and debate over ways to cook bacon.A friend helps Gilbert reinforce the wood floor under Gilbert's house, so that the floor won't collapse under the weight of momma. Gilbert is kind, and has a big heart. And he is very protective of Arnie who has a habit of climbing up the town's water tower.The townsfolk are satisfied with fulfilling small dreams, like getting a job at the new burger barn, or getting an ice cream snack at the local "Dairy Dreme". Small American towns ... life is familial and loving, but it can also be confining. And this film reminds me a lot of "The Last Picture Show" (1971).The acting in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is very good, as is the color cinematography, and production design. I did find the Arnie character to be a bit grating at times. The film's plot is slightly repetitive. And I don't care for the film's title. But these are minor issues."What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is a heartfelt story about life in a small American town, with all its kindness, big hearts, and familial love, despite the hardships. The film is worth a serious look, for its thematic depth, for its acting, and for its attention to detail in sets and production design.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple movie with a simple plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depp plays the title character and this movie just seems to go through a typical few days in this family's life. However, the main character is getting tired of it, and you can tell he is about to snap. There isn't a very well defined plot, but it seems to revolve around Arnie's birthday party and the coming of motor homes that drive through the area. This movie though doesn't revolve around plot, but rather characters. It is more of a character study I would say. The performances are rather good so it works for me. First time I saw this, before I knew who Leonardo was I actually thought he was a mentally ill person playing the part. This movie has some laughs too as it isn't all serious. It is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone should be a bit more like Gilbert Grape...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What's eating Gilbert Grape" is the unique story of a young man who just wants to be a good person. Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance and Leonardo Dicaprio is amazing, unbelievable, outstanding,... as the retarded Arnie. It's hard to describe his performance, you just have to see it. I think it's one of the best performances of a retarded kid ever. He definitely should have won the Oscar, instead of Tommy Lee Jones. Also Juliette Lewis gives a truly remarkable performance as the vulnerable Becky.There are also many heartbreaking moments in this movie, but I will only mention the ones who where the most special to be. The scene where the mother goes to the police office herself to get her son, was really moving. When she returns to the car and all the people are staring at here, children are laughing, there's even a guy who's taking a picture... when I saw this I could only feel very sorry for her. Another great scene is when they put the house on fire when their mother died. The meaning of that is very beautiful and sad at the same time: it's the only way her funeral can be a bit respectful and she won't be seen as a joke (it's literally what she said she wanted) I'm a big fan of Lasse Hallström. Every time he makes a movie, he succeeds in delivering a wonderful a touching piece of art with actors who give the best of them. This movie isn't an exception, it is as beautiful as "The Cider House Rules", "Chocolat" and "The Shipping News".Wonderful story, great acting,...what more should a movie have? Excellent movie, a must see for everyone who isn't afraid of feeling something... 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A change of pace for almost everyone involved results in spectacular success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently stumbled upon the last half of one of those Top 50 Child Stars TV shows, which had a segment on Leonardo DiCaprio, showing interviews with him when he first started acting and would make jokes about how famous and rich he was, having had no way of knowing how astronomically rich and famous he would go on to be. Anyway, the show described his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape as one of his most charming, which turned out to be a tremendous understatement.The film takes place in the motionless town of Endora, Iowa, and concerns the world of Gilbert Grape, whose life is in a constant state of turmoil. He works for a tiny local general store that has come under the competitive strain of a massive supermarket which has opened just outside of town. Needless to say, the store is a major topic of conversation among the local townspeople, because a big store in a town like Endora is big news. I think the real charm of the movie lies in the fact that it is able to portray what you normally might consider to be a highly dysfunctional family and make them charming and, in the context of the town and world they live in, lovable. All of the problems that the family suffers on a daily basis are right at the forefront throughout the film, but no one ever really seems unhappy, except for the mother, and we get the feeling that her unhappiness is both the cause and the result of her morbid obesity. We get a brief explanation of how she came to be so heavy, but not really much more than, "I wasn't always like this." Gilbert is about 21 and seems to be the only one mature (and mentally and physically able) enough to hold the family together, and the majority of the movie focuses on his struggles to do that in normal life. He is in charge of his mentally retarded brother Arnie (DiCaprio), has to periodically subdue his intolerably obnoxious sister, who looks like she belongs in a different family and a different society (and she believes that, too), while at the same time getting to work on time, hanging out at coffee shops with his similarly offbeat friends talking about the undertaking business. In between all of this, a local desperate housewife periodically orders groceries for delivery from the general store where he works, and she tends to be a little less desperate after he leaves.It seems that all of this normality, charming in both its daily routine and its total difference from the daily monotony that the majority of us are used to, is presented to us so that we can get to know Gilbert, his daily life, and his family, as they are before the cataclysmic arrival of Becky (Juliette Lewis). Becky is on a vacation of sorts with her mother and stops in Endora long enough for her and Gilbert to develop a romantic interest in each other, and she thereby breaks the series of monotonies which the first part of the movie introduced us to. Monotonies which may have continued forever had she not arrived. There are a series of events that take place after Becky arrives as Gilbert tries to assimilate her into his well-established life, testing the waters and taking new risks that he would never have even considered before, and learning something about himself from the results, as we all do. The Grapes are a family that would very likely knock you off your feet if you were to run into almost any of them in person, but the movie is so good at treating them as humans that they are not a spectacle at all, even when Arnie is repeatedly climbing the local water tower, much to the chagrin of the local police force, who have been promised repeatedly that this is the last time. It never is, and when we see Arnie up there on the tower, we cheer for him, and the reason we cheer for him is the same reason why the movie is so effective.We don't cheer for him because we identify with his struggle against a couple of grumpy cops, but as though he has made an accomplishment, because in his mind, he has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of a family, in a back water town, where we get to see each of them struggling with life. Johnny Depp, him again, gives yet another excellent performance as Gilbert, frustrated with his lot, wishing he could get away from his family, responsibilities and most of all Endora. He works to support his family, is having a less than fulfilling affair with an older married woman and is always looking out for his brother Arnie, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, but more of him later. Depp manages to capture every emotion perfectly, in an non-showy role he pulls you in and makes you believe.Ultimately this is a simple story, man struggles then finds love, but it's so much more, the relationships of the family Grape are very well observed, from the mother hugely overweight, causing the structure of the house to crumble to the growing pains of the sisters. Where this story strikes gold is with Arnie, I remember when I first saw this film I had no idea who Di Caprio was, I actually thought they had used a disabled actor to play the part, when watching that year's Oscars and seeing him nominated for the role I was amazed. I have watched many films, and his performance is one of the best I have ever seen. Remarkable in it's accuracy and so moving, when we find him sitting in cold bath water having been told not to move hours earlier, well it breaks your heart, and Gilbert's rage demonstrating his frustration not really at Arnie but at life, just brilliant.So this is a film that you should see, if only for Di Caprio, but it has much more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard many people praising this film long before I ever actually caught it myself, and I have to say that the praise is more than worthy. On the surface it is a simple story of an unusual family closely bound together, but in actuality it is really about life itself. The title of the film "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" (for international readers, the term 'eating' is a play on words meaning 'bothering') can refer to many facets of his character.[POTENTIAL SPOILERS]Gilbert is bothered by the problems that his mother's large size impose on the family, and yet he isn't bothered enough to realize the curiosity others have in her; even helping kids get a better look at her through the window.Gilbert is bothered by having to take care of his rather impaired brother Arnie (masterfully played by DiCaprio), and yet he will not tolerate others to be disrespectful to him.Gilbert is bothered by the fact that he is effectively trapped by his family, and yet he really has nowhere to go (which seems to be a favorite chant of Arnie.)Gilbert is bothered by his father's suicide, which apparently triggered his mother's depression that led to her weight problem, and yet he seems constantly filled with the desire to just 'check out' himself but doesn't.Gilbert is bothered by a non-emotional sexual fling which ultimately has predictable results, and has difficulty dealing with a true relationship with Juliette Lewis.The care and concern that he feels for his family is powerful and tangible. An interesting metaphor used several times is him starting a fire (lighting a match), only to blow it out again, which kind of summarizes his existence; starting something, and then changing his mind (at least until the end of the film.)This film deals with the kind of gut-level emotions that we all have but would rather not acknowledge, very much like 'The Cider House Rules' (by the same director.) A truly wonderful film that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I want to be a good person."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tell me what you want as fast as it comes to you," says Becky to Gilbert as they relax in the thick brown grass beside the pond. Stretched out under the bright sun, he closes his eyes and begins to think deeply. "House...I want a new house for the family." His dreamlike expression softens. "I want Mama to take aerobics classes. I want Ellen to grow up. I want a new brain for Arnie." "What do you want for you," she asks, "just for you?" The shadow of a smile drifts across his face, and he replies without hesitation, "I want to be a good person." Gilbert Grape is a good person, he just doesn't realize it yet. Johnny Depp portrays the twentysomething Gilbert in Endora, Iowa (Pop. 1,091) as a young man asleep at the wheel of his life. As he narrates his story, we learn his older sister Amy is a mother type figure and a decent cook, only she has a tendency to accidentally start fires (like the one that burned down the elementary school she used to work at). Ellen, his younger sister, is a preening pubescent teen who has an opinion on everything - and it isn't a very good opinion either. Kids from around town come peeking through windows of the ramshackle Grape house to catch a glimpse of his 500-pound mother, who cannot come to the dinner table (or hardly go anywhere for that matter) so the dinner table comes to her. And then there's Arnie. Arnie Grape (in an Oscar-nominated performance by Leonardo DiCaprio) is about to turn eighteen in a few days, and suffers from severe mental retardation. His favorite pastime is to climb up the water tower in the middle of town, but climbing down is a different story. He is unable to dress or bathe himself. He likes to find inventive ways to decapitate grasshoppers, but cries when he realizes he has killed them. As the doctors have warned - and Arnie often cheerfully reminds everyone - he can go at any time. Gilbert puts it this way: "Some days you want him to live...some days you don't."Just passing through this off-beat atmosphere is a curiously wise yet enigmatic young stranger named Becky (Juliette Lewis). Everyone else in the sleepy town sees Gilbert as a carbon copy of his father, who committed suicide fifteen years earlier. They see someone going nowhere, and in a sense he already is nowhere. But Becky sees more. She sees more than Gilbert can see in himself, and she sees that his circumstances have made him afraid to feel anything.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is the fine product of director Lasse Hallstrom. Just as in one of his later efforts, Chocolat, Hallstrom has created here a small world where stagnant lives hide under a blanket of tranquility, and a mysterious young woman blows in and changes everything. Beyond the perfect cast of supporting characters played brilliantly by Mary Steenburgen, John C. Reilly, and Crispin Glover, on the surface this could seem like a sentimental teen chickflick dramedy, but it is nothing of the sort. Because in this film Gilbert finds more than just love...for the first time ever, he finds himself, he discovers life, he even discovers death. He finds freedom, and through that freedom he is able to save his family from themselves.Do not miss this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The storyline and direction is absolutely superb! One of my favourite Johnny Depp movies. It's probably the best "feel good" flick in years. Johnny Depp performs brilliantly as the young, embarrassed, pressured but patient boy who just wants the best for him self and his family.Juliette Lewis is excellent as the confident traveler who Johnny Depp has his eye on. If anyone else were to be cast in this role, it would be a mistake. She's the only one who can make this part work. Leonardo Dicaprio delivers the best acting performance that I have ever seen! He was so convincing of his part (the disabled child) that if he hadn't of acted in other films I would of really believed he was mentally ill.All together the tear jerker/feel good flick turned out to be absolutely excellent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' a film by Lasse Hallström, is not your average movie. There are no stunning visual effects, no mind-blowing stunt-work and even the film setting is somewhat dull and lifeless. However, the movie is a very good one, for it is driven by its diverse range of characters.Gilbert Grape, played by Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Pirates Of The Caribbean), does not think much of his home town. He describes Endora, population 1091, as a place he sorely wishes not to be, like "dancing with no music." About 21 years of age, Gilbert became the fatherly figure in the somewhat dysfunctional household after his father committed suicide some years ago. Alongside his work at a struggling local grocery store, Gilbert has a very difficult personal life. Between caring for his intellectually disabled brother (Leonardo DiCaprio- Titanic, Catch Me If You Can) and his dangerously obese mother (Darlene Cates), Gilbert is trapped in a very intimate relationship with Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen), a lonesome housewife to whom Gilbert makes frequent deliveries. However, everything that Gilbert believes about life suddenly changes with the arrival of Becky (Juliette Lewis), a stranded camper who shows Gilbert to look at the bigger picture, rather than focus on the negatives.The acting performances are generally superb. Depp, who mastered the role of a quiet outsider in 'Edward Scissorhands,' steps painlessly into the role of Gilbert Grape, a man confused by his own emotions and the sudden changes happening in his life. However, the highlight of the film is, without a doubt, the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. In a both funny and convincing role that deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination, and displayed the greatness that he would later achieve, DiCaprio portrays Gilbert's intellectually disabled brother, Arnie, who is currently ecstatic about his coming 18th birthday party and occupies himself by climbing the town water tower and forgetting how to get down.'What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is a great film with a warm heart. Its characters are convincingly portrayed and easy to relate to, and the story brings the drama to great levels. Perhaps the only flaw I found with the film was that there was much of the same throughout, and the dry Iowa setting was not very appealing to the eye. However, this somewhat dull repetitiveness also serves to convey the monotony of Gilbert's life- a routine that is suddenly plunged into chaos with each unforeseen change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet story without much drive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slightly askew fairy tale from director Lasse Halstrom, who thankfully has abandoned his penchant for overwrought irony and comic nastiness, has a big heart but one that isn't always well-placed. Dedicated to his mentally backward brother and reclusive, overweight mother, grocery worker Gilbert Grape (a nicely understated Johnny Depp) rethinks his life after meeting an attractive young woman passing through town. The film has finely-balanced little moments that spring up at you, however Mary Steenburgen's role as a cheating wife isn't really necessary (it's just there to give us some input into Gilbert's situation), but Juliette Lewis, John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover are very charming as Gilbert's friends. Leonardo DiCaprio...you gotta hand it to him, he pulls off a tricky role with amazing aplomb. Hallstrom's film doesn't always strike the chords it wants to, and occasionally it seems to intentionally wobble while juggling its emotional priorities. Some scenes that should cut deep don't (as with Gilbert shopping at the competition and getting caught by his boss, or with Gilbert letting neighborhood kids get a peek at his mother). Still, a pleasant, thought-provoking outing, one that is nonchalant about its emotions (and its brains). It isn't a heady mix of dramatic ideas, but it does leave you with something--thoughts that may return to you a day or so after seeing it. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just start off by saying that this is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen. Every moment starting from the second the film began, I found myself mesmerized by its articulate beauty. Every character is massively complex and I started to have different feelings about each of them as time went on; with the obese Bonnie living in denial, the brother, Arnie with special needs who at times you can both love and absolutely hate, and even Gilbert who only wants to be a good person and help his dysfunctional family make it through life while at the same time tries desperately to make himself happy, none of the plot points ever become stale or predictable thanks to the numerous dynamics of character. The story seems to flow as casually as a conversation wit a close friend, weaving in and out of Gilbert's redemption as he falls in love and faces life as it truly is. If I were to suggest any film to see to show just how much we take our lives for granted, without a doubt "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" would fall out of my mouth in an instant. It is truly a movie that everyone should watch and appreciate before their time here on Earth runs out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...this was one of the most powerful and emotionally gripping movies I have ever seen. The story is told through the eyes of the main character, Gilbert, played marvelously by Johnny Depp. This is a story that most of us can relate to. Gilbert feels trapped in the small town of Endora and doesn't know how he can leave. He has been thrown responsibilities and obligations that he wasn't ready to have. After the death of his father, he is the man of the family, forced to care for his very obese mother, 2 sisters, and his mentally handicapped younger brother Arnie. Due to his mothers health, he is basically the parent of Arnie. He is frustrated and he tries to numb himself from feeling anything at all. He tries to make himself a robot and has almost succeeded until the arrival of Becky. Becky inspires Gilbert to open up his heart...he heart he had closed off for quite some time. She shows him how to open his eyes and see...truly see. The performances were amazing...Leonardo DiCaprio is nothing short of spectacular. Darlene Cates gives a truly heart-breaking performance as Mama. My favorite line in this film, which I feel is the theme, is when Gilbert says, "We can go anywhere...if we want."</fullReview>

Leonardo Decaprio was also fantastic as Depp's younger brother. He played the part so well that although there was something familiar about him at the start of the movie - I didn't actually realise it was Leo playing the part until about 20 minutes into the film! The lady who played their mother wasn't even an actress - she was spotted on the Sally Jessy Raphael Show talking about her weight. She also gave a tremendous performance as the overweight housebound mother who is dependant on her children for everything. If you are a Depp or Decaprio fan, you must see this movie, but if you're not you will be by the end of the film. Excellent.</fullReview>

This movie takes us into the complicated life of Gilbert Grape and all the "weights" he holds on his shoulder. As Arnie's 18th birthday looms ahead, Gilbert is faced with dealing with not just his brother's and the rest of his family's lives, but his own as well. This movie should be seen by all because of the excellent story and the superb acting.

		<fullReview>An understated, small-town drama about a family. Very much the sum of its various parts the film revolves around an indifferent central performance from Johnny Depp. The real success of the film is in its careful manipulation of juxtaposed characters and small, situational stories: the travellers passing through a stagnating town; failure of relationships but hope in new friends and opportunities; love and death.The wonderful cyclone of energy that binds many of the threads together is the Oscar-nominated performance of Leonardo di Caprio. He plays the mentally-impaired younger brother of Depp convincingly, sympathetically and brilliantly. I'd imagine that his performance lifts the rest of the ensemble: Darlene Cates as the obese mother of the family can be assessed on her acting rather than some disguising of her real-life girth; John C Reilly puts in a pre-The Good Girl study as a big-hearted all-American guy; and Juliette Lewis adds another achievement to her glittering canon as princess of the Indie-flick. Marvellous 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The mixed reviews for this film are hard to resist, but there has to be some signs of achievement. WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is sporadically funny for an old town life story that centers along with growing pains that run in the family. The idea is placed on how to deal with helpless relatives, but somewhere along the line, the humor is gratifying and makes you interested. Johnny Depp is okay as a young guy who succumbs to all kinds of pressure while getting romanced by a customer he saw in the grocery store. He just needs more emotional value. Leonardo DiCaprio in his pre-TITANIC role as an 18-year old handicap is a show-stealer. A little bit of comedy relief is expected out of his annoying, magically spirited character who takes risks without sudden harm. Brilliant acting on his part. However, the movie takes a downturn towards mellow pastures and ends up to the point of absolute uncertainty. A very natural heartwarming story that will appeal to fans of DiCaprio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the small town of Endora, Gilbert Grape is busy caring for his mentally handicapped brother, Arnie. His morbidly obese mother, Bonnie has done little except eat since her husband died, and longs only to see Arnie live to the age of 18. With Bonnie unable to care for her children on her own, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and looking after Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the town water tower, while his sisters Amy and Ellen do the rest. The relationship between the brothers is of both care and protection, as Gilbert continually enforces the 'nobody touches Arnie' policy. A new "Foodland" supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery where Gilbert works. In addition, Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman, Betty Carver. The family is looking forward to Arnie's 18th birthday. A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when their car breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their possible romance. His affair with Mrs Carver ends when she leaves town in search of a new life following her husbands death,. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie and as she talks to Gilbert she begins to unlock some buried hopes, dreams and happiness. Later on, Arnie tries to run away yet again from his bath and in his frustration Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert takes the car and runs out without another word, fearing that he is leaving his family just like his father and brother did.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is just an incredibly beautiful and touching movie that will always have a special place in my heart. It makes you laugh, cry, and think about how precious life is. All the characters are relatable or likable in some way. Even in the smallest of all towns where it seems like it's just dead, there is life. That's what this movie is about to me, everyone has a story and everyone has an experience to share. This is just a terrific film, quality acting and a heart felt story, I very much recommend that if you get the chance to watch it. If anything for Leonardo DiCaprio's incredible performance and Johnny Depp singing to him "Match in the gas tank, boom boom!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Film Anchored to DiCaprio's Breakout Performance as Mentally Impaired Arnie Grape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What's Eating Gilbert Grape" directed by Swede Lasse Hallström (director of "The Cider House Rules" and "Hachi: A Dog's Tale") focuses on Gilbert Grape, a young adult taking care of his brother with a developmental disability and his morbidly obese mother, in the days leading up to his brother's 18th Birthday. His brother Arnie Grape, splendidly played by a young Leonardo DiCaprio, has against all odds lived past the ten years medically allotted his life due to his condition. Arnie's upcoming birthday works as a backdrop for the movie.The film's plot seemed a little too thin to me with the majority of the film being episodic occurrences in the Grape family's everyday lives. Although this lets us closer in on the characters, I got the feeling that the film lacked the direction it needed in order to advance the plot. The dialog felt awry on occasion discernible for instance in exchanges between Gilbert and his friends Tucker Van Dyke (John C. Reilly) and town coroner Bobby McBurney (Crispin Glover). In fact, I thought John C. Reilly gave a poor performance throughout.Director Lasse Hallström has a tendency of making feel-good films without a lot of depth to them. I do not necessarily dislike films of this format, but they do have to redeem themselves in other departments to make up for this. The strongest selling point of the movie is therefore by far the performances by the actors. Casting director Gail Levin did well in bringing on Johnny Depp and Darlene Cates (the mother) as Gilbert and Bonnie Grape respectively, both whom delivers earnest and appealing performances. It goes without saying however that Leonardo DiCaprio is the one to watch out for in this picture. His acting is so convincing as to make it very difficult to believe he is acting a part in the first place. From the mannerisms he evokes to the way he talks and does his posturing, all bear witness to an immensely talented actor. DiCaprio, who was 18 at the time of filming, spent several days at a home for mentally challenged teens where he would talk to the kids as well as observe their mannerisms. This must have been a deciding factor in how he was able to act the part with such strong conviction.The efforts of Editor Andrew Mondsheim left me scratching my head for a bit. Some scenes ended with almost no dialog at all, and I would have wanted him to show more patience during stretches of the film. Mondsheim was Oscar-nominated in 2000 for editing M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense", so he seems skilled enough to have done a better job with the film. The music in the film was too repetitive and dull for my taste. In addition, I thought the film was overlong. The fictional town of Endora with its gloomy atmosphere sets up the film nicely though, and the cinematography was befitting the themes of the film.I would call this a good film, a simple one, but a good one still. It is worth the while if only to watch Leonardo DiCaprio's solid performance as autistic Arnie Grape. That the Academy could favour Tommy Lee Jones's role in "The Fugitive" over DiCaprio is absurd to me, but DiCaprio is no stranger to such disappointments as time has shown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not everybody is "normal". There are those who don't have the perfect physique and are too skinny or way too fat or are mentally challenged. This movie gives an excellent depiction of how difficult not being "normal" really is. It clearly shows how one's physical or mental state can lead to a lot of ridicule and eyeballing in society. It shows that "hiding" for some is the only alternative to take.Johnny Depp's extreme acting talent is evidently showcased here and as one IMDb reviewer said, he's capable of "acting with his eyes" which is totally true. He gives an excellent performance as the young man yearning to escape from a small, no-where town, but is trapped by the burden of his family.Darlene Cates is outstanding as the extremely overweight momma who sits on the couch all day and watches TV. As a non-professional actor who got the part because of her girth, she has excellent "screen presence" like the other acting professionals around her. Since her character's situation mirrored her own life, you can tell she's acting from sincerity and understanding.Leonardo Dicaprio is, of course, outstanding as the mentally challenged son who can behead a grasshopper at the mailbox and later cry about it. His happy, wild curiosity about the world and his habit for "hiding up a tree", not to mention his urge to climb the town's water tower, is a very believable performance. No wonder he was nominated for an Oscar.Juliette Lewis was perfectly cast as the down-to-earth and common-sense minded love interest to Gilbert who believes that appearances are "external" and that no one should be judged by that. The moment when she finally meets Gilbert's mom was a touching one indeed.This is a very beautiful, heartwarming movie and the beauty isn't in what is depicted, but in those who depicted it. Being "normal" isn't always the case for some and this movie perfectly shows that. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional family drama with standout performances from DiCaprio and Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I want Momma to take aerobics classes. I want Ellen to grow up. I want a new brain for Arnie. I want?"Looking back at Leonardo DiCaprio's filmography I'm constantly reminded what a great actor he is. In What's Eating Gilbert Grape, he plays a seventeen year old mentally ill kid in such a natural way that if I didn't know this was Leo I would've believed the actor playing Arnie was really mentally ill. This is probably one of his standout performances and is one of the highlights of this emotionally gripping family drama. However he is just a supporting character in this film as the title character is played by Johnny Depp, Arnie's older brother who is always taking care of him and the rest of the family. Gilbert's father has abandoned them and ever since he has been the male role model for the family in the small community where they live. He not only takes care of Arnie, he also has to provide for the family by working in a small local supermarket. He is ashamed of his obese mother (Darlene Cates), who simply stopped caring about her beautiful body after her husband abandoned her. Gilbert also has two sisters who help out with the family chores, Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt). The responsibility Gilbert feels towards his family has taken its toll on him and explains why he seems to be half asleep all the time. He has no time for accomplishing any personal goals or dreams and spends his few free minutes with his local friends, Tucker (John C. Reilly) and Bobby (Crispin Glover). Things take an unexpected turn when Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives in town and the two form a special bond together. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an emotionally gripping family drama that works thanks to the strong performances from the cast and a fantastically well written script by Peter Hedges. The film avoids feeling cliché or melodramatic and I found it to be an honest story. Lasse Hallstrom has been accused of being overly melodramatic at times, but I think that the director avoided much of those moments here thanks in most part to a well written script.Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of the film, but Johnny Depp also delivers in a very subtle way. His character doesn't seem to say much, but the way he simply moves and speaks says a lot about him. He knows he isn't getting anywhere in life and feels stuck in this small town, but at the same time he has responsibilities and knows that his family relies on him to survive. He is trapped in a prison he can't get out of. He cares deeply for his family, but at the same time he resents them and it seems they have become a burden for him. The way he approaches the character is fascinating because he doesn't have to say or do anything for us to understand how he feels. We can easily identify and sympathize for his character. The chemistry he shares with Lewis is also strong. She is in some ways the opposite of him. She is free spirited and has travelled across several states. She doesn't have many responsibilities, and the two end up complementing each other quite well. Their relationship might not be the central theme of the movie, but it does lighten up the mood a bit. Reilly is always funny on screen and despite playing a more serious character he still delivers his usual quirky silliness to the role. All these small relationships are the central theme of the movie and the brotherhood between Depp and DiCaprio stands out above them all. I enjoyed this family drama and I'm glad I finally got a chance to watch it. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Worried with the hero Depp and DiCaprio incredibly touching work. I think it's so hard to play a mentally retarded boy, but DiCaprio did it, I believed him absolutely.Wonderful movie, thin, shaped, very deep, hurt several strands of life. Do not even want to describe what he awakens in the soul. After viewing the remains light precipitate appears food for thought. The film shows the complicated social life, psychological problems of human relations in the family. The script is good, but sometimes the film is tightened, for about 15 minutes at the beginning could be removed. The plot is, in addition to all other problems, the problem of fathers and children. How often we are ashamed of their parents. They blurt out something random, something not to do so, is necessary for them to blush. Mentality they have not the same interests and ideals outdated. And Gilbert's mother at all like home, and his father hanged himself.Heavy, lingering story of a family in which the main victim of a desperate life is not sick boy who survived almost twice metered doctors period not sisters, driven into a maid almost from the cradle and not the same Gilbert, who dreams of escape from a small town where nothing occurs and never happen.This film I felt the first to the last frame. He has touched and excited me deeply. How uncharacteristic role Depp, DiCaprio is so incredible. Depp without his usual affectation at first glance may seem a little faded on the background DiCaprio. But this is only an illusion. To play Grape, ordinary young man without any aspirations and ideals, also need talent. I especially want to mention brilliant game DiCaprio. This is one of the busiest and brightest of his roles, which requires the talent, colloquially referred to as the actor's.The film is heavy, but the feeling after watching the highly positive.</fullReview>

The character is developed very well. Soundtracks are inserted in time and in place. Arnie's character made me nervous, but on the other hand Leonardo DiCaprio developed him perfectly. I recommend this movie for those who love dramas. You will like it one hundred percent. You will fall in love with this movie, because there are so much such as: love, funny moments, disappointments, anguish, fortune, pain, poverty and anger. Plot is very gripping. Cast tried that viewer would feel every emotion which feels the character. It seems that during those 116 minutes nothing happens, but it isn't true. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until today, my impression of the movie's title was that it was asking a question. It never occurred to me that the story was in fact trying to answer one. For Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp), life is an imponderable existence, trapped as he is in a fatherless family with a mentally challenged younger brother (Leonardo DiCaprio), an obese mother (Darlene Cates) whose dimensions threaten the very foundation of their home, and a pair of sisters (Laura Harrington, Mary Kate Schellhardt) who find it difficult to maintain some semblance of normality in a community that considers the family a spectator attraction. But if you think about it, they might not have been the oddest characters living in Endora. The town also features a harmless joke mortician (Crispin Glover), a sad and lonely woman trapped in a loveless marriage (Mary Steenburgen), and a family friend (John C. Reilly) who insists that the soon to arrive Burger Barn is nothing short of cutting edge in the fast food industry. Into this mix arrives a free spirit angel (Juliette Lewis) who tries to help Gilbert realize his self proclaimed goal of being a good person. The film has it's absurd moments along with the bittersweet, and it was for that reason I found the marching band's choice of song to greet the Burger Barn as truly ironic - 'This Magic Moment'. By the time the picture is over, one realizes that even if our hero Gilbert has 'got nowhere to go', he's always been exactly where he needed to be.</fullReview>

This movie tell us that we all have a story in life which is happy and sad and the movie makes you laugh and cry in the same time and it's all for great play of Leonardo Dicaprio as happy side and Johnny Depp of the sad part. The movie is just telling a story but what makes you keep watching this movie is the brilliant Leonardo Dicaprio acting which is one his best acting role ever. I mean he has been so natural in the whole movie and no one else could have played it better than him. The movie shows Leo's acting talent even when he was a young boy. On the other hand Johnny Depp also was just brilliant in this movie and this two great actor together in the same movie make Whats eating Gilbert Grape movie a masterpiece.in the entire movie you don't get bored at all.And the best part when Gillbert and Becky are having the conversation together:Gilbert: I want Momma to take aerobics classes.

		<fullReview>Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) has to care for his mentally handicap brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his morbidly obese mother (Darlene Cates) in the hard scrabble tiny town of Endora. His dad's dead. He works at the town's dying grocery store, and is having an affair with one of its customers Mrs Carver (Mary Steenburgen). Every year, the town is invaded by a fleet of trailers. One of those trailer people is Becky (Juliette Lewis).This is a dysfunctional family where everybody is tiptoeing around the mother's obesity and the tragedy of its past. These are well defined and sharply acted roles. The unspoken things are tearing this family down bit by bit. Johnny Depp is doing some beautiful acting as a guy tied down by responsibilities. Leo is believable as disabled. And Juliette Lewis is lovely. This is a gorgeous movie, both as a story and in terms of acting. Darlene Cates will break your heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful portrayal of a family dealing with disability.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when it was released in the cinemas, and found it touching with powerful performances. When the DVD became available, I bought it. However I did not watch it for several years ... my mother developed Alzheimer's, and the storyline was too close to home. When I did watch it again I realised just how powerful and true the performances really were. Everyone comments on Leonardo's role, and rightly so ... it is astounding, especially for someone so young. But, with the experience of living with a difficult family situation, I now realise just how spot-on Johnny Depp's performance was. He capture's the conflict between love and reality perfectly ... no matter how much you love someone, there are times when you just cannot love them. It would have been so easy for the portrayal of Gilbert to be shallow goodness and sweetness, and then the scene where he hits his brother would have been so wrong. As it is, it rings so true. Also wonderful is the portrayal of conflict between resentment at the eldest brother's "escape" and still desperately wanting to care for the disabled brother. The ability to really express the conflict that carer's inevitably have is incredibly difficult. Johnny Depp is the one whose performance should have been nominated for the Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) **** (out of 4)Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) tries adjusting to his small town where the weight of the world is on his shoulders. He must try and take care of his eccentric family including his retarded brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), his obese mother (Darlene Cates) as well as try and keeps his affair with a married woman (Mary Streenburgen) quiet. After meeting a stranger (Juliette Lewis) he begins to think that he might be better served just leaving the town and his family behind. I watched this movie when it was first released and thought it was extremely good but I think it's safe to say that time has been very good to the film as its not only shaped into a classic but I think it's improved all around. I think the movie is just about as perfect as you can get in showing someone who is just at the end of everything including being fed up with their life and the burden of the expectations that are on them. This here is where the film is so special because the Gilbert character really does feel like a real person who just wants to escape but can't find a way to do it. The film was incredibly realistic and I think it manages to be rather heartbreaking along the way even though there are certainly bits of romance and comedy scattered throughout. The greatest thing going are without question the performances. DiCaprio turns in one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to see as the mentally challenged Arnie. Just the way he performs the character is something really special to watch as he's got some perfect small touches and not for a second do you ever believe you're just watching an actor do a part. The supporting cast is terrific with Lewis, Steenburgen, Cates, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover and Kevin Tighe perfectly fitting their roles. Depp, and everyone for that matter, were overlooked due to how great DiCaprio was but I think he too gives one of the better performances of his career. Everyone's gotten so used to his over-the-top and flashy characters that it's pretty amazing to see him play the opposite. The film has so many touching and memorable scenes and the director really pulls them all together wonderfully. Classics get better over time and I think this is a perfect example of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful story of an Iowa family struggling through trials and tribulations. Johnny Depp plays the title character, the eldest son working at a grocery store to support his family since the suicide of his father. A 16 year old Leonardo DiCaprio, in his first Oscar nominated role, as Gilbert's autistic brother, Arnie, a sensitive boy on the verge of adulthood. Juliette Lewis stars as Becky, a young lady who ends up in Gilbert's town after a tire blows on her trailer and becomes attached to both Gilbert and Arnie in their time of need. The film touches my heart each time since I can connect with DiCaprio's character being on the autism spectrum myself. The cast is brilliant in bringing their characters to life and evoking sympathy for their plight. If you cry easily then you may not want to watch this film because I guarantee there will be tears by the movie's final scenes, but this is a terrific family film that anyone can enjoy.</fullReview>

In this movie you look at Johnny Depp's character and you feel a sense of honesty in him, a quality not quite common these days and Juliette Lewis's character brings a bit of joy to the movie and what can you say about Leonardo, sometimes you really doubt that if he's acting or if he's really mentally challenged, just amazing acting.The soundtrack is calm and serene, never overpowers the scenes just increase their beauty. The movie tells you that sometimes things can go wrong without someone being really responsible for them. All in all it's a movie you feel happy after watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of this movie but had no idea what it was actually about, it was marked at $5.99 so I thought it was probably a decent choice, Johnny Depp/Leo DiCaprio, a quick look at the credits on the back showed Lasse Hallstrom as the director and John C. Reilly, Mary Steenburgen and Juliette Lewis in supporting roles. A great little movie in many ways, the supporting cast-including Crispin Glover, not listed on the DVD box, carry this movie. Leo DiCaprio's performance in this movie is stunning. Oscar worthy, he was nominated that year but he really should have won the award. Depp and Lewis provide adequate performances, decent work but not particularly noteworthy. Will not talk about the plot itself, definitely better for the viewer to watch it unwind. The only problem I had was the ending, utterly predictable like most movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ups And Downs Of A Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a comedy/drama film directed by Lasse Hallström that features Johnny Depp, Juliette Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio. Peter Hedges wrote the screenplay adapted from his 1991 novel of the same title.This is a story about Gilbert,who has to care for his brother Arnie and his obese mother.The that gets in the way when love walks into his life.Gilbert Grape is busy caring for his mentally challenged brother Arnie as they wait for the many tourists' trailers to pass through town during their yearly camp ritual at a nearby recreational area. His mother, Bonnie is morbidly obese after years of depression following her husband's suicide. The relationship between the brothers is one of care and protection. In order to cope with his frenetic life, Gilbert has taken on a secret love affair with a housewife, Betty, whilst her insensitive, unsuspecting husband Ken, is fully intent on selling Gilbert insurance for his family. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their budding romance. In order to spend time with Becky watching the sun set,Gilbert leaves Arnie alone in the bathtub by himself, believing he is now old enough to get out on his own. He returns home late and wakes up the following morning to find Arnie still in the bath, shivering in the now-cold water. Gilbert's guilt is compounded by his family's anger. As a result Arnie refuses to get near water, including the pond by Becky's trailer, and his fear causes him to become extremely dirty, adding to the many problems Gilbert faces. Betty's affair with Gilbert ends when she begins to make demands on him and tries to have sex with him while he's on the phone with her husband, Ken. Ken drowns after suffering a cardiac arrest and landing face down in his sons' wading pool.Becky bonds with Gilbert and Arnie and helps Gilbert reflect on his feelings. They become deeply involved in conversation until Gilbert realizes that Arnie is missing. He has returned to the water tower he is forever trying to climb and this time has succeeded at getting to the top. Arnie is arrested, compelling Bonnie, who has not left the house in seven years, to rush to the police station to demand his release, causing her appearance to be ridiculed by the townspeople. Later at home, Arnie prematurely eats some of his birthday cake, which Gilbert told him not to touch. Gilbert orders Arnie to take a bath as punishment, and Arnie resists when Gilbert tries to force him. Losing his temper, Gilbert strikes Arnie-hard. Appalled at himself and angry at his life in general, Gilbert drives away, leaving Endora. Arnie leaves the house to find Becky, who takes care of him. Gilbert returns to town and sees Arnie with Becky, who is able to get him to enter the lake, thus overcoming Arnie's fear of water. After Amy and Ellen come to Becky's and take Arnie home, Gilbert approaches Becky and the two talk about his own frustration and the reality of his father's death. The next day he returns home during Arnie's birthday party to apologize. Following Arnie's eighteenth birthday and meeting Becky for the first time, Bonnie climbs the stairs to her bedroom for the first time in years. That evening she passes away in her bed. Arnie tries to wake her, thinking that she is just playing. He runs out of the house and begins to hurt himself. As his sisters try to stop him, they realize that Bonnie has died. Jerry, the local sheriff, and his deputies tell the Grape family that they would need more men to get Bonnie's heavy corpse out of the house. After the police leave, Gilbert and his sisters soon cry over losing her. The siblings realize that her removal would draw a gawking crowd and want to protect their mother from being a spectacle. They empty the house except for their mother's body, then Gilbert sets the house on fire.One year later, Gilbert and Arnie are looking out again to watch the trailers pass. Through voice over, Gilbert tells of Amy getting a job offer to manage a bakery in Des Moines, and Ellen being thrilled to switch schools. Arnie chases the vehicles, arms flailing, excited to see Becky again. Along with Becky and her grandma, Gilbert and Arnie hit the road.It's sentimental and somewhat predictable, but those are small complaints, given the tender atmosphere and moving performances at the heart of the film.It's fascinating to see DiCaprio before he became a bona fide star as it is to watch Depp at the very moment he cemented his reputation for coolness.Also,Depp's sincere, subtle performance is certainly a big reason for the movie's success.This was definitely a good film about the ups and downs of a family as Hallstrom finds the right bittersweet tone for his dysfunctional family tale that makes it a must-see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilbert's burdens press him to a valued vintage!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage." The Grapes of WrathEach time I watch Gilbert Grape I am transported in memory to the small town in which I was raised on the Western border of the panhandle of Idaho, population: pert near 90; almost all related one way or another. My uncle, four years younger than I, was diagnosed with several physical anomalies shortly after birth. Within a year or two, it became apparent that he was learning disabled. He tolerated several surgeries on his eyes and legs, and having seven older siblings giving him all kinds of attention, he thrived. Our small town became his little sovereign nation, of sorts, as did the Grape family and their house in the country. A sort of soft isolation which protects and nurtures can be a great defense for a while, at least. Eventually, though, the outside world must be allowed its chance to either toughen us up or do its damage. Arnie, Gilbert's affected brother, played brilliantly by Leo DiCaprio, and their mother each have issues away from the safety of home. Bonnie, having eaten herself to enormity after her husband abandons the family, so to speak, finds it very difficult both physically and emotionally to leave her house. Arnie, on the other hand, loves to take off with Gilbert whenever possible or flee into town and climb the water tower at will, regardless of consequences. Then, there is sister Ellen, a handful, who also lives at home. This leaves Gilbert, a teenager, toting a bulging load. Relief comes in the form of Becky, Juliette Lewis, who befriends Gilbert and becomes a conduit, bringing hope and dreams back to life for him. This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. The power behind this picture is in the alchemic synergy of Johnny Depp and Leo DiCaprio so closely paired in this great project. So many viewers have lauded DiCaprio for the genius he brought to his role, but without Depp's unique talent to receive and react...I don't know. To sum it all up, as Gilbert puts a bandage on Arnie, he asks him, "And why am I going to make it better?" Arnie replies, "Cause you are Gilbert." "Cause I am Gilbert," his brother reassures. Pure gold!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape never fails to get my emotions all riled up when all is said and done. The acting is honestly some of the best I have ever seen in a movie. Johnny Depp deserved to be Oscar nominated, while Dicaprio deserved his Oscar nomination for supporting actor in his brilliant portrayal of Arnie as the mentally handicapped individual. This isn't your usual family type drama, it's very different and unique and that's what I loved about it. Gilbert is basically a loner, he goes by his own tune, only caring about Arnie and his well-being, while having a small affair with someone's wife. Becky|Juliette Lewis| and Gilbert have the most unusual, yet sweet romance together. It's not the typical fall in love story, it's done with creativity and with two eccentric characters, I just loved how it was done. The ending itself is one of the saddest I've personally ever seen. This movie gave me many emotions. It made me teary eyed, it made me laugh, it warmed my heart and it made me angry, all the qualities that I look for in a Drama.Performances. Johnny Depp gives an Oscar worthy show here. His character isn't as complex as some of the others perhaps, but people really tend to forget he is the heart of the movie. He is instantly likable from the start, and his eccentric character was fabulous!. Leonardo DiCaprio deserved his Oscar nomination, and made me believe he truly was handicapped. His voice, his laugh was just a phenomenal showcase of acting and he proves why he deserves his reputation as one of Hollywood's most gifted actors. Juliette Lewis's cute but odd character worked for me. She was likable and had good chemistry with Johnny Depp. Mary Steenburgen's character I felt very sorry for. Her sadness, yet greediness at the same time made for a very intriguing character. Darlene Cates doesn't have a very long acting resume, but her character as the infamous over-weight mom is memorable. People like John C. Reilly and Kevin Tighe are both great in their roles.Bottom line. This is one of the greatest dramas of all time in my opinion. This truly deserves to be on IMDb's top 250, and it's a shame it isn't. An absolute must see.9 1/2 /10</fullReview>

This one is a typical "piece-of-life." There's not much going on in the story but you become emotionally entangled with every single detail on the screen. And you can't help but ask yourself every now and then "what if that were me?!!" The movie lays thousands of possibilities ahead and makes you rethink your life and your attitude. Mr. Depp was amazing as usual.. but his performance is nothing compared with the EXCEPTIONAL performance of Leonardo DiCaprio who played Depp's retarded brother Arnie; a performance that deserves an Oscar and a heartfelt applause! This guy Leo is a RAW talent... and he never seizes to surprise me. I wonder how I hated him years ago!!!..

		<fullReview>Great movies, make you laugh and cry and I certainly did both while watching this movie. One of the reasons why this film is great, is because all of the characters are believable. Johnny Depp (Gilbert) is a man who was given the role of "man of the house", after his father killed himself. He is stuck in a little town with no way out, he has to watch his brother Arnie constantly, while dealing with a bratty sister and an obese mother who is bedridden. His acting is once again superb, and while watching the movie, you wish you could just go there and help him. Another very believable character is Arnie (Leonardo Dicaprio), who is mentally handicapped. Dicaprio's performance deserves the Oscar Nomination he got. He is so convincing when he shows us what its like for a teenage boy to be trapped in a mentally handicapped body. Arnie makes you cry but also makes you smile and laugh. I also thought the ending was appropriate,because in the beginning this is how it begins with a bunch of campers driving by, but in the beginning Gilbert, didn't have any hope. Now, at the ending the campers drive by, and Becky picks up Gilbert and Arnie to escape. Gilbert now has hope and a chance at a better future. Finally, what made this movie so good was the plot. Every scene had a purpose, every scene would move the plot forward or have the purpose of character development. This plot has many big scenes, some examples, when Gilbert leaves Arnie in the bath over night, Gilbert's mother dies, and when Gilbert is so frustrated that he actually hits Arnie and then runs away. This was a big moment, because Gilbert refers to his father as "the one that got away", his father took his life. His mother cant forget that her husband abandoned her, and she thought that Gilbert ran away to, but Gilbert comes back.This movie is inspiring, and truly is a great film. It is now on my favorite movie list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring Johnny Depp in the films lead role as Gilbert Grape alongside Leonardo DiCaprio as Archie Grape the autistic brother to Gilbert we soon from the opening scenes get the sense of a town being somewhat of a prison for the kids living there. You can tell straight away that Gilbert wants to leave but he's constantly pulled back into the lifestyle of looking after his younger brother and very overweight mother, he just wants to what's right by his family. If you want to watch a film that is so true to life in so many respect then What's eating Gilbert Grape is the film for you because once those end titles role up the screen you'll be left feeling so grateful for what you have and so sorry for the people that have to deal with the things shown in this film.</fullReview>

The story is very compassionate and, for the most part, leaves you feeling with a renewed faith in people.One small downfall is how slow the movie begins. I'm not saying that I was looking for some great action sequence to start the movie off, but things really don't pick up until the half hour mark or so.Thinking back on this film, I really think that Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors. Even back when he was very young he did a fantastic job in his role. All other characters were either perfect or close to it. Not only are the actors great in their roles, but the characters all really hold the viewers attention. This movie has a great plot and forces you to give your heart to the characters. It is a very sweet movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent drama with some good performances, even if it's not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was around back when this film was made in the early 90's, but was way too young to see it. I would have been old enough to see it years before I did, but I don't think I ever heard of it until 2006. That was when I first saw it. By then, I was familiar with Johnny Depp, as I had seen him in several other movies, and I knew he played the starring role in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape". I was also reasonably familiar with Leonardo DiCaprio, who has a big part in this movie as well. I'm not exactly sure how high my expectations were for this film at the time, but I was blown away! It's been three years since then, and I've finally seen this critically acclaimed 1993 drama a second time. This time, I definitely wasn't blown away, but still thought it was good.Gilbert Grape is a young man who lives with his dysfunctional family in Endora, Iowa, a small town where nothing much ever happens. The father of the family is dead, and the mother, Bonnie, hasn't left the house in many years, which has made her morbidly obese. Gilbert's siblings in the family are his two sisters, Amy and Ellen, and his severely mentally handicapped younger brother, Arnie, who wasn't expected to live past the age of ten, but is now approaching his eighteenth birthday! Gilbert works at a local grocery store, which is being threatened by a new "FoodLand"" supermarket just out of town, and it is his responsibility to take care of Arnie, who often goes and climbs up the local water tower when left unsupervised. So, Gilbert doesn't have much time on his hands, which becomes a significant problem when he falls in love with Becky, who is currently stranded in Endora. This also leads to trouble with Betty Carver, an older married woman who has been having an affair with him.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Arnie has been praised to death, which I can understand. He's very convincing in this role, and if you watched the movie without knowing who the actor was, you could easily think he really was handicapped! He was nominated for an Oscar for this performance, and I don't think it would have been a bad thing if he had won. As usual, Johnny Depp also puts on a decent performance, and there are some other cast highlights, including Darlene Cates as Bonnie Grape (considering the fact that she had never been in a film before, and hasn't made many appearances since then), and John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover as Gilbert's friends, Tucker Van Dyke and Bobby McBurney. The characters, the conflict, Gilbert and Arnie's relationship, etc. keep the story interesting for the most part, and sometimes poignant. Now, the film also has flaws. There's some fairly weak dialogue at times, and Betty Carver, played by Mary Steenburgen, gets a little creepy. However, this doesn't completely ruin the film.I've never read the novel of the same name (upon which this movie is based), written by Peter Hedges, who also wrote the screenplay for this adaptation, but regardless, this movie is a well-crafted drama. I noticed some aspects of this movie which I didn't remember from my first viewing, which includes Gilbert's affair with Betty Carver, and how creepy she gets. I don't know how I could have possibly forgotten that from the first viewing, but I definitely won't forget it after my second, and it doesn't help. I also definitely wasn't as moved as I was the first time. On the other hand, my second viewing didn't change my opinion on most of the positive things I could remember from before, and I would still say it's a realistic story. "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is a rather simple movie, and I'm sure many viewers would find it boring, but for the kind of film it is, they could have done slightly better, but they still did a pretty good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've just seen 'What's eating Gilbert Grape?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've thought for a long time what an underrated actor Leonardo DiCaprio is and this film has just reinforced this for me. I have a young son with Learning difficulties and Leonardos character in this film reminded me so much of my son it made me cry. My son actually looks like Leonardo which makes the resemblance so much more, but he has really captured the character amazingly. I hated Titantic and was very disappointed that Leonardo was in it but he was still good in it, but The Departed was a fantastic film and he deserved best actor for it. I really hope Leonardo continues to be offered great parts and that he gets the credit he deserves for being one of the best actors this century. Gilbert Grape is such a lovely film. Its so nice to see a film where the characters are like real people who are genuine and caring. Johnny Depp was as usual, great and i wish i could meet a man as nice as him in my life! I'm going to go out and buy this film tomorrow so i can show it to my mum!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leo's Performance Outshines All in this WONDERFUL Adaption of the Classic Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I turn on my t.v and decide that i am going to watch What's Eating Gilbert Grape. I didn't know much about it, all i knew was that Leonardo Dicaprio was in it. and that he played a Mentally Challenged boy. I begin to watch it. Even the starting is amazing. It just shows the Grape family living there day. Gilbert is the Leader of the family. his father built the house but ever since his father had died. He was in charge of the repairs. He had an overweight mom, an annoying sister and another sister who was like the mom of the family.Throughout the WHOLE movie. I couldn't believe Leonardo Dicaprios performance! It was perfection! Sometimes he made you laugh, sometimes he made you cry. And even sometimes i actually thought he was mentally challenged. Ya, the other performances we're o.k. Like John. C. Reilly's and Julitte Lewis's but Leo's performance was AMAZING! In my opinion it is one of my favorite performances and one of the best performances in decades! This is Leonardo Dicaprio at his best! This Movie had a great story line. Great adaption from the book. It is a classic and it is one of my favorites! If you want to see Leo's bets performance when he was just starting out you have to see this movie NO DOUBT. Leo deserved that Oscar Nomination 100%. I even think he should have won! In Conclusion. The Movie was great! The cast was great. But Leo was even greater. Go see this movie. Go rent it. go. NOW.As Arnie Would say. "Match in the Gas Tank. "BOOM BOOM"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was wonderful for me to watch. I like watching movies about people with different disabilities even if there not the main character. This is my favorite because it showed Leonardo Dicaprio is to me one of the only ones I believe that can act like there mentally challenged person, it was so believable that i didn't realize it was him at all, because i used to watch him on growing pains. I still think hes a good actor. But this performance was amazing and he portrayed someone that was severely mentally challenged. I am not as severe as his character is in the movie, but i do have a disability and I really hate it when people used the word retard its very hurtful because i still have people call me that once in awhile. I am slow at things, but i make sure i can do things on my own. "And the support of the family for Arnie to me was true to reality.</fullReview>

It definitely reminded me of my childhood days!! Every actor did his/her job the best they possibly could have. Depp, DiCaprio, Juliet Lewis and everyone else were so brilliant. The direction was simple but awesome. You will love the movie till the very end.And for me this was the best role played so far by DiCaprio.It is one of those movies which will definitely remind you of some of the best days you might have spent in a village/town.

		<shortDescription>This film always stays in my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film many many years ago. I bought it and watched it again and again. There is something very special about this film.I think I love the way it shows the contrast between freedom and bondage of responsibility. You can feel the sense of freedom in the landscape, in the horizon, in the sunset, on the country road. Gilbert is surrounded by all of this scenery of freedom but he has to carry on his shoulder the responsibility of an obese mother and a retarded brother. You can 'feel' the sense of longing in him, you can feel how much he wants to be free. However, Gilbert chooses to do the right thing. He doesn't run away from all of these responsibilities and just get himself out of the boring town. And in the end, freedom comes to him, at the right time. The ending is such a very, very beautiful ending.I love the cinematography. All the pictures in the film somehow sing and speak their own language. I love the acting of Jonhny Depp and Leonardo Dicaprio. They just simply be Gilbert and Arnie perfectly. I love the story very, very much. Every little detail matters. I love the way everything is such a perfect combination, a simple story that is delivered beautifully.This is a movie that I can never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about Gilbert Grape, whose life is troubled by his love, his mentally handicapped brother and his obese mother.I was particularly impressed by Leonardo DiCaprio's acting as a mentally handicapped person. He was so convincing, real and natural in his portrayal. The scene where the obese mother walked out of the police station was particularly memorable. I was impressed by the film's take on the stigma on obesity, and also the burden of the carers caused by a mentally handicapped person. Not many films handled these issues, and this film handled it with a touch of humanity. I realised that this film is not a film to enjoy, but to chew on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have ever watched. I can't find a word to describe how great this movie is.Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) is taking care of a mentally-retarded brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), his obese mother Bonnie, and two sisters in a small town of America. He is tired of being in small town, but he feels he can never leave because of his family. One day, a girl named Becky (Juliette Lewis) comes to the town and inspires him. He is attracted to her free personality and begins to think over about his life and hopes.I love this movie, but not only because of the actor and the actress. The story and the performance are amazing. Especially, Leonardo Dicaprio's performance is terrific. When I saw him performing Arnie for the first time, I thought he is really retarded. This is a touching and heart-warming movie. Gilbert's love for his family makes me feel warm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies of small town America, and actually one of the best dramas ever.Gilbert Grape, played by Johnny Depp, feels "anchored" to small town America where nothing happens. Despite his curiosity, he feels he must stay and take care of his mentally-retarded brother due to his mother's obesity and his father's suicide years before. But when the free-willed Becky comes through town, she catches Gilbert's curiosity in both her and the world outside....Though Gilbert is flawed, viewers are drawn into the movie because can they can identify with his love of his family yet the dream of escaping and finding a more exciting life. The plot is unpredictable and realistic. The performances are amazing all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a small town Gilbert Grape works as delivery man in a little store. He has two sisters, a younger brother and his mom. Mom is very fat and younger brother Arnie is mentally ill. Movie doesn't have a specific storyline to write about. Still there is so much in the film to watch. There are 4 tracks and every track has Gilbert in the center. Gilbert Grape is an interesting film about people who have responsibilities on their shoulders and how they don't even realize that they are living a mechanical life. Juliette lewis meets Gilbert as a traveler. Its a nice angle as Gilbert realizes through her what he is missing in life. He realizes his submission to everything is taken for granted. Its a very good movie and very entertaining too. Gilbert's fat mom's angle is fantastic and very novel. 'Food land' track looks out of place but jells in perfect by the end of the film. Pace of the film looks slow but its actually very fast. All the tracks are very interesting and well done.Johnny Depp as Gilbert Grape does a very good job. Caprio is unbelievably good. You just cant believe that he is not mentally retarded. I think I am becoming a big Caprio fan now. I liked him a lot in 'Catch me..' and 'Man in the Iron mask'. In this film he has proved that he is a gifted actor and deserves all the stardom he has. watch it for the film and actors. Johnny Depp and Caprio what else can you look for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"grape" of justified wrath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio first caught our attention as mentally retarded Arnie Grape, cared for by his brother Gilbert (Johnny Depp) in Endora*, Iowa. The movie shows how Gilbert is really in charge of the family, as their mother Bonnie (Darlene Cates) is dangerously overweight, and pretty much everything in their destitute world looks pretty grim. Among other things, there's a mega-store destroying the local place. A bleak movie, but with hope.Lasse Hallstrom brings to "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" the same great direction that he brought to "My Life as a Dog", "The Cider House Rules" and "Chocolat". It's a look at the whole failed state of things in the world. A truly great movie. Also starring Juliette Lewis and John C. Reilly.*While we were watching the movie, I thought that they were saying "Andorra", the country in the Pyrenees! Still, the town had the name of the "Bewitched" mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie belongs to Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no other way to say it, I love this movie. Johnny Depp gives what I consider his best performance ever. A performance that is overshadowed by DiCpario's Arnie, but one that I think establishes him as one of the best actors of his generation. Depp's Portrayal of the main character Gilbert, a sensitive, emotionally torn character that struggles with his duty to his family, and his own wants and desires in life, is so natural it's hard to see where the character begins and where Depp, himself, ends. I rented this movie back in '93 and am happy to say that I've been a devoted fan every since.The movie is an example of perfection. Great direction by Hallstrom along with a great script and great acting help to make this movie one of the most underrated movies of the '90's. The characters are real, conveying emotions that could be had by anyone who has ever felt that they needed more out of life, but needed that extra push to get them moving. And the setting could be any small town in America, which makes it even more relevant.The acting is great. Whenever I doubt DiCaprio's acting ability I always come back to his performance as Arnie and it makes me realize just how talented he is, even though sometimes it gets blurred by his good looks. John C. Reily, Juliette Lewis, Crispin Glover, and Mary Steenburgen all give excellent performances but the movie belongs to Depp. This movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Eating Him? The Story of Gilbert Grape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while a movie comes along worth reviewing, and in this case, the classic film What's Eating Gilbert Grape?. This film is an in depth look on how dreary life can be, and how so little can change it all. An amazing cast combined with a fantastic plot or lack of plot has made a beautiful film timeless in all respects. The story takes place in a remote town in the boonies of the United States. Stuck there is an adolescent man Gilbert who has to face his own life; one which is caught in a tangle to complicated relationships that he resents sorting out. Grape (Depp) is an excellent character who displays common human emotion, as well as his excessive kindness toward his disabled brother Arnie (DeCaprio). In fact, surprisingly, DeCaprio executes the role with such fluidity and achievement that one almost forgets all of his other terrible films (and I mean every single other one). Gilbert must face changing times, urbanization of rural America, and a nomadic girl who he develops sincere love for. The ideas that went into making this movie came together so well that I was taken aback ? the many banalities of Midwestern living were re-created with accuracy and grace. The changes that the characters went through were perfectly done. The filming was fantastic. The only question that remains ? what was eating Mr. Grape? Only the movie can tell. "Canola Oil. Now that's cutting edge. Your fries are crispier and tastier. That's the future." "It's going to take a crane to get her out" RATING: 10/10</fullReview>

The huge number of fans in so many countries who loved this movie for all the right reasons says a lot of good things about your fan base. No use repeating all their summaries and comments; almost all of the reviewers could see how great this movie is. But to add mine to the chorus: never has Leonardo di Caprio exceeded the acting artistry he brought to this film. The pathos and warmth all the actors and actresses brought to their roles and the very unique qualities of the roles themselves make this a movie like no other. The incredible operatic ending (the secret of which too many of your commentators let out) must be somewhere to unique in films. It's hard to believe that this stunning and wonderful picture went nowhere at the box office. No doubt its odd and strange title added to its non-acceptance. You'd have to go back to The Grapes of Wrath (1939)(another "grape" movie) to find another movie that pulls at your heart like this one does. Into the list of the greatest films ever made goes this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape is director Lasse Hallström's adaptation of Peter Hedges' strange but very moving story of a young man and his siblings who have to care for their widowed mother -- all 500 pounds of her. As her son Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) says, "She's a whale." Younger brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) is retarded and needs constant supervision -- he likes to climb water towers and like a cat he can't get down by himself. The film has many characters and sub plots involving Depp and a married woman (Mary Steenburgen) and Depp and a traveler through town (Juliette Lewis.) The cast is exceptional with John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover in interesting supporting roles. Anyone who saw Leonardo's performance knew he was destined for stardom. Not many people have see this box office flop but everyone who has seen it likes it. If you're a Johnny Depp fan and haven't seen What's Eating Gilbert Grape you'll enjoy him in it. Every character in the film is memorable and the acting from everyone is superb. The film is just terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small towns, old trucks, and people in all their eccentricities are what this movie is about. That and a host of other human qualities; the highs and lows of human emotion are showcased in this nearly two-hour movie.Gilbert Grape is a kid growing up on a small farmstead in a prairie state where the sky rolls on forever. He is 'saddled' with a retarded younger brother he helps care for and a depressed mother who ballooned to obesity after the suicide of her husband. Two sisters round out this cast of 'misfit' family members.The casting and acting are superbly done, the array of acting skills by the two principals in the film Johnny Depp playing Gilbert Grape and Leonardo DiCaprio playing his younger brother Arnie Grape are so amazingly executed that I was a bit transfixed at the performance.It is a heartrending tearjerker, allow yourself some time to sit through the whole two hours to enjoy and absorb it all in.I suppose sometimes it is the way we can identify with characters in a story that make us connect with the tale in a deeper way. There are many people in this movie that the folks in a small town would see reflected in the daily life of their community. This is a good movie for the whole family to enjoy.</fullReview>

I have worked with special needs children for nearly 20 years, and Leonardo DiCaprio gives an excellent performance as a mentally challenged teenager. His mannerisms and vocal inflection as Arnie were dead on. I had never been a DiCaprio fan until I watched this movie, now I see him in a completely different light. He SO deserved an Oscar for this performance. It puts that whole Dustin Hoffman/Rainman performance to shame.Beyond this outstanding performance is an incredible movie. What is eating Gilbert Grape indeed? Oh, just a loony housewife that wants him at every turn, a mother who requires as much care as a child and a mentally challenged brother who requires almost as much care as a toddler. What is not eating him alive is a better question. The anger culminates in a harsh scene with Arnie. That scene is so real it tears my heart out.Fabulous film, fantastic performances.

I work with a special needs child; very similar to Arnie though she cannot communicate as well and some people do not accept her; which is such a shame as she is a beautiful girl.Leonardo DiCaprio performance of Arnie was wonderful; it was such a joy to see Arnie's love for the simple things in life and the most dramatic for me was when Arnie found his mother dead. But I cannot go without saying what a wonderful performance was given by Mr Depp.....whose emotions were well acted...from the struggle to keep his brother Arnie out of mischief...to trying not to be ashamed of his mother. I just loved the way he hugged his mother after he came back to be at Arnie's birthday party; to me that was the highlight of the film...he truly was her "knight in shimmering armour" and she did appreciate him and loved him for his total love for Arnie; for children like Arnie and the girl I work with really do need total love; for then they can grow and blossom into the wonderful people that they are, and this movie really shows that from a family who have not so much worldly hardships, but mental and physical hardships with love and appreciation they can succeed."It's NICE to be IMPORTANT....but more IMPORTANT to be NICE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The award belongs to DiCaprio in this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I am not a very big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. The majority of the movies he's made have been sub-par and he tends to rely on his seemingly "bad-boy hearthrob" image through most of his movies (gag). However, in Gilbert Grape we saw the very essence of DiCaprio's talent and if it weren't for him, I daresay this movie would not be worth watching. In fact, for me, the *only* reason I continued to watch was because I was drawn to his character.Some people believe it is easy to play a "mentally deficient" person. I disagree. Actors run the risk of appearing as if they are merely making fun of a mentally challenged person rather than depicting one. Often times, the portrayal is a complete flop, leaving the viewer disgusted and annoyed (I am Sam). Such is not the case for DiCaprio's "Arnie" in Gilbert Grape. Having worked with the disabled for over 10 years, I have to say his portrayal was on the spot and certainly not overdone. From the constant repitition of various phrases, the contorting of his fingers, to the throaty, squeaky laugh, DiCaprio hits the nail square on the head. So you might be wondering why this seems like a DiCaprio review rather than a Gilbert Grape review. Basically, that's what this movie turns into...a DiCaprio film...because the viewer can't help but to totally focus on his character and set aside all the others.But, since this is supposed to be about the film itself, here goes: Johnny Depp was extremely flat throughout this film, citing lines with the utmost of monotony. Darlene Cates (although not really an actress, just a pick from a daytime talk tv show) was really only picked due to her size since the few lines she had were so poorly acted. Personally, I find that insulting: To only be picked for a movie *because* you are obese. Juliette Lewis is her typical self and although I like most of her work, in Gilbert Grape she just appears "typical". The storyline could have been compelling enough but the deep points of the movie were never really captured, nor expanded upon; leaving the movie to be another run-of-the-mill, tug-on-the-heartstrings big budgeted movie that was meant to be made for tv. So, we get back to DiCaprio who really was the only "big budget" performance of the bunch.If you're suffering from insomnia, it's 1am and this movie happens to be playing, then watch it. Or if you're interested in single performances rather than the movie as a whole, then watch this one...you'll enjoy the scenes with Arnie. However, if you're looking for something interesting, provoking, or even entertaining choose another.</fullReview>

I did not really want to see this film, especially since I always thought of Di Caprio as a bit of a talentless git. However I gained huge respect for his acting abilities after watching this.

		<fullReview>Bittersweet and poignant are two words to describe this film. The performances by every actor are magnificent especially the understated one of Johnny Depp. Even though many of his previous roles before this film were eccentric, he is the only one in his family who isn't. Leonardo DiCaprio though i don't like any of his other films i must say is remarkable as the role of Arnie Grape and should have one the Oscar for this role. Though Peter Hedges wrote the screenplay and the book, the two are very different. The book is more ironic and bitter but still very humourous. The film has in funny moments that come from the people themselves rather than clever remarks. In my opinion, one of the most funniest characters is Ken Carver and his interaction with his two sons. Probably some of the funniest dialogue in the whole movie. One thing that i am glad about this film is that Bonnie Grape (played by the marvelous Darlene Cates) is not made into a joke. That could have happened very easily if the film was given the Hollywood treatment. It is too bad that there aren't more films out there as endearing as this one. A good film to watch that makes you think. I also have to recommend the book. I read the book after viewing the film, and it is much different and you get more subplots with the characters that you don't get to see in the movie.</fullReview>

The mother, I can't remember her name, was excellent as a obese mother who feared leaving her own home because of the ridicule. While most of my friends view Juliette Lewis as a poor actress, I feel differently and use this movie as part of my rebuttal. The chemistry between her and Johnny Depp was wonderful. And speaking of another scorned actor... (cough, cough) Leo... He was even wonderful. It's truly sad the the only role where I found him convincing was one where he played a mentally challenged youth. If I offended anyone with this last comment you need not worry. I view every human being as truly exceptional, that is everyone except Leo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1/2 comedy 1/2 drama depp at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story which takes place in a small town, a town where gilbert grape has been raised with his family all his life. He wants something different, he just doesn't know what it is. Throughout the story gilbert deals with many things including the responcibility of taking care of his mentally retarded brother (well acted role by leonardo dicaprio), dealing with his 400+ pound mother,and also a married women who has gilbert deliver her groceries (oh ya, he works at the town market, where the big question is "What does the that other store have that we don't," refering to a tops internationional equivalant that was just put up near by. this also is part of the conformity of the old to the new)so that she can seduce him. All in all, this is the type of movie that cannot be catagorized into a plotline, it's just about perspectives. If i was to ask you what your life is about what would you say. And if i asked you what's your fmily like? well, you'd probably say crazy and i think gilbert grape would say exactly the same!Now don't think that this is a serious film because alot of humor is thrown into this. Humor is intertwined in what the say, how they say it, and the way they act. There's a great scene where arnie(leonardo) gets thrown into jail for being the jock he is and climbing the water tower for the 100th time, so the mother finally puts down the remote and goes into town, to the police station in the lop sided car their driving to bail him out. Great scene!!!johnny depp is the perfect actor for this film because he is talented enough to pull you into his characters life better than most actors. I once heard him described as the best looking gas station employee on the face of the Earth and that is just the man he is. This is one of the 100 best films ever made in my opinion so watch it TODAY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple movie exploring you... and relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' holds a mirror up to society and we, the audience, are forced to see our reflections in the dynamics of the Grape family. Set in the small ghost-like town of Endora, the Grape family are struggling to cope. Their burdens are becoming bigger, like Momma. Their frustrations are beginning to show, like the creaking foundations of the house.The film revolves around Gilbert Grape who runs an impassive life; a total emotionless character who has grown up with out a father yet turned out to be a replica of what his dad was. Gilbert is bored- bored with Endora, bored with his family and bored with his tasks, his role in the family routine. He wants more- not superficial things like he states to Becky but 'things' like escaping. Being swooped up and taken away, out of Endora to someplace else... someplace where he can live. Camoflauged in the long grass, Gilbert and his autistic brother Arnie watch Becky, an outsider, enter their world in her shimmering armour. Becky is a positive influence in the lives of the Grape family. She is a likeable character due to her naturalistic portrayal by Juliette Lewis. Unselfishly she changes the lives and life of the locals she meets in Endora.Gilbert and Becky are drawn to each other through fascination. Who is this girl? And why is this boy so plain? Gilbert, now connected with Becky, begins to release his frustrations and neglect his responsibilities. Since meeting Becky he shows emotion and his desire to escape becomes more evident... This is a simple movie on top- one that can be viewed on a single level (like many of this website's reviewers) or can be taken for what it is meant to be:- A thick blend of naturalism, intricate directorial decisions, fresh dialogue written with careful thought and brilliant performances by a beautiful, young cast. It provokes thought in the viewer's mind and questions who we are. How much do we want to escape and how much are we keeping inside... how much are you letting bubble up inside yourself until you snap, break out and get rescued by your knight in shimmering armour?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unconventional and a bit boring lovestory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each actor fits in his role very well, especially Leonardo di Caprio as the handicapped brother Arnie. The film "What's eating Gilbert Grape" is based on a novel ´by Peter Hedges and takes place in Endora, a small town in Iowa. The protagonist is Gilbert Grape, a young man acted by Johnny Depp who lives in Endora with his family: his corpulent mother, his two sisters and his handicapped brother Arnie. Gilber has a very boring and routine life; the only thing that breaks his everyday life is his affair with Mrs. Carver, a married woman. But one day Becky, acted by Juliette Lewis, appears in his life and everything changes. A wonderful lovestory slowly develops between them until Becky even saves Gilbert from his boring life. This film got many good reviews and also was nominated for the oscar. From my point of view the film was ok. It won't become my favourite film, although the actors and the idea of the story are very good. I think 12 years is a fitting age rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. When I first saw the film poster, I thought I wouldn't like it, but I do. Johnny Depp, alias Gilbert Grape, is a brilliant actor. He shows very well the question of conscience when he has to decide if he is going to meet Becky or look after Arnie. I think Leonardo di Caprio, who acted Arnie had the most difficult role in this movie, but he handled it very well. You nearly can't imagine that he is acted by a person, who is not disabled. I also think the music in this movie is very good chosen. In a way it shows how the people feel in a certain scene. The only thing I don't like about this film is the ending. In my opinion it's unrealistic that Becky and her grandmother are okay with taking Gilbert and Arnie with them on their tour. Of course, it's nice to have a happy ending, but I can't imagine that it would happen like that in reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an example of how people can have responsibilities unconsiously set upon them, as Gilbert does, bringing in the money for the family, taking care of his mother and brother without thanks from anyone.I can't quite work out if I like this movie. There's something vaguely disorientating about it, I'm not sure if that's the intention or not. Despite my respect for Johnny Depp, I think his performance in this movie isn't really up to his usual standard but the film's strong point is an outstanding performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.His portayal of Arnie, Gilbert's autistic brother is stunning and I can't work out why he didn't receive an Academy Award for it. DiCaprio may be a teenage heartthrob but he proves his already evident acting talent in this role. Personally I don't think much Of DiCaprio's personality but no-one can deny his talent and this performance outshines just about everything else he's ever done. He saves this otherwise strange movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DiCaprio delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I'm 3 years late on the DiCaprio bandwagon, but I'm on it, after my second viewing of `The Man in the Iron Mask'. He is, no doubt, a truly gifted actor who deserved not only his Oscar nomination for his brilliant and powerful portrayal as Arnie, he deserved the award itself. For me personally, his performance made the film. He didn't bring Arnie's retardedness over-the-top, as another actor may have done; he gave him a realistic touch of innocence and, to a certain extent, sweetness, that I think one would find really hard to dislike. The most poignant scene in the film is when Arnie turns 18 and goes upstairs to see his mother, who lays motionless on the bed. He doesn't understand that she is no longer living, and DiCaprio brings out his confusion and bewilderment with such clarification and skills, one can't help but ache along with him. I've not seen Tommy Lee Jones in `The Fugitive', but I really do not understand why DiCaprio wasn't awarded his Oscar; in my humble opinion, he deserved it more than anyone else nominated for the same category. A quietly touching film with a mainly terrific cast, `What's Eating Gilbert Grape' is definitely worth watching. This is one of the more realistic movies that are powered by its characters and not by its plot. Johnny Depp is suitably subdued as Gilbert, Darlene Cates is fantastic, and the two actresses who played the Grape girls (I forget their names) are good as well. The only gripe I have with the cast is Juliette Lewis. She doesn't seem to have a purpose in the movie, and sometimes the way she handles Arnie kind of gives off an off-handish feeling. She'd appear to be afraid of him one minute, and the next she's all caring and sisterly towards him, which really does not make sense to me. Maybe I simply didn't get it, but I rented the VHS, and at the back of the cover it says that Becky changed Gilbert's life. I'm kind of, you know, wondering...how?Despite that, `WEGG' is a good movie, and I would definitely recommend it to DiCaprio non-fans. It would certainly make you re-think your opinions on his abilities as an actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes incredible ability to effectively play a mentally handicapped person in my opinion, and Mr. DiCaprio nailed his role in this movie. The quality of Leonardo DiCaprio's work after this film seemed pale by comparison. Johnny Depp was his usual wonderful self and brought light a life to the lead character. I think Darlene Cates portrayal of Ms. Grape (Moma) was phenomenal. I don't know much about Ms. Cates but I understand this was her first movie role. From personal experience I know what terrible prejudice she must've faced just by being who she was/is. The story moves at an almost imperceptible pace at times - but it's so good that you don't mind. The directing and cinematography are both wonderful in this film. If you, like me have a penchant for movies that are not the same old same old, you will really enjoy this one. It's funny and happy and sad and just generally awe inspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Spoilers ahead**Let me say up front that I'm a fan of "traditional" movies. I despise little plot bombs like the one dropped on me in Chinatown (you know which one). I HATE getting hooked on great acting and having some horrible secret revealed that gives the whole film a disgusting taste (and keeps me from ever watching it again). I believe that it is possible for great stories to be told without distasteful twists in the tale.Well, I have to tell you that I kept waiting for a plot bomb here. This movie had me on the edge of my seat awaiting some horrible accident with one of the various dysfunctional family members, or some disgusting revelation.Instead, what we have here is a story that is warm, well-told, simple though with a twist or two tossed in, and sadly overlooked. Yet, the sense of something wrong in the background makes for a real nail-biter, at least the first time you see it.Johnny Depp: nicely understated. DeCaprio: amazing. Darlene Cates: impressive actress. Great triumphant exit. Mary Steenburgen: quietly brilliant, as usual. Juliette Lewis: wonderful. Kevin Tighe: a nice goofball. I remember you from Emergency!My first viewing was full of anxiety, waiting for something horrible to happen. My next will be much more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie, Johnny Depp plays a small-town loner, Gilbert Grape who has a lot of problems: a retarded brother, a morbidly obese mother, a seemingly perfect older sister, and a frustrated younger sister whom held a grudge against him. His life changes when he meets Becky (Juliette Lewis) a free-spirited young woman whom he falls in love with. I highly suggest this movie because it's enjoyable, and the characters and plot were very realistic and in depth. I especially liked Leonardo DiCapprio's performance as Arnie Grape, like Johnny Depp, he is a talented and innovative actor of his time. Too bad this movie was sort of underrated when it first came to theaters, it didn't really get the credit it deserved. All actors in this movie played their parts rather well.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one in several of great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, which proves that he is cast better in dramatic movies, or movies with a much more profoundly written screenplay than &lt;Titanic&gt; or &lt;The Beach&gt;. Depp is always good, but is the most likeable character in this story...and what a beautiful, coming-of-age story this is. With such a dysfunctional family, who would dare to look at them so honestly and find a sort of resolution, in the end? I believe this is a daring attempt, but it never fails to bring tears to my eyes. Obviously, Gilbert's mother is overweight, but would you dare to stoop to her level, feel her pain, and cry along with her. Yes, the family seems pathetic. But the story's told so believeably, with a very gentle mix of humor, (remember the way the car is lop-sided after Mama gets in) that you feel this family could be yours, too. And you feel so much for Gilbert. At the same time, we feel the only way he has taken so much of this type of life is because he is naturally, more selfless than the average person. SLIGHT SPOILER- So in the end, you also have a sense of wonder and new hope for Gilbert, if such a selfless person will now be able to do what he wants and not be pushed around. But the gut feeling is that, he will be the same exact person, but with more time for Arnie and his new love interest.Those who haven't seen this yet are missing something!-Sep</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not many films that I honestly view as perfect-- I'm generally very cynical and try to pick things apart on even the most fundamental levels. But every element of "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" is perfectly crafted and put together to emotionally wrenching effect.The acting here is flawless. Johnny Depp's multifaceted performance as the title character fully conveys the inner conflict that tears at his character-- a free spirit confined to working in a second-string market in a 'one-horse town.' Only his turn as Ed Wood showcases similar depth. Juliette Lewis, whose film selection hardly reflects her intrinsic acting talents, turns in an evocative performance as Becky, the 'wanderer' who attempts to understand the world in which she finds both herself and her soulmate. And Leonardo DiCaprio is absolutely brilliant as Arnie. There's no other word for it. Love him or not (and I usually fall into the latter category), his work in this film is THE best acting performance of the 1990s. Period. Anyone whose life has been touched by a special-needs child in ANY way will appreciate the innocence and the subtlety of his performance, which never slips into cariacature, as so many similar performances (re: Juliette Lewis in "The Other Sister") often do.While "WEGG" focuses primarily on its array of beautifully developed characters, it also has a great deal to say about life in general. It's not just a movie about what's eating Gilbert Grape-- it's a film that challenges the complacency that eats at ALL of us: the fact that so many people are unable to distinguish between the things that their souls YEARN to do, and the things that, because of whatever ties they are unable to sever, they are OBLIGATED to do. That's why the climactic scene involving the way that Gilbert chooses to handle his mother's death works on such a powerfully symbolic level. Very few films in the last decade(s) have been able to say SO much in one scene without a single line of dialogue.Everything in this movie thoughtfully builds toward its common theme. From the Mary Steenbergen character or the new Burger Barn to Arnie's climbs up the town water tower, the film is about finding different ways to break free. It's refreshing to find a movie that attempts to make such a profound statement without ever becoming trite or heavy-handed, and that's why "WEGG" is so affecting-- it allows you to apply its message to your own life, however you see fit.Fundamentally, "Gilbert" is an allegory about the confining worlds in which we find ourselves. On a broader scope, with its brilliant performances, dialogue (re: the brief but poignant encounter between Ms. Grape and Becky...), and powerful theme, it encourages us to challenge the way we view our own worlds... and to change them.Rating: 10 out of 10. One of just a handful of perfect movies out there. Hopefully, it will eventually earn the "classic" status that it so richly deserves.</fullReview>

It's a story of a small-town guy named Gilbert Grape, played by Johnny Depp. Gilbert has spent his entire life caring for his family which includes his dangerously overweight mother and his mentally challenged brother, Arnie. When Johnny falls in love, he soon finds it harder to deal with caring for his family. I found this movie to be wonderful. The acting was excellent, the story was beautiful, and I cried and laughed.

It makes the emotions and drama elements in this movie feel all very real.For fans of Scandinavian cinema this movie is nothing new. Movies like this are getting made for years now over there. "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" however reaches a wider range of people and make more people see the beauty and brilliance of slow cinema, in which everything is build up very slow and the story is told like a documentary like observation of the different characters.Man and was Leonardo DiCaprio brilliant in this! Even the most hardened DiCaprio hater should have to admit this. He is totally believable as a mentally-challenged young boy. He really stole the show. Also the rest of the cast is more than great. Johnny Depp is as good as always and Mary Steenburgen and Darlene Cates also know to impress.Yet the movie is more than just an emotional drama, it also knows how to be funny and entertaining about certain things at the right times without making the movie less powerful in any way.There really is nothing wrong with the piece of cinema brilliance and everything is simply perfect and works very well.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie set in the probably most boring place on earth, Endora, somewhere deep down in Iowa. The Grape family lives there and the strange characters of this family are the reason why "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is not as boring as the small town where something's "eating Gilbert Grape". Alongside Gilbert (Johnny Depp), who is about 20 years old, his obese mother (Darlene Cates), who has never left home since her husband's suicide seven years ago, and Arnie (Leonardo di Caprio), his 17 years old retarded brother, are the main family -members in this Indie-movie. Gilbert's life can hardly be described as thrilling except for the intimate meetings with married Mrs. Carver (i.e. delivering her some sperm after delivering what she has bought in the local grocery-store Gilbert works in). So he's really delighted when Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives at Endora with her grandma (Penelope Brenning) and their camping-van and the two young people fall in love with each other. But as the whole film is not the typical Hollywood stuff, their love story also isn't a typical one. They talk about Becky's uncommon definition of Love and also have their arguments, but nevertheless Becky is able to break the routine of the Grape's life. Swedish director Lasse Hallström has of course not created the era-defining movie the world was waiting for. But together with some convincing actors (especially Depp, di Caprio and Cates) he makes a quiet and slow but intense movie out of the novel by Peter Hedges and succeeds in showing real human characters and not just fat or retarded subjects. Therefore "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is despite it's quite bizarre setting a movie to tell something about everyone's life in a sometimes funny, sometimes sad but always touching way.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one might expect, since this is directed by Lasse Hallstrom and stars Johnny Depp, What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a well-constructed, totally offbeat, gentle and sensitive movie. It gets us deep within the souls and the psyches of a family of apparent losers in a nowhere town. Surprisingly and upliftingly, we gradually become acquainted not only with the trials and tribulations of the somewhat pathetic characters, but about their basic dignities and the sources of their strengths to go on. Almost needless to add about a Hallstrom movie, but the soundtrack and photography are both utterly exquisite. Newcomer Darlene Cates was not a professional actress but an actual obese agoraphobe who gives a magnificent performance as Depp's mother. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Depp's retarded younger brother. All the other cast members also give genuine and sensitive performance, another standout being Kevin Tighe as Mary Steenburgen's cuckolded husband who manages to drown in his children's wading pool!I highly recommend this offbeat and charming movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He's got a mother that weighs 400 pounds, or maybe it's 600. There's a married woman who can't keep her hands off of him whose husband would like to kill him. He's got a younger brother that is cuckoo, and he's responsible for him. He's got to take care of him. He works in a grocery store. His life is about groceries. Honk if you've got groceries...He's trapped in Endora, somewhere, probably Kansas or Nebraska or Iowa (actually filmed in Texas), somewhere in the heart of the Heartland--by the way this is the sort of American film that plays as a foreign film in, say, France or Sweden. Along comes Juliette Lewis who's a bit of a short-haired punk to his long-haired country ("Get in the car, longhair"). He is wallowing in self-pity and she sees it. "What about you?" she asks. "What do you want?" She attracts him and frightens him. She may make him upset his predictable life as Job. And then one day, he loses it and hits Arnie, and hits him again. Who can blame him? But you don't hurt Arnie. He is just a boy who will always be a boy.Johnny Depp is Gilbert Grape, Leonardo DiCaprio is Arnie, Mary Steenburgen is the married woman, Juliette Lewis is Becky and Darlene Cates is Mama. They all give sterling performances. The script and direction are flawless. You've probably seen bits and pieces of this movie on TV. See the whole thing. It is an outstanding flick. Gilbert is an America hero. He knows the good and the bad, and he always tries to do the good. But it's tough. Life is an embarrassment and a boredom, and when it isn't boring, it's scary emotionally. Depp is perfectly cast as a man whose loyalty to his family and his love for them has trapped him. And they are using him, and they don't appreciate him. His father disappeared. His older brother is gone. Gilbert has the responsibility. And he knows it. And he can't escape it.But it's hard, and when Becky comes along, she is something different. She is something he's never seen before. She isn't predictable, and she is striking. And she is smart and sensitive, like him.Don't answer the phone. Don't answer the door. This is a heartland masterpiece about real people living real lives, and director Lasse Halstrom (The Cider House Rules (1999) Chocolat (2000) after many Swedish films) doesn't flinch and he doesn't do clichés, and he gets it right. You will be moved.But see this for Johnny Depp and see why women love him.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>This odd little film gives us powerful performances, especially by Depp and DiCaprio. The off-beat story isn't as strange as it at first seems because everyone has the kinds of pains and joys that these characters experience.Life, death, loss, and everything else that people must deal with are presented in such a simple fashion as to deceive the viewer. But the point is made that life goes on with both laughs and tears.If you watch this film, don't be fooled by its seeming simplicity. There is a great deal going on here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilbert Grape is the primary provider for his fatherless family, especially his intellectually disabled brother.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is spectacular. The cutting edge of the dialogue is sharp and hits all the feels. The bareboned plot is part of the reason why this movie is so powerful. I may be one of those lame-os that's not got around to watching this until Leo won the Oscar, but I'm glad I came. Lots of people (probably people that haven't seen this movie) say that he should have won one for Titanic, but honestly he's infinitely more brilliant as Arnie Grape than as Jack Dawson. Titanic is like a game of pretend compared to this movie (no hate, I still love it). Also important to note, there's practically no other movie out there where intellectual disabilities are explored and treated with as much respect as it was treated in this movie. As much as you see the Grapes struggle with Arnie (occasionally physically) the way the writers, producers, and directors chose to portray Arnie as a character was fantastic. Cut scenes of him laughing and playing at the end of a tense scene. Treating him less as a sidekick and more as a secondary protagonist. It's so rare to see people with intellectual disabilities given the respect any other human being would get in the real world, let alone in pop culture. A+.Only critique I have is that the soundtrack is pretty lame. It went with the mood of the film pretty well, but like, it was kind of boring/not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the story about the emotional growth of a young man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story that describes the emotional growth of a young man. The main character whose name is Gilbert never left his hometown Endora since he was born. He has taken care of his brother, Arnie, who had a mental disability and his fat bulimic mother who has never gone out of home since her husband killed himself and two sisters. One day, he meets Becky who turns out to stay in Endora for a while because of a trailer breakdown.At first, the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio is really great. He played Arnie at the tender age of 15. However, he plays a boy with mental retardation naturally as if he were real retarded boy by devising his look and how to move his body. The acting of Johnny Depp is also excellent. Gilbert is bound his family, so he cannot leave Endora freely. Johnny Depp can express the kindness that Gilbert takes care of his brother and mother and the frustration that he wants to know the world out there. I think it's good scene that Gilbert changes his view of life by commune with Becky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see DiCaprio at his best, this is the film to see! As many times as I watch it, his portrayal of Arnie, a retarded soon to be 18 year old boy, never ceases to amaze me! His performance is captivating. DiCaprio becomes Arnie. This film is an extremely touching story of family loyalty, albeit dysfunctional family loyalty. The title character is played exceptionally well by Johnny Depp, but it is difficult to focus on anyone but Leonardo DiCaprio. The best scenes in the film are those between Depp and DiCaprio. Gilbert is Arnie's primary caretaker. His love for Arnie is undeniable but marred by frustration and on occasion, resentment that he has been saddled with the burden of being his brother's keeper.But for most of the movie Depp plays a kind of straight man to DiCaprio's goofball antics. They have a wonderful chemistry together, for not only do they mine some restrained comedy from these scenes, but they also ably portray a strong brotherly bond. Gilbert will care for Arnie till the day he dies; Arnie loves and trusts Gilbert, even if he has not the mental capacity to understand why. This is the most carefully crafted film I've ever seen. Every scene, almost every line, reinforces the theme and illuminates the main characters' motivations. In my opinion, "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" is as nearly perfect as play writing gets.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Emotional Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very seldom that a film comes along that can bring the true human emotion out of you and keep you entertained at the same time. This is exactly the case for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, where the main protagonist, Gilbert, played by Johnny Depp, has to deal with the aftermath of his father's death and trying to care of his mentally disabled brother, Arnie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his morbidly obese mother, played by Darlene Cates. Soon a girl named Becky, played by Juliette Lewis, springs up into town and catches the eye of Gilbert. The setting is the small fictional town of Endora, Iowa; Gilbert works for the town's slowly dying convenience store and he often makes deliveries to many of the locals around town. One of the locals that Gilbert consistently delivers to is Mrs. Carver. Played by Mary Steenburgen, whom plans on having an affair with Gilbert. The film is filled with emotion and it is interesting to see how the film is put together. Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio give great all around performances and they show great chemistry when on screen. Gilbert shows that he cares for Arnie and one quote that relates to this is when he says "You don't hurt Arnie, you just don't." This film is one that I would highly recommend anyone watch given the chance because What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape is for sure an underrated picture,Johnny Depp does a competent enough job but because of his choice of playing Grape as a numb individual could have made the movie a real snooze, but Depp's performance is actually a plus in the movie thanks to the show stealer performance from young Leonardo Dicaprio as Arnie a mentally challenged kid in the most believable, and in my opinion, best performance of his entire career. I've seen this movie after all the other Dicaprio's movies and if it wasn't for this I would not be able to believe that Dicaprio himself wasn't a mentally challenged kid because he brings so much to the table in this movie in such a simple way. I'm glad that he got an Oscar nod over this, because without that nod I probably wouldn't even know that this movie existed. The remaining characters are competent as well. Not the best movie ever made, not a masterpiece in my opinion, but a solid story that excels because of Leo's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt, Poignant &amp; Amusing In Equal Doses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heartfelt, poignant &amp; amusing in equal doses, What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a wonderfully crafted, sensibly narrated &amp; brilliantly acted coming-of-age drama that offers an intriguing glimpse into the everyday life of a dysfunctional family and is powered by stellar performances from Johnny Depp &amp; Leonardo DiCaprio.Set in a small American town, the story of What's Eating Gilbert Grape follows its titular character who has put his own life on shelf after his father's death in order to take care of his morbidly obese mother &amp; mentally disabled younger brother and has been struggling to make ends meet for his family but all of it is challenged when love enters Gilbert's life.Directed by Lasse Hallström, the film begins on a slow note and while the pace never really picks up at any given point, it does allow its characters to breathe freely &amp; adds sizeable depth to their arcs. The small-scale town life is elegantly captured and the lifeless surrounding further amplifies the hopeless situation our protagonist finds himself to be trapped in.However, the most impressive aspect of What's Eating Gilbert Grape is the input from both Johnny Depp &amp; Leonardo DiCaprio. Depp chips in with a highly layered performance that clearly expresses his character's inner turmoil but it's the then-young DiCaprio who effortlessly steals the show with a tender, effective &amp; thoroughly compelling work that will always be counted amongst his finest acts to date.On an overall scale, What's Eating Gilbert Grape expertly covers the themes of familial burdens, brotherhood, responsibility, caring, love, bonding &amp; self-awareness and is at its most enchanting when the screen is shared by Depp &amp; DiCaprio for their chemistry is absolutely spot-on here and easily overshadows the rest of the aspects. Although my experience with it was somewhat underwhelming, it's still worth a shot for DiCaprio's show-stopping turn alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional and more interesting than you might expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially, this movie would seem to be a pretty boring two hours. It doesn't have a terribly definitive external plot like people expect lots of movies to have. That's not to say that there's not a story there, but it's just not one that you could advertise well. Actually, one could make a case that it was spoofed by Napoleon Dynamite eleven years later since very little happens in either Midwestern town, but Endora is made laughable enough that there's nothing really to spoof.Gilbert seems a little bit like one of those characters who "didn't exist before the movie", but I think this is actually his Inactiveness. The quoted phrase above is typically used when critiquing how a character is written, but I think it actually holds true for Glibert as a person. We don't think he's existed prior to the events of the movie because he hasn't. He's just been content with his dead-end life and doesn't feel like making any change to it, not because he likes it, but because he's just never considered doing anything else. Throughout the story, we see him try to shed the burdens and responsibilities that his family has placed on him and begin to seek his own interests. His most prominent burden is his disabled brother Arnie. I get the feeling that if Arnie ever did die, Gilbert would then be able to handle practically any challenge that he faced for the rest of his life. Firstly, he would finally have the freedom to accept other responsibilities without having to worry about Arnie, and secondly he would have so much day-to-day experience with hardships and dealing with difficult people that other tasks would seem fairly easy to him. But all the same, Arnie's innocence makes him worth the workload and he provides emotional support for Gilbert like nobody else could. A less rewarding burden is Mrs. Grape, a lump of a woman who becomes the laughingstock of the town for her extreme obesity. The other two women in Gilbert's life are his adulterous lover Mrs. Carver and the out of town visitor Becky. Eventually, Becky's presence in his life makes Gilbert more aware of himself and helps him to bring his entire family to a better state of life (even in the form of Mrs. Grape's death). Mrs. Carver is probably the most hatable character (outside of maybe Ellen Grape) because of her poor parenting and how she takes advantage of Gilbert's problems. On the other hand, Becky is a breath of fresh air to everyone she meets, but you don't get the sense that she's a saint or anything. The acting was amazing all around. Obviously DiCaprio steals the show as Arnie, but the other actors deserve props as well. Johnny Depp didn't really have an opportunity here for a great performance, but he did well enough for the part he was in. The overall directing felt way ahead of its time. Without knowing the year, I would have guessed that this came out ten years later than it did. I especially liked the way the camera was positioned so that you were constantly aware of how much danger Arnie is in whenever he is in an elevated position. The script was pretty good with dialogue and the author did a good job adapting the screenplay; I could feel the care that was put into the action lines as they were performed on-screen. The score did a really good job capturing the mood of care-freeness when that was called for.As I said at the start, it might not seem that appealing, but I would encourage you to give it a try. It will most likely not be one of your favorite movies, but it will be a fairly enjoyable and enriching experience. I suppose if you like one of the actors featured, there's already some draw anyways. If that is the case, you will not be disappointed by DiCaprio, but know that it is a relatively low-key performance from Johnny Depp. Overall Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I have decided to watch all (nearly all) of Leonardo and Johnny Depp's movies. I have to say that this movie is unexpected because it does not have the elements of what I usually enjoy in movies (adventure, action, dramatic romance etc.). The story is simple. Everything about this movie is beyond simple, but it works because the performances from Johnny Depp and Leo (especially Leo) carries this movie. I cannot believe Leo did not win an Oscar for his role, Arnie. I have seen the Fugitive and I love Tommy Lee Jones, but I believe Leo deserved this Oscar. I, always, was outraged that he never won an Oscar, but now I truly understand how upsetting it is for him to not win the Oscars. He puts his everything in his performances. I love the brotherly bond of Gilbert and Arnie. It truly warmed my heart to see Gilbert take care of Arnie the way he did. The ending was so touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are predictable, but What's Eating Gilbert Grape truly breaks the limits of your expectations on what a good movie is. Nowadays, movies are either a slightly different take on a classic movie, or a predictable story line we have all seen a hundred times. This production didn't need to follow a grain, in that same sense, good movies don't follow any grain, but produce a new grain to be further followed. Likewise, with What's Eating Gilbert Grape,In one instant the simple reality of a family is changed. A girl comes into town, and ironically enough, brings chaos as well as clarity to the Grapes and their way of living.While watching this film I found myself asking not what's eating Gilbert grape, but, what defines who is and is not handicapped? There are dictionaries based around the conditions that can inhabit a person, each one with their own characteristics. What's Eating Gilbert Grape further establishes this concept into the sleeves of the real world, uncovering the truth in all humans, a trait we all have, and that is a handicap of our very own. From the opening scene to the credits, we are taken into the home of the Grapes, in the small town of Endora, and soon come to know the characters and their personalities as if they were our own flesh and blood. Most Importantly, there is Gilbert, the strong one, who brings home the bacon, provides for the family, and cares for his little brother Arnie, who has an intellectual disability. Although Arnie is incapable at times of achieving a task or completely understanding a concept, he breaks the criterion's based on him countless times, and through his ignorance of his handicapped, we too grow numb to where he falls short. In coming to know these characters and their predictable tomorrows, we are able to see the disabilities within the, so called, "normal" characters. There is the mother, who is trapped in her terrible eating habits, and forever confined to the sofa; from her condition, she is incapable of being the mother the family needs, therefore adding more to the plates of her children. Then there is Gilbert and his inability to think in terms of himself and what is best for him. All of this changes when Becky, the new girl, comes into town. In effect, Gilbert, for the first time ever, becomes aware of the dreams and future he could have, the things he could do with his life, and the love he has for Becky. With this groundbreaking discovery, Gilbert dives head first after the visions in his head. Putting his responsibilities on the back shelf, he falls in love, and starts seeing things in a different view. Soon enough, these unmet responsibilities catch up with him, and leave circumstances pleading for his call to action. Does he resort back to the person his family needs him to be, or does he go after the life he has now had a taste of?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Gilbert?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT Great Gilbert?Gilbert Grape is a young 19 year-old boy who lives in Endora. His father hung himself, which lead his mother to become an obese recluse who stays in the house eating and watching TV. His older brother ran away, leading Gilbert to become the man of the house. Working at their town's grocery store to provide for his mom, two sisters, and his handicapped brother Arnie. Gilbert (Jonny Depp) is a kind-hearted young man who tries his hardest to please everyone, which gets him into a lot of trouble.The first bit of trouble he gets into is with Mrs. Betty Carver, a lonely married woman with two sons, who calls Gilbert over to deliver her groceries, which leads them to fool around. Eventually, when Betty doesn't get what she wants from Gilbert, she ends up telling her husband. At the time he is meeting with Gilbert discussing his future and that without him Gilbert's family would be nowhere. This is ironic because I couldn't tell if he was threatening to kill him or was thanking him for his humility towards his family. Soon after, Mr. Carver ends up drowning and the whole town suspects Mrs.Carver. The affair leaves Gilbert feeling guilty and he blames himself for Mr. Carver's death. Mrs. Carver then takes her sons to Virginia to start a new life. I was glad because the story was better without her and her trampy drama.Arinie (Leonardo Dicaprio) brings a lot of tenderness and love to the film. In one scene Arnie doesn't want to take a bath due to his fear of drowning and Gilbert gets so frustrated he hits him a few times. This scene made my heart hurt. Later Gilbert expresses remorse to his friend Becky. Crying he says "You don't hit Albert, you just don't." Albert's character brings tenderness to the film because his disability makes him so innocent, yet everything he does gets him into trouble. Becky is seen in the first scene with her aunt. They are traveling around the states in an airstream and stop Endora because their truck is having problems. Beck befriends Arnie and Gilbert when they help drive her groceries to her trailer. Becky and Arnie's small fling shows the sweetness of young love and I believe it softens Gilbert's heart. They soon have to say goodbye once Betty's aunt fixes her truck. After mama decides to climbs the stairs, something completely different from her usual spot on the couch in front of the TV, she quietly dies as on her bed. The children don't know what to do when the EMT and policemen tell them they'll have to get a crane to lift her out of the house. Knowing this will cause a scene the children decide to light the house on fire. Most would think this is a very cruel thing to do but the children don't want their mother to die a joke, so they do what they have to. The ending scene was probably my favorite, as the children stand around watching the house they lived in their whole life burn to the ground, the house that both their parents died in. To me this symbolizes a new beginning for all of them, one with happier memories.This is a film is a classic, I would suggest to everyone of all ages. It is a wonderfully directed movie teaching a lesson on how to be tender hearted and patient like Gilbert.</fullReview>

His expressions, his mannerisms and his screams sounded so real that I was so mind blown of it all!Johnny Depp looked good with having long hair, he definitely looks pure country in which you would rarely see him look like that in his films! The women in the cast probably had their wishes come true whenever they had to kiss him! I found that his character never shouted throughout the film like he had a lot of problems at home and he did in some scenes, looking like he was gonna explode. It wasn't right for him to hit Arnie since he doesn't do anything bad but only shouts really. Whilst Leonardo thought it was fun, I say it was absolutely exhausting to be going all over the place in some scenes and shouting probably gave him a bigger headache too haha! I didn't like the arguments between the families and I say the reason why they always had the arguments was because of keeping Arnie safe and happy. Even though, Leonardo Dicaprio does not have a disability for real but he showed us extraordinary on what it would be like if we were in a disabled persons body!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's eating Gilbert Grape is my kind of movie, it's really a splendid film that I can't even believe that it only earned $10,000,000 when it was released at least based on the article I've read. Johnny Depp loves portraying Gilbert Grape not because it was Winona Ryder who showed him the novel but because he could relate to Gilbert himself and I think it is one of the reasons why the role is perfect for him; Darlene Cates who portrayed Bonnie Grape could also relate to her role because she never left her home for 5 years because of the same reason and the part where she told Gilbert that she didn't choose to be on her situation she told her own son the exact same thing at the end of her bed too and after knowing that I just can't help but be emotional on that part. Leonardo DiCaprio did such incredible job portraying Arnie Grape; before they started filming Leo spent time hanging out with kids who are mentally ill and he studied their mannerism -the flickering fingers, facial expressions and wiping the nose. It was incredible movie and all the characters are just amazing. This film deserves gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best I've ever seen.Story is superb and full of inspiration.Lasse Hallström is the director of the movie. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for My Life as a Dog and later for The Cider House Rules. What's Eating Gilbert Grape was his first notable American success movie.This is the one of the best movie of Leonardo and Johnny Depp. Leonardo DiCaprio said that playing Arnie was "the most fun I've ever had".Lasse Hallström picked Johnny Depp to play Gilbert Grape because of the way he can express so much emotion through his face and eyes. Focusing on the angst of an unwanted small-town life, follows the daily life of Gilbert Grape(Johnny Depp). Gilbert Grape is a small-town young man with a lot of responsibility.He lived in Endora with his family.He had one younger brother, 2 sisters and widowed mother. He also had one older brother (Larry) who passed away. Gilbert himself has a career as a delivery boy, working in the small, outmoded grocery store. He has an ongoing affair with local woman Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen). His older sister (Amy) did lots of household work and she also used to manage the elementary school cafeteria until it burned down last year. His chief concerns was his overweight mother(Darlene Cates) who hasn't leave the house from a long time. His mentally-challenged brother,Arnie(Leonardo Dicaprio), steals the heart of the audience. Doctors said Arnie will not lived to be Ten,but now he was on eighteen. Gilbert's life is turned around by the unexpected introduction of Juliette Lewis's Becky. Becky's free-spirited and optimistic take on life greatly influence's Gilbert's own life. Everyone did everything they could to protect their mother and their disturbed brother from outside influences and hurt feelings. And They stuck together until the end which actually became the beginning. WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE is deeply tragic yet deeply real tale of a complicated family stuck in a simple town. The performances of Johnny Depp, Leonardo Dicaprio, Darlene Cates and Juliette Lewis are unmatched and truly wonderful. It is a film mixed with comedy, drama, love and everyday emotion, perfected with beautiful cinematography and superb directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is Gilbert GREAT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting in this film, especially 18 year old Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as mentally challenged Arnie Grape, is absolutely extraordinary. A few mistakes here and there, but otherwise it is one of my favorite films. I've watched it three times and it never gets old. Never will. I must praise Mr DiCaprio more than the other actors/actresses in this movie because he really worked hard to nail this role. Even before the training, studying, etc... he had the crew wrapped around his dirty little fingers. The role belonged to him. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it. If they did, I would have never seen the movie. Why the Oscar didn't go to him, I don't know. The Academy treats him like just another Disney star, which he isn't. If it weren't for him, The Aviator, Revolutionary Road and other films wouldn't exist. I can't believe he hasn't won an Oscar yet. That's bull crap.Darlene Cates- wow. She really knows how to act, just like Leo. Crying, nailed it. Depression, nailed it. Demanding her son back from the police station, nailed it. Being beautiful, nailed it. How she managed to keep her eyes closed and stay still while Arnie shook her and yelled in her ear, that's incredible. Like Titanic, this movie deserves well over ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grapes are a dysfunctional but nevertheless happy family, living in Endora, a small town "where nothing ever happens and nothing ever will" says Gilbert, who narrates the movie. Gilbert is the oldest son in the Grape family, and since his father committed suicide seventeen years ago Gilbert has become the man of the house, looking after his morbidly obese mom Bonnie and mentally challenged brother Arnie, while his two sisters pitch in to help whenever they can. Gilbert wants nothing more than to leave Endora's small town lifestyle, and when he meets Becky and her grandmother after their trailer breaks down near his house, his life changes, as does the rest of Endora. Chain stores like Foodland and Burger Barn start threatening the business of the grocery store where he works. Arnie's 18th birthday is coming up. Bonnie might actually leave the house after seven years, and Gilbert might end up a better person from his experiences.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an excellent drama, funny and sad all at once, without getting preachy or annoying. Johnny Depp isn't really an actor I'm a fan of, mainly because he's always playing the exact same gothy-emo roles in movies ever since Tim Burton had him acting in films, but Gilbert Grape is an exception, he was great in this role, not donning bad Halloween makeup as usual but instead playing a solemn, small-town guy trying to make sense of his life and the lives of those around him. However, the two best actors in the movie in my opinion were Darlene Cates (who played Bonnie Grape) and Leonardo DiCaprio (who played Arnie Grape). Darlene Cates, who is obese in reality as well, also does self-esteem and weight seminars at children's schools and the character Bonnie Grape points out that nobody who is obese ever asked to be obese, it comes with a lot of troubles but Bonnie is a very caring and loving mother and kid person regardless of her weight. It's sad to see how Gilbert loses his grocery boy job, and today many small town businesses are being shoved aside by Wal-Marts, Targets, Toys R' Us' and Starbucks, it's sad but it's true, the modern world is all disposable, and in the modern world people matter much less than profit.This is a movie everyone should get the chance to watch, it's definitely worth it. I think it was based off a novel but I can't remember, if it is an adaptation of a book then I've gotta say, they did a great job with it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geeky Randy's summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very well-made film based on the 1991 novel of the same name about an Iowa family and how they try to make the best of things despite their many misfortunes. Depp, in the titular role, leads the rest of the strong cast through an enjoyable story that evolves nicely through brilliant character development instead of action. Kudos for being far less melodramatic than it could have been. The ending kind of makes it seem like all the Grape Family's problems are brought on by the mother (with first-timer Cates delivering like a pro), yet it doesn't seem like that was Hedges and/or Hallström's intentions.***?

		<shortDescription>A Story That Spreads the Warmth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people talk about Leonardo DiCaprio and his films, they seem to overlook this film, What's Eating Gilbert Grape. While the film takes it time and can be overly melodramatic, this is an excellent drama that will make you cry, make you happy, and will as hell sure make an imprint in your memory. It's about the small-town friendship and most of all, it's about family bonding. This film has a beautiful script and many of these quotes are actually quite memorable.Lasse Hallstrom's film is about a twenty-year-old named Gilbert Grape who is nearly fed up with his small-town life. He has a mother who weighs nearly five hundred pounds and is the joke of the town. He has two sisters and a special-needs brother that he constantly cares for. He works for a small grocery and he satisfies the need of a lonely mother while her husband is away at work. But when a camper girl named Becky comes to town, a romance is blossomed and now Gilbert is at the ultimate life stage.The acting is absolutely tremendous. Johnny Depp, in one of his few straight-forward roles, does a fantastic job as the depressed man who cares for his family. I think the real standout is Leonardo DiCaprio. Without this role, I don't believe we would have gotten the future films of his that we all come to love. That being said, this as well may be Leo's best performance and he has given many. There are also great performances from Darlene Cates, Mary Steenburgen, and Juliette Lewis.Overall, What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a film that stands out in the very crowded year of 1993. Of such films like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Philadelphia, and Carlito's Way, this film may be my favorite. It will provide you with a range of emotions whether it's laughter or sadness and this film excels in provoking emotion. It's a little predictable, but then again almost every drama is. Thanks to a magnificent script and fantastic acting all across the board, this is one of the best dramas ever made. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, I think all the actors do a good job and I think that this is a prime example of how movies don't have to be action packed to be interesting. The plot is very interesting, different, and odd in the best ways.And then there's Leo. As a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio in general, I think this film not only is the first to shine a light on his amazing talent, but that this is still his one of his best performances ever. I am shocked and almost offended that he did not win an Oscar.Leo is truly authentic and honest in the role, and that not only shows that he is a fantastic actor but that he had an impressive amount of maturity and class to tackle this role the way he did, especially at such a young age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd, enjoyable, and slightly mesmeric experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape will inevitably be remembered mainly for it's cast, who now form a sizeable part of the Hollywood elite. Inevitable, but perhaps a shame, as it's an intriguing film in its own right.There's no denying it however, the cast is incredible. It's not just a disgustingly young Leo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp, it's also Juliette Lewis, John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover of Back to the Future fame.It tells the story of Gilbert Grape (Depp on fine monosyllabic form), his disabled brother Arnie (DiCaprio, who steals the show) and 'worldly' girl Becky (Lewis), Gilbert's love interest who travels around the country with her grandmother. It's a meandering film, full of odd little touches - the mother who is so fat that the floor of her house can barely hold her weight; Arnie, who likes to climb as high as he can at every opportunity, and the little faux-philosophical gems that Gilbert grants us.If you're looking for a rip-roaring narrative and non-stop action, this is not the film for you. As Gilbert tells us early on, nothing really happens in the small town he lives in. What little plot there is circles around Gilbert's dilemma - his duty to care for his brother Arnie and to help his gargantuan, housebound mother; and the promised excitement and escape of a romance with the exotic Becky.It's also about acceptance - both Arnie and his mother are outcasts, yet it's the mother and her titanic size that provokes the most open ridicule. People openly take pictures, stare and laugh at her in a way they would never do with Arnie, who is accepted and liked for all his eccentricities.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an odd experience, but an enjoyable, and slightly mesmeric one. It evokes a rather beautiful sense of small town simplicity that makes me despair of the urbane cynicism of modern London.</fullReview>

I'm not a big fan of movies that have no action in them, though.My confusion is, if the movie was about a girl that came into his life and he was conflicted between helping his family and taking care of his brother or just going along with her...then why was she only in like 10% of the movie?Bottom line is, great story, great plot, but too slow for me to watch more than once...there wasn't any excitement.BIG props to Leonardo DiCaprio for his fantastic acting skills, I was amazed at what he could do at such a young age in his acting career and I appreciate him more as an actor now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Great as I Hoped it Would Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape? is a good movie but it's not great. Since two of my all time favourite actors are in it (the amazing Johnny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio who I didn't even know was nominated for an Oscar in this) I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. Maybe I set my expectations too high and set myself up for disappointment. Depp is really good, not as awesome as usual but he's younger and did a very good job. Di Caprio does very well and I would say awesome for his age as a mentally challenged boy. The movie is basically about Depp dealing with his family (brother Di Caprio and an extremely overweight mother who is so big Depp literally has to put support beams up in the basement and can not fit through her house's doors. I don't want to wreck the ending, it's very good, the mother is a good actress. It's one of those things where the parts are better than the movie they add up to be if that makes sense. Direction/writing I suspect could have been better. But the ending is emotional and a good way to leave off the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know there are a lot of movies to watch. But one Night I stumbled upon this DVD in my friends collection. This movie is quite personal to me. I know what it means to stick around for the family, and how trapped you are, as the eldest son.I like the way in which the movie is set, a small lonely country town, far away from the urban fuzz. A mother who has let herself go, and her two elder kids who work hard to make the ends meet, a challenged 3rd, and a 16old last girl. Elder son has to work for the bread, he is actually shown as if he is replacing his deceased father, but when he looks for his future calling(a girl) he is facing a dilemma whether to just quit or to stick around. I just like the acting, DiCaprio is a prodigy, such a great performance at such an young age. And Johnny Depp has proved it time and again that he can do it in his way, Great.I suggest, you pull your brother, your sister and your parents in, and give this movie its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful drama set in a some where little happens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endora, a small town in rural Iowa, is home to Gilbert Grape and his family. After his father committed suicide some time earlier his mother fell into a state of depression and became morbidly obese; now she doesn't even leave the house and his younger brother Arnie is mentally disabled. It is up to Gilbert and his to sisters to look after there mother and Arnie. Gilbert acts as friend and protector to his brother; it isn't easy though as he is almost eighteen but has the mind of a young child... when a child in the body of an eighteen year old decides to be naughty it can be difficult for those around him. Arnie loves climbing; he spends much of his time up various trees, he also loves climbing the town's water tower; he finds it exciting but it is obviously very dangerous. Not much happens in Endora; in fact so little happens that watching the procession of holiday makers' trailers each year is one of the things Arnie looks forward to; this year one of them will have quite of an effect on them; Becky and her mother are travelling through when their car breaks down; it will take a week or so to get the part they need and in that time Becky will have quite an effect on Gilbert.If you are looking for action and excitement or a constant stream of laughs then this isn't the film for you; however if you want a gentle story with characters who seem real, with moments of comedy, romance and tragedy then this might be just the film you are looking for. The film has a melancholy feel; Endora feels like a town that time passed by; less and less people go to the grocery store Gilbert works at because a new out of town shopping centre has been built and Gilbert's friend Tucker sees the arrival of a new Burger Barn way of getting a job with good prospects! It isn't all downbeat though; Arnie's childlike enthusiasm for life is heart-warming even if his condition makes things difficult for his family and the arrival of Becky, a beautiful girl who will only be there a week or so clearly lightens Gilbert's mood. The cast does a fine job; Johnny Depp puts in a nicely restrained performance as Gilbert; Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Arnie; one of the best performances I've seen him give and Juliette Lewis was just right as Becky; there was something almost ethereal about her which was ideal for a character who was just passing though. Also of note is Darlene Cates who put in a fine performance as the mother despite not acting before this film. Over the course of the film expect to laugh and cry but ultimately be left with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when it played in theaters 19 years ago, and I thought it was amazing. I rented it yesterday, to watch it again, and I still am amazed. I won't discuss the plot, except to say that it was low-key, motivated and (most important) believable. Despite the title, the film is not a wacky comedy, and I would not call it particularly light-hearted. Some very serious ideas were presented without the trappings of drama.The acting was remarkable, especially for being so understated. Darlene Cates gave a very brave performance, especially in light of the fact that she was not cast for her acting abilities. Leonardo DiCaprio has never given a better performance. Some critics referred to his character as being lovable. No, not at all. The character is obviously child-like, but an extreme amount of patience was required in dealing with this adult child, and that was a major theme of this film. DiCaprio put this across with no apparent effort, and there was not a glimpse of the actor asking for audience approval.After seeing DiCaprio in this film, I was rather dismayed when he subsequently got into his "teen idol" phase, which TG was just a phase. If you've been a fan of his acting and have not seen this film, you are in store for a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about many things but one of them is fatness. It does not cover the enormity (no pun intended) of the tragic being fat but it does more than most films, who all seriously suggest that the people being fat somehow want to be fat and that they just had to eat a little less in order to loose weight - not a word about the fact that many copiously fat people die while dieting, because they have to go so far in dieting before anything happens.Instead you have all these movies and "science" about the poor alcoholics. If alcoholism to 90% is an affliction that punishes the surroundings of a person and to a far lesser extent the person itself, who (if he does not belong to the unfortunate 10 %) can live to a very ripe age indeed, then the abuse of food is an affliction that punishes the person itself but not his surroundings. Alcoholism is aggression turned outwards and food-abuse aggression turned inwards.In alcoholism there mustn't be any melancholia involved - usually it's just about an extremely selfish person who gives a hooting hell about other people. In food-abuse and extreme fatness there is always deep melancholia involved, which however is seldom played out against the surroundings.Now, alcoholism as other drug abuse, is the abuse of the rich and powerful - hence all the sentimentality about it.Food-abuse is usually the abuse of the poor, who try to get along in impossible situations. Food-abusers get ridiculed just like the poor always get ridiculed and abused by the rich.If a fat person is too fat to be operated upon, he is allowed to go to a resort, paid for by the state, where his or her weight is reduced to just the weight that the operating table can carry. He could go on in the resort not needing the operation at all but since that would mean that he would probably have to return to the resort every 5 years or so, this is considered far too expensive. Society rather cripples the person by removing guts than truly help him.We will still have to wait for a truly fair film about fatness but this film is definitely a step in the right direction and Johnny Depp was never better than in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What do you want for you? Just for you?"Small town life can be complicated. Even more so for Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) than the rest of us. He has a annoying and immature younger sister, a morbidly obese mother, the shadow of his father's suicide still hangs over his family, he has a complicated relationship with an older, married woman, and there's a new girl (Juliette Lewis) in town who's full of experiences of life beyond the area where Gilbert feels he may be stuck forever.&nbsp;Added to all that, Gilbert has a younger brother (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is mentally handicapped, and who unintentionally provides challenges and additional stress for Gilbert and his family. So, what's eating Gilbert Grape? A lot.I found the movie to be a pleasant surprise, even though I'm not typically into this sort of thing. Depp may not exactly fit his character physically, but as far as the acting goes, he was great. Genuine, expressive, and relatable. As were all the actors, especially DiCaprio. This is one of those movies where you can't help but sympathize with the characters, and even feel a lot of what they're feeling, yourself. The drama never becomes cloying or sappy, there are no artificial attempts to tug at your heartstrings, and as a result, the story feels refreshingly organic.

No way my life is in crossroads as it is for Gilbert but have just been afraid to live life to the full. Coming back to the film, there aren't many other films with characters so honest and emotions so sincere. I mean, the entire movie itself is about a bunch of characters trying to figure out what they wanna do. Rather than a movie with a distinct plot, it's more of a character study. I've loved movies about dysfunctional families, but this isn't just another one of them. This is probably the best of them along with The Royal Tenenbaums.And this film will probably be in my top 20 list, if not, definitely in top 30.

		<shortDescription>Undeniable charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a slight, yet undeniably charming film. For a movie with so much grief, it is actually rather heartwarming. A little too long, but it is still a wonderful film.Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) lives with his family in Endora, Iowa. It's a tiny town in the middle of nowhere with a population that would have trouble reaching the triple digits. Gilbert's family is in shambles; the father is dead, his mother is too obese to care for her children, and his brother, Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Therefore, Gilbert takes it upon himself to keep his family together. But then one day, a girl named Becky (Juliette Lewis) and her grandmother become stuck in Endora with a car that won't work. Gilbert and Becky fall for each other, but their romance just might damage the status quo that Gilbert has worked so hard to keep.There's really not much of a story in this film. It's all about the characters, and they are richly developed and superbly acted. Johnny Depp is known for his extraordinary versatility, and his penchant for playing off the wall characters (Jack Sparrow and Sweeney Todd, just to name a few). But Depp is quite effective in a subdued, low-key performance as Gilbert. Gilbert is a guy who does everything for everyone else, but nothing for himself. Only when Becky enters the picture does he begin to realize that he has his own wants and desires as well. His co-star, Juliette Lewis, is equally impressive as the flighty yet kind Becky. She's a free spirit, something that the tied-down Gilbert longs to be.The lion's share of the acting acclaim has to go to Leonardo DiCaprio. At age 19, DiCaprio gives the performance of a lifetime as Arnie. He portrays every facet of the character so well, that it is simply jaw-dropping to watch. From the excited squeals to the difficulty talking to the awkward hand movements, DiCaprio nails it, and had the film been released at another year, he would undoubtedly have won an Oscar for his performance (he did receive a nomination, however).Lasse Halstrom is an interesting director. His films are highly character-based, and all have a mixture of charm and sadness. Although it's not as deliciously warm as his later effort, "Chocolat," it does have a warm, pleasant feeling that pervades the film."What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is a film that requires patience. Not much actually happens, but for those who can appreciate character over plot, this is an excellent choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grape Family Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp whose penchant for quirky and unusual characters is a hallmark of his career plays a fairly normal kid in the title role of What's Eating Gilbert Grape. What's eating him is that he's stuck in the role of family breadwinner, guardian to his younger siblings, and in a most nowhere job. The future isn't looking up.It all kind of devolved on him naturally when years ago his father just up and left the family one day without warning, or at least without warning to a child. His mother Darlene Cates grew morbidly obese, ballooning up to 500 pounds, his sisters are having the usual adolescent problems. But his mentally retarded brother Leonardo DiCaprio who is the real problem. He needs constant watching every minute, something Cates just can't do, she can't even get up to the second story of the Grape family home. It all falls on Depp.Not that there aren't certain compensations for him, Mary Steenburgen asks for him to make special deliveries to her house when husband Kevin Tighe is at the office. But life is generally drab in Iowa for him until Juliette Lewis's trailer breaks down in the Grape neighborhood. When Depp gets involved with her she points him in the direction of a much wider world, something we all need to realize at some point in our lives.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is distinguished mostly for the Academy Award nomination it received for Leonardo DiCaprio for playing the mentally retarded Arnie Grape. DiCaprio is unbelievably convincing as a retarded kid, to think almost a decade later he'd be playing Howard Hughes on the big screen. But part of his performance is no doubt due to Johnny Depp as well. Most of DiCaprio's scenes are with Depp and they bring the best out in each other. Very much like Rain Man with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman.Both DiCaprio and Depp have gone on to give the movie-going public a wide variety of roles to see them in. But they are something special in What's Eating Gilbert Grape.</fullReview>

Still the way movie goes over and ends is really close to heart and touching The best thing in the movie is all it characters which nearly seem to be perfect. No one other than Johnny Depp could have been better to play Gilbert Grape and I am amazed at the acting skills of Leonardo Di caprio at such a age who has played Arnie Grape, kind of retard fellow.

		<fullReview>"What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is a movie that shows the struggle of a family, because their father left them and the children have to take care of their obese mother who cannot get around. In the movie Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) is the man of the house. Gilbert works at the local grocery store to support the family. He also has to take care of his younger brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is suffering with autism. Gilbert has no time to himself, but when Becky (Juliette Lewis) comes along things started to change. Every time Gilbert would go somewhere he takes Arnie with him, so eventually Arnie has a special bond with Becky.The director Lasse Hallstrom delivers the message that it takes more than one person to take care of a child who is mentally disabled. Gilbert was always having a hard time taking care of Arnie. Every time Gilbert would turn his head when they were in town, Arnie would climb up the water tower and then they would get in trouble by the police officers. When Becky came into Gilbert's life, he always takes Arnie with him everywhere he goes. One time when Gilbert tried letting Arnie take a bath by himself, so he could meet up with Becky, Arnie stayed in the bath tub all night because he didn't know what to do. So that was the end of leaving Arnie by himself.My favorite part of the movie is the night before Arnie's birthday party. Arnie and Gilbert were arguing because Arnie did not want to take a bath because of the incidence when Gilbert left him in the tub all night. So Arnie ran away and went to Becky's house. Gilbert and his sisters went and looked for Arnie all night; they eventually found him swimming in the lake with Becky. It shows that he has a strong connection with Becky and he trusts in her. Another good part in the movie is when Arnie climbs on the water tower and Gilbert sings to him, and that made Arnie want to come down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances A True Classic Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a big fan of Johnny Depp's and think that this is one of his best films. It's quirky, funny, and full of memorable and likable characters. The story is pretty straight forward Johnny Depp plays Gilbert Grape a twenty something stuck with his very weird family in the small town of Endora, I really like Depp's opening narration describing Endora. Leonardo Dicaprio gives an Oscar worthy performance as his mentally challenged brother Arnie. There are so many memorable scenes in this film that I can't really just talk about one so I will end the review just by saying that if you haven't seen the film yet you are in for a treat.</fullReview>

All these assessments are wrong you understand the level of bad opinion of this site. Only films for intellectuals can be saved. This film was produced with many dollars and the optimal use of special effects make the place as among the best science fiction film Americans. Finitela of using double standards when judged as a movie, try to be objective because they give 3.8 a film of its kind and reward a crap how terrible sin city with 8.2 is really a 'offense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here it is, a PERFECT film. I first saw WEGG when I was 5, and I've always remembered it since. A beautiful comedy-drama that has a gentle honesty that's rare in films of its type. I can identify with every character-- even the minor characters are so well-drawn that we can relate to them. I live in a small town, and we have the funeral director who is constantly eyeing off new clients! And who doesn't know an attention-starved 15 year old girl, or the sad "town freak" who everyone gossips about? This is still Johnny Depp's best performance, he's never been so natural on-screen as he is here as Gilbert Grape. It sounds totally politically incorrect, but seeing Leo Di Caprio, its hard not to believe he isn't mentally disabled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely the best film concerning family issues and goes beyond it.I heard of it long time ago but watched it only last week.Thank god I didn't miss this great work.I won't elaborate on the plot as it's not complex.However,the psychological struggle of the main characters(especially Gilbert)is.Having been stuck in a boring and small town,the life is hopeless for most residents and it is particularly difficult for the Grapes.Obese mom,willful Ellen and retarded Arnie...it is a highly dysfunctional family that,to make it worse,largely depend on the only 'man' at home-Gilbert.Having to shoulder all the responsibilities,Gilbert must,for most of the time,take care of others and when love comes,the only thing he's supposed to do is to repress himself and leave.While life treats him so cruelly,he has somehow learned the truth of life and become more mature,caring and stronger.He knows that he can feel frustrated and angry sometimes,but after the fury and tears,he has to get back up again and move on.That's what happens in the end when mom dies unexpectedly,Gilbert decides to defend his mom's dignity by burning down the house.Now they MUST move on as there's no longer a place to settle down.Isn't it better? The ending of the film heralds a brighter prospect that neutralizes the previous depression.One thing that makes this film outstanding is its sincerity and simplicity.The troublesome family issues,the lost and re-found love,the joys and sorrows in our lives,the ambivalence towards some very close persons...all these are so true and are things we all could identify with.In films like this,no special effects are necessary,hyperbolic acting will be a disaster.Fortunately we have awesome Depp and particularly Leo...the former keeps his excellence by playing a mentally-afflicted role while the latter impresses us with a marvelous acting that enriches this bittersweet story.High respect to all the actors that grasp the inner world of the characters so well.Equally high respect to the scores in this film-they simply add to the emotional power.All in all, this is a film that mainly concerns family issues but is by no means limited to it.It's a hymn to life,to being strong and selfless.Gilbert is a hero in an ordinary life,anyone likes him is.Cry,then move on,cos life goes on and we're forever on the road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title's question is soon answered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't have to get very far into this movie to see what's eating Gilbert Grape. Absent a father in the family, he has a mentally disabled brother and a 500 pound mother to deal with and be responsible for. It's a testament to his good nature that he is not only coping with this, but he has strong bonds with both brother and mother. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Gilbert's brother Arnie with a perfect balance for us to see how difficult he is to deal with, but why he is lovable. Any more disabled and he would probably have to be institutionalized and any less so he would not present the personal challenges for Gilbert that are at the crux of this movie. DiCaprio's performance is an amazing feat of acting.Depp plays Gilbert with such quiet, gentle charm that you hardly know he is acting (maybe he isn't?) His presence is a counterbalance to the chaos in his household. However, he can be pushed beyond his limits and that made him more real to me - he is not a saint. We are left to wonder if Gilbert's personality has been shaped by his environment as a coping mechanism or whether he is intrinsically disposed to making the best of difficult situations. I think the latter.The people are not stereotyped and we come to understand and care for them. There are similarities here with "The Last Picture Show," with the events taking place in a small run-down town, the relationship between the brothers, Gilbert's liaison with a married woman, and people just trying to play the hands they have been dealt as best they can. Juilette Lewis, as Gilbert's ultimate love interest is rather one-dimensional compared to the rest of the characters.What if you were in Gilbert's situation? Would you be as responsible, accepting and understanding?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a beautifully shot movie that is set amongst the fictional working class one street town of Endora. With its cynically renamed ENDora OF THE LINE Drug Store, the almost deserted dairy dreme ice cream parlour and the exceedingly unused Lamson's Grocery shop, life in Endora, Iowa and it population of just 1,901, is motionless.This is Gilbert Grape's story, and his recollection of what was to be just another ordinary and uneventful moment in the life of him, his family and his, almost sleepy, town. Centred around the Grape family, sisters Ellen and Amy and their two brothers Arnie and Gilbert, who, along with their widowed mother, morbidly obese Bonnie Grape are striving to survive and coexist with the absence of a father figure, low waged work and seventeen-year-old Arnie's severe mental condition.It is in this awkward and extremely one sided affair that the unfortunate sibling Gilbert (Johnny Depp) has to constantly watch over his younger brother Arnie, played to such depth and conviction by a very young Leonardo DiCaprio, while still holding down a job for Lamson's Groceries and looking after, also, their housebound mother. Gilbert's life, his future, his dreams is thwarted, he know this, but it is in this Guardian Angel that his love and bond for Arnie, and his family, cannot, and will not, be let go.That is until the free spirited Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives in town, and stranded with her grandmother for the week while waiting for parts for their vehicle. This realisation, this new fresh face unties new feelings, new thoughts and new hope for the put upon Gilbert, something new is eating Gilbert Grape.Iowa born Peter Hedges (b. 1962) novel has been turned into a fine work of emotional art, with the reassuring and delicate touch from Swedish director Lasse Hallström (b. 1942). While the dialogue is somewhat nondescript, but at the same time is never wasted on distractive trivialities, it is the inner core of the narrative that projects What's Eating Gilbert Grape as a tender and caring movie of self-sacrifice, devoted love and long full companionship.The cast here are all relatively young, a younger than nineteen looking DiCaprio and Lewis, with its much more than capable co-stars. This gifted young cast are individually exceptional and hold their qualities well; to the point that at times we are mistaken for thinking we are seeing more home video than movie. Rita Darlene Guthrie's (b. 1947) first acting role is astounding, her natural instinctive character, as mother Grape, protrudes more than we expect, as the backbone of this family, she holds together a family of highly individual children under one union, and their respect and love. We are also seeing their new and young lives unfold before us, and the inevitable hand of fate that both bad timing and misplaced destiny has dealt them.This movie ties us in with compassion and enlightenment through it main character Arnie, here we are given an insight into the daily responsibilities of this family toward his special needs. DiCaprio excels himself as the much loved youngster whose unintentional care-free and more than often care-less mind can at times bring domestic harmonies to boiling point and, sadly, beyond breaking point, even for the closest of families. Often surprising, often enduring but always touching.This is perpetuated by the music of soft acoustic guitar that plays on the musical heartstrings for this gentle love story and with the work of the late Sven Nykvist (1922 - 2006) as its Swedish cinematographer, illuminating both the beauty of the surroundings and the bleak realities. We are also shown, subconsciously, that there is nothing wrong in being poor and that being from the side where the grass is not so green is not too bad after all, with just the right amount of stable influences that can support anyone through the hardships of life, most thing's can happen. This has been proved by the photograph of the third Grape brother seen on the fridge door, and the families pride in him gaining a University Degree, and ultimately, starting a new life outside of Endora. The subplot, though minor, is still a harsh reminder that even the best of people can become too isolated, too familiar in their lives. Mary Steenburgen's middle-aged Betty Carver has a nice family, a nice house and a nice middle-aged husband, but is still not happy. Her affair with Gilbert is just a fleeting glimpse into the perspective of human companionship gone sour between old love.Leonardo DiCaprio lost out to Tommy Lee Jones for his part as repetitive Marshal Samuel Gerard in The Fugitive (1993) at the 1994 Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Losing out to such an uninspiring role did not harm his winning the 1994 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards for Most Promising Actor as well as National Board of Review 1993 Award for Best Supporting Actor. With just three years after Edward Scissorhands (1990) and a year before Ed Wood (1994) this little movie proves that Mr. Depp can still take chances and win, and with Gilbert Grape, he has succeeded in proving versatility, depth and charm.Endora may be broken and beat, but it does not mean that it is dead, there is still hope, with the arrival of the new Burger Barn to enlighten the town's folk spirit, like the two young buds of love, enlightenment can stop at the most peculiar of places.</fullReview>

He is utterly convincing. What Johnny Depp brings to his character is warmth and humility, something which is sadly lacking in American culture of today. This a film that explores loyalties in human relationships, within a family, employer/employee, marriage, and lovers. It moves, you are never distracted, there is tension to keep you watching right to the end. The film is brilliantly photographed and outstandingly directed. A film not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, I think of him as one of the world's greatest actors and this film in no way undermines my view of him at all, it is truly a touching and memorable performance. However, even the great Johnny Depp was out shined in this film by the unbelievable role of Arnie Grape played by Leonardo DiCaprio, if I didn't know any better I'd say that he really did suffer from a serious mental illness. This is by far one of my all time favourite films thanks to DiCaprio, I have a new real respect for him as an actor that I had never noticed before, but now the more I see of him, the greater I think he is, and not just because he's gorgeous and I'm a teenage girl, but because he is one hell of an actor!

I think the woman who played the mother was incredibly brave to put herself out like that, I have nothing but respect for her. And I pretty much love everything Johnny Depp has ever done. (Though, to be fair, I never watched any of his more mainstream actiony type movies like Nick of Time, or anything like that) Also, he's so pretty in this movie its almost blinding.</fullReview>

Tough Amy playing her role as a big sister, which also a 'Mom' in her family. Lucky Ellen didn't become as a trouble maker in this film, because usually 'there is always a 'monkey' in the house', but none of it in this film. I'm also feeling so happy looking at Endora people who shows their understanding of Gilbert &amp; Arnie problem. The relationship between Gilbert &amp; Arnie as a brother, what can i say...."too excellent". bravo to all actor/actress in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was amusing when Gilbert's mother corrected him that he was, instead of a shining knight, a shimmering one. The word "shining" is usually used to describe heroes who are as bold and perfect as the sun, while "shimmering" is a better word for things that change quickly and slightly all the time. Light is reflected in different ways. Life is a combination of choices, and few mortals can score "A+" in this sheet of multiple choices. Gilbert was not Jesus, he might not always complete tasks as excellently and wholly as he was told. He had strengths and flaws. That's exactly why he had his own presentation of life. Yet no matter what steps he took, he never halted shimmering hope and pride for his own self, for his family, and for life itself as the best part of nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came across this movie the other night on TV. I had seen it years earlier and I remembered that I liked it then and thought Johnny Depp was good. But it was this second viewing that surprised me. I was just flipping channels and soon I couldn't stop watching it. This to me, is what a good movie requires and what so many Hollywood movies today neglect, great character developement. The characters experiences draw you in, you feel what they feel and relate to the real-life situations they face. I guess its not for everyone, action addicts, need not tune in. Or maybe you should watch but watch it alone or with one other so you can let it sink in and appreciate and reflect, not snicker. Everyone has s*** they HAVE to deal with in life and sometimes seeing others plights portrayed so realistically can help us deal with our own.Johnny Depp is superb. This movie now cements him now as one of my favorite actors. Not only for his acting but for the characters and films he chooses (along with this Chocolat, Pirates of the Carib come to mind)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't try to write this with flourish, just tell it simply. Lasse Halstrom's direction of this perfectly cast movie is top-notch. Then there's the fact of having Depp and di Caprio, the best actors of their generation in Hollywood. He's done some excellent work since this (Titanic, Celebrity and Gangs of New York) but to my mind, this should have been his Oscar (an Oscar which the Academy has so far denied him for anything), and I don't know that he's done anything better. Tough role, teen with a brain birth defect. Depp as the overwhelmed oldest child needing romance and relief is also superb. Steenbergen and Juliette Lewis were both good. With this, I expected better work from Lewis than she has panned out: a shame. The surprise here, however, is a wonderful performance by the center of the story: the 500 (yes, 500 pound, according to her imdb bio), mother of Johnny, di Caprio, the two daughters ? all troubled. The realistic depiction of the pain and the courage are extraordinary. It's a heart-warming tearjerker but that doesn't convey 'Gilbert Grapes' depth. Perhaps better to say that it is in what was once called the great liberal tradition of genuinely engendering compassion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depp's choice in roles is exquisite! From "Bennie and Joon" to "Whats eating Gilbert Grape", Johnny Depp throws himself into the charactor like no other actor. He becomes the actor. One defination of the word "exquisite" means "carefully selected or thought out", and that is what Depp does when choosing a movie.Leanardo DiCaprio also gives a very strong performance in this film. He plays a mentally challanged 17 year old who is always getting into trouble. Watching him it was hard to believe that he WASN'T mentally challanged.Lewis had a smaller part, but still crucial to the film. She potrayed a "free-spirit" traveling around the US with her grandmother, with no place special to go and no special time to be there. (hence a freespirit) Unlike "Natural born Killers" (in which Lewis played a murdering psyco) in this film she played a very heart warming role, and she did it very well.All in all it was still Johnny Depp's movie.....he WAS Gilbert Grape, and he did it so well. I only wish there were more Johnny Depp's out there making movies because he certainly IS exquisite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of the 90's. The acting is superb on all accounts from, Depp, Leo, Lewis, to everyone in the family, and the man who is in just about every great movie as of late, John C. Reilly. The plot is this...Leo plays Arnie Grape, a mentally handicapped teenager, who is more like a 5 year old. Depp plays the title character Gilbert Grape, who is the man of the Grape house, and Arnie's idle. Lewis plays Gilbert's love intrest and is traveling through town when she and Gilbert fall in love. The plot of this movie is rather uncertain, it's more like, the life of the Grape family, from the good times to the bad. This movie has so many plots to it, from the struggels of the overweight mother, to the struggels with a mentally retarted son who the family is almost burdened with, to Gilbert falling in love with Becky. The end scene of this movie made me cry, Leo is amazing in this movie, so is Depp. If you have not had a chance to catch this on TV, look for it because it is on all the time, or rent it, or buy it, you will not let yourself down. I rated this 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but not inspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie much reminds me of myself. Boring storyline but great storyplay. Anyway, Johnny Depp who for me an unsung hero where most of his collegue had won numerous award and recognition, Depp still seraching the true limelight in his career. His acting in Blow and What's eating gilbert Grape deserved him to class A actor in a second. In his film, he had just hit a jackpot, his acting are brilliant, little orthodox but still a breathtaking one. He showed loyalty, love but most importantly utmost respect to his mom (especially in the ending). Leonardo 'Arnie' DiCaprio for me, over rated. Just like Roger Ebert stated, one of the easiest part in acting is to play a retard (just watched 'Sam' for example) because it's involved random emotion but in the same time straight linear acting where else playing a normal character involved commitment and deep concetration to the part. Believe me, if not of Depp, this movie will be so much dull and boring film. Other character did wonderfully especially her mom. Especially involving the part that her mom returned home after bailing arnie home. Thats my friend, is emotion and depth in acting. Her face reaction told everything. Suffice to say, this movie is great but in the same time there's couple of flaw that swipe away this move from retaining a classic tagmark: The ending and inconsistent acting by Leonardo DiCaprio. I'll give a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another good one. All the actor's performances were top notch. The cinematography and art direction and the script. All of it was admirable. I know that Depp was going through a difficult time when doing this film, but the melancholic mood was appropriate for the film and right on par with Gilbert's character in the book. The book was great too.What made this such a good movie and story as well is that it was realistic. It's hard to get out of a funk when your down like Gilbert's character with no real goals ahead, longing for change yet still uncertain, and living in a town where you have one large grocery store, and the one Gilbert worked in and competing with each other, a diner everyone attends and a Dairy Dream. Every small town has one.The characters were all dry, distinct and interesting . It was DiCaprio's finest performance to play such a challenging role. It wasn't forced or artificial. I liked the mother who was stricken with life-threatening obesity and a severe lack of self-worth. And Depp is just the bomb. This movie was real. And for those unimpressed with DiCaprio's recent work, check out why his acting brought him to where he is today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie, and very much a product of the '90s. There are those who say there are no new ideas, and this movie also proves that. Many movie makers admit to "borrowing" from other films. Please compare this movie to "The Last Picture Show", and you will see many of the same ideas and even the same scenes (main character tries to leave town at one point in his pickup truck, but can't, and turns around). The similar situations - main character is having an affair with a married older woman, is stuck in a small town, has a retarded brother/friend... Still a great movie, and has enough new ideas to make it fresh. Perhaps someone will steal from this movie one day...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie airing on ABC Family one day and decided to sit down and watch it because I had heard about it before and thought, it can't be that bad. So I watched it and loved it! I'm 14, and i'm into usually dopey comedy movies but this one really stands apart from others I have seen. I knew that Leo DiCaprio was nominated for an Oscar for this movie but I do not understand why he didn't win! This has got to be one or the best performance in his movie career. This movie brings out his true talent. I wondered why I hadn't seen it sooner. I'm not as much as a Leonardo fan as I was in 5th grade when "Titanic" was out (lol), but there is a certain thing in Leo and that is why so many people love him. And i'm not only saying that DiCaprio did well, Johnny Depp and all of the stars were excellent. I don't think there were any miscasts at all. This movie has great meaning and emotion, and is truly enjoyable. Go out and rent it, you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is charming, touching, and puts together at least three actors who many not have gotten the credit they deserve. Johnny Depp is excellent as the small-town kid trapped in his home town, yearning to get out, yet kept at home due to family commitments. Juliette Lewis, who I associate with really strange characters (Kalifornia, Cape Fear) is very sweet and down to earth as the girl traveling through Iowa with her grandma in an Airstream Trailer. And this may be Leo DiCaprio's best movie as Arnie, a mentally disabled child. I don't dare give away the plot, but check for the supporting roles played by Mary Steenbergen and Kevin Tighe (of Emergency fame!). But Johnny Depp steals the show, much as he also does in Benny and Joon, another fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally these sort of warm comedies wouldn't appeal to me...I'm the Adam Sandler type comedy loving, 22 year old college male who hates movies like Steel magnolias. But this movie is funny in its own little way, using the mother's weight and the way DiCaprio's character is mentally challenged to create some funny scenes. Everything in the movie is pretty relevant, it doesn't stray. The thing I love though is that there is true character development, which is missing from so many of the movies I have seen lately. Watch "Hollow Man" and find out about that. Anyways, it has a good ending...it's not incredibly happy, but it's not really sad either...their mother dies and the house burns down (Sorry for the spoiler), but they still have each other and that bond is so strong that you can't feel incredibly sad for them either. A really nice film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a REAL movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*may give away some main parts*I can't get over how good this movie is. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is very underrated. Why? It didn't do all that good at the theaters, and I can't even remember hearing about it until I bought it. This is one of the most realistic and best movies I have ever watched.Each of the characters that were introduced to us were unique with troubles of their own. Lets start with the best performance in a long time from a young actor. Leonardo DiCaprio is absolutely phenomenal in this film. As the mentally challenged Arnie, DiCaprio gives a very true and believable performance. Hand this guy an oscar. Well, maybe not that far but he still was the main reason I love this movie. Some people may find his acting ability towards being handicapped, laughable and poorly done. I thought that the actions and lines that he delivered were very well written out. Johnny Depp gives a refreshing good look at a troubled homebody who cares for his dysfunctional family. The laid back yet anxious Gilbert, also delivers good lines and a good performance. He is hard to read but we still understand what he's going through. Juliette Lewis doesn't put her real talent and effort into the role of Becky. Still, she is very entertaining to watch, especially with Depp in the scene as well. Amy, Ellen, and Momma make up the rest of the Grape family. The very much overweight mother does an all right job. Her role really doesn't consist of too much energy and/or talent. If they were looking for an obese actress who can deliver some basic lines, they found a good person. Gilbert's sisters, Amy and Ellen, aren't given a lot of detail or exposure to. That's good because there are enough characters already introduced to us. Bad because it focuses on Gilbert along with his family. It really doesn't let the audience have a complete look at the family if the two sisters weren't included. Betty Carver was a character that was in the way. She was in the way of Becky and Gilbert, but the character in general wasn't needed all that much. For her role, Steenburgen does a good job. The Grape family, made up from a list of talented actors, shines as your typical family next door. Almost.  The best thing I like about this film is that it is a very basic story with a very low budget. It was easy to follow and held my attention the whole way through. It's pretty good when the most amount of money that was spent towards this movie, is the burning of the house. With today's movies and how all of them need millions and millions of dollars put into it in order for them to be successful, it is good to still watch a cheap movie. I understand that this movie is from 1993, but it continues to look good for the audiences of today.There's really no plot to the movie. Gilbert is introduced and we are then introduced to his family, emotions, and problems. While wandering around Endora, Gilbert tries to find a stable ground and a normal life. It's easy to understand. It isn't complicated with tons of unnecessary story lines. And the characters are different and terrific in their own special way.The script and writing (which is taken from the book) is average. Again, it isn't terribly long and it actually does have a point. The amount of time that What's Eating Gilbert Grape consists of, is good. It opens to the family, we follow their problems, and it's over in a good period of time. The ending is great. The family's decision to leave their problems in the house along with their mother is very touching. I can't believe that they just set the house on fire like that. Good job to the crew and author of the book for that little slice of creativity. Overall, this movie has everything that a good movie is supposed to have. A dramatic and funny cast, and excellent problems that the cast runs into are just a couple of things that you will like about this film. It's dates back a couple years, but if you still haven't seen it, or just want to get a slight laugh, see this well thought out flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Touching Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the better films I have seen. As indicated in the other comments, the story depicts a young man, Gilbert Grape, who believes he is destined to stay in a small "nothing" town and help provide for his family, which includes an obese mother who has been unable to care for her family for years. Although this would make someone seem like a saint, he has his downfalls as well --- such as some of the jokes he cracks about his mother and the lack of attention he sometimes pays to his brother --- which is what makes his character realistic. As the movie progresses with him getting to know Becky, and situations that cause his mother to reflect on her insecurities about herself, I see a lot more depth in each of the characters. And even though Becky's personality was somewhat annoying to me, she had her good points throughout the story as well.Excellent performances from all of the cast; one of my favorite movies of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a science-fiction and action movie fan primarily, I give huge leeway in Star Wars and Star Trek movies, despite gaping holes in their plots and stories or how the same, idea is being used yet again.This movie surprised me when it hit me so hard, no action to speak of, but an amazing, touching story of Gilbert Grape and his family, mostly Gilbert himself and his life, taking care of his incompetent family and working as a grocery store clerk to keep everything going.This is the first time that I'd seen Leonardo DiCaprio in any movie. He played Arnie, Gilbert's mentally challenged little brother. DiCaprio does an amazing job in this role, he's completely charming as the slow younger brother and he really deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor in a really tough year that had Tommy Lee Jones take it away for his roll in "The Fugitive".Depp is also fantastic as the oldest brother, keeping his family together, but knowing that he'd be better off leaving and going off on his own, held back by his obligations.I was blown away that this movie didn't get nominated for best picture, it was truly deserving and one of the most unappreciated movies of the last decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a few things to say about this movie. First of all, it was very good, and I like almost everything that Lasse Hallstrom directed. But I have problems with Juliette Lewis' performance. I saw the movie before reading the book, and I was entranced and practically fell over myself getting the book from the library. In the book, Becky is a completely different character, and I felt that she was made very bland in the movie. In the book she plays and insightful temptress, cruel, but openhearted, and has much more personality than what the movie depicted.Second of all, this is not a Leonardo Dicaprio flick. It is an artistic representation. I don't think it's in good taste to say it was only worth it because of "Leo's" performance, or "Leo" was wonderful in it. He was wonderful in it, but he was not the center, he was not the main character, it was not a hunky dreamboat character, and I know I suffered immense shock seeing him as a normal person in later movies. I would more readily say it was a Johnny Depp movie or a Lasse Hallstrom movie. I have nothing personal against Leonardo Dicaprio, I think he is very talented.Overall, I think the movie is worth watching but the book is worth BUYING. It's really the story that made the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always said that a movie doesn't have to lay itself out like a masterpiece to be a four-star triumph. Good characters, powerful acting, a good story, and pure realism are often the keys to inspired film making. "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" fully understands this simple formula for success, and provides the viewer with a honesty that very few films today possess. The strangeness of the title does not match the film's premise. Johnny Depp, an enjoyable presence in film in recent years, plays the title character, a young man who lives a completely selfless existence, but who never gets much of an opportunity to please himself. He has his near-18 year old mentally challenged brother, Arnie (Oscar-nominee Leonardo DeCaprio, in one of his first major roles) to tend to, as well as his 500-pound mother (Darlene Cates), who has not left the house in over seven years. His other two sisters take his sacrifices for granted, leaving Gilbert without much moral support around the house. He works at a second-rate supermarket, whereby he becomes acquainted with a lonely housewife (Mary Steenburgen) who turns to Gilbert for a little more than delivery of her groceries. It is only once a drifting girl named Becky (Juliette Lewis) comes along that he is able to find a true soul mate, someone who can help him momentarily escape from the chaos of his everyday life.The aspect about Gilbert that I really admired about his character was the fact that he did not think of himself as a particularly good person or even a help to others, but rather someone who was fulfilling an obligation to those around him, whether it be within the home, at the grocery store, or being "friendly" with Steenburgen. He follows what he believes must be followed, and in many ways is trapped, without a sense of freedom. What is even more heartbreaking about Gilbert is that the ones who should have been appreciative of his kindness did not give a damn about whether they were affecting his life. Real emotions are clearly at stake here.From what I've described about "Gilbert Grape," it would seem that the film is a sobfest. Not so. Leonardo deCaprio deserves a great deal of credit for bringing spirit to the movie, a true innocent within the family. He is so free-spirited that Gilbert, as well as the audience, cannot help but love the guy despite his being a major chore to take care of, and sometimes a real pain in the rump. DeCaprio deserved his Oscar nomination, starting off his prosperous career in Hollywood.Another thing I was really surprised about was how Gilbert's mother, while being amazingly overweight, is not treated as a stereotype by the filmmakers. Darlene Cates, in her film debut, brings real heart to a role that could have been completely one-sided. She lives a life that she herself never intended, but learns to make the best of it.Films like "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" always let you know when they're working by how much you feel for the characters in its story. I honestly felt for Gilbert and what he had to put up with, and truly hoped he would find a happy ending once the film was over. Of course I would not dare reveal that ending to you, but let's just say there is a sense of satisfaction that arises as Gilbert Grape finds the spirit within himself he thought was never there. Rating: Three stars and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad story, but a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the story itself is a sad one, the movie never fails to impress. This is a story about a dysfunctional family going through an incessant series of problems. Johnny Depp plays the title character, and he gives a pretty good natural performance. He's the "man of the house"; he's the glue that holds his family together. He longs to leave his dead-end town, yet his family responsibilities are what keep him from leaving that town. One of his responsibilities is to take care of his mentally retarded younger brother, played by Leo DiCaprio. What a magnificent performance by DiCaprio! If you think DiCaprio is not talented, you need to see this movie. The other performances are good too. I like the unpredictability of the story. You never know what else is going to happen to these characters (as if they don't already have enough problems). You'll feel bad for the family, and you'll understand why Gilbert Grape is frustrated. I'd recommend this movie to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart warming, sweet film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape? the title of this film is begging for an answer and the film delivers. 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' is the heart warming tale of the Grape family. In particular Gilbert (Johnny Deep) who so eloquently put by Arnie (Leonardo Dicaprio)is not going anywhere. Gilbert is stuck in a town, in a life of numbing sameness. His routine of caring for his handicapped brother Arnie, working at the grocery store to support his family, and having to cope with the embarrassment of his extremely over weight mother has taken it's tole on him and he soon finds himself headed down the same fateful path as his father. That is until Becky (Juliette Lewis) enters the scene and proves to be a catalyst for change in Gilbert's life.The film is extremely well acted although Dicaprio steals the film with his portrayal of the handicapped Arnie, Johnny Depp should not be over looked in what is one of his best performance of his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie-Great performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's Eating... is a pretty good movie depicting real characters(is that an oxymoron?)and real relationships but there just wasn't enough going on in it to pull me in like a "great" movie would. Leo Dicaprio established himself as an actor of extreme talent in my book, however, totally searching himself and then dissolving himself into Arnie Grape-it was fascinating to watch. Johnny Depp, however, turned down his charisma so much that he almost faded in the background-I dig most of his stuff (especially Fear and Loathing)but I think his work in this is sub-par and amatuerish. He acted like one of those cookie cutter "sensitive loner" types on those cheesy teen shows. Darlene Cates gave a solid and honest performance. Juliette Lewis did what Juliette Lewis does-freespirited, cryptic but lovable girl with a vulnerable side. It was not a great movie but it is worth seeing.</fullReview>

It uses nothing but the reality its story and great acting from its cast - particularly from Depp, DiCaprio, and Cates - to carry itself through, and in the end, it succeeds beautifully in giving us a glimpse into human nature and strength. Of course, the main attraction of this film is Leonardo DiCaprio's tender, astonishing performance as Arnie Grape, who is perhaps my all-time favorite movie character.

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp remains the most underrated actor of his generation !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from perhaps ''Total Eclipse'', this had to be Oscar-nominee (Best Supporting Actor) Leonardo Di Caprio's breakthrough role, but Johnny Depp remains the most underrated actor of his generation in Hollywood. The insistence on taking roles of substance, depth and feeling (vs. what instantly sells) must be the reason, and the role of Gilbert Grape was no exception. Depp is brilliant as the overburdened youth, seemingly the lone responsible for a completely dysfunctional family. Di Caprio's performance as mentally-handicapped little brother Arnie was astonishing, however, and well worth the nod from Oscar. Like many of Depp's films, this one had a tendency to sneak by the public unnoticed. Perhaps it's more of a marketing question, but this guy deserves recognition ! If you don't believe me, get the video and find out for yourself (rating = 4.5 stars of 5) !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex and complete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is concerned with two related themes: people who, for various reasons, are marginalized by society (i.e. people who are deformed, very overweight, depressed, retarded, poor, etc); and people who allow the problems or animosity of other individuals to trap them, and who limit their own lives because of that. Gilbert is an intelligent, emotional, conflicted, and introverted young man who lives with his two sisters, one retarded brother (Leonardo deCaprio), and a morbidly obese mother in a shaky old farm house. Gilbert's mother used to be beautiful and energetic. When her depressed husband committed suicide, she ate herself into becoming morbidly obese. She confines herself to the house and, in fact, confines herself to the sofa on the first floor. She's a burden and an embarrassment for her children, especially for Gilbert. Still, Gilbert loves and cares for her. She's also a joke for the local townspeople, which is an even more painful situation for the sensitive Gilbert. Gilbert's beloved younger brother is also a burden. Although he can communicate and is sympathetic to the feelings of others, he can barely take care of himself. He is also a source of amusement for, and sometimes a victim of violence from, the townspeople. The three major characters, the mother, Gilbert, and the vivacious young woman who breathes life into him (Juliette Lewis), represent the film's thematic conclusions. The mother's problem is her self-confinement, her emotional suicide, in the wake of her husband's death. She allows his incompetence to confine her emotionally and physically, and she allows society, embodied by the townspeople, to marginalize and dehumanize her. What's eating Gilbert is his inner conflict, his desire to leave family problems forever versus his commitment to remain and take care of the family. Gilbert must decide, with the young woman's help, to what extent he will allow his relatives, especially his mother and brother, to limit his life. He must also learn to accept, however, that he cannot and should not entirely escape from his family's difficult situation. "Gilbert Grape" is a strange but excellent film, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's kind of hard to say what exactly WEGG is about. Sure he takes care of his dysfunctional family but this movie leaves you with a sense of more than that. The scenes just flow and you take up the details almost unconsciously. The characters drive the story, not any plot.As usual, Johnny Depp is remarkable in the title role. Leonardo Di Caprio got an Oscar Nomination for his portrayal or Arnie. The relationship between these two is the focus of the movie, if anything. Juliette Lewis is the 'love interest' and her character is unique to this movie. She plays the other concern in Gilbert's lifeThe movie works well and is never over-dramatic and never tries too hard to make some moral point. The characters are all somewhat unusual but recognisably human. It is perhaps this simplicity that makes this film special</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this again after 18 years, it is more alive and vital than it was when it was released. The innate truth and honesty of this sad, strange tale cannot fade, and that is why I call this film a timeless classic. The film is quirky and full of highly individual, not to say eccentric, characters. The director Lasse Hallstrom, who is of Swedish origin and is perhaps best known in America for his marvellous HACHI: A DOG'S TALE (2009, see my review), specialises in exploring deep feelings and emotions, and seems to prefer those of unusual people, including even dogs who are people. As a dog-lover, I am pleased that Hallstrom realizes that dogs are people. In fact, Hallstrom seems to have a sympathy for outcasts. One might consider dogs outcasts, in that they are denied human status except by those in the know. In this film, the central character is an outcast, a woman named Bonnie Grape, who is enormously fat, about 500 pounds in fact, so that she can barely stand. She not only stays in her house and refuses to go outdoors, but she declines even to go upstairs to her own bedroom, and has spent seven years living and sleeping on the sofa in her living room. She is played by Darlene Cates, a genuine Texan with an authentic accent, which helps make the film convincing, as it is set in a small Texas town in the 1950s. In terms of the action, Bonnie is a peripheral character, but in terms of the story, she is its heart. She became fat through uncontrolled and compulsive comfort-eating caused by depression after her husband hung himself in the basement of their large, rambling farmhouse on the outskirts of town. In one central pathetic scene, she says apologetically to a visitor: 'I wasn't always like this.' Her elder son, beautifully and sensitively played by Johnny Depp, tells a girl friend that Bonnie was once so pretty. This unusual story is from a novel by Peter Hedges, who also wrote the screenplay for the film. One wonders what inspired him. Whatever it was, it was deeply felt. He was born in Iowa, and one wonders if this story's mythical town of Endora, though filmed in Texas, may represent some place in Iowa best known to himself. This film contains so many exquisitely sensitive performances that from the acting point of view it is nothing short of a miracle. The most astounding of all is that of 19 year-old Leonardo Di Caprio, then little known, as Arnie, the younger brother of Johnny Depp. Arnie is mentally handicapped, of the kind which often occurs through oxygen deprivation at birth. He is about to reach his 18th birthday but is mentally like an unruly and unpredictable child. I don't know how Di Caprio did it, but he must have studied such people very closely, since his every gesture and movement, and every aspect of his speech, is one hundred percent accurate. There is not a single scene where he lets us glimpse the real Leonardo. It is a tour de force of epic dimensions. For those who think OF MICE AND MEN (1939, see my review) was deeply moving, try this, which is far more so. The intense devotion to Arnie shown by Depp reminds us of RAIN MAN (1988), where Tom Cruise was similarly devoted to Dustin Hoffman. The ever-watchable Juliette Lewis, that weird-looking gal you can't take your eyes off for a minute, passes through town in a trailer with her mother, and becomes a sort-of girlfriend for Depp. She instinctively understands and accepts Arnie, who becomes attached to her. Depp has had a disturbing affair with a frustrated married woman of the town, brilliantly played by Mary Steenburgen. Everyone in the small town is frustrated, which one might say is sometimes the standard condition of a small town, especially one as small as 'Endora', the name suggesting the end of the road, since no one ever leaves, and they either die by drowning in a child's paddle pool (the fate of Steenburgen's husband) or just moulder away. The film is full of marvellously quirky humour, and has scenes which are riotously funny. So the pathos is constantly lightened by eruptions of the ludicrous. Hallstrom has accomplished a marvellous balancing act, as he never sacrifices the sadness to laughs, but he never allows life's tragedies to get in the way of a good guffaw at human follies. It all works. It might have been better if the surname had been changed from Grape, and if the title had not been a pun on eating a grape. That lessens the impact of this classic film, for unless one knows how wonderful it is, and if one just comes upon the DVD by browsing, one might be inclined to dismiss it as some trivial inferior comedy. The film is also distinguished by the anguished performances of Laura Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt as Depp's two long-suffering sisters. Every aspect of this film is a triumph. If only there were many more like it. It is a magnificent example of a film which uplifts the human spirit.</fullReview>

Now im a huge Depp fan i only wish though he would go back to these kinds of movies instead of all that Tim Burton stuff hes doing.This movie is about a man named Gilbert (Depp) who has a mentally challenged brother named Arnie (Dicaprio). Gilbert lives at home with his two sisters and his morbidly obese mother. He tries his best to look after his mother and his brother but the burden of them begins to wear on him as the movie progresses.This movie is great. The acting is just spectacular by Leos character. Leo is so young in this and still just an amazing actor. Depp also does a great job with all the backup roles playing there parts nice. There is not much of a story just a guy trying to do right by his family. This movie does not have any action but it does have its funny moments. It almost a dark comedy. VERY GOOD MOVIE WATCH THIS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Helped Me See my Girlfriend as a Human Being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in 1995 I had a girlfriend with whom I disagreed about almost everything. I liked Sade, she idolized Madonna. I worshiped sunlight, she kept her apartment like a bat cave. I loved pizza with anchovies, she'd call me a pussy wimp. One day she recommended we rent this movie because she had already seen it and said it was the best movie she had seen since "Gone With The Wind." And so I thought to myself out loud "Sounds like two hours of pure torture." Since it was her turn to pick the movie for the night, and that's the kind of wonderful guy I am, we got it. Also, I figured during her favorite movie would be a really cool time to break up. After five minutes I was fascinated by the slow, gentle pace and sparse, effective dialog. Hey, I thought, what gives? She hated "Apocalypse Now" and fell asleep during "FrankenHooker." She had crap taste in movies, but this one was actually kinda good. I was sure the person playing Arnie was actually mentally handicapped but doing a very good acting job. Then I realized that it was all acting, not a retarded actor. Wow, very impressive. And the story just got better and better, all the details and moments contributing to the theme and mood. Nothing was gratuitous, it just kept getting deeper and broader.I just watched it again, and 15 years of aging has only made it better. It's even more relevant today, with it's mediation on the "simple" life and exploration of the values that hold families, communities and individuals together. The "self" is just a reflection, a part of something much bigger and greater than any one single person. Even if we don't like or appreciate or understand other people's place in the world, we all have the same worth. Even the town mortician, played by the always sublime Crispin Glover, who ghoulishly awaits the next death, is essential and equal. And of course, the repulsively overweight, near helpless mother is somehow made a sympathetic soul.Johnny Depp is solid and, in spite of his limited, almost monotone vocal range (compare him to Leonardo's great range), is a very compelling screen presence. Juliette Lewis has since made a career for herself playing more extreme, unusual characters but here she is so understated and fascinating to watch. I was cheering for the two of them to hook up.So, I suppose you might be guessing that this movie proved to me what a wonderful, magical person my girlfriend truly was. That our endless differences were only trivial and meaningless in the face of the vast expanse of genuine humanity that we shared; a truth rendered undeniable by our mutual adoration of this profoundly touching film. Uh, yeah. Let's just say that that loony, wacko freak for once in her chaotic, ridiculous life got something right. See how I've taken this movie's message to heart and can now look back on those horrendous nightmare days with fond affection. I'm sure that twisted goblin is doing the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilbert Grape is one of my all-time favourite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read all the posts regarding this movie and I am amazed at the range of ratings it has been given. Rather than give a synopsis of this movie, I would prefer to indicate why I love it so much: 1. The story is of a "functional" dysfunctional family. Despite the challenges they face they work together and respect and love each other; 2. Gilbert is very human. He is trapped by circumstances beyond his control and is doing the best he can. He does not realize what a good person he is and, although he slips when he strikes Arnie in frustration, he is forgiven and redeemed; 3. Arnie is a full-realized individual and although mentally-challenged, (please note, this character is NOT autistic) he has layers of behaviour and emotion that are as complex as any experienced by the "normal" members of society; 4. Mrs. Grape is as handicapped as Arnie but loves her children and they love her. They are forced daily to accommodate her limitations and do it in a respectful and accepting way; 5. Becky is the force of change in Gilbert's life. Will he courageously follow this new path or remain stuck in his life as it is now? In summary, this is a story about love, acceptance and change. It is a hopeful and optimistic view that courage can be reflected in everyday lives and that challenges are a part of life and do not diminish us or defeat us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this film is sacred as it has been made with absolute dedication.It is one of those rare Hollywood films which bring good thoughts to mind.The great thing to watch in this film is a highly uncommon small American town where nothing much happens.All that remains of this town are its quirky people including Gilbert,Arnie,two sisters and their fat mother.This is not a coming of age story but a meaningful story of a young boy who sacrifices his personal happiness for the greater well being of his family.He desperately wants to find a permanent solution to two of his greatest worries:his nerdy young brother and his excessively obese mother.Johnny Depp is absolutely hard to believe in such a deglamorised role.Leonardo de Caprio is great too as the nerdy brother. Juliette Lewis is good too as Gilbert's friend.This film has been directed by a talented Swedish director named Lasse Hallstrom who among other films has made a documentary about Abba.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Eating Gilbert Grape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Lasse Hallström (The Cider House Rules), this is an inspired film with a fantastic cast of actors. Basically Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) lives in Endora, where not much happens, with his quite unusual family. He has an obese 36 stone mother Bonnie (500 pound weighing Darlene Cates), two sisters, Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), and a very close and inescapable bond with his mentally handicapped autistic brother, Arnie (Oscar nominated, and then unknown Leonardo DiCaprio). Gilbert's life is almost stolen from him by having to look after his family, particularly Arnie, but stranded free spirit Becky (Juliette Lewis) who gives him more feelings. Also starring Escape to Witch Mountain's (the crap one) Kevin Tighe as Ken Carver, The River Wild's John C. Reilly as Tucker Van Dyke and Crispin Glover as Bobby McBurney. The only giggle I laughed at was the car driving with half almost on the ground (because of the mother), there are many serious issues as well, e.g. coping with mental handicapped people, extreme obesity and losses. The most memorable moments, good and bad, are the mother being stared at (and photographed!) when leaving the police station, Gilbert striking Arnie, and the mother's tragic death after Arnie's 18th birthday (the doctor's predicted he'd die at 10) and being cremated in the house instead of having more starers see her lifted by a crane. As the only Oscar nominated was for DiCaprio's extraordinary and believable performance, he could have won it (he lost it to Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive). Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, and Johnny Depp number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb performance, let down by...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting talent in this film stands out a mile; Johny Depp, DiCaprio and Mary Steenburgh are breathtakingly good. I thought it would be hard to watch the flick as I would constantly be aware of the big name tags on the back of the actors, but the method acting is done so well that they connect with the viewer instantly.I wasn't that impressed with the film itself - despite the praise I have heard of it in the past. It seemed to superficially glide over all the interesting sub-plots it had created (e.g. the mass production of commercialism hitting the small time, and the fragility of life), never seeming to really dig into the points it was making. Instead it relies on the superb acting skills, before making some daft poignant point such as "Life always presents opportunities".Well worth a watch, and is a true credit to the leading cast, but not the classic its branded as.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm from this generation who thought that Leonardo Dicapro came out from nowhere with the Titanic movie and that Johnny Depp was just the cute boy who's dating Vanessa Paradis... Fortunately, I went deeper in my Depp's fascination and found out Edward Scissorhands, Private Resort (Ok, maybe not a so good example...), and, of course, What's eating Gilbert Grape. This movie has this family thing, this feeling that whatever you'll do with your life, you'll always be stuck with the same one, as good or as bad as it gets. Your mother, as fat as she will get will always try to look upon your actions and take care of you. Your sisters, as crazy and weird they are will always be there for you, to loan you some money or to welcome you for the night if you got the blues. And your brothers, as unsuitable and non- conform as they are, will always be attached to you in a way, even if you'd better like them not to... This performance by Leonardo Dicaprio is so remarkable that I still have trouble recognizing he was so young when he did it. We truly believe in his character and it's impossible thinking of it as a joke. Juliette Lewis too is so true in her character, taking Gilbert Grape away from his problems for a moment...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fabulous film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched 'What's eating gilbert grape' at the age of eleven or so, just after I'd developed an interest in Leonardo DiCaprio's work.The film follows Gilbert Grape, a young man who lives with his disabled brother and clinically obese mother in a small town where 'nothing ever happens'. Gilbert is having an affair with an older married woman and feels trapped in the town he lives in - his father is gone and he is the main provider for his family.The film portrays public scrutiny well, as people don't accept Gilbert's mother - as well as conveying a sense of doubt and isolation, Gilbert's true frustration with a world that provides him with little solace.Watching it now, with a more mature and adult perspective, I see what was always present in this film, how truly remarkable each element really is. The acting is absolutely spot on, Johnny Depp is a phenomenal actor and portrays Gilbert well, Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of disability is also fabulous - such a hard thing to accomplish. I can't fault much on this film, it's emotive and thought-provoking as well as unique and interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartbreaking film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that this film really broke Leonardo DiCaprio's career. He earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his role as retarded Arnie. Somebody who was never expected to survive. His brother is played by JOhnny Depp and their mother was casted by Darlene Cates who gives a superb role as the obese mother. Her performance is equally heartbreaking. Martha Plimpton plays the girlfriend or love interest to Johnny Depp's character. His character is a loving son, brother, and employee of a small grocery store where a new store in town like Walmart opens up luring their customers. Depp's character is truthful to his word even though he has to attend the supermarket because they need a birthday cake breaking his employer's heart. Their obese mother is so overweight that she spends most of her time downstairs. It's painful to watch Darlene Cates' go to the police station to pick up Arnie. He is lovable and unforgettable in his role. Depp's Gilbert is equally unforgettable. He is the son that you want. His friend is played by Crispin Glover who is a mortician. The end of the film is also unpredictable. It's worth watching and it will break your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely wonderful. Everyone should watch this movie. It is one of those rare and luminous movies that is less a film than an experience-it starts out gradually and unmajestically, but by the end it's become one of the movies that captures a part of the human heart and psyche. I especially love the end-it is loose and freeing, near-perfection. This movie did overdo some of its points and is sometimes painfully close to real life and real family interaction, but with the great performances from Johnny Depp and particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and its gradual, cataclysmic rising to the luminous ending, it's a movie that everyone should watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I have to admit that I hated that film... because two years ago I had to analyze it in my English class and I can tell you, it was REALLY hard! We all weren't used to watch films in English, so we had a bad time to follow the conversations... especially when Johnny Depp was talking. He speaks in a 'mumbling' way (if you can say so) and if English isn't your native language... well, then you're a little lost! To top that we had to write an class test about that film, so as a consequence we all didn't want to see this film ever again!But how life goes, I watched it not long ago on TV...;) With the distance of two years and without the pressure to analyze their conversations or the different camera shots, I liked watching this film! It's entertaining, but also demanding in a way. I thought about the story even some hours after watching it, and IMO it's a good thing, if a film makes you think about it.Of course, the actors are absolutely brilliant! They all did a great job, especially Johnny Depp (well, after watching some films with him I'm a big fan!), Leonardo DiCaprio and Darlene Cates. My opinion has changed: I don't hate it anymore, I like it!I'll give it a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my absolute favorite-movies, and I guess that's because it´s quite a simple story involving a few great characters and events that you can relate to. The story of Gilbert should be seen by anyone who's young and feels stuck where they are. This is Lasse Hallströms best film, and the acting performances are all great. You get a really laid-back Johnny Depp as Gilbert, but in the same time he feels more natural and maybe more of being himself here than what he usually does. I think this is one of his best films, and Leonardo DiCaprio definitely makes his best performance ever, here as Gilberts retarded brother Arnie. This is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only agreed to see this movie despite Leo DiCaprio being in it because he plays a drooling retard. It's a role tailor made for him.This is sort of a quirky little film about a family living in the country in their little nothing community where everybody knows each other.Pretty much all the plot elements are interesting and together they make up an interesting, but light hearted story.Johnny Depp plays Gilbert Grape, a guy stuck where he is but who desperately wants to get out. His family, including a bratty little 15 year old, the gorgeous and sweet older sister who is the acting mother of the family, the grossly obese mother and of course the retarded Arnie played by DiCaprio. The Juliette Lewis character was rather annoying, and at many times seemed more retarded than Arnie.The ending is bittersweet, but befitting the film, and I won't reveal it here. You'll care about (almost) all the country bumpkin characters in this film, and it will give you a warm feeling in your chest.What's eating Gilbert Grape? Watch this movie and find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie that fails to fully connect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's Eating Gilbert Grape -- Gilbert is trapped in his life, caring for a severely retarded brother, an enormously obese mother who doesn't leave the house (and barely leaves the couch) and two sisters. He's trapped in a dead-end job with dead-end friends. His affair with a much older married woman is another dead-end trap that provides nothing but sex. Juliette Lewis is 'just passing through' and awakens in him the desire for something that has nothing to do with responsibility.In some ways this is an excellent movie. DiCaprio's performance as the retarded brother is breathtaking - so invisible that you have no idea who's playing the role or how. Johnny Depp as Gilbert is understated to the point of numbness; because that's how he deals with his life. The story is emotionally involving and the atmosphere is effectively oppressive. The characters are unique and worthy of attention.But in other ways the story fails to transcend itself, and the ending is a cheat. I was reminded of Leaving Las Vegas, through which I began to see that the extreme self-hatred of the characters was a feeling we all share; we all sometimes think of ourselves as if we are as degraded as those characters, even though we aren't. Leaving Las Vegas gave us characters with a life bizarrely different from ours, and made us relate to it. But What's Eating Gilbert Grape does the opposite. Despite it's emotional hook, it made me look at that family and think "Wow, that's worse than anyone or anything I know." Instead of making the audience relate, it made the audience feel sorry for, which is a cheaper and easier thrill. It came very, very close to showing us that we're all those people, but it slipped.Juliette Lewis is far too much a savior, and far too little a human being. And the ending provides easy answers which spit in the face of the carefully constructed story that preceded it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dicaprio...who da thunk it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: potential spoilers ahead.Leonardo Dicaprio is masterful as the autistic 18 year-old Arnie Grape. I never would have thought, after seeing the crap he's doing now. Wow. His acting here, though not quite in the league of Daniel Day-Lewis' Cristy Brown in My Left Foot, rivals that of Geoffrey Rush in Shine and Dustin Hoffman in Rain man. I do not hesitate to say this. Rush and Hoffman are huge actors, and Dicaprio was just a boy at the time, but his performance is just as moving, just as comfortable, and just as mind-blowing, real and believable. Wow. He can act. It's a shame he's so terrible now. Maybe he just needs a suitable role. He's just no good at the squinting tough-guy stuff. He's no Clint Eastwood (which could be a compliment, I'm not sure).Anyway, the rest of the movie doesn't quite measure up to Dicaprio's tremendous acting, which doesn't make it necessarily bad. I don't want to seem shallow or closed, but I'm not into the cliché romance stuff. Yawn. I've heard it all before. Juliette Lewis is just boring, but her character is boring, being the perfect girl savior. She's not noticeably bad, though. Johnny Depp isn't bad either. He's not outstanding, but he's believable. Gilbert Grape is a complex character, that doesn't come around too often. He's conflicted, with himself, his mother, his autistic brother, his secret lover's husband, and the people that mistreat Arnie. He's a good kid. And he is human (unlike Juliette Lewis' character, faw!). He loses it. He runs away when things get hard. But he can come back. At one point, he hits Arnie, trying to get him to take a bath (like Dustin Hoffman in Rain man, Arnie is afraid of water). And he runs away, ashamed. But he comes back to Arnie's party, and they make amends.Gilbert's mother is overweight. Which is an understatement. He's embarrassed of her, and frequently refers to her as a beached whale. Really a rude analogy coming from her own son. She never moves from the couch. Never goes anywhere. But she loves her children, and when the police take Arnie away (after he climbs the tower for the last time), she gets up, and fights to get him back. Sniff, sniff. Touching. Anyway, she dies later during the party, and Arnie goes up to visit. This is a beautiful scene. A horrible scene. A beautiful scene. "Haha, you're hiding, momma," Arnie says. He thinks it's a game, but when it lasts for too long, he's scared. He's shaking her. He's crying. He's yelling for her to stop hiding. He's crying. What do you know...I'm crying too.Anyway, I don't want to bore myself (or you) by going on and on about the plot. Lalala. I didn't like the cliché romantic part of this film, but the rest is quite good. Good acting overall, not a bad story actually, though slightly predictable, the relationship between Gilbert and Arnie is thorough, moving and developed, and well, Leonardo Dicaprio is outstanding. And to think, stone-boy Tommy Lee Jones won best supporting actor over him. Faw, what balonee. Dicaprio delivers simply one of the best performances I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Silence of Regrets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the film "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", anyone who has been cursed with a common family, will find a deep kinship with Johnny Depp. Playing Gilbert Grape, Depp does an admirable job of sustaining a sympathetic role for himself and his retarded brother, played equally superb by Leonardo DiCaprio. Included among his additional sufferings Gilbert must endure is his obese mother, who blames her huge weight problem on her husband's death. His two sisters add to his burden as does an unfaithful wife and traveling woman in a streamline trailer. Gilbert endures the given facts of his dull, uneventful and nondescript life with seemingly limitless patience. He further accepts the troubling circumstances of his half-wit brother who persistently seeks the summits of a city water tower. His world drifts from tedium to tedium until finally it explodes with an unexpected but understandable rage. Somewhere in the aftermath, Gilbert discovers a renewed compassion, a soul saving reason for continuing his existence and the dark root of his mother's weighty affliction. Gilbert saves her humiliation with a modicum of dignity. Regrets are forgotten, life must go on. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie ten out of ten because it will touch your heart. Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing short of magic in his role, bringing the movie to a level that could never be achieved without him. The storyline was heartwarming, the characters were realistic and the parts were well cast.I had a bit of a problem with some things though; like John C Reilly's character. While he is a good actor and was nice to the Grape family in the movie, he didn't really have a developed personality. He didn't have a background or character development or even a reason of why he was so nice and helpful to the Grape family.Another thing I didn't like was the ambiguity of the ending. Amy finds a job in a new town after the house burns down and Ellen moves away with her which is a happy ending for both of them but Gilbert and Arnie just go where they want to go....? You see him reconnecting with his girlfriend when she comes back to visit, but the bag he's carrying kind of implies that he doesn't have a house. I thought the ending could have been though out better, because there is no way he could take care of his brother with a life of hitch hiking and his grocery job.But don't let my review ruin the movie for you. As I said, that was implied but you don't really know how they are living. The movie also had many good parts, which I don't have room to fit all of them in and it is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A young Leonardo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp bring to us one of the most underrated classics of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film certainly suits the description of being an underrated, forgotten classic! As school is about to start soon, one of our curricular assessments is based on the film so I went in, expecting a very disappointing and boring movie. What I eventually got was something that was funny, exciting and emotional that I didn't know would EVER happen! The biggest strength in this movie, to me, is undeniably its GREAT acting! The star of the movie, as many would say, is definitely a young Leonardo DiCaprio would unfortunately would not get the Oscar as Liam Neeson wins if for Schindler's List. Its unfortunate that this movie came out in the same year that the Winner of 7 Academy Awards, Schindler's List came out in. Johnny Depp himself is absolutely brilliant playing the family supporting brother who perfectly illustrates his character.The story never slows down. Its a fast paced drama from start to finish filled with much humor and emotion. The greatest thing about it all is that we personally care for all the characters in this film. The character I most cared about in this film was not Arnie or Gilbert, it was their obese mother, Bonnie. I found her the character I could feel for the most, imagining if the same had actually happened to my mother, how I would feel.Something I also love in this film is that despite a lot of humorous moments, the movie NEVER fails to fall out of its tone. The whole way through we care about these characters and find it so emotional when things to do eventually go wrong.The ending of the film was so powerful that if this film were to be brought back into cinemas, the final scene alone is worth the price of admission.For any who have not checked out this film, it certainly is a classical, underrated movie that is sure to leave you in tears for a good 120 minutes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful, beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot about this film and it is, in its own way, a classic. It's a bit of a strange experience to watch some of your favorite actors nearly 20 years ago, but it was definitely worth it. I've been a huge fan of both Depp and (especially) DiCaprio for a few years and I thought it would be nice to watch them in some of the roles that helped launch their careers. The film centers around Gilbert Grape, a young adult who helps take care of his morbidly obese mother and his mentally handicapped brother while trying to spend time with the newly found girl of his dreams. He has to deal with a lot of conflicting emotions regarding his family and his prospects, and thanks to Depp's masterful performance the viewer easily empathizes with the character's struggles. Gilbert is very protective of his brother Arnie, and their relationship plays a very important role as the movie unfolds.DiCaprio was brilliant in this film; it was hard to believe I wasn't actually seeing a mentally retarded teenager on the screen, and the Oscar nomination was definitely warranted. The film is very powerful, beautifully told and shot and with very pleasant music to boot. My only complaint is that I felt it was too long. Some subplots, such as Tucker's fixation with a fast food chain called Burger Barn, are welcome and very entertaining, but the film lingers for too long on the some of the romantic scenes between the main characters. Arnie's role seems to be reduced about halfway through the film and brought back to first plane as it unfolds. Otherwise, the film is very powerful and features stellar performances all around.</fullReview>

This film made me laugh and cry and Depp's performance was also very good as the bored Gilbert who has no joy in life except affairs with a married woman. Everyone else gives a good performance and the director did a great job. The film is very difficult to flaw except a couple of very small things ,like making Depp a red head and none of his family red headed seemed a bit pointless, but apart from those tiny details this film is great definitely one to watch.</fullReview>

I was focused when I saw this film but I still got the answer at the end of the film. And it gave a good emotion.Leonardo DiCaprio (Arnie Grape) is a very talented actor. It is actually questionable whether he is like that whom he is so called playing or he truly plays. Well, history has shown that he still just played and he did it brilliantly. What concerns about Johnny Depp (Gilbert Grape), then it's somewhat unbelievable. Is there really a association of similarity between Gilbert Grape and captain Jack Sparrow? You have to take a very good look to see that.Leo is the winner here. He is a stand-out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Good It Will Make You Angry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so good it will make you angry. At the way Leonardo DiCaprio was robbed of an Oscar (it went instead to Tommy Lee Jones that year for the Fugitive...unforgivable "Good Ole Boy politics, obviously). It will make you angry over the injustices of life, and at the parents who make themselves the victim rather than the advocates their children need them to be. But it will also make you feel good that life can be a triumph over tragedy rather than just succumbing to it. A must see for DiCaprio who does an incredible job as a handicapped teen, full of life &amp; love but never cloying or pitiful. But Johnny Depp also does an outstanding job as a young man on the verge of life and at the same time terrified of it.And when all is said &amp; done, "What's eating Gilbert Grape" is a hunger for life &amp; love for himself &amp; those he loves. This film makes you think both are available to all, if we're willing to taste them, the bitter &amp; the sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whats eating gilbert grape ?? good or bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of which was both enjoyable and emotional. Leonardo DiCaprio played the mentally disabled character Arnie he played it so well i thought that maybe it wasn't him playing it but an actual mentally disabled person was. Johnny Depp's character (Gilbert) is the big brother of the movie and cares for his family before himself and is very unselfish. Bonnie is extremely obese and this shows but it doesn't stop her from loving her family. In our eyes this movie was a 6 out of 10 for different reasons being it is funny at times but is also depressingly mean and the mother (bonnie) is taunted about her weight it is very eye openingly cruel of what todays people have become.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Ensemble Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rewatching this film recently I'm reminded of how great Johnny Depp was even in his earlier days. His performance in this movie is understated and moving. Although Depp's character is the "lead", he's surrounded by a fantastic ensemble cast, including Leo DiCaprio in an Oscar-nominated performance. (Another actor who was great even way-back-when. It's ironic how Depp's career went from indie to blockbuster, and DiCaprio's has gone from blockbuster to less mainstream - both with fantastic results.) The quirky characters, the small-town setting - it all comes together to create an enjoyable film. It's too bad Lasse Hallstrom has veered off this track in his later movies. I'd love to see him return to more original and quirky material such as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know about you guys, but I love Johnny Depp, he is my favorite actor, and always will be, but in the scene where he hits Arnie, I could have easily hated him. Whats Eating Gilbert Grape was probably one of the only movies that could ever make me cry, and that was the scene that did it. I just cannot watch a mentally challenged person being mistreated like that, my Health class watched What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and the person sitting next to me asked me if this movie was about "some retard" (I had previously seen this prior to the Health class) so I corrected him and said Arnie is probably the coolest person in the movie, and his reply was "He's still retarded", so I beat him up at recess. I HATE when people make fun of mentally challenged people, the only other movies that make me cry is "Radio", "Tru Confessions", and any other movie about people with mental disabilities. Please reply so I don't feel like the only guy with emotions!</fullReview>

DiCaprio and Depp at their, unfortunate some what forgotten, best. "What's eating..." also always reminds me why I'm supposed to be sorry for reading an interview with Juliette Lewis. In which she was saying that she'll only be doing parts in the future if she's in the need for money. This movie however is one of the top rated on my list on Swedish films an film makers doing something sensible. So beside the exquisite arts of the actors, director Lasse Hallstrom is the one to honored. Thank you Lasse! In conclusion: Makes one proud to be a Swede... for once.</fullReview>

However, Leonardo Dicaprio shone the most as Arnie ,and was so convincing, I wondered if the actor himself was actually mentally ill.The plot is a little boring but with a mixture of tear-jerking scenes,comedy and romance this is perfect for a girlie night in. Of course, not everybody will like this film;if your looking for guns, cars and action this is not for you. Overall, i really enjoyed the movie and was amazed at how well all the cast acted.

		<fullReview>Great film, with even greater performances--one everyone should see.I came in late when I saw this in the theater, but loved it anyway, and always wanted to see it all. Twelve years later, I found it on DVD, bought it, and tonight I watched it all.What I found absolutely amazing is that it was full of so many actors whose work I now admire so greatly. I hadn't even realized the main characters were played by Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. (I had remembered "Gilbert" as being Lou Diamond Phillips...sorry!) DiCapprio was amazing, and so young! I saw hints of this great performance again in The Aviator (which I also purchased). Perhaps DiCaprio works best when portraying the "mentally challenged" among us.While the film suffers from technical issues (the trucks headlights duplicated in the camera lens--c'mon! You can "PhotoShop" that out now, can't you?) and a lack of editing, I had time tonight, and actually enjoyed the longer pace.Though fiction, it's a story of real life events, and from the comments written here, I know many people related to it. As my daughter says, "We all come from dysfunctional families." :) I also noticed the director is Lasse Hallstrom (with one of those double-dot Swedish characters over the "o" which I don't know how to make...) and TODAY, June 2, is his birthday, so, Happy Birthday, Lasse. Email me. I know someone (Swedish-American) with an amazing script you should direct!</fullReview>

What a moving movie with an all star cast - Johnny Depp, Mary Steenburgen, Leonardo DiCaprio, Juliette Lewis, Kevin Tighe and more.I've seriously avoided "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", figuring it was a stupid movie with poor acting (even though I really like most of Johnny Depp's work, as well as Mary Steenburgen) and a poor plot and storyline. I've never been more wrong."What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is a drama with some comedic moments. You quickly learn to feel sorry for Gilbert Grape because, at an earlier than normal age, adult responsibilities (including some that adults run away from) are thrust upon him. It's a great story of how Gilbert handles all the issues in his and his family's life. Simply terrific!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most striking films I've ever seen. The depth of each of the main characters is equal to or better than any major film (perhaps by Glengarry Glen Ross). This movie is also of tremendous value for clinical psychologists and psychological practitioners, especially those involved with family therapy. The subtle dynamics of a family living under distressful conditions is portrayed in this movie with awe-striking sensitivity, and it is a reminder of the sensitivity needed when working with families in general. Kudos to what is probably Johnny Depp's finest role, a tribute to the below-middle class in America. Watch it a couple of times to catch important subtleties.</fullReview>

My younger brother had mental retardation, he passed away at the age of 17 - watching this film brought up many old memories, some happy, some sad. What I enjoyed most was the interaction between Gilbert and Arnie, it was just beautiful - Leonardo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp portrayed these characters so realistically. This film is not just entertainment - it shows the life of a lost young man, and I think everyone can identify with Gilbert to an extent. The cast was great and the story is beautiful. What's Eating Gilbert Grape contains many life lessons within the script - people of all ages can enjoy and learn from it (although there are a few scenes that are inappropriate for children). I wouldn't say this movie is a comedy - though it certainly does have it's comedic moments - it's drama, a poetic depiction of life, love, and human struggle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film last week for the first time. The acting was on a level above most films I have ever seen, in particular that of Johny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio. These two actors have shot up in my estimation since my having seen this movie, not in the sense that I didn't appreciate their recent work. I realized what true artists with integrity to their craft they must surely be, having been able to press on with their careers notwithstanding the absence of academy recognition for their performances here. The scene of Arnie trying to wake his dead mother, the developing expressions on his face , his striking of himself on the head, the pitch of his shrieks of joy while up in the tree, it really was character interpretation at its best. And Johny Depps Gilbert Grape character was able to successfully portray a reluctancy in his embarrassment of his overweight mother, fine shades in his of acting that overall made this a classic piece of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly underrated and completely essential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes there comes across a movie that doesn't shatter your TV screen or expensive audio set with great special effects, overwhelmingly adventurous stories or mega epic blockbusters. Sometimes there comes across a movie that's overwhelming in a completely different manner, achieved through a cast that's devoted in the best possible way, a much more down to earth moving storyline and a meaningful soundtrack that never gets in the way with the actors.What's Eating Gilbert Grape really belongs to the latter kind of film. Since the rising popularity of (the then virtually unknown) Leonardo DiCaprio, much more people took a look at this production, which has got so much to offer it's a shame it hasn't received the kind of attention before. It really is pointless to go into the story of this film because there's so much to mention, so many moments pass along with great intensity and truthfulness that I can only recommend every viewer of this page to go and see this movie about a not so average American country family trying to make the best of the world they got dealt with. Darlene Cates makes a powerful impression as the much too fat mother of the family and Leonardo DiCaprio simply soars in one of the best parts ever captured on tape.Unbelievable how some films can give you a real, rich boost of emotion and energy without even using excessive Hollywood force to win everyone's hearts. If you like greatness in modesty in films, where purity and conviction in acting are in the center of things, you'll simply love this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting by a youthful cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is a great piece of acting by a youthful cast. I prognosticated the very success of some of our most popular current actors. Johnny Depp gives a masterful performance as Gilbert Grape. His younger brother, Arnie Grape, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He gives a genius performance at his young age of a retarded boy who is engaging and endearing to the viewer. One is fooled by his perfect act to think that he is genuinely a patient with cerebral palsy. Their mother is morbidly obese and barely able to walk because of her extreme size. She attracts empathy from the audience and also gives a convincing performance. Juliette Lewis at around age 20 plays Becky, Gilbert's girlfriend, and Mary Steenburgen plays Betty Carver, the middle aged married woman seeking a trist with Gilbert at every opportunity. This cinema is very well made, and deserves a viewing by every serious moviegoer.</fullReview>

It made me, as a young child cry and feel so much empathy for these character, especially Gilbert. There was so much truth to the story that it makes it impossible for the audience to not feel the overwhelming emotion, that we know Gilbert, feels deep inside of him. Depps intended gentle performance allows for the film not become about one person, but the world in which that one person lives. It is not a love story focused on love, bot rather a life story focused on life.It is such an amazing experience, and to watch it now I still maintain such an appreciation for its rawness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie got only one Oscar nomination and didn't win any. Hard to understand why!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's eating Gilbert Grape is a very original and moving film about a young man (Gilbert Grape, played by Johnny Depp) who, after the death of his father, has to take care about his obese mother (he calls her a beached whale once) and his younger brother who's 18, but with the mental capacities of a 5 year old. He has a love-hate relationship with his mom and brother. He loves them, but sometimes he can't take it any more and has to flee from them. Living in a very small town, where there is absolutely nothing to do, he hasn't much reasons to be happy. But than he meets the intriguing Becky (played by Juliette Lewis).This movie is really well made. The characters are excellently portrayed, the story is touching but not too heavy... It is said to be a comedy / drama, but personally I think you better call it a drama with some funny moments. If this funny moments wouldn't be in the movie, it would probably be very hard to keep watching it with as much attention as you do now.The movie got only one Oscar nomination, which is hard to understand. It really deserved more than that one nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio and should at least have won one Oscar, but it didn't. Too bad, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good movie of course. I reward it with an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the eighties and nineties there was a popular series of children's books about the "Garden Gang", characters based upon fruit and vegetables with alliterative names such as Oscar Orange, Robert Raspberry, Colin Cucumber or Gertrude Gooseberry. Gilbert Grape sounds as though he should be a character from that series, but he is in fact a young man living in the small town of Endora, Iowa. (Was the town named after Agnes Moorehead's character in "Bewitched"?) Gilbert finds himself at the head of a family which can only be described as dysfunctional. His father is dead; we later learn that his death was in fact suicide. His mother Bonnie is morbidly obese and has not set foot outside her house for several years. His elder brother Larry has left home for good, and his younger brother Arnie is mentally handicapped. (I know politically correct Americans prefer the expression "mentally challenged", but here in Britain that would just be a sarcastic way of calling someone stupid). There are also two sisters, Ellen and Amy, but they do not play major roles in the film.Apart from his day-job as a clerk in a grocery store, Gilbert's main responsibility is caring for Arnie (normally quite manageable, apart from his regular habit of climbing to the top of the town's water tower) and his housebound mother. What is "eating" Gilbert is the fact that he feels trapped by the need to care for his family but is emotionally unable to abandon them as Larry has done. He has been conducting an affair with Betty, an unhappily married local housewife, but finds a more satisfying romance when he meets Becky, a girl who roams round the country in a trailer with her grandmother; they just happen to have broken down in Endora.There is some good acting in the film, particularly from Johnny Depp as Gilbert and Juliette Lewis as the gentle, sensitive Becky. Depp has never let his status as a major star dissuade him from playing quirky roles, and here his appearance, bespectacled and with long, lank ginger hair, seems quite at variance with his normal heart-throb image. Leonardo di Caprio's performance as Arnie was reasonably good ?certainly better than those he gave in some of his later films such as "Titanic" and "Gangs of New York"- but not, in my view, really deserving of an Oscar nomination. In the late eighties and early nineties, however, the easiest way to get a nomination seems to have been to play a disabled person. (This was, after all, the year when "Best Actress" went to Holly Hunter for her portrayal of a mute and "Best Actor" to Tom Hanks for playing an AIDS victim).I have always regarded Lasse Hallstrom as an overrated director. His more recent films "Chocolat" and "The Cider House Rules" were characterised by lush (at times cloyingly so) photography, but I felt that this was used as a smokescreen to disguise some very questionable philosophising. "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is less visually sumptuous than those films; doubtless the Iowa prairies allowed Hallstrom less scope in that regard than did New England or rural France. Nor does he seem so keen to make propaganda for some dubious philosophy of life. The film has more in common with his early film, "My Life as a Dog", made in his native Sweden and which also dealt with a dysfunctional family."Gilbert Grape" could have been interesting as a tragic study of family life, but I felt that it concentrated too much on Gilbert himself and not enough on the other members of his family. Amy and Ellen are minor figures, and Bonnie and Arnie seem less like people in their own right than like plot devices to act as tests of Gilbert's patience. (The most shocking moment comes when the otherwise saintly Gilbert loses his temper with Arnie and hits him).My opening remarks about the "Garden Gang" were not simply meant facetiously. The slangy, colloquial title ("eating" is here given its colloquial meaning of "worrying", with possible quibbles on the literal meaning and the alternative slang meaning of "performing oral sex") and the jokey name of the central character give the misleading impression that the film is an eccentric, offbeat comedy. There are, certainly, comic elements, but these sit uneasily with the film's more serious themes. "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" is not a bad film, rather a mediocre one, often long-winded with little to say. At one point Arnie exclaims "We're not going anywhere!". Watching this film, I knew how he felt. 5/10</fullReview>

The supporting performances that consist of the likes of Juliette Lewis and Crispin Glover are very winning, but I was even more impressed with the leads.

		<fullReview>Supporting the disabled is not easy. That burden is something that nobody can carry easily, and the only thing that can fuel perseverance to keep from being overwhelmed by this burden is love. Yet I'm sure anyone who has had to experience something like what we see in What's Eating Gilbert Grape can say that the pressures get very overwhelming and it makes it an extremely daunting task, making it very hard to stay sane. Johnny Depp does an excellent job in portraying these emotional tribulations through his character of Gilbert Grape. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is about a family of five. Gilbert is the oldest son who has two sisters and a mentally handicapped brother, Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), that he must constantly look after. The mother of the family is an equally heavy burden (no pun intended) because she is morbidly obese and in no way self sufficient. The film focuses on Gilbert's emotional hardships he must endure trying to support his family in the small rural town of Endora, Iowa. The story focuses heavily on family and doing whats ethical versus doing what's easiest. It's an interesting look into the human condition.Overall the film looks beautiful. The director obviously puts a lot of care into capturing such a deeply emotional story, and he paces his film fittingly. The film is very consistent, and this works throughout the film's entirety, but the minuscule variations in tone and pace drag the film down. The director does a nice job at showcasing the wide open rural setting the film is takes place in and he uses a lot of good country motifs to give the film its consistent mood. He no doubt shoots the film very well and makes the most out of what he is given.There are a number of big stars in this film, and they all do a good job. Johnny Depp carries the film very well and is plenty believable. The character of Gilbert Grape teeters on the line between angry and sympathetic about his brother Arnie. He even makes the statement at the beginning of the film, "The doctor says Arnie could die any day. Some days you're glad Arnie's alive. Some days... you're not." This line sets the stage for a lot of Gilberts polarizing attitudes that he has to fight through to keep his family safe. He is a character a lot of people can surely relate to, making the whole story much more personal for certain audiences. For me, I understood the challenge of Gilbert, but obviously couldn't connect at the same level as some people might.DiCaprio gets a lot of praise for his role as the severely mentally disabled Arnie Grape. I think that a lot of the acclamation he gets for this role is overrated. For the level at which DiCaprio plays his character, he does a good job. However, I wish Tropic Thunder could have come out about fifteen years earlier so that DiCaprio would have been enlightened by the infamous yet relevant phrase, "you never go full retard." I hate to say it, but DiCaprio went full retard. Like I said, for going full retard DiCaprio handled the role well, but the fact of the matter is you never go full retard. There were times where he definitely overdid it, and it was difficult to connect with such an out of touch character. The connection really falls to the people around him and how he affects them. The rest of the cast does a great job with what they're given though. Especially the beautiful shining Juliette Lewis, who seems to perfect every role she plays with a kind of sophistication that you don't see in younger actresses anymore.The storyline in What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of those story lines that makes for a great synopsis. A young man must support his family that consists of a mentally handicapped brother and morbidly obese mother in a small rural town. You can tell from that one sentence that this should be an emotional, uplifting, and probably tragic film. But when you drag it out into a two hour film, the results are much less extraordinary than what you were led to believe from the synopsis. Admittedly, not a lot happens in this film. It is a much stronger focus on the characters, which is not a problem, but here it seems to become monotonous and redundant after a while. The film develops very slowly and after a while we seem to see the same things over and over again. It's just one problem after another focusing around Arnie or their obese mother. But probably the most unfortunate thing about this story is that it becomes very formulaic. In the end it is a very predictable film that I've seen multiple times, just with different types of issues set in a different location. And to add insult to injury, I can't say this sort of genre appeals to me at all, so on a personal level it was already headed down a bad road.What's Eating Gilbert Grape has its highs and lows, but for what it is I can't say it's a bad movie. It's just not a great movie. It's not poorly made and there is a lot of obvious care put forth by the director and actors. They make the most out of what they have, which is fairly weak in some respects. I have too many issues with this film that keep me from loving it, but I certainly didn't hate it. I have to respect it for what it is, but it's definitely something I won't watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathos turns to bathos within the course of an hour...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers.This movie has a lot in common with Pay It Forward, another movie I didn't like. Grape starts out with many interesting characters- a 500 pound mom who hasn't been out of the house in seven years, a 17 year old handicapped boy, a 15 girl who can't stop looking at her teeth since the braces came off, a store clerk trying to pitifully run his store and compete with the chain down the street, a girl who gets stranded in the town and decides to stay, a women who is married who has a sort of ice creamy affair with Gilbert. Like Pay It Forward, a story that starts out amusing, turns into a sappy, overdone affair, complete with a death in the end, so everyone can grab a tissue. Both films are really over the top and end up crushing their life in the process, so it becomes unwatchable, even comical when it is meant to be the opposite. I had high hopes for it, since it is a cult favorite. After seeing it, I wonder why it is.This film sadly goes limp by the half way point. I don't know if it is Juliette Lewis I just can't stand, or nothing really happened, or the drama turned to bathos...it just had all the personality of a dying dog with rabies that should be put out of its misery. Every time the screen went black, I hoped it was all over, yet no it wasn't. As another viewer said, this is torture.John C. Reilly was the only humor relief in the film. I enjoyed his character. Other characters, like the "quirky" family, were introduced as a highpoint. Then there was nothing else to them, they seemed 2-D and lifeless. There was nothing to keep it going except a few scenes with the brother and a lukewarm romance with the bicycle girl...a slight pulse...I started to read a magazine in the midway point, not a good sign!It might just be the sadist in me, but I wanted Leonardo DiCaprio's character to come to an early end, probably just to end the movie. The kids runs off at a funeral almost in front of a "Burger Barn" truck and boy, I was cheering for it to run him over. Of course, I was hoping his character would be beaten to death in Gangs of New York, there is just something about his acting that makes me want to see as little of it as possible. I wonder why when someone plays a handicapped character, all of a sudden it is an Oscar worthy performance, no matter who it is...I suppose Lewis should have got one to for The Other Sister...another film I assume is overly full of bathos, so I don't bother seeing it, especially after this film. I get tired of the "handicapped person as profound" theme of many movies. Hopefully this trend has ended. It just seems so false.And at the end, I couldn't figure out what was eating Gilbert. He seemed to get the girls and be ok with his mentally impaired brother and he got to leave at the end...so what was his problem again? I didn't quite understand why they burn the house down with their dead mother inside...I know she was sad because she was so heavy, but couldn't have they just buried her in the backyard? The dialog is pretty pointless to. Read this exchange: Becky: I love the sky. It's so limitless. Gilbert: It is big. It's very big. Becky: Big doesn't even sum it up, right? That word big is so small.Oh yes, it is THAT profound. My cynicism gets the best of me here...I got sick of hearing these supposed philosophical yet working class lines about life. The only parts of the film I thought felt real where when Gilbert beats up his brother and the frustration of his mother. Other than that, most of the other characters flatlined and I couldn't have cared less...isn't drama supposed to convey emotions? I don't even know anything about Lewis' character...she rode it on a bike and didn't have much of a story, except she liked Gilbert. I would recommend running away from this film as fast as you can. Depp's character here isn't as interesting as most of his other films by far. You would be better off with Don Juan De Marco, Sleepy Hollow or Edward Scissorhands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubting the quality of the acting in this film. Leonado in particular is outstanding and Depp plays his role well too.The subject matter presents such great possibilities and - thankfully - it certainly avoids all the potential Hollywood clichés that it would have been so easy to fall into. Unfortunately it avoids them so much that it just doesn't go anywhere much at all.The film felt like 4 hours not 2 - which I guess helps us empathise with the lead character! And if the directors aim was to get us to feel empathy with Gilbert Grape then he's done an outstanding job. I now know what it's like to feel trapped, bored, numb, like I'm just passing time. Sorry, for all those of you who love it (my wife did!) it just didn't do anything for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) has to care for his brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his obese mother (Darlene Cates), which gets in the way when love (Juliette Lewis) walks into his life.What really sells this film, for me, is the cast. Besides those mentioned above, we also have John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover, both of whom are amazing (and Reilly was not well-known yet, I believe). The plot itself is nothing really special, and if there is some deep message, I guess I missed it.Unfortunately, I would rank this as one of Depp's lower roles. He is not quirky, or handsome, or charming or funny. He is just a guy with terrible hair and a messed up family. I might be misjudging him because it is so unlike any other role he has done, but it did nothing for me. Depp himself felt he played the character of Gilbert in a "boring" way, and I agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>iaahhhh...no idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "What's eating Gilbert Grape?" is based on the novel by Peter Hedges. The main characters are acted by Johnny Depp, Juliette Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio. It is about a guy who lives with his family in a small town called Endora somewhere in Iowa. His mother suffers from obesity and his younger brother Arnie is disabled. He also has two other sisters, one is younger and one is older than him. One day he meets a girl, whose name is Becky and the love-story begins between them. Gilbert doesn't seem to be very happy with his life. He always has to care about his retarded brother because his mother can't do anything. He can't really live his own life. When he meets Becky there is also often his family in the way. For example one day when they were together, he had to go, because Arnie had to take a bath. he promised Becky to come back, so he put Arnie in the bath-tub and explained him how to get out and so on. When he came back later in the night, Arnie was still having a bath. Gilbert'S mum was quite angry but I can understand Gilbert that he just once wanted to think about himself and only about his family. I think all in all the plot is a bit boring. It'S only about Gilbert who can't get out of this small town, Endora and start his own life. The love-story between him and Becky doesn't really get started. It's not a real love-story, it's more like a friendship, because Gilbert can't really show his feelings. So all in all I think the film is ok, but I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*YAWN* Why does everyone love this film so much? Everyone says this film is extremely realistic and all families goes through this!!! I say "yeah, WHATEVER!"Yeah, I guess just about every family has a suicidal dad, a morbidly obese mom, and too many siblings.Yeah, I also guess that all mentally handicapped people are total brain-dead idiots that do nothing but try to be cute and act like little kids.Personally, I found this film VERY insulting towards everybody. People in the Midwestern USA (or is it Texas, dunno, been so long since I've been to the west....-_-) are not all trailer trash! And I thought Leotardo Dicaprio was actually a demeaning insulting towards mentally challenged individuals. Okay, I have a cousin with Autism and I have ADD myself, and I even WORKED with retarted and autistic people and NONE that I knew acted like Leo's character! Downright TASTELESS!!!And in reallity, Gilbert would feel quite ashamed of his family and possibly go into a violent breakdown with some of them. Oh, and about the obese mom, would have he done something about it instead of sitting there saying "I'm so ashamed. Ma used to be pretty, but now, she's a whale"! What a pathethic loser!If you want a true film that realistically portrays people, watch Jackie Chan's and Sammo Hung's "Heart of Dragon" (Long Xie Song). Now they could act without tending to be insulting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok let's get this straight. I hated this movie. I could not believe I wasted so much time watching such a poor excuse for cinema. So why bother to write this? I hear you ask. Well, the reason I got through this movie was due to Leo DiCaprio's performance as Arnie Grape. The depth, warmth, sincerity, and above all total and utter credibility and believability (so maybe it's not a word, but it's all that's coming to me right now) made me at first sceptical to believe that it was actually Leonardo on the screen. And after that I completely forgot it was even him. And that is something that is incredibly hard to convince an audience of, especially when you look like he does. I was actually speechless after the closing credits, sat in a wonderment of such phenomenal talent and dedication. It seems an understatement to say that he was worthy of an Oscar. He deserved much more than that, and maybe he got it. If it were anyone but Tommy-Lee Jones' 'Sam Gerard' that beat Leo for the Oscar, I would've lost all faith in the Academy. As it is I can only say that it's a shame that his best work was in such a pathetic movie. Leo saves this from ending up in a dumpster next to "The Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes". See this movie only to see one of the best performances you're likely to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is such a bully at times!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of these films that are an essential step in the career of an actor. It was true for Leonardo DiCaprio who got his first Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for the role of a differently-abled kid . It is true he does a good job in that part and he is a brilliant couple with Johnny Depp as his bigger brother. The film is entertaining though on many other levels. The survival of a small town in the US at a time when big shopping malls are opening everywhere. These small towns are doomed to die sooner or later. Their only chance is to become suburban development projects and become the home of people working in the big city next door who want to live away from the hectic activity of the city and commute there every day. We are before this development in Endora. The second interest is the fate of a family in which there is a mentally disabled child. Here they have no opportunity to provide him with an education and some professional activity. So he is more or less attached to a member of his family and he is haunting if not even worse that brother of his, as well as the police and neighbors. It is never vicious but it is really bothering those who want to have peace and quiet. The place of mentally disabled people in our society is something difficult to envisage because they are necessarily a burden to normative people and a normative system that has to adapt to them and not the reverse. Today things have changed a lot, thanks to such films probably, definitely. Then the film attaches itself to showing the mother who is an extremely obese person, her shame, her humiliation, her lot that is close to an ordeal. The film shows how dependent she is on her own family, on her own children, the father having died a long time before. And the film tries to show her under the best light they can afford. On her disabled son's birthday, after having accepted to be introduced to her elder son's girl friend (a young woman who had to stop in Endora with her mother and their traveling bus for a couple of weeks because of the breakdown of the car they travel in), after climbing back up to the second floor bedroom of the house for the first time in many years and lying there on her back, she dies without any kind of pain or noise with her disabled son calling for her to wake up. The film though has a strange ending. The children decide to burn her in the house since she cannot be taken down. A domestic pyre for the mother and a complete liberation for the children who are scattered away now they are homeless. The burial of old civilizations, of the Hinduist tradition. Amazing. And yet it is not the end. A last scene shows how the elder brother is recuperated by his girlfriend who comes back to pick him up and away from Endora and by picking one she gets two because the disabled brother comes along too. That's what happens when a mechanical incident forces you to stop over in a lost village in the countryside for a couple of weeks. You get trapped in some kind of sentimental cage like the disabled brother's crickets in his glass jar where he raises them. A good decent softly entertaining film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was well-acted, interesting and a bizarre story but, man, one viewing was enough. That was because of Leonardo DiCaprio's title character, "Arnie Grape," is hard to take in more than one dosage.The young DiCaprio, in the beginning of what has become a solid acting career, plays this mentally-challenged kid who yells all the time. Who wants to hear someone ranting and raving all the time? Not me. That "act" wears thin, believe me. It's shocking to see a 400-pound woman (Darlene Cates) acting in this movie, but here she is, playing the boy's mother "Bonnie," and she does a fine job of acting as all do in here. That includes the weird Johnny Depp doing something really strange for him - playing a normal person, the title character of "Gilbert Grape."As with many stories dealing with dysfunctional families, the movie is not always a lot of fun to watch, but it's one you remember. Kudos to all concerned for a memorable film, even if I didn't care to watch it a second time....although I just might now that it's been a long time since the first viewing, and it's out on DVD.This is just one of many, many extremely interesting movies that came out in 1993, a year, I think, that was the best ever in films.</fullReview>

The film is very consistent, and this works throughout the film's entirety, but the minuscule variations in tone and pace drag the film down. The director does a nice job at showcasing the wide open rural setting the film is takes place in and he uses a lot of good country motifs to give the film its consistent mood. He no doubt shoots the film very well and makes the most out of what he is given.There are a number of big stars in this film, and they all do a good job.

		<fullReview>The movie "What's eating Gilbert Grape?" is based on a novel by Peter Hedges, who adapted his own book. Gilbert Grape lives in Endora, a town with less than 1000 inhabitants and a place where nothing happens. The police only has something to do when Arnie, Gilbert's little, disabled brother, climbs up the water tower. Taking care of Arnie is Gilbert's full-time-job and it's not an easy one, especially when he has to work in a grocery store at the same time. This problem gets bigger, when Becky and her mother stop in the town, because they have trouble with their car. Gilbert falls in love with Becky, but he doesn't have much time to meet her, because of his family and his job. What I like about the movie is the point that it is realistic. Life can be so hard for someone like Gilbert. Another point I like are the brilliant actors in the movie. I think in this particular movie Leonardo di Caprio acts better than in his other roles in movies like Titanic. But there are some aspects, which make the film a very boring movie. It's the fact that it's both a love-story and a drama in the same movie. In my opinion it is very difficult to put these two genres in one movie. In general I would say that this movie is nothing for those, who like action and horror movies, because nothing really interesting happens.Jan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel almost guilty writing a review for this film....because it's not a positive one...and I have friends who really like it, and say they "identify" with it.But, I gotta be honest...it's boring. It is 128 minutes long. And for 120 of those minutes, I was waiting for something, anything, interesting, unusual, inspirational to happen.I might as well have watched Little House on the Prairie, or The Walton's.CharactersGilbert (played by Johnny Depp) is longing for something more than what he has and what he knows. But he is tied down with helping the local store, looking after his brother Arnie, and taking care of his mother.His sisters are also longing for something more.Arnie (played by Leo DiCap) likes to climb the local water tower and it makes everyone very nervous (which is why he ends up in jail). Later he celebrates his 18th birthday. Something that the doctors said would never happen. Arnie is an adorable special needs kids who can be somewhat of a handful from time to time.Gilbert's mother is a big woman, who used to be beautiful. She finally recognizes that eating lots of fried chicken and cheese curds may possibly lead to obesity. She realizes how big she has become when she goes to rescue Arnie from the local jail where hoards of local folks have gathered to ogle her and take her picture. There are about 30 people waiting outside the jail when she comes out....waiting to see old Widow Grape. Does anyone else think this is pathetic? Your thrill of the day was seeing the fat woman in town? Here's a dollar...go purchase a meaningful life.Gilbert's mom passes away after she successfully walks upstairs for the first time in ages. Although this event is tragic, it ultimately frees the siblings of their commitment to stay at home and care for their mother. They are now free to pursue other beneficial and productive interests. The world is at their fingertips. Will they take that next step? Will they move out of Endora? Will they put forth the effort to improve their sense of self-worth...or will they be content to remain as they are? That is mostly left up to the viewer to decide. Gilbert will almost certainly be the one who will care for Arnie.Plot It's about the lives of a small-town family in any-town USA.Gilbert is banging some other man's wife because she "settled" and married some bland insurance agent that she wasn't truly in love with (she later admits after he dies that she "misses him and she doesn't miss him"). That's another way of saying she married the wrong guy. She used him as a safety net. Now that her safety net is gone, she "misses him". But that didn't stop her from cheating on him. And she didn't give a sh*t about him while he was alive.Later in the film, Gilbert hits his special needs brother, Arnie because he's being difficult. (Go figure, a special needs kid not understanding the consequences of his actions). Gilbert feels bad about doing this and runs to the local new girl in town, Becky (played by Juliette Lewis). He finds that she has gotten Arnie to go swimming (something that Arnie is fearful of). Shortly thereafter, he confesses his mistake to Becky and all is well in the morning. The whole movie is like this.The best part is the house burning down...Gilbert did not want her mother to be disrespected by airlifting her out of the upstairs (after she dies) because they cannot carry her down the stairs. Good for you, Gilbert. Summary This movie is chalk full of the inconsequential happenings of an any-town family in any-town America. And it is 128 minutes of boredom. Bottom line - many, many people go to movies to see something they CAN'T see in everyday life. They go to movies to learn, to be inspired, to escape. Where I live, I could drive 20 miles in any direction and experience any of the plot points in this film first-hand, and it wouldn't cost me $5 for a ticket. Synopsis -Common events happening to common people.-Uninspiring and dull-The minute I entered the town of Endora, I wanted to leave. I felt the same at the end of my 128-minute journey.Conclusion -Leo gives the performance of a lifetime as Arnie!For that, I kick it up one point.-The material, subjects, and style of this film are purposefully focused on the ordinary. Thus, this film is ordinary. So, it gets an ordinary score. 5/10.Apologies to my friends who like it. I fail to see the allure. I'd rather have my grandmother take a big stinky dump on my chest. G'night everybody!</fullReview>

Playing straight roles - that's the tricky part.All these movie petards, I'm sick of them: Tom Hanks as Gump, Tom Hanks as a Philadelphian, Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, Angelina Jolie as a "mother" of 16, Susan Sarandon in "Dead Man Walking", Sean Penn as... Sean Penn in every movie, Barbra Streisand as "Yentl"... Who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good actors, bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "What`s eating Gilbert Grape" is about a boy called Gilbert, who lives with his mother, his two sisters and his 18-years-old handicaped brother in Endora, Iowa. His father left them a couple of years ago. Gilbert has a lot of problems because he has to play his father`s role.One day he meets Beck`s a Beer who is visiting her grandma in Iowa and fells in love with her. At the end of the movie they become a couple.I didn`t really like that story. I think the actors were really good especially Leonardi Di Caprio but the story was too boring.There was no suspense at no point of the story and the whole story was written very simple.I really wouldn`t watch the movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sedative, but too irritating to make you fall asleep. Skin deep characters. Juliette Lewis is a caricature; she pretends to be a wise woman who understands the deeper meaning of life (and love), but she doesn't convince, in fact she is annoying. This movie is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring Movie, badly thought out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love Johnny Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio? Then this is not a movie for you. They star in one of the worst films I've watched, 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'. Their performances by the actors Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio is good, I give many credits to Leonardo DiCaprio for his acting, he acted like a mentally retarded person, I couldn't tell it was fake!The plot is very different compared to all the action movies we love from Hollywood. The Grapes' are already troubled from the start, and things just get worse. It may have a star studded line up but the actual storyline is out of date for this time. It is set in a fake town called Endora, in Iowa, USA.The acting is exceptionally good, Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job of acting like a mentally retarded person. Johnny Depp is not serious enough to play this role of the main character, he still is renowned for his humor. People who love seeing Johnny Depp in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie series will be disappointed . As Johnny Depp tries to be a very serious person (which he is not), it is advised to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' fans and others not to watch this film.The funny remarks that Johnny Depp makes to the obese actress Darlene Cates who plays "Momma" are funny especially the line, "She is a whale!" There are many stereotypes shown, that Americans are fat and love eating fat, is in this movie. Another stereotype that is shown is the Americans love for fast food.The director Lasse Hallstorm has bought his Swedish filming styles and have used very awkward camera shots in this film. The cameramen in this film movie were lazy. They used the same shot (Wide shot, for those actually interested) for most of the film.Also featured in this film is the weird Juliette Lewis. She is probably the worst actress in this film. She is unattractive and uninteresting. Her life is so "perfect" which is so fake!I give this film 1 star, for the acting that Leonardo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp and Darlene Cates, which saved this film from getting nothing! This is a very badly finished film, with a very laid back and pathetic plot. The screenplay is pathetic, it highly lacks pizazz. This is one of the worst ways to waste 113 Minutes thanks to Swedish director, Lasse Hallstorm. This movie is a mix of a slow plot + good acting + corny lines x laughter ÷ by a little bit of romance = BORING!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse movie I ever saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp must be hiding his face over this one. DeCaprio played the part of a retarded boy brilliantly. However hours of his portrayal were just a bit too much. It ceased to be entertaining and became instead something I could not wait to turn off. It did not entertain me. It made me wonder why they wasted film on such a story. I can see it labeled as an earpy classroom film, that students are made to watch for class credit. But what an awful way to have to earn a grade. Yuck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have ever seen in my /life/</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this title alone holds that horrible disgrace. Nothing else I have ever seen has ever come /close,/ and I doubt any other movie will hold this title. It was the most boring, agonizing collection of photons I have ever been forced to view. (The "family" was required to watch it because Siskel &amp; Ebert approved it and it was billed as such--my family's disturbing, and hence the reason I despise anything by the pair). It was several hours of pure MISERY!Thankfully I've blocked out most of my memories of the film, but I would not advise this movie for use as anything but an instrument of TORTURE, and even then it's still so /wrong./ Please, may such an atrocity never be inflicted on the human race again.</fullReview>
