		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person who enjoys good movies, as well as reading and writing, I loved this film, and would see it again. Some may accuse it of being formulaic, but I feel that there is just enough unexpected-ness in it to keep the audience interested. I would hope that the apparent similarities to the director, Gus Van Sant's earlier work, Good Will Hunting, do not dissuade anyone from seeing the film. Any similarities are unimportant and do not take away from the fact that this is a good movie which stands alone as a deep film with an good plot. The script is very well written and all of the dialog appears real and natural. It is a thought provoking drama, but it is not depressing or sappy, as all too many dramas are. At the same time, it does not give the impression of simply being a feel-good movie. Also, although there are several humorous lines in the movie, they do not rely on cheap puns or slap stick humor.William Forester once wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book, but now is a recluse, hiding from his fame, who never leaves his book-filled apartment in the Bronx, but spends his time reading and bird watching, as well as watching the teenagers of the neighborhood play basketball in the park outside his window. Jamal Wallace is one of these teenagers. He hides his love of reading, and his brilliant writing skills, and chooses instead to gain the acceptance of his peers through his skill at basketball. A prep school has offered Jamal a scholarship because of his high test scores, and their need to win a basketball championship. The two characters meet, and Forester becomes a sort of teacher/mentor, but both learn many things from each other. Symbolism is important in this film, and it makes many good points about people, how we relate to each other, and how we deal with the difficulties of life.The movie stays away from any violence and sex. It is rated PG-13 because of brief strong language and sexual references, but even these are few, and not over done, using only what is necessary to create real characters and setting -- a refreshing difference from many films that are now being made. The message of the film is good and moral, but it was wonderful to see a serious film staring a young black person that does not hit you over the head with messages of racial tolerance.One of the surprises in the film is the great soundtrack. It is mostly Jazz songs from Miles Davis and others, which seems well suited to the mood of the movie and to the setting, another well done part of the film. The final song, a medley of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" and "What a Wonderful World" is great. I was happy that this movie had refused to do what many recent movies have done in capitalizing on a soundtrack and trying to use or create hit pop songs in a movie. It also stays away from sappy and unnecessary orchestra music that is often used to try to create emotion in the audience. This movie does not need to resort to tricks like this in order to make you feel for the characters. Another happy surprise is a cameo from Matt Damon.The acting is wonderful, particularly from the experienced Sean Connery, playing the title character, and from newcomer Robert Brown, as Jamal. Even the more minor parts in the film, such as Jamal's older brother, played by Busta Rhymes, and Jamal's friends and teachers are well-acted. Anna Paquin is well suited for her role as Claire, a rich girl from the prep school that Jamal transfers to. The two seem to make a connection, but a romantic subplot is not pursued very far in the film. I found this a refreshing change, and one of the factors that kept the movie from being too predictable, as well as much more realistic. Real life romances do not usually happen the way they often do in films. A disappointment was the character played by F. Murray Abraham. Although well acted, there is a complete lack of character development, and the teacher-that-gives-the-brilliant-student-a-hard-time stereotype is hard to ignore. Despite this one shortcoming, this is an excellent film.As the film ended and the credits began to roll, I noticed that no one in the theater got up to leave, as is usually the case in theaters. The audience remained seated until the credits and music had finished, and the lights came back on. It is just that kind of a movie. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone wishing to see a mature and thought-provoking film that is entertaining and enjoyable to watch, and will leave you feeling inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On The Resilience Of The Human Spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reclusive author, whose only published novel won the Pulitzer Prize, becomes the mentor of an underprivileged and talented sixteen-year-old in `Finding Forrester,' directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Sean Connery and newcomer Rob Brown. Young Jamal Wallace (Brown) is a star basketball player in his neighborhood, and-- unbeknownst to his peers-- also has a gift for writing. The acceptance he needs from his friends, however, that need to `fit in,' is derived from playing ball; yet his heart is in his writing. But he knows that within the limited confines of his environs his skill with the written word means next to nothing in regards to his future, and he sees basketball as the only viable means of doing anything worthwhile with his life. That is, until one day circumstances bring him into contact with William Forrester (Connery); and it's an encounter that ultimately changes the direction of his life forever. Working from an intelligent, well crafted screenplay by Mike Rich, Van Sant establishes the milieu within which the story will unfold with his opening shot: A black youth setting the stage in rap. It's clever and effective, and the contrast between the rap at the beginning and the song at the end not only frames the film but underscores the impact of the story, as it succinctly encapsulates the changes in Jamal's life. As he did with `Drugstore Cowboy' and `Good Will Hunting,' Van Sant successfully captures the essence of a particular culture and how those living within it relate to those apart from it. It's a study of human nature and the levels of diversity of which our society is comprised, and Van Sant does it exceedingly well. As far as performances go, Connery makes the most of one of his best roles in years. Perfectly cast as Forrester, he lends an adamant toughness to the character initially, then slowly and subtly allows the vulnerability that lies beneath the gruff exterior to surface. It makes for a well-rounded, complete portrayal, as we see not only his iconoclastic leanings, but the very human and caring side of the man as well. And it's Connery's superlative performance, through which he conveys the complexities of the character so well, that illuminates the true depth and multi-faceted dimensions of Forrester; it is not only memorable, but worthy of an Oscar. In his motion picture debut, Brown takes the screen by storm; a storm that is at once gentle and discerning, yet endowed with a strength born of it's own momentum. With a manner reminiscent of Cuba Gooding Jr. in `Boyz N the Hood,' he has a natural acting ability that commands attention, and if his performance here is any indication of his talents (which obviously it must be), then it is safe to say that the cinematic world has certainly just been enriched by his presence. The supporting cast includes F. Murray Abraham (Professor Robert Crawford), Anna Paquin (Claire), Busta Rhymes (Terrell), April Grace (Ms. Joyce), Michael Pitt (Coleridge) and Michael Nouri (Dr. Spence). An uplifting example of deriving hope from hopelessness, `Finding Forrester' is an entertaining and moving testimony to the resilience and depth of the human spirit. It's a film that will stay with you long after the screen has gone dark, for there is much here to be savored and embraced; a film too good to be allowed to let pass you by. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding meaning in Finding Forrester</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mechanics of the movie have been well-reviewed by others. Yes, it could definitely have been a better movie, but then again what movie can't you say that about? In terms of plot and character development what it needed most was another 30 minutes, but at two and a quarter hours already most studios would never allow that. (Note that the movie did not seem nearly that long to me.) Perhaps the plot and story could have been tighter, but it's really a remarkable job for first-time screenwriter Mike Rich.The acting, while not always remarkable, was quite good. Connery brilliantly underplayed Forrester, yielding a less dramatic but much more realistic portrayal of the writer. Rob Brown's portrayal of Jamal was equally reserved yet forceful. The directing held the two characters in balance well. The other characters were well-acted though not generally well-developed (hence much criticism of this movie).Others have compared Finding Forrester to Goodwill Hunting (also directed by Gus Van Sant) and to Scent of a Woman, suggesting that it is just a ripoff of the plot in those two. If so (which I doubt), those are two pretty good movies to plagiarize. The basic concept of Forrester's story (first novel wins Pulitzer -- what do you do for an encore?) has also been done before, but I've never seen it done so well (and without resorting to The Bottle as an excuse for a wasted life).What's been missed in the reviews I checked was a discussion of who found whom. When you boil it down, Jamal found Jamal and Forrester found Forrester (just in time), though they found themselves by reaching out to each other and forming a bond of friendship across a gulf of age, suspicion, and race. The way they do this, without the usual twists of self-destruction and miraculous salvation, is both touching and refreshingly real. And finding oneself, in its essence, is what EVERY good drama is about, so, yes, there is a similarity to Goodwill and Scent and every other good movie ever made.Included in the movie is a very brief first course in writing. Though the movie doesn't dwell on it, the way it presents the process of writing (and of the criticism of writing) is refreshingly realistic.Speculation about the "real" identity of Forrester is interesting. Salinger has been mentioned, but the similarities are only superficial. Harper Lee (To Kill a Mockingbird) is a much better fit (first novel wins Pulitzer, nothing else ever written, lived as a recluse), but I almost favor the enigmatic Gardner McKay (though Forrester is certainly different in many ways from McKay). However, it's just as likely that Rich had no particular person in mind when he crafted Forrester (since, after all, the First Novel Syndrome is a well known plot theme).All in all, while not The Great American Movie, it's a very good movie and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A transcendent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Gus Van Sant also directed `Good Will Hunting' and this film has essentially the same plot. An underprivileged youth is discovered by a reclusive genius and is shepherded to his full potential. What GWH was to math, this film is to literature. They are such close cousins that Van Sant felt compelled to bring in Matt Damon for a cameo.Regardless of the familiar plot, `Finding Forrester' succeeds because of an excellent screenplay and outstanding acting performances by Sean Connery, Rob Brown and F. Murray Abraham. This kind of story can't help grabbing the audience at a human level. Genius, suppressed by societal class, struggles to emerge and it beats the odds. The story is transcendent for both the main characters. Forrester (Sean Connery) helps Jamal (Rob Wallace) transcend his societal constraints to realize his potential as a writer, and Jamal helps Forrester to transcend the constraints of his emotional traumas to free him as a human being. It is a triumphant story, very uplifting.Van Sant does a good job of presenting the human element and developing the characters while keeping the photography effective but in the background. The photography is very straightforward, allowing the characters to tell the story without the intrusive use of stylish shots that are all to prevalent lately. Van Sant gives Forrester's apartment a dark and dreary look from a color and lighting perspective, which is particularly effective.Sean Connery is in top form and continues to make the case for being one of our best and most treasured actors. He gives a virtuoso performance in this film with a complex and ornery character. It is a powerful and moving portrayal. Rob Brown is phenomenal in his first feature film. He was found in a talent search and made an impressive debut with an extremely mature performance. With the right scripts, he has a good chance of having a bright future. F. Murray Abraham is fantastic as the haughty English teacher, who gets his just deserts.This is a highly intelligent film with a strong story, steady direction and marvelous acting. I rated it a 9/10. Despite an all too familiar storyline, it differentiates itself by its wide-ranging excellence. For those who enjoy good dramatic performances and intriguing character studies, this film is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie with a stunning performance from Connery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a little about this movie before and entered into watching it merely expecting to see another of Sean Connery's typical Connery performances. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that, he is a very good actor, but he always plays himself. Other than that, I had no inclination what the story was about so there was surprise from the outset seeing that the movie was starring Busta Rhymes and was set in the Bronx.How surprised I was as this gentle and perfectly paced tale brings together two people who share a common love for writing, one is a faded writer who once had success, and the other is a new talent who faces so many obstacles in his path to let his talent shine.There are similarities to other films such as Dead Poets Society, but what captures the viewer and their imagination is the restraint and the simplicity. There are no great acts or contrived emotionally charged plot twists, this is real and it's character driven. You believe in the characters, the acting is so natural and understated you are easily drawn into the movie and the characters lives, and it's hard to break free. Choices and actions are small, compassionate, and you can relate them to real life.The relationship between Forrester (Connery) and Jamal (Rob Brown) is superbly played with Brown holding back perfectly until the scene where his restraint fails, and Connery giving one of the most emotive and complex performances I have ever seen. His performance is simply stunning and totally off of the Connery mould. Watching his face as he struggles with demons long past was extraordinary.Overall the story is very well written, and doesn't fail to pull you along with the emotional journey and yet never hit the twee button. You can feel the passion that Connery has for writing, and see the complexity of emotions as he wants to help the boy but gets pulled back by hidden problems. Problems which slowly reveal themselves and get shared and dealt with in the most natural of ways, again never falling foul of an emotion overload.It's warm, uplifting and an inspiring story and I recommend it to anyone. I really can't be vocal enough about the stunning performance by Connery, and the matching performance by Brown. Even Rhymes shows that he has talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a great book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Finding Forrester' is without any doubt the best movie of the year 2000. I've heard many people say that this is just director Gus Van Sant's retread of his oscar winning hit 'Good Will Hunting'. That is the furthest statement from the truth. Eventhough the general idea of two different people bonding is here, everything else is as different as it comes.The story is about Jamal Wallace(Rob Brown, making his bigscreen debut), an allstar basketball player who's only 16 but has a passion for writing and reading. One night on a bet he breaks into the apartment of a person only known to the neighborhood kids as "The Window". But when he's caught, Wallace bolts and forgets his backpack. Later he gets his backpack back, with all his written material analyzed, corrected ect. After revisiting the man, Wallace finds out that "The Window" is none other than reclusive author William Forrester(Sean Connery), who has been hiding for 40 years. They cut a deal that as long as Jamal doesn't tell anybody about William, then William must help Jamal with his writing. Over the course of the movie a beautiful bond forms as the two different people become friends and partners. Along the way William helps Jamal deal with his biased english professor Robert Crawford(F. Murray Abraham), his new girlfriend(Anna Paquin), his brother(rapper Busta Rhymes) and everyone else in his life.The acting in this film is universally excellent, and no matter how it is billed Brown is the real star of this movie. Connery is brilliant but isn't on the screen enough to outshine Brown. Abraham comes off as the perfect nemesis and Busta Rhymes acquits himself rather well. Anna Paquin isn't too bad but she isn't given too much to do. Excellent supporting cast withstanding the best scenes in the film are the one on one interactions between Brown and Connery. I especially loved the "Soup questions" scene and the Jeopardy scene.Considering this is Van Sant's first film since the terrible 'Psycho' remake he made a few years back he does very well. And surprisingly he generates more tension and suspense in one basketball sequence late in the movie than he did in all of 'Psycho'.Overall this is not only Van Sant's best movie but also the best film all year. And after seeing this movie three weeks after the Academy Awards it makes it all the more shocking that 'Gladiator' won as I can't see how, in any way, it is better than this great film. Like a great book 'Finding Forrester' gets better every viewing and i'm sure it will stand the test of time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a nice movie. Great plot, nice character development, and moments of brilliance. To be sure the story of a prodigy and brilliant but sometimes reluctant mentor has been told before, but this story is a unique and interesting take on the subject. Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) is a writing prodigy. His journey makes for riveting stuff.Strengths of this movie? I love the depth to Jamal's character - he portrays the inner conflict the character feels without over-acting or unnecessary melodrama. The relationship with Forrester (Sean Connery) is a thing of beauty, in large part because Connery is (as usual) wonderful.Downsides? Well, not any major ones in my opinion. You can nitpick almost any movie to death, but this movie is solid.In the end, its strengths are great, its weaknesses are minimal, and the memorable touches here and there (moments of beauty between Forrester and Jamal, Busta Rhymes as Jamal's brother, and some beautiful quotes) make this a winner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some serious flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following comment was written and posted by tightspotkilo. I agreed with what he had written, and told him so. Then, inexplicably, the comment was removed because some unknown user complained about it for some unknown reason. Tightspotkilo appealed to IMDb and they encouraged him to repost it. I am reposting it in his stead. Fair commentary that is less than fawning should NOT be removed because someone disagrees with what it written. Here goes.Good performances by Sean Connery and Rob Brown, in the latter's screen debut. Good direction by Gus Van Sant too. But, alas, not a good movie. The problem is much more fundamental than whether you have a good cast or a good director. The problem is with the story. Some say the story was ripped off from Good Will Hunting, and I can see the obvious reasons behind people getting that idea. But I don't agree too much with it. If this story was ripped from anywhere it was ripped from the real life biography of Joyce Maynard, when as a young woman still in her late teens she pierced the veil of privacy and famously took up with the notoriously reclusive and fifty-something writing legend J.D. Salinger, who, among other things, mentored her in her writing. This movie mimics that sequence of events more than it does Good Will Hunting. I might even go so far as to wager that the Maynard experience in some way inspired Mike Rich when he wrote Finding Forrester (minus of course the sexual relationship that existed between between Salinger and Maynard). The William Forrester character just oozes too much of J.D. Salinger in so many of the particulars and details of his personality quirks for that to be a coincidence. But as for the story itself, when you get right down to the nub of it, neither Good Will Hunting nor Joyce Maynard's life story are truly mirrored in Finding Forrester, mainly because the sine qua non of the Finding Forrester story --what really drives it-- is the racial contrast between the protagonists, and race did not figure in those other comparative examples in any way. Clearly Mike Rich was fully invested in exploiting the racial angle for all it was worth in contriving a "feel good" story. So we end up with a final product that is very contrived, very pat, indeed very formulaic, in its single-minded quest to blatantly manipulate the emotions of the target audience. And that target audience is surely liberal whites who, caught up in the throes of their self-congratulatory feel-goodism, are utterly oblivious as to how unrealistic the story really is.Don't misunderstand me. I don't mind having my emotions manipulated, per se. In fact, the capacity to evoke emotion is the res of art, art's very essence. But, that said, I don't like --in fact resent-- a concocted effort to manipulate my emotions in a false or phony way. And that's what happens here. There are ways that this story could have been told that would've been real, that would've been faithful to the true nature of an inner city urban youth trying to find a way to express himself, and to juxtapose it alongside, and then inject it into, the life of a J.D. Salinger-type character. It could have been done with verisimilitude. In fact, I can visualize John Updike writing that story. But Mike Rich didn't write it.If you haven't already, watch Radio, also written by Mike Rich. You will discern a thematic pattern. Rich is fond of pandering to liberal whites.</fullReview>

I had a slight recollection of a recommendation from a friend some time ago. In a nutshell, we really enjoyed this film. Both main characters are charming and convincing. The story makes you think and is clever. If you liked "Good Will Hunting" you will probably like this movie too, since it has a similar flavor to it. Though the film is 4 years old, the story is timeless and worth watching. Enjoy, Jimmy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Derivative but enjoyable that is made much better by the two strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamal Wallace is a black highschool student living in the Bronx, New York. He has a talent for basketball, which is popular with his friends and a talent for writing that he tends not to talk up. His test scores bring him to the attention of an exclusive private school with offers of a scholarship, starting immediately. Meanwhile he gives in to his friend's challenges and breaks into the flat of a man known as "the window" because he never leaves his flat but just stares out at the world passing outside. When he is confronted by the man, Wallace flees but forgets his bag, but it is given back later, with all his note book scribbled on and critiqued. He goes back to the flat and tries to get the man to help him further with his writing.Has it been so many years since Good Will Hunting that Van Sant felt the need to remake it with elements changed? And if so did he feel so insecure about doing it that he delivered with such little originality and blandness so that the audience knows just what they are getting and feels comfortable (if unimpressed)? I guess the answers to both those questions is yes because Finding Forrester is very much a version of Good Will Hunting with the basics kept the same and other bits changed around. Of course this does not mean that it is a bad film because I actually quite enjoyed it; although I knew just where it was going and what it was doing from start to finish. In this way it is a bit annoying that director and writer should be so uninterested in doing anything other than trudging out such obvious material.The story, although familiar is well enough told though to make it worth seeing. What made it much better for me though were the two genuinely engaging performances in the lead. Given fairly obvious characters to work with, I felt that both Brown and Connery took it, worked it and made it more than the sum of the words in the script. Brown is impressive by how much seems to be going on behind his eyes and I was more impressed when I learnt that this was his acting debut. Connery is equally as good in a role that he could have slummed off his famous voice and natural presence; but instead he works with a vulnerability that is convincing and makes his character and the story so much more interesting. Neither of them can make this a wonderful film but they both do a lot of work to make it an enjoyable and engaging one. Support from Abraham is by-the-numbers but effective (although his final scene is unconvincing); I didn't understand why Paquin bothered (or why they bothered to have her character in the story) while Rhymes is just what you expect and only looks weak at the end when he is asked to emote.Overall this is a solid and enjoyable film despite the fact that it seems determined to do just what you expect it to do. That said the story is still interesting but what really does the business are the two great performances from Brown and Connery ? both as individuals but also together; they take the obvious material and make it somehow much more convincing and engaging. Not a great film by any stretch of the imaginative and too derivative to really stick in the mind but does enough to entertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some will call it "Good Will Forrester"; but it isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons will be made since Gus Van Sant directed both. As there are similarities, there are also differences. I found that the main characters are dealing with social issues that are more specific to the world today. In Hunting it was more specific to the characters. Forrester's main characters stakes are more obvious where I thought in Hunting there were more subtleties. Van Sant does an effective job at showing the different worlds at stake. How New York is a Tale of Two Cities. This is the kind of movie that should be shown in schools. I believe there is social benefit to be gained. We are also introduced to a new actor that Van Sant discovered. I think people will be amazed at how he naturally plays the part and opposite Connery's Forrester. I'm sure you will enjoy it; just try not to compare it too much. Though, there is an obvious reason when you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an obvious return to Good Will Hunting territory, Gus Van Sant gives us another story of a gifted young student (this time played by Rob Brown) and his aged mentor (Sean Connery).Student Jamal Wallace (Brown) meets reclusive writer William Forrester (Connery) who wrote one successful novel decades ago, but has refused to write another, and now lives in self-enforced obscurity. Forrester lives alone, dislikes people and makes witty but insightful statements about people and the world, the way reclusive writers always do in these kind of films. As luck would have it, Wallace just happens to be studying Forrester's book at school, and the old boy is able to give him some pointers. But disaster strikes when Wallace humiliates his school tutor (F. Murray Abraham) and then submits for a literary competition a piece which unintentionally plagiarises one of Forrester's works.Finding Forrester might strike you as intelligent if you've never picked up a book in your life, but think it might be nice to do so one day. In which case you're probably the target audience. It's one of those films where being able to quote random lines from Dickens or Mark Twain is meant to convey great literary ability. Characters supposedly have minutely-detailed recollection of great works of literature despite never apparently picking up a book, let alone reading one. The main advantage of Wallace's literary ability seems to be that it increases his pulling power. Maybe we should admire an attempt like this to convince us that literary knowledge is a sure way of picking up girls, but I thought the makers had something more serious in mind. This whole film, sadly, is conducted on a TV movie level, which is really no more than it deserves. The plot is mechanical and predictable and the characters aren't even vaguely convincing. Connery can be a good actor, but he's given nothing to really work with and the story and character development in Finding Forrester are strictly by the numbers. Save for a star cameo towards the end there really isn't a surprise in the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been baffled more than once by this film. Do not understand me. The film is as simple as a goldfish bowl. People, however react to it very differently. I originally watched this one at the movies with some friends. I left the theatre utterly relieved and having made peace with the fact I someday would forget my ordeal. My friends found the movie "good". That amazed me because it just doesn't work. Mr Connery can only play Mr Connery and to be honest that is fine with me. I mean, he does it really well. But not even that can make this film bearable. The scene where the distant angry young man enters Connery' apartment and randomly "opens up", speaking about abandonment and neglect without having even seen Mr Bond. Well, that is one way of reaching out. I never figured out what the romance with the high-class poor little rich girl was supposed to establish. Miss Paquin, however, who in the past managed to get wonderfully human performances out of mutes and ducks can do very little with her co-"star". In fact one wonders if her better scenes landed on the cutting room floor. One scene which did not land on the cutting room floor was the infamous "further/farther" scene. Since I saw that scene I have started using them wrongly in the hope some angry young man will correct me and i can get a cheap laugh. Even bringing in Matt Damon as a nod to Good Will Hunting could only make the situation worse. It was... sad. (Adam Sandler would have been better, well funkier at least.) I have no farther comment!</fullReview>

I can't wait for a sequel. Religious groups worship at Sean's feet, as he proclaims: "Punch the keys for God's Sake". For God's sake, see this movie.

		<shortDescription>How did they get it so wrong? (SPOILER)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For nigh on two hours, I watched an often engrossing film. The story of talented teenager meets bad-tempered genius recluse is a very old one, but one with a lot of scope nonetheless, and it's done well here. A lot comes down to the acting; Brown makes a superb debut, Abraham is as good as ever, and Connery finally does something worthwhile. Through this, the 'odd couple' storyline moves very neatly towards the obvious conclusion, indeed getting there with a lot of intelligence and imagination. Really, I was quite happy. Two hours well spent.Now comes the spoiler.I'll tell you about the ending. It's RUBBISH. Utterly DIRE. Perhaps the worst ending I have EVER, EVER SEEN. If I'd previously had any faith in Gus van Sant (no, I haven't), it would be straight out the window.Now the real spoiler: Jamal, the hugely talented teenager, writes a fantastic speech. A wonderful, mesmerising speech that will change the way everyone thinks. But, having been treated so badly by the school, he refuses to read it. Reclusive writer Forrester has to come down and read it for everyone. Wait with baited breath as he reads out this life-affirming speech - and collapse in horror as the words disappear to be replaced by 'stirring' music. No speech. NO SPEECH! Neither Mike Rich nor Gus van Sant could be bothered to even TRY to write something worth hearing. All we get is Connery gesticulating and panning across awed faces. Not one single word of this 'work of genius' is to be heard. A cop out on an incredible scale.And thus, the movie is ruined.If ten awful minutes doesn't sound like a reason to damn an otherwise fine film, imagine if we were never told what Rosebud was. Imagine if Bambi ended in the middle of winter. Imagine if Sherlock Holmes said he didn't care how many people had seen the dog with glowing teeth, it was time for tea, and he wasn't going anywhere. See? The entire film, built up to NOTHING. And two enjoyable hours become two hours utterly wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forest of folly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No surprise to find that this screenplay was penned by a morning drivetime DJ, since it's a jerk's idea of literary greatness that animates it: the sentimental notions of someone who will probably never write a novel, good or bad, but spend his days scratching out scenarios for development hell. (Perhaps he'll "novelise" one of them?) William Forrester appears modelled on J.D. Salinger, except that this hermit stays holed up in the middle of a busy neighborhood of New York City instead of a quiet, thrifty cabin in New England. Like Salinger, Forrester was a one-hit wonder: 'Avalon Landing' must have been a hit indeed to keep him in idleness for over 40 years. He has a gofer to bring him groceries and fresh socks, since he has become agoraphobic; he also has cancer, which might have got him out of the apartment, but no... it takes cheeky young black prodigy Jamal to put the old curmudgeon back on his push-bike and remind him what Life Is Really All About.Jamal is not only a literary prodigy who can trump his sour Eng Lit teacher on every quote with the reflexes of a Wilt Chamberlain. Just to show he ain't jes actin' white, man, we never see him read anything (maybe he does it all by telepathy) but we do see him struttin' his stuff on the basketball court, and deliberately letting his teammates down when he chooses to thumb his nose at The Man. Jamal's at this toney, WASP-y academy; and by another miracle of contrivance, the crabby "professor" who suspects the lad of cribbing his assignments-- rightly, in one instance-- is an old rival of Forrester the one-book genius in the cutthroat world of NYC letters. So the stage is set for a final showdown, with creativity vindicated and criticism abashed.In fact, so creaky is the narrative that this is not the end. There are several more false-alarm curtain scenes to follow. But long before the fadeout, we are drowning in treacle of the genus TV Movie of the Week, unaccountably given a feature film's budget.Sure, Forrester is allowed a couple of F-words, though the pupil remains chaste in diction. Apparently you can swear and get a '12' certificate these days: my, how we've progressed since Otto Preminger broke the Code by using the word 'virgin'. Most of Forrester's surly wisdom is cracker-barrel advice about being a writer-- forcing the stuff out of your psyche on to the page-- on the Dale Carnegie level. The boy has to promise not to ask his guru why he dried up after one book, and Mr Mike Rich honours this pledge all too faithfully, except to imply that if unhappy things happen to a born writer, it stops him working. Well, that's a Hollywood wannabe for you. All the same we catch Forrester fiddling with piles of manuscript now and again. Is this his posthumous second work of genius, like Salinger's legendary Glass family saga? The screenplay is cryptic.Otherwise, during this 'Driving Miss Daisy through the 'Hood', entertainment can be derived from Connery's rug, from his cursory recension of the gruff Irish cop in 'The Untouchables', and from one more contribution to the ever-lengthening list of scriptwriter's excuses for Connery not attempting an accent: Forrester migrated to the States from Scotland after World War Two, you see. That makes his ability to turn out an abiding American classic a few years later even more miraculous, but still... One ends by feeling that this movie is not quite as egregious a folly as van Sant's literal remake of 'Psycho', but it's close enough for a small cigar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where do the James Baldwins spring from?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Gus Van Sant took the best parts of his own Good Will Hunting and Scent Of A Woman and fashioned Finding Forrester. The title is a something of a misnomer in that Forrester and someone else kind of find each other.The title role of finding Forrester is played by Sean Connery who is a J.D. Salinger type author who has lived as a recluse in a brownstone. He wrote one novel back in the day and never wrote another. Presumably he said all there was to say in his mind.A young ghetto kid with a talent for basketball and a bigger talent for writing meet in a rather peculiar fashion that I won't go into. They form a nice relationship, supplying needs for each other. Rob Brown who was a newcomer played the kid who has gotten a basketball scholarship, from a posh prep school, but has dazzled many with his abilities as a writer.Finding Forrester has an interesting commentary on our stereotypes. Brown is in the school to bring home a basketball champion. Black ghetto kids are supposed to have talent in that direction. But creative writing? Just where do they think the James Baldwins spring from? That's no matter to frustrated professor F. Murray Abraham who teaches because he failed as a novelist. As Connery puts it people can get the mechanics of writing down, but talent can't be learned.Anyway Brown gets put through a ringer like Chris O'Donnell did in Scent Of A Woman. Can you imagine the late J.D. Salinger coming out of his hideaway in New England on such a mission as Connery undertakes. Much bigger than what Al Pacino did in Scent Of A Woman.Connery and Brown do form a nice bond and they have good chemistry for the viewer. And that's really about 80% of Finding Forrester.You'll find Finding Forrester worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's the biggest secret you ever kept? Sneaking out past curfew, smoking pot behind the garage? What if this secret wasn't yours to tell? Do you think that would make it easier or harder to keep?Jamal Wallace (played by Rob Brown) is a basketball player in the Bronx. When we enter the story, he's recently taken academic assessment tests and, in contrast to his work in class, has scored high enough to gain the attention of the school board. On top of this, it is mentioned that Jamal (Brown) is an exceptional basketball player. One night, after a successful game, he is sharing a meal with friends at a restaurant. They discuss, among other things, a neighborhood resident who is something of an urban legend, referred to simply as "the window" because he never leaves his apartment. A common tradition among the group is for one member to dare another. One of the men dares Jamal to break into "the window's" apartment and return with something from inside. Jamal enters the apartment and sees a letter opener shaped like a knife but, much to his surprise, "the window" catches him, yelling loudly and inspiring Jamal to flee. Until his mother makes him aware of the fact, he never realized that he left his backpack in the apartment. That's set aside, briefly, when he meets with an admissions officer from an expensive private school, as a result of his test scores. When his mother says they couldn't possibly afford the tuition, the school official says that if Jamal were to continue playing basketball with the same skill for his new school, that tuition will not be an issue. In the time since, Jamal's backpack was unceremoniously dropped from "the window's" apartment and the notebooks inside, all containing creative writing of Jamal's, now with editorial comments written with a red pen. Jamal approaches the apartment, this time using the front door, and asks "the window" if he would read more of his writing.I truly love this movie. Brown as Jamal Wallace is a character you cannot help but like, despite his momentary foray into delinquency. "The Window" who is later identified as a renowned author who became a recluse decades before we're introduced to him. "The Window", played by Sean Connery, is a very sympathetic character and, as he takes on the role of mentor to Brown's character, the audience is given the opportunity to see it change both of their lives for the better. Until recently, I hadn't watched this film for some time. Since watching it again, I have no idea why it took me this long. You should see this movie as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am writing this review after my watching this movie for the 5th time and dare I say, I am not the most frequent reviewer. Every time I feel a bit down or unhappy with myself, Finding Forrester cheers me up and elevates my confidence. People might remember director Gus Van Sant's earlier work in Good Will Hunting (equally good) more famously, but Finding Forrester never seizes to amaze me on every single viewing. The relationship shown between an under-privileged black kid (the film is not totally on the race card for a change) and a famous but ex-writer, who has gone in hiding from the society, is heart warming and quite engaging. The performances from Sean Connery and Rob Brown are excellent and takes this amazing tale to greater heights. I haven't seen all the Sean Connery movies, but this performance remains my favorite. All in all, if you like cinema which has some content, story-telling and emotions, this flick is highly recommended for you.</fullReview>

One hundred and thirty-six -- one hundred and thirty-six minutes devoted the theme of yet another disadvantaged youth yet again struggling to make something out of his life -- which is not only unnovel, but in this case also built on excruciating cliches. Come on -- most of us struggle towards personal and professional growth -- this story does not have any grain of uniqueness that would deserve so much tape. The story line is drawn out, the dialogue is boring and predictable, and the great cast just does not remedy the sheer poverty of the plot. What a waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reclusive writer and reluctant scholar bring out the best in each other, a fine film worth seeing more than once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sept 2013 update: Just watched it again after 5 years, holding up very well!"Finding Forrester" is an interesting title, because it could simply mean the outside world re-discovering writer William Forrester (Sean Connery) after almost a half-century of reclusive living under an assumed name. However to me it contains a deeper meaning, of Forrester finding himself, and getting on with a life he had put on hold for so many years. I rate it highly and should be a moving film experience for anyone who values family and deep personal relationships. To me it is of similar overall quality and impact as "Good Will Hunting", "Cider House Rules", and "Eve's Bayou."CAUTION -- SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW --Jamal (first-time actor Rob Brown) is a black American, NYC 16-yr-old, basketball-playing, straight "C" high school junior being raised by his single mom. After dad disappeared, Jamal secretly began writing down his thoughts in small diary books. Highly intelligent, he played basketball with his friends and kept his grades average as a way of being accepted in the 'hood. All the boys refer to "the window" over their basketball court, where they see a man periodically peering through binoculars.On a dare, Jamal one night goes into the "haunted house", and is surprised by Forrester, and in his rush to get out leaves his backpack behind. Next day, leaving the basketball court, the backpack drops near him from the top story corner window of Forrester's. Jamal gets home, opens his diaries, and finds RED MARKS, comments by Forrester, some complimentary, most not. Thus the seeds of collaboration are planted.Jamal eventually, through sheer assertiveness, works his way into Forrester's life. He cannot understand how this talented author could quit publishing after one Pulitzer-prize winning novel almost a half-century earlier. Forrester's story is complex, but includes a brother who had returned from war and dies in a car wreck on his way home after saying goodbye to Forrester. At the morgue, the attendant was so insensitive that she commented on his book, rather than recognize his grief. Thus "writing and publishing" became a cruel reminder of the public's infatuation with celebrity, and he didn't want any part of it.Forrester agrees to help Jamal learn to write well, as long as Jamal promises to never reveal their relationship nor Forrester's whereabouts. Jamal has very productive writing sessions, and through his academic achievement test scores, gets offered a scholarship to a prestigious private school, where he also gets to play basketball. His writing is so good, the Professor (Murray Abraham, also the protagonist to Mozart in "Amadeus") refuses to believe it is Jamal's work, and sets out to expose his fraud. In a gripping classroom scene, the Professor uses the word "farther" in a put-down referring to Jamal and basketball, and Jamal speaks up, "further", going on to explain that the Professor used the wrong word. Then, further embarrassing the Professor by finishing all his poetry quotes and naming the author, gets thrown out of class. In a later meeting, Professor whispers to Jamal, "Don't ever embarrass me in front of my students again", which is a perfect commentary on the Professor's priorities.As the film wraps up, Jamal has a chance to win the championship basketball game with two free throws with no time on the clock, and misses them both. Earlier in practice we see that he is an expert free-thrower. Then, in the climactic scene, Forrester comes into Jamal's classroom, and reads some wonderful writing on "family and friendship", and Professor congratulates him while the students applaud. However, Forrester tells them that he was reading something Jamal wrote just the night before, and thus exposes Professor for the fraud that he is.Near the end, Professor asks Jamal, did you miss those free throws, or did you "miss them"?? Jamal answers, "that isn't a soup question, is it?", referring to a question during their first meeting. That line alone shows the depth and subtleness of the script writing, and is largely responsible for this fine, fine film. Forrester decides to venture out more, tells Jamal he is going back to his homeland for a visit. "Ireland?", asks Jamal. Indignantly, Forrester answers, "Scotland!" Jamal smiles and says, "I'm just messing with you." Just another good piece of writing, and illustrates the "peer" relationship this old writer and this young basketball player had developed. At the end, during Jamal's senior year, a lawyer (Matt Damon) shows up, representing Forrester, Jamal is told he died, had had cancer for 3 years, handed him some keys and a box and said "he wanted you to have these right away." Inside was a completed manuscript, a new novel written by Forrester and on the title page was written, "Foreword by Jamal Wallace."I cannot say enough about how good first-time actor Rob Brown is in this film. Up against Sean Connery, one of the most powerful actors of our time, and a true screen "legend", Brown is simply perfect. There is no flaw in his performance. Unless this is a "one-role" wonder, he is destined to become one of the fine actors for the next 40 or 50 years. The DVD has a few interesting "extras", the best being the "Rob Brown" story which chronicles how he was found, and some candid behind the scenes video which shows how easily he worked with the stars and director in making "Finding Forrester". In real life he is much like the character he plays, an honor student who also plays basketball.Anna Paquin also has a small role, befriending Jamal and helping him navigate the norms at the new school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film which greatly underachieves...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly Gus Van Sant is not the same director without the sharp writing of Damon and Affleck. Finding Forrester is a film with great potential, a fine cast, and some of the worst pacing I have ever seen in a movie. The script is long, far far too long, and is made even longer by the half-hearted attempts to work Anna Paquin and Michael Pitt's pointless characters into the plot. Busta turns a surprisingly dramatic performance as Jamal's content older brother, and Connery, Abraham, and Brown all demonstrate their polished acting skills, albeit hampered at times by an unwieldly script. All in all though, this movie is definitely worth sitting through once. The themes about triumph over adversity and the struggles of inner city students, while not particularly original, are compelling. And Van Sant never disappoints in the realm of the technical with his well-thought-out and well shot film. You won't walk away with your heart exactly aching for the plight of a lonely author and his African student-friend, but it does produce a certain fuzzy feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some people compared "Finding Forrester" to "Good Will Hunting", I wish to assert that this one was far better. This one shows how Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) discovered his own strength by helping William Forrester (Sean Connery), and managed to challenge the dictatorial professor (F. Murray Abraham); both sides saw a completely new side of life. Maybe on one level, it looks sort of funny to have Jamal's rap-centric world meet William's literary world, but the movie takes a serious, well-done approach to it. "Good Will Hunting", I'm sorry to say, now seems self-indulgent.So yes, this one is better, and it affirms Gus Van Sant as one of the great directors of our era. It is one that I recommend at all costs. Also starring Anna Paquin, Busta Rhymes and Matt Damon in a small role.</fullReview>

The irony of this being the central dilemma should not escape anyone, as this movie was clearly plagiarized. The subsequent preaching about the evils of plagiarism is offensive given the source. Sean Connery was, as usual, Sean Connery and in no way an interesting character. The main character, meanwhile, was (Good Will Hunting) of course too good at everything. Then the kicker - despite plagiarizing after being warned not to, we are meant to believe it is he who is wronged. What is the message here? If you come from a tough situation and you know famous people that it's not only OK, but laudable to plagiarize as a writer? Please. It's upsetting that a movie like this can get made.</fullReview>

Main character, young Jamal Wallace isn't interesting in any way - he is presented to us as being just perfect, so perfect that it becomes unrealistic. He plays basketball perfectly, he is a role model son, incredible natural talent for writing, and, at age 16, he can quote by heart any novel ever written in English language. His mentor, William Forester (Sean Connery) has spent decades in hiding (for no realistic reason whatsoever, nor for a reason that one could ever sympathize with, or understand as serious). It is painfully obvious that the only reason why producers created his character as such was to have him "liberated" and inspired by our imperfectionless hero. As was clear from the start, Forrester appeared at the end of the movie in a pale imitation of Al Pacino's entrance in defense of his protg in "Scent of a Woman".

Jamal enjoys literature and playing basketball but has to conceal his passion for literature from his peers. The main point of the movie is when Jamal gets to know a famous writer who seemed mysterious and weird. According to Kim Woo Chong, Daewoo founder, "life changes after meeting" and this is exactly what happens in this movie. Mr. Ex-Bond is still very good at acting. One of my favorite moments is a short conversation of the main character and a snob about BMW. And I am sure you will find that verbal duel between Jamal and one ambitious professor very interesting.

		<fullReview>Facing the common adversities of a teenage male growing up within the typical urban culture, Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) mindlessly floats through academic work while keeping his writing secrets a talent. A dare from his basketball peers to enter the domain of "The Window," the ever-watching presence that constantly peers out of the window and never leaves his station, resulting in the meeting of William Forrester (Sean Connery). Serving as a mentor, Forrester uses writing to help identify Jamal's purpose in the world. When barred by a tyrant in a classroom, Professor Crawford, Jamal must separate himself from Forrester in order to gain identity as a writer. With championship basketball games, a potential girlfriend, a pompous professor, and Forrester's expectations floating around in Jamal's mind, the struggle of writing the story of Jamal Wallace rests on Jamal's pen and paper.Finding Forrester easily identifies itself as a highly intelligent film which draws on its ability to make the audience differentiate between their passions and careers. Gus Van Sant's visual storytelling makes use of the mise en scenes and dark, hermit lighting. During deep scenes, a small piano tune would lightly play in the background, resulting in a pleasant period of thought. It allows the audience to peacefully reflect on the emotional depth that the director is trying to present. Although the plot could be more original, the underlying details make the story unique when compared to films such as Good Will Hunting (also directed by Gus Van Sant). The focus on a historical figure while staying on a linear plot line strengthens the storytelling aspect of the film by keeping the spotlight on Jamal without shifting too far into Forrester's past. Sean Connery, Rob Brown, and F. Murray Abraham are absolutely wonderful in conveying their characters' stories. The hermit mentor, the lost student, and the arrogant antagonist were apparent throughout the entire film. One of the greatest strengths in the movie is the character description and development of Jamal. The depth in his character was fill-able with raw emotion, constant worry of identity, and inner conflict. Brown's ability to show Jamal's natural reactions to all of the peculiar things that Forrester says only strengthens Jamal as a character. Despite the loss of his father, Jamal doesn't allow Forrester to fill that void, but only allows the mentor exist as a friend or even an older brother. The student stays true to his family and never looks back on them. Despite its many strengths, Finding Forrester lacks originality, which keeps it from being a highly regarded movie. The themes of the film correlate with many themes presented in literary works studied in classrooms. The setting plays within the urban culture, showing the rise from mediocre living situations. This theme usually ties in with the themes of corrupt school systems, class, and race. Jamal's financial standings and race separates him from Forrester, Crawford, and the other students at his private high school. And, of course, love and love interests always seem to find their way into stories. This movie could easily be shown in a class room due to its thematic relevance with common literary works and subjects studied in school. Teachers will find it easy to implement this movie into their teaching material in order to create a suitable lesson plan. The movie hits a wide variety of classroom subjects such as English, drama, history, film/media, and writing. Because of the language used in the movie, I would have to recommend that this movie be shown to 10th grade or above. Usually movies of this length would take 2-3 class periods to finish, but the value gained at the end along with a productive lesson plan is well worth the time. With the ability to grasp students right away with its opening rap scene and immediate integration of basketball, students will comfortably adapt to the movie's message and take into account the director's purpose. Interest always sparks the learning process and warms up the classroom for discussion. Simple discussion and short answer questions could be used: What does Forrester's living space say about his personality and past? How does Jamal refrain from conforming to the typical urban character? This movie presents many questions that can stir student stimuli. Overall, this movie does a great job at conveying a simple, yet captivating story. I highly recommend it to students, teachers, basketball fans, hermits, and anybody who enjoys the fine work of Sean Connery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps appropriately for a film in which allegations of plagiarism play an important role in the plot, "Finding Forrester" is a good example of Hollywood's propensity for self-cannibalisation. (The film's star, Sean Connery, had a few years earlier starred in "Just Cause", another film cobbled together from themes and motifs taken from others). The film's theme of a reclusive but kindly older man assisting a teenage boy with his academic studies seems to have been borrowed from Mel Gibson's "The Man without a Face". The reclusive writer William Forrester bears similarities to the character played by James Earl Jones in "Field of Dreams". (Both characters seem to have been inspired by J. D. Salinger, although while Salinger was a native-born New Yorker, Forrester is originally from Scotland- a detail presumably inserted to suit Connery, who has never had much of a gift for accents). And the character of Jamal, another academically gifted but troubled young man from a working-class background, recalls Gus Van Sant's own "Good Will Hunting". Jamal Wallace is a black New York teenager whose academic brilliance and talent for basketball win him a scholarship to a prestigious private high school. His relationship with Forrester, who lives in a flat in his neighbourhood, is initially a difficult one- the two first meet when Jamal acts on a dare from a schoolfriend to sneak into the apartment- but eventually the two become friends. Forrester, who has published nothing since his one and only much-praised novel came out in the fifties, is impressed by the young man's talent for writing and agrees to tutor him in this respect. Plagiarism may be frowned upon in academic life, but not so in Hollywood. Indeed, it is often positively encouraged in the film industry, and the results are not always bad. "Sommersby", for example, is a good film, in my view at least as good as "The Return of Martin Guerre" from which its plot was blatantly lifted. Similarly, "Finding Forrester" is, if not as good a film as "Sommersby", at least an interesting one, and its interest is not diminished by the fact that it contains elements borrowed from other films, because it succeeds in giving those elements a new twist. Van Sant and his scriptwriter use them to comment on race relations in American society, a theme not present in any of the films mentioned above. The film's main antagonist is Jamal's literature teacher, Professor Crawford. (It would appear that in America the title "professor" can be applied to schoolteachers; in Britain it is reserved for the most distinguished university lecturers). Crawford, himself an unsuccessful writer embittered by the failure of his literary ambitions, is a covert racist who refuses to admit that a black student, especially a black student from a poor background, could have any talent for academic work. To his way of thinking, Jamal's natural sphere is the basketball court, not the classroom, and he takes any opportunity to belittle Jamal's written work. This highlights a problem prevalent in Britain as well as America, the tendency on the part of some white teachers and others in authority to assume that the talents of people from ethnic minorities can only lie in certain directions, generally sport and music, and to overlook the other gifts that they might possess. The film, in fact, can be seen as the story of how Forrester helps Jamal to define his own identity, free from the preconceptions of Crawford and of white society in general. Towards the end of the film Jamal misses two free throw shots in a vital basketball game, and the possibility is raised that he may have done so deliberately in order to confound the perception that black men are good at sport and not much else. There is a fine performance from Connery as Forrester, testy and obstinate but basically a kindly, decent man. This was to be Connery's penultimate film before retirement; his last was to be "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" from three years later. From an actor nearing the end of his career to one at the very beginning. This was Rob Brown's first-ever film, and he initially only auditioned for a part as an extra. He ended up, however, being cast in the leading role, despite having no previous acting experience, even as an amateur. It was a brave move on Van Sant's part to cast an unknown 16-year-old, but it is one that pays off; Brown is able to bring to his part the sort of freshness and immediacy that are often missing from those films (too many to mention) where teenage schoolchildren are played by established actors in their late twenties. (Or in some cases thirties). There is also a good performance by F. Murray Abraham as Crawford. The film is partly about challenging preconceptions, and it also overturned one of my own, namely that Van Sant is one of the most overrated directors currently working in the industry, although it must be admitted that this preconception was based upon some strong evidence. I found "Good Will Hunting", for example, long-winded and boring, despite a good acting contribution from Robin Williams, "My Own Private Idaho" and "The Secret Language of Cranes" were confusing and self- consciously artsy, and that awful version of Hitchcock's "Psycho" can serve as an object lesson in how not to remake a classic movie. When I saw "Finding Forrester" on television recently, however, I was glad that I resisted my initial impulse to switch channels as soon as I saw the director's name in the opening credits, because this was the first Van Sant film I actually enjoyed. It combines a provocative look at racial issues with a touching coming-of-age drama about the friendship between a young man and an old one. A very watchable film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's okay, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot when I was a kid. I think I even remember saying to myself that it was one of my favorite inspirational movies. Looking back, it was okay. I'll keep it as brief as I can: 1. The biggest problem with this movie (in my humble opinion) is the script. The writing of this movie was heavy-handed and extremely awkward. -The dialogue was okay. It wasn't horrible, but there were moments that took me out of the movie and made me think about how strange the lines were. In particular, the beginning exposition with Jamal and friends sitting in school, talking about Forrester, was strange. I kept thinking, "wait, people don't say stuff like this." It felt like a weird old guy trying to write urban dialogue while simultaneously characterizing "the window". I guess ultimately, I'd just say that there was a strange disconnect. -Many elements of the movie were hackneyed and sloppy. The love story element was extremely weird to me. I thought that entire relationship between Jamal and Anna Paquin was rushed and not believable. The racism elements/the "changing social circle" elements were strange as well. But I don't even think this movie was about race or class really. They just kind of threw in those elements sloppily, like afterthoughts. Basically, they have Jamal say "it's because I'm black, isn't it?". That's the extent of racism's role in this movie. To the film's credit, at least it didn't hit you over the head with these minor parts. It doesn't sink to the level of a Step Up movie, despite having a very similar idea to those pieces of crap. -The character arcs were weird too. I can't really put into words how Forrester changed. I have a hard time pinning down exactly what Jamal did for William that cured his fear of the world. It almost feels like Forrester went to defend Jamal just on a whim. Similarly, I can't really pin down Jamal's arc. What happened to him? He got better at writing? And...? Then what? I suppose you could force out some idea about beating the system, but I don't think that was emphasized enough. 2. Look, no one wants to criticize Gus Van Sant. I get it. I didn't think the directing was that bad. He definitely gets points for squeezing out decent performances. This wasn't exactly a complex movie with complicated imagery or anything. One thing sticks out though. When Professor Crawford and co. confront Jamal about plagiarism, I couldn't even tell that there was more than one professor in the room. It was just a scene where I couldn't really tell what was going on. Just a note. 3. The acting was alright. -Plenty of awkward lines. Plenty of awkward delivery. The head honcho professor was terrible. That scene where he talks to Jamal in Madison Square Garden was noticeably bad. -Main actors were okay. I liked Jamal. And Sean Connery. They were fine. -Why was Busta Rhymes in this movie? He wasn't bad or anything, but I found his part kind of negligible and his appearance distracting. Was it a strange attempt to lend this movie some kind of street cred or urban appeal? His character didn't even do much. The script could have found another way for Forrester to change his mind about helping Jamal. Or they could have had someone else let Jamal and Forrester into Yankee Stadium. I don't know. I'm just confused. 4. The jazz music was okay. It was quaint. At least they didn't blast some rap track in this movie to make it seem racial. 5. In conclusion- Don't have a guy who writes sports movies write something that's purportedly deeper. The script was the biggest weak spot of this movie. I kind of think that the writer wanted to do another Radio, but failed because there was a little too much going on in this movie. Which was good because it wasn't a horrible, over-sentimentalized touchy feely turd, but it WAS a bit of a clusterfuck. Everything else was decent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Forrester, review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about a young writer, Jamal who is talented as basket ball player and gifted in his high school academic work. The film tells a story how he struggles to find his voice as a writer. Although basket ball forms part of his life, it doesn't contribute much to the overall message of the film, other than it helped him get a scholarship to one of the prestigious high school in the city. Jamal who happens to be a very gifted student, because from his previous school results he maintained an average C, and the fact that he managed to do as well as he did with limited resource and poor background shows he had a potential to be someone one day given the right education, mentorship and education. He was lucky enough to find a good mentor, a writer who won the Pulitzer award/prize. During their friendship Jamal's school grades improved significantly in such a way that his English teacher questioned the sudden improvement. But the improvement was as a result of having a really good mentor who critic his work and taught him how to write including finding his own voice as a writer, but because he made a pact with his mentor to never disclose details about their friendship/mentorship relationship he couldn't tell his teacher that he had a mentor. Things escalated when the teacher asked Jamal to write an essay on his presence at school but Jamal handed an the essay he wrote with William Forrester using, William published another essay with the similar title. This is a really inspiring film, I recommend it to all writers who just started out writing and struggling on how to get started, and all people going through a mentorship relationship.Viwe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpretentious, well done film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An above average film about a gifted young man from the Bronx who draws inspiration from a reclusive author.There are several elements which could have been overdone in this film: prejudice, class differences, breaking out from poverty, isolation. But the film is really about the friendship which develops between Jamal and Forrester, and how it changes both of their lives. Had the film tried to develop everything else, it would have lost this principal focus, and much of its impact.Sean Connery does a masterful job, as always, and Rob Brown as Jamal is a natural. Anna Paquin is charming, as is the chemistry between her character and Jamal.A bit less sentimental than "Good Will Hunting," if you liked that film, you will like this one. If you don't like films that don't have a lot of action, avoid this film. I have always said that character development makes or breaks a film, and this film develops its characters superbly.The music, though different than you might expect from a typical Hollywood production, is excellent and fits the movie well. Smoky jazz/blues, moody in some places, playful in others. I especially liked the jazz guitar rendition of "Somewhere, Over the Rainbow." A final note: The camera work is VERY tight, and my wife and I both felt that a lot of the scenes were being cut off by the "pan and scan." We found this distracting, so we feel that this movie is probably best viewed "widescreen."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching it, the only actual reason was that it had Sean Connery in it. But after maybe 10 minutes, I really started appreciating the movie for what it was, a great movie about a young black boy from the Bronx who has got a real talent for writing, and a retired writer, who's afraid of the world because of the death of his brother and parents, for which he partly blames himself.The movie may start off a bit slow, but when the conversations between Jamal and William get underway, about writing and school, the movie just took me away to another reality.Rob Brown really impressed me as an actor, though from time to time he looks a little uncaring. But Sean Connery completely makes up for that little loss. He proves once again that he is a great actor.He is so convincing that I really nearly cried at the time in Madison Guarden when he loses Jamal in the crowd and just gets to a corner to cry. It really touched me.The movie has really one major location where everything takes place, and that's William's apartment, everything that makes the movie turn happens here. The relationship between Jamal and William really grows up until the point that Jamal forgets about his friend from the Bronx and nearly spends all his time with William, learning about how to write.On school he gets involved with Clair. A relationship that we, thank god, never see to the kissing end, but which is build up perfectly. Claire is the rich girl with a father in the school board he absolutely is not happy that his daughter is spending time with a poor black boy from the Bronx. Paquin may not be the greatest actress, and it showed in this movie, but she still was convincing enough to show the slow build up of the relation and the blossoming of the love between the two. A simple concept, but very good worked out.And then of course there is the point that the movie needs a happy ending and thus something that nearly spoils everything. In this case it's Prof. Crawford, who is Jamal's writing teacher. He doesn't think that a black boy from the Bronx can be writing at a level he can't even reach, and when Jamal embarrasses him in front of his class by answering every question right, he tries, and gets, his revenge. He nearly gets Jamal suspended until, of course, William interferes.It's all maybe a bit predictable, but well, a movie in which everyone loses everything isn't fun to watch. And like in a great book we all know, Lord of the Rings, William can't stay and they lived happily ever after, he leaves for his homeland Schotland and dies there of cancer, of which he never told Jamal. A not so happy, but great, and I nearly cried here as well, ending to a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT movie concept spoiled by laughable acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie in my English class (why? I still have no idea, I guess it pertains to literature), and I have to say that at first, I was remarkably interested. I usually sleep through in class movies, but this one I decided to stay awake. And this movie was VERY good, until the first time Sean Connery opened his mouth. Every line he delivers sounds absolutely ridiculous...he speaks in the same "dialect" and plays the same character he has done in every....other....movie....he....has....ever....BEEN IN!! So if you can put up with Sean Connery's abysmal acting, this is a great rental. But some will be reduced to tears with laughter by his lacking performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The old needs the new, or should we say "the young"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Forrester is a saviour here. Jamal Wallace yet is even a greater savior. Only that the "objects" they save are different. The old saves the young's art and the young saves the old's life. Racial conscious people may also say a black savior to a white stray.The friendship is precious between these two guys. At times, I cannot bear the saying of jumpy westerners when seeing this sort of ancient Greek teacher-student relationship or mentorship, they would jump into conclusion abruptly by saying that there is gay insinuation. That's why more and more white men don't have close friends, buddies, cronies or whatever...Forrester is a blessed one. Ask most of the writers, they will tell you definitely that they want to have a life like his. (Perhaps a little modification is needed, anyhow.) Rocketed to literary stardom by just one book, he swiftly started a reclusive life. This for sure imprints hundreds of question marks in people's mind (think about the paparazzi) and the cameras are always ready to flash in front of him if he appears just once even only at a slum. It's good marketing, it's a wondrous way to keep people remember a once public figure. And the most important is, he's never short of funds, well, maybe he needs to practise frugality, anyway money is not a concern to him.Forrester is a deprived one. He was deprived of courage, he fears the new. When an artist is at his wits' end, what he needs is something new, new things. Unfortunately he was intimidated, paralysed by the new, he couldn't move on and so he remains in his time capsule trying to save the time in a his own bottle. And God sent the fledgling Jamal to rescue him.Life is full of labyrinths and we need courage to make us move on. Age can absolutely be kicked aside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witness to the Prostitution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Gus Van Sant showed remarkable talent with "Drugstore Cowboy" and then topped it with a genuine masterpiece in "My Own Private Idaho". Then things began to go wrong. There was "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" which was a total miss and though "To Die For" fared slightly better, it was clear that Van Sant had lost his hold.It would have been unimaginable for anyone, like myself, who really appreciated this new voice in American cinema to foresee what was about to transpire. Van Sant went mainstream. He's not the first independent director to take that route. Soderbergh crossed over without much loss to his indie eye. Van Sant made the hugely successful, horribly overrated and totally spurious "Good Will Hunting".There's a scene in "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" in which Van Sant plays himself, ignoring the movie he is supposed to be directing while he counts the money he's making. It's not funny. No doubt money played a big part in his total sellout to Hollywood, though there may have been other factors. No matter, it's infuriating to witness the prostitution of a film maker of his caliber.Both "Good Will Hunting" and "Finding Forrester" are movies designed to make audiences feel good and to this end Van Sant uses every manipulative trick in the book. Nothing stands in his way. Lack of credibility in both the stories and the characters don't bother him at all. He wants success ? to hell with artistic integrity, and for what it may be worth he seems to have achieved his goal. It's hard not to sense the cynicism of this process."Finding Forrester" is an unashamedly cliched ridden, truly offensive film. It fits cozily into the made for tv, film of the week slot.First time actor Rob Brown is astonishingly good. It's a miraculous turn and a pity it had to be in such an undistinguished work. Connery is highly irritating in one his most mannered performances ever, though he's topped by F. Murray Abraham who outdoes himself in what could be used as a lesson in bad acting.Whether Van Sant will ever be able to regain his artistic powers remain to be seen. At this point he's a major disappointment to which this ludicrous mediocrity "Finding Forrester" will forever remain testament.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding ourselves in Forrester (and Wallace)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a person who enjoys watching movies as well as reading and writing. I loved this movie and I wouldn't mind watching it again. It's the type of movie that you probably wouldn't get bored of. Some people say that it is plain and boring, but I think it has enough unexpectedness as to keep the audience interested. It bears a resemblance to Gus van Sant's previous movie Good Will Hunting, although Finding Forrester is more towards literature whereas Good Will Hunting is mainly about Mathematics. The similarities of the two movies do not take away from the fact that Finding Forrester is a deep movie with an incredible plot. The movie is very thought-provoking and it's not sappy nor depressing. At the same time, it isn't a feel good movie either.A reclusive author whose only book won a Pulitzer Prize becomes the mentor of an underprivileged yet extremely talented sixteen year-old, starring Sean Connery and Rob Brown. Jamal Wallace is a star basketball player and unbeknownst to his friends, has a talent for writing. The need to fit in with his friends is derived from playing ball. A prep school offers Jamal a scholarship due to his high test scores and their need to win the basketball championship.Although it is shown that Forrester is Jamal's mentor, Forrester learns things from Jamal as well, such as not being afraid of leaving his house and also that friendship is more than just being there.The acting is wonderful, especially from Sean Connery, playing the title character, and from Rob Brown, as Jamal. Even the minor characters in the film, such as Jamal's older brother, played by Busta Rhyme and Jamal's friends. Anna Paquin is great for her role as Claire, a rich girl from the prep school that Jamal transfers to. The only disappointment was the character played by F. Murray Abraham. Although he acted well, there was a complete lack of character development, and the teacher-that-gives-the-brilliant-student-a-hard-time stereotype is hard to ignore. Despite this one shortcoming, this is one of the best movies and is high up there on the recommendation list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finding Forrester (2000): Dir: Gus Van Sant / Cast: Rob Brown, Sean Connery, F. Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin, Busta Rhymes: After falling from grace upon the release of his pathetic so-called shot by shot remake of Psycho, Gus Van Sant decides to return to what worked before but instead of making a decent movie he xeroxes his previous success. Here is a drama about rediscovery with Rob Brown as a student sent to a private school. He and his friends play basketball and chatter about the window above them. He is dared to enter and steal something but he accidentally leaves his backpack. When it falls from the window the following day he discovers his essays corrected. Van Sant is basically duplicating Good Will Hunting with Brown as Matt Damon and Sean Connery as Robin Williams. F. Murray Abraham fills in for Stellan Skarsgard, and Anna Paquin as a student is just the perfect copy for Minnie Driver. Perhaps Van Sant had so much confidence after the acclaim of Good Will Hunting that he failed to realize what a mistake a remake of Psycho would be. His work here is sufficient but it just seems like he is trying to catch lightning is a bottle twice and not succeeding. Even had this film came out first, it would still be inferior because the other film is better crafted. My best advice would be to find Good Will Hunting and leave Forrester in the lost and hopefully never found bin. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Gus Van Stant and written by Mike Rich, ?Finding Forrester" is an uplifting story about an eloquent literary prodigy (Rob Brown) taken under the wing of a Pulitzer Prize-winning author (Sean Connery) Despite their differences, the two unexpectedly strike up a true friendship. Jamal Wallace is a black sixteen year old from the Bronx with an untapped gift and an underprivileged background. William Forrester is a bitter and reclusive writer who escaped the public eye decades ago. Throughout the story, they form a symbiotic bond: Forrester helps the boy with his literary skills as well as big decisions he faces, and Jamal helps Forrester to realize that the world may not be as ugly as it seems. The way the film presents the process of writing is refreshingly realistic. Even writing a novel seems like a piece of cake afterward. The trouble is, the entirety of it is subdued. Stretched at over two hours, it lacks real dramatic tension, while the ending is quite predictable. Overall, the experience of watching is not as amusing and thought-provoking as it might appear.In conclusion, the story is amiable and intelligent. I found myself enjoying the growth of Jamal's and William's friendship, especially the ?soup questions". It was simultaneously a growth of both individuals, they completed each other in a peculiar way. I spent a couple of pleasant hours and would recommend anyone who likes books as much as I do to do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film about writing, Finding Forrester centers around a young black writing and basketball prodigy from the Bronx who meets a reclusive classic writer by chance. Jamal is a high school student at a pivotal time in his life, and William is a Pulitzer Prize winning novelist reaching the end of his life. The two spend time writing together in William's apartment and they develop a friendship. While William takes on the role of mentor and Jamal the apprentice, they each help the other to see the world in a new light and to overcome personal and social obstacles. Finding Forrester is a film that is about social, economic, and racial divides. It's about institutionalized prejudice and exploitation, and the power of the written word, and friendship, as tools to combat those forces. This is an example of a relatively straight forward drama that is surprisingly nuanced, and it features great performances by Sean Connery, Rob Brown, and F. Murray Abraham.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superficial Treatment of the Literary, Creative Process</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely do I harbor any ambivalence or confusion regarding my 1-10 rating of a certain movie. That said, I found (and still find) it difficult to conclude Finding Forrester's rating: I find myself vacillating between a 7 or an 8.This is a decent movie about unlikely relationships and a fair one about writing. I would certainly like to find more movies with writing as a central theme.In the acting department, Sean Connery is as brilliant as ever. Ironically, the loss of a family member (his brother) had a negative effect on his literary production and the loss of Jamal's father had a positive effect on his. Unfortunately, these dynamics and major events that inspired them are never fully treated in the movie. Finding Forrester would have been much better had the inner lives (emotions, compulsions, responses, etc.) been examined and illustrated. Instead, we never get to fully meet Jamal or William, as they seem frozen by their own, respective fears, hindered only by a superficial movie script (and perhaps a time constraint imposed on the movie.) Speaking of time, I would certainly think that in 136 minutes, a little bit of examination could have been devoted to what initially caused these two men to be attracted to writing.Another problem that I have with Finding Forrester is that not only are the formulative pasts of Jamal and William, respectively, not given their due exposure, but the present is ignored, in respect to writing, as well: I was left wondering, "What is Jamal's style?" "What does he write? How does he write.., and why?"I wondered the same thing about William's writing: What inspires him? What was the fuel for his past literary produce, and now, for his anger and avoidance? The most disappointing part of the movie was when we learned that Jamal had plagiarized. This was totally out-of-character for him, because he was good and he knew it. He also knew that the title of his Final essay was not his.., but he turned it in, anyway. The title, no less! It would be the first thing a vigilant professor would scrutinize.I almost gave the movie a 7 solely because of this hole in the script. From that point on, I had no empathy for Jamal. A better plot would have been if Jamal had authentically written a sentence or question in his essay that had been written one hundred years ago by another, famous author. Jamal could have then been given the opportunity to prove the genesis of his statement. So, here we have a teen who writes for "who-knows-why", and a senior who does not write, anymore, for "who-knows-why". Never-the-less, I recognize that writing from the soul stirs up some intense emotions, some of which can be partially-hidden and some conflicting: The catharsis that is creative writing can elicit some turbulent content from the sub-conscious.William obviously cares deeply about the integrity and sanctity of his writing. It is possible that Jamal learned his lesson about plagiarizing, but from his reaction to the professor's suggestion that he write and read a personal apology to his fellow classmates, it seems as though he has not. The movie has some good dialogue and some tense moments. The inter-racial, impromptu, one-way relationship was unexplained. Why was Claire fawning over Jamal right from the beginning? Jamal seemed to wonder.The integrity Jamal was unable to express with his writing, he expressed with his basketball play (two intentionally-missed free throws). Perhaps some of that honesty will show up in his writing at some later date. We'll never know: We never got to see any of it.With some depth, and maybe more length, Finding Forrester could have been great.</fullReview>

It was easily one of the more mentally intense movies that I've ever watched. I do hope that Sean enjoyed doing this movie as much as I have enjoyed watching it.

I Think a movie about writing and writers should have to come up with some more interesting quotes. Especially when right at the climax forresters reading of jamals letter is just faded out and replaced some music while we get to see the audience staring in admiration at the beauty these words. Thanks a lot we did not get to hear what great monologue this was. To me it seems as if the script writers just could not think of something that at least sounded worth calling literate.Characters are also quite pale, never developing any life, especially for the supporting actors. The story all in all just has the level of mothers-like-to-watch-while-ironing movie, nothing really interesting.Sorry, just 5 of 10</fullReview>

It unfolds subtlely and smoothly but is ever penetrating to the heart. It captivates you by the sides and finally occupies all but the hardiest niche of emotions. Sean just does it so well and the young negro boy greatly helps in the process.

An Academy Award for Best Actor. Any one who's seen 'Amadeus' will see F Murray Abraham in what would be the performance of any actor's life. Unfortunately, the difference isn't Abraham at all, it's the role. The Crawford character is hilarious to watch... he's like Eric from Billy Madison or Shooter McGavin from Happy Gilmore or a similar character from any other silly comedy. He's a 100% villain from his first scene to his last, with the obvious fate of huge and repeated public humiliation. Since Connery has a beef with him too, we get to see both protagonists take a homerun swing through Crawford's dignity. The scene toward the end is classic when Crawford performs the huge Hollywood retread of desperately and futilely trying to quiet the crowd cheering for Jamal, the crowd of course includes Crawford's superiors who in turn belittle the meek authority that Crawford's bitter and empty soul clings to. I was seriously waiting for a warm Connery/Jamal hug to be interrupted by shrieks from the audience as Crawford menacingly approached with a gun, only to have Connery, now cool and now confident in his return to society, perform a few quick Judo moves, disarming Crawford and sending him to the ground in a pile of his own waste.This is basically an interesting movie ruined by painfully predictable characters and scenes. When you watch it, see if you can guess everything that will happen, you'll probably be right.</fullReview>

Didn't Van Zant already direct this movie in 1997? It was titled "Good Will Hunting," wasn't it? The difference between the two movies is that "Good Will Hunting" was first, and as such, more original with better characters and not so much pandering to the audience. By pandering, I mean the worst line Sean Connery has ever uttered, "You're the man now, dogg!" BAH! Forget it and rent "Good Will Hunting". I give this one 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding the Black Good Will Hunting !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant continues to preach the young generation to be independent and hard working. Do what you can do and do it right. But this movie is somehow the repetition of the Oscar-winning formula of Good Will Hunting with the following major differences: 1. Jamal Wallace - the protagonist - is black but Will Hunting was blond. It seems that black people can be as smart as white guys. 2. Although Jamal is hard headed and has a unique point of view, he cares more about his life than Will Hunting. Will Hunting was a real devil-may-care and self-destructive, but Jamal seems worried about his future. Also Jamal is generally more sociable than Will Hunting. Jamal doesn't have the weird background of Will Hunting. 3. Sean Connery - the one who supports Jamal - is a celebrity in a way, he is not sociable at all , and still he is not so complicated at least in the protocol of such movies. But Robin Williams - the supporter of Will Hunting - was not a celebrity , he also had problems in his life but he had remained quite sociable. He seemed to have a character far more complicated than the Sean Connery's. That's why they gave him an Oscar for supporting role. ;)The movie has a slow progress. So it is not recommended for all tastes. But if you're looking to see a suggested way of life in a movie, this one is a good choice. In Good Will Hunting and also this movie, Gus Van Sant shows his magical ability to direct a movie based on a script which has naturally made for preaching and advising. Such a screenplay if directed by an inexperienced director could be much more boring. But Gus has given it the necessary energy.Sean Connery is always Sean Connery. Whether he plays William Forrester , James Bond or even Indiana Jones' father, it seems that he always repeats himself. It can be considered as a disadvantage for an actor to always play himself with a little difference from one movie to another, but let's take Sean as an exception to this rule. He somehow drowns himself in himself and make the role so believable which make you forget that he is representing himself again and again.But the other characters and especially F.Murray Abraham - a caricature-like villain professor - are not so amusing and fall into the cliche.If the movie doesn't attract you so much while you're watching it , don't give up and try to follow it, because there is a surprising cameo performance in the end of the movie !!Thanks to my best friend who reminded me to watch this movie on TV :))7 of 10</fullReview>

Weird huh? Let me tell you what I think. I found the similarity by the names. Sean Connery's characters name is WILLIAM Forrester. Rob Brown's characters name is Jamal WALLACE. In the movie Braveheart, Mel Gibson's characters name is WILLIAM WALLACE. Either the writer of this movie did this on purpose because he really like Braveheart, or it is a big coincidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable and compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why a lot of people make all the comparisons with Good Will Hunting. The same director, a similar storyline. It's a natural comparison. What I don't understand is why the vast majority of the reviewers here who've seen both films seem to constantly dog this movie as though it were some substandard melodrama with a second rate cast. I suppose a lot of it has to do with the fact that most people saw Good Will Hunting first so anything similar won't seem as original and therefore won't get as fair a shake from their perspective.And maybe that's why I ended up liking Finding Forrester more than Good Will Hunting since I saw the former first. Even after viewing both films several times I simply find Forrester (bad pun) to be a film with a more genuine feeling to it. In Good Will Hunting, it seemed to me that I was watching actors trying to show off how well that could act. They were SO precise with their dialog and performance that it simply didn't feel as real. It was good for sure. It was just so professionally artificial that I personally never felt that close to the characters.In Finding Forrester, the very fact that we have a brand new actor seems to make this particular storyline more realistic. Yes, Rob Brown is not as smooth or polished as Matt Damon or Ben Affleck. That's what makes him all the more compelling in this role. He's real. Real people don't always speak with wordsmith precision and glide effortlessly through conversations hitting all the right spots for dramatic emphasis. Real people often speak in a subdued, monotone voice unsure of where their dialog may be headed; young African-American males in particular don't exactly open up by having all their emotions outwardly visible. You keep things calm. You try to play it cool. The fact that Rob Brown comes across in this undramatic manner makes the character of Jamal someone I can identify with. It gives the picture an almost documentary-like sense of realism.Connery is perfect for his role and he plays it to near perfection. With his grizzled looks and dour persona, he's the epitome of what most of us envision as the neighborhood recluse.If you haven't seen either of these films yet, give Finding Forrester a shot first. You'll be one of the few people to see the film without feeling the need for comparison.</fullReview>

It's just one of the best movies ever.

		<fullReview>Movies like "Finding Forrester" are rare. You know, the big-budget ones that make you think, and are actually very good!Rob Brown as Jamal Wallace performs well, if somewhat stilted as an intelligent black teenager whose gifts land him in a private school. Sean Connery is the reclusive author William Forrester, and well, the Academy played ostrich again, burying their heads in the sand for his performance. Never has Mr. Connery been so real. Jamal and Forrester form a progressive, at times shaky, friendship. In the end they've helped each other. This all may sound boring, but it never does get that way.Another thing that's pleasant about this movie, is that it doesn't succumb to stupid stereotypes. Unlike the teens in "Save the Last Dance," they're not prone to plan a drive-by. Jamal's friends are street, but not "thug" or "gangsta." I'm really glad Gus Van Sant avoided that nonsense. If you ever wanted to see an excellent, unforgettable movie about life's possibilities, then I strongly recommend you watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unfortunate to have to point out that this movie is quite awful.Unfortunate in the sense that the makers obviously love writing, love really good writing, and ended up writing a really bad movie.One can really appreciate the first, the motive behind the film, but if you're going to take on a task that large, you'd better be up to it. Because there's a long way to fall--it's kind of similar to that quote, "If you shoot at a King, you better kill him." If you shoot for a movie about genius, you better at least have a glimmer of it in yourself.The central problem here is not that the plot is wildly improbable--though it is--it's that the central character, an inner city ghetto youth who has a passion for the English language, doesn't work. And the actor, Rob Brown, can't bring it off, though it's hard to fault him since the idea of an urban kid who's into Coleridge, Twain, Shaw, and can quote them at will AND who is a basketball whiz AND manages to stumble upon a reclusive pulitzer prize winning author AND who manages to convince said writer to mentor him is a wee bit too much. What's worst though, is that Brown never manages to convince that he actually knows what he's talking about--it's like he's speaking a different language and just mouthing the words. It's not his fault though, a character like this really needs a massive talent to bring off--and Brown is just rather a basic actor. And for that matter, the writers haven't given him the tools to bring it off--they just can't manage to run the gantlet between urban hipster and wordwise wunderkind in training.The movie is still worth seeing if only for two incredibly impressive actors: Connery and Abraham. It's unfortunate that the two didn't have more scenes together--in the final scene (possible spoiler), when Connery marches into the class room, Abraham's change from imperious professorial tyranny to unctuous toady is classic.Is there anything this guy is actually bad in? I mean everyone has off days, but I've never seen him put in a poor performance. Connery, as usual, plays a larger than life figure--the only kind he really can play, being larger than life himself. In fact it's interesting to consider this role in conjunction with one of his roles in the sixties "A Fine Madness" where he plays a teetering on the edge writer/poet who could, sorta, be an early version of this Forrester character (kind of a stretch, but still an interesting juxtaposition). For all its weaknesses, any movie about writing--and they are few and far between, probably because writing is so boring to do and even worse to watch--has to be applauded. It's just so disappointing the makers of the flick didn't bother to DO any serious writing. They had the talent, the money (which may be more of a hindrance than an asset), and the respect. No where is there any foolish appreciation for phony second rate hacks like Maya Angelou or Bret Easton Ellis, they take great writers for who they are. I'd recommend to anyone who hasn't caught the movie to give it a try, but realize it's weaknesses, and enjoy its virtues.There's enough of the latter to get you through a couple hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did enjoy this movie. I'm all about characters and having the movie take you inside their life. The outside is less important to me. And two really well done characters, Jamal and Forrester, did just that. They drew you into their lives. The thing that frustrated me was the inconsistencies and plot gaps that made the final product seem rushed. For instance, after state finals, Jamal goes his own way from the team, writes his letter etc. His parents and bro show up, see a letter and Busta takes the letter to Forrester. What was the sequence here??? You find a informal letter (no address) and immediately deliver it? Then the whole overdramatized scene where Forrester shows up and reads his letter. And there were even a few parts where maybe my DVD was skipping over parts...cause the sequence just confused me. These scenes weren't the meat of the film but gave the film a second-rate feel. Again seemed as if a lot of time and thought was spent doing the scenes that were the real heart of the film but when it came time to connect the dots either the budget ran short or someone said let's just wrap it up without really doing it right. It's too bad cause with the superb characters it could've been superb rather it was drug down. 9 drug down to a 6 1/2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finding Forrester is probably one of the coolest action movies I've ever seen. Jamal Wallace and Sean Connery are awesome as the very surprising on-screen duo. They both give really cool performances and they made they're character look a lot better. Jamal Wallace is looking for a writer who can help him. Sean Connery plays Forrester, a hidden author of a book that can possibly help out Jamal Wallace. The movie is very cool and I've enjoyed it and immediately bought this.Overall the movie is probably one of the greatest dramas I have ever seen and the performances were excellent. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly outstanding followup to the critically acclaimed Good Will Hunting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rented Finding Forrester on DVD and popped it in the machine, I expected to see nothing more than a feel-good movie. I had seen Good Will Hunting, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I didn't think much of Forrester's premise, which is as follows: a teenage African-American kid living in a bad neighborhood discovers that a Pulitzer Prize-winning author lives across the street, secluded from the rest of the world. But I think a movie can be good in two different ways: first, if it has a good screenplay and good direction, but also if it has excellent character development, which Finding Forrester DID have. Never since Scent of a Woman (which Gus Van Sant has been accused of plagiarizing in both of his films) has an on-screen duo been developed so well. And the supporting cast is great, also. The only character in the movie that seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever was Anna Paquin's, who played a "two-comma" girl at the private school Jamal attends. No true relationship is built up between her and Jamal, and if you examine the dynamics of the film, I think you, too, will notice that she was rather... expendable. But, set aside a few flaws and blemishes, Finding Forrester was an all-around good movie, an exploration of writing and the frustrations society can bring you, and on a lesser scale, an exploitation of the corrupt school system. And let us not forget Sean Connery's excellent performance; he truly immerses himself into William Forrester's character, going all-out in a role that should have won him an Oscar nomination (call me crazy for saying that, but I truly believe he was that good). Also, keep your eyes open for a scene in which Sean Connery watches Jeapordy! (as in the well-known SNL skits) and a cameo by Matt Damon.Overall rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: Inspiring, deep, accessible to non-arty types</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Finding Forrester" has a lot to say about life, and I found the film to be quite deep and intellectual without being overly melodramatic or arty. The film is really an upscale teen film, but I found it accessible to me as a pure drama. The film has two characters who go through a transition rather than the usual just one. The only negative comment I'll make is that I think perhaps more could have been at stake in the film. It's not boring, but neither is it a nail-biter.Who should see this film:-- teens, a must-see-- everyone who has a little tolerance for dramas, this isa safe one and quite inspiring. It may change your life!I'll give "Finding Forrester" a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Its not the acting, or the actors, or the hotshot production that makes the movie, its simply the story, the meaning portrayed by the writer. Of course it helps to have an actor like Connery who is more than aptly cast for the part. This movie is a must see for anyone who wishes to learn anything about life.The emphasis being on, " its not to late even in your golden years, or you have the rest of your life to do something great, or even just good.

Sean Connery is painfully wasted and is forced to recite the most hackneyed, contrived lines he's ever uttered ("... and you're black!"). Rob Brown is good as the kid, and deserves a better movie for his debut. I don't even want to discuss F. Murray Abraham - he's been desperate to take any part since he won the Oscar in 1984 for Amadeus. This movie is so boring and predictable it hurt -- although it was pretty amusing seeing Busta Rhymes having a scene together with Connery. See this movie at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>far, far short of 'perfection'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding Forrester is not necessarily what I would call a bad film, but it is a film whose successes are far outweighed by its failures. Others have pointed out its derivation from Good Will Hunting and Scent of Woman, and while these criticisms are certainly valid, I do not believe that simply being derivative is cause alone for a severely flawed film. This film fails not because of what it has borrowed from others, but because of what it fails to provide on its own.In short the surface level characters, uninteresting dialogue and meandering dramatic arc left me struggling to stay awake. Drama is the product of conflict and ultimately resolution, and most of the potential conflicts in this film were barely exposed, let alone explored, leaving most of the film feeling flat and extraordinarily dull.Van Sant has made much better films, among them Good Will Hunting, Drugstore Cowboy and My Own Private Idaho. I would rather see one of these films for a third or fourth time than sit through Forrester again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film but Jamal is First a Thief!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding Forrester was for me an inspirational film rich with symbolism, fantasy, emotion and most of all, the vibrance life.The main theme and main characters were very intriguing to me; the enigma Pulitzer Prize winning author hidden from society yet so close we might trip on him, the quiet, withdrawn intellect of the unassuming athlete, and finally the power of institution and tradition versus the minority.While I enjoyed the film immensely I have one main question and that is of character - Jamal is first introduced to the audience as a thief, a criminal, someone who does not respect other people's property. How wide were Jamal's eyes when he was accused of stealing words? How could anyone suppose that he, a man of such character would do such a thing yet we see that he is already a thief, there is no stretch here.The fact that Forrester apparently forgives Jamal's transgression is probably due to the fact that it was committed by someone with promise, and in need of some guidance. This allows me to live with it, but other than this I am happy with the quintessential humanness portrayed so brilliantly by Connery and Brown. Maybe the relationship blossoming out of theft, forgiveness and promise is just one more subtle essence of the their humanness.I found the interest of the Forrester character in birding to be symbolic of leading a life worth living, breaking rules and filling the life with bright, colorful experiences - the irony is while Jamal is at 16 ready to do just that Forrester remains in his birdcage.I thought one key point in the movie was when Claire says (or words similar to) to Jamal "The Mailer School was once an all-boys school but my dad changed that...He did what anyone in his position would do, he joined the board and then changed the rules. Everyone knows it's because of him". Does Jamal accept the challenge to change the rules? I think he does!Perhaps it is a heavy weight to be perfect or blessed with a great talent, I feel this when searching both Jamal and Forrester and finding both to be recluses in their own domains, but in the end they are set free on new paths, and the audience is set free with them.I enjoyed the film thoroughly and I hope you did too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched Finding Forrester last night and in my mind there is little to perfect here.The enigma Pulitzer Prize winning author hidden from society yet so close we might trip on him, the withdrawn quiet intellect of the unassuming athlete, the battle of institution and tradition versus the rightous minority.This film is rich with symbolism, fantasy, emotion and most of all, life.I am one to quickly look for believability in characters and script and in Finding Forrester I found that what I initially characterized as plot inconsistencies and character deficiencies were something quite different, and that is the display of quintessential humanness portrayed so slightly by Connery and directly by Brown.The interest of the Forrester Character in birding seemed to me to be symbolic of something greater than the art of writing something worth reading, that of "living", and doing so freely of rules and filling the life with bright, colorful experiences - the irony is while Jamal is at just 16 ready to do just that Forrester is a bird in a cage.A key point in the movie - Clair says to Jamal "Mailer use to be an all boy's school but my dad changed that...He did what anyone in his position would do, he joined the board and then changed the rules.

		<fullReview>Authentic, high-concept, the film refreshes with its wonderful storytelling through setting and rich characterization, sold perfectly by an outstanding core of actors. The character of Jamal plays brilliantly by an unknown, Rob Brown; he manages to make me wonder wether he really isn't Jamal. Sean Connery is wonderful to watch as an eccentric Saligner-type author, F. Murray Abraham played this as perfect as anything seen, and every supporting actor performed such that we are never disturbed from the story. And the director certainly gets credit for balancing high-concept with the constraints. Whatever style he used to guide his cast, it surely let them shine and sold the movie.Upon second watching, the evocative soundtrack provides deep storytelling wonder not found in even many of the prominent great films which relied on the soundtrack to reverberate emotionally--not provide more story elements.What still stays with me is the haunting closing with a beautiful song medley, arranged such that the overplayed songs are given new life and totally different candor, and a camera angle that my slow wit only picked up on the second time: the shot was from the apartment. (Here I would describe more but may spoil. See it.)Looking forward to more films like this.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This bland film does a few things right, but it flounders on stereotyped characters, predictable situations, and a relentlessly phony climax. The movie purports to be about writing, but that's really the MacGuffin: The one time we actually get to hear words written by either of the two lead characters, the soundtrack quickly fades and we get a montage of people responding to the words in place of hearing the actual writing itself. (I guess the screenwriter decided that it would be safer to show us everyone responding this way than to try writing something that would provoke such a response in the film's actual viewers.) Meanwhile, Sean Connery's character periodically provides sage advice on writing to his young friend -- advice like "POUND the keys! POUND the keys!" Ishmael Reed once said that writin' is fightin', but this is ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serendipity - A shot to the heart in time of need . . . Possible Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Fellow Film Reviewers: This is a personal response essay to a remarkable film: "Finding Forrester."Sometimes we writers suffer a battering from outside and within side - without ever being drunk or stoned or swathed in any other forms of depression or 'typical' writer's maladies ascribed to us by our public: Sometimes we simply suffer from life.We're all just normal. And so are all of the exigencies of life which visit us.Such it was for me this past few weeks: I finally 'escaped' from the hospital after 5 weeks of pneumonia and other irritants, not the least of which was cancer #6: melanoma [light case, I'm told - just a stage one.] Frankly, it's almost become boring, cancer: I've been dealing with one kind of cancer or another since 1959 when I started with lymphoma; then Hodgkin's (II, III, IVa, IVb); then bladder; then throat - and, intermittently, all three skin types.I wish I had a secret to reveal you about 'getting well' - Having none, I wish my magnificent body would simply stay ?well' instead of 'healing' and keeping 'them' so busy at their work. Over the years, I've become a Professional Medical Economic Unit for the medical profession. I keep ?em working!My point: About the magnificent work of writer Mark Rich and director Gus Van Sant and the cast of "Finding Forrester" - - -I am about to begin produce my first original works - three films, a trilogy - which will be shot simultaneously due to the age (12 years old) of one of the main characters. It's a drama, adapted from a fiction novel-trilogy I wrote in 1995-1997.These past few weeks have taken a lot of my famous 'drive and spirit' away from my withinness. My 'innerself' seems flat. - That which I had always deemed to be boundless: That automatic 'I never give up. Never - Not Ever.' That Innerself now seems to be soft; just a shapeless cloud wafting around wherever, whatever I am. It was almost as if I was trying to wave it away - leave me be.Two nights ago I 'doubled' up on codeine-sulfate for pain, extra Valium for severe spasms, garbapentin for neurogenic pain (I'm a spastic-paraplegic) and several others ?goodies' - - - a few hours later, still hoping for relief, I did it all over again.I 'knew' that I was 'toying' with overload, and, for the first time in my life, it really didn't matter: I just wanted to be pain free, to hell with the rest..The last I remember, I had restarted "Quigley" for a third time in between Instrument Flying training films . . . (and, I guess I went to sleep.)I'm a former drunk: sober almost 20 years. I know better than to ?toy around with analgesics.' Amazingly enough - I had no hangover. I woke up a little while ago, called the operator and learned that it was Saturday, December1, 2001 - 6:30 - - -"AM or PM?""PM . . ."Hot damn! I got what I wanted: almost two days, pain free. Night time or not, I made my everyday 'morning' instant oatmeal, flicked on the satellite and . . . There was a film in progress . . .There was that ?dirty rotten mean' old F. Murray Abraham - "Professor Robert Crawford" - and young Rob Brown - "Jamal Wallace" (a quiet brilliant student) - going at it during a college (literature?) class.Power versus accuracy with perhaps a little racism thrown in.Soon, Sean Connery - "William Forrester (the mentor) - enters the film-story and he and Jamal began to bring life's complexities together.Bingo: and, "I" began to live.I began to give a damn.F**k the pain. - - - "I" wanted to finish my work.`I' wanted to do what this writer (Mark Rich? - who?) (And Van Sant) had done: put `life' onto the screen which transferred seamlessly into me, his audience.Not a ?message film'; a `story' - a `life' into which I could enter, take part, take sides; want an outcome, one I know would not happen - or could it?What talents; what gifts - given just to me - purely through artists and serendipity.I hadn't a clue about the film beforehand; nothing about its time to play - or anything about it at all. I just flipped on the ?clicker' and there it was, somewhere after it had started.Watching `Finding Forrester' I was absorbed, I went inside.I went inside of the film, lived there, stayed there until ending credits finished and pushed me back out. And I knew I was different for it.During my visit inside of `their' world, my enerergies began to reassemble, reinvade my life, they 'apologized' for having been outside - claiming there was always a tether upon which for me to pull them back inside. (Yeah, right: that's why I was so despondent and lonely!)I knew and know now, that as the work of Van Sant and Rich developed in `Finding Forrester' they made me come alive again; and that the excitement of my looking forward to the battles ahead this spring, are a gift of life which comes only from artists giving their all invisibly to each other.Sometimes the marriage of a director and a writer and uncanny casting can touch our creative selves at what seems to be a most desperate, hopeless time. `Finding Forrester' was that for me.They touched me with a work so complicated it appears simple - a work done by actors who gave of themselves so completely, so remarkably, so honestly, with such purity and simplicity - that I've had all words which were ever present inside of me before watching `Finding Forrester' vacuumed out of my brain and I am left with just these four words for the writer, director and cast of `Finding Forrester' -Thank you, very much!Please, do see this film.Killiam Tierney - killiam@earthlink.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the sort of supposedly intelligent film that employs a quality cast and seemingly conscientious premise but is irretrivably sloppy and cliched. A prodigy film about a promising teenaged writer from the Bronx, it even employs the synonomous participle to Good Will Hunting and Finding Bobby Fischer. Unlike those films, it relies on and never moves beyond a hackneyed premise and shortcut cast (Sean Connery as a secretive wise mentor and F. Murray Abraham as an embittered authority figure). The film's protagonist is buffeted between the two older men in a plot that is heavily derivative of Scent of a Woman (including the implication that private school denizens are mostly petty and amoral). Vaguely trying to show that bright African American youths at risk can be straightened out with guidance from old, famous white guys with time on their hands, this movie ultimately says nothing insightful about maturation, race, class or the process of writing. A waste of time that insults the films with which it would associate itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth seeing despite some plot shortcomings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies which seems more impressive when you are viewing it than on later reflection. The main plot, of a young black boy with exceptional writing ability (as well as being a basket ball ace) who - out of all the young Afro-Americans living in the Bronx - happens to stumble upon a reclusive Salinger-type writer who then mentors him, would be more suitable for a satire or stylised fable, than a would-be realistic drama. And even if writer Mike Rich was allowed to get away with the coincidental key encounter between promising pupil Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) and Pulitzer Prize-winning William Forrester (Sean Connery), he should have been sent back to his word processor when he produced a second major coincidence that Jamal's nasty English teacher at his swish Prep School (F Murray Abraham) turns out to be a failed writer with a grudge against Forrester.Nevertheless, despite the unlikely and, in some respects, anodyne plot, the film is enjoyable for its acting, the touching father-son relationship built up between the older man and the boy, and its overall messages about the importance of both life and artistic creativity. Connery is quietly impressive as Forrester, convincingly portraying a man at first unwilling and now unable to fully engage with the outside world; and Brown gives a fine debut performance on and off the basket ball court, though possibly his part was tailored to fit his inexperience. Among the supporting cast are Busta Rhymes as Jamal's street-wise, hustling brother; Anna Paquin as his upperclass fellow pupil; and April Grace as his rather too saintly mother. The film might have been better if a little more time had been spent developing these minor characters and their relationships to Jamal, and the sentimental ending had been cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YUM (young urban male) is proficient enough to be a basketball savior and the next Arthur Hailey - I don't think so. Yes some people are born with the talent to write without putting in a lot of time and effort (although no one I can think of comes to mind), but there is nobody in New York City good enough to lead a team to the state basketball championship without devoting at least 4-5 hours per day practicing. In addition, Jamal also had to do a high level mathematics course, 2 social studies courses, and 2 electives. All this in a high school that demands more of its students than most colleges. The writer should have omitted the basketball sub-plot. (I think he was trying to say something about the white power structure in a very heavy-handed way.)At least Good Will Hunting had the good sense to limit Will to one world class skill (if you don't count his drinking).There were some good points to the movie. Busta Rhymes was a pleasant surprise (and his life of street hustling quid pro quo's probably would have made a more interesting movie). Also the writer had the good sense not to clutter up the plot with an extraneous inter-racial love affair. Having Clare and Jamal remain only friends was just the right touch (pun intended) keeping the plot focused on Jamal's writing. Sean Connery gives his usual performance, touching all the right bases. Some more interplay among Jamal, William, and William's gofer would have been welcome.In the end the movie falls short for one reason - Jamal was just a boring character. He never says or does anything interesting. What should have been a deep conflict between him and his former friends gets very short shrift.The concept of the movie is good, but it is not executed very well.</fullReview>

This movie brought back wonderful memories of my many hours in his office with him reading and editing my work. This movie has both tension and resolve.

What is just as common, and quite the pity, is when the commercials trick you into NOT seeing the movie. Such was the case for me with Finding Forrester. What I took away from the TV ads, it turned out, was not what the movie is about. For example, in the precious 30 seconds of ad time they show a scene where Sean Connery tells his young friend that if he writes a book then he can get girls to go to bed with him. Oh, boy! Just what we need, Sean Connery in an "American Pie" rip off. What else was I to think? That was bad marketing. The ads convinced me this was going to be a cliche ridden, high brow smut-i-thon. Well, it's not. It turns out to be thoughtful and thought provoking. They seemed to want us to believe the movie would insult our intelligence, but instead it is enlightening. Excellent acting, good characters, entertaining story. I liked it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was alright, but not what I was looking for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all before I comment on this film, I must say that Rob Brown (a charming performance as Jamal) and Sean Connory (good form as usual) are a great screen duo. There truly was a great father/teacher, son/student relationship there. Better than I have seen in years. But there were a few things about this film that didn't work for me. It seems to me that in these particular films, with this kind of theme, they tend to indicate that gifted writers have to be geniuses or have an extremely high intellect. I believe that the true source of writing talent really comes from the heart. This film didn't seem say much about this. If it did, I guess I expected more. Writers, however, do need to have some enlightening ideas and be on a higher plane of thinking, but writing emerges from the soul and from life's experiences not from test scores. This film did indicate this remotely with Forrester's family situation from the past, but this film again, didn't elaborate this enough.What bothered me too, was the poor kid being accused of all sorts of crimes like plagiarism. If he has high test scores and attends this school why would they even comment on his work, stating that it was just "too good". His teachers didn't seem to have a lot of faith in him. Even his basketball coach flashes him a dirty look for loosing the big game (seems to me he fails to remember that the kid scored a perfect winning streak previously). Is a private prep school really so stiff and formal that they would disqualify Jamal's work (for supposed plagiarism again), and then humiliate him in front of his peers by making him read an apology during the contest? I wouldn't know personally, but it seems to me that poor Jamal just couldn't get a break. Mr.Forrester, even flings a few arrows at the poor guy at times. A good attempt of displaying a kid's dream coming true, but I found myself a little crestfallen after such high hopes of inspiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that seems to work often, even though we've seen the formula of the prodigious youth being tutored by the misunderstood genius elder. I love keeping tabs on directors like Gus Van Sant, who seem to hit and miss alternately with his films. This is not a great film but I didn't feel cheated out of the two plus hours that I sat through it. What works primarily is a wonderful performance by Rob Brown IV, who with his first film proved to be a diamond in the rough.Even though the ending is obvious, we're left satisfied even with its predictability, this is simply the kind of story that it needs the ending that it has, to give us anything else would be too much of a curve-ball, and totally unnecessary. Too bad that Hollywood doesn't feel necessary to provide more movies with three strong acts. Often we're teased with an interesting beginning and promising middle section only to have it all fall apart at the ending. Not this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made, but Beyond Derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tough to get to the heart of Finding Forrester because of its muddled pool of influences. Good Will Hunting is an obvious point of comparison -- both are stories of blue collar prodigies reticent to use their talent because of their backgrounds and both were directed by Gus Van Sant. The issues of integrity and classism as well as the trite climax are reminiscent of Scent of a Woman (and once you add the athletics angle, you may also recall School Ties). The reclusive iconic author with a passion for baseball sounds like a subplot from Field of Dreams. And whole chunks of plot and character dynamics seem borrowed from the William Hurt story arc of Smoke. What's even more troubling is that Good Will Hunting, Field of Dreams, and Scent of a Woman tended towards clichs anyway so Finding Forrester feels either like a slick piece of mimicry, or a film written by a man who had never seen a movie and thus didn't know how to avoid dozens over too-familiar tropes. The lack of originality is troubling and yet Finding Forrester largely works because of Van Sant's proficient direction and excellent performances all around.Newcomer Rob Brown plays Jamal Wallace, a basketball player from the Bronx who has a dirty secret. At every opportunity he's writing in one of a series of journals or reading one of a series of great books. He knows poetry and the history of the BMW corporation, and yet he gets C's at school. His test scores and hoops skills attract the attention of a ritzy Manhattan private school. At the same time, Wallace meets "The Window", a reclusive white guy who's always watching the schoolyard ball games. The Window turns out to be William Forrester, a Scot whose lone novel is still inspiring people forty years after its publication. As happens in movies, Forrester gives Wallace lessons in writing, but those lessons are really lessons in life. Wallace, meanwhile, tries to bring Forrester out into the real world. But in the end, everything that happens is about determination and being true to your own principles, while all the while chasing your dreams. In case you didn't get that "dream" motif, "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" makes a couple appearances in the film.Written by first-time screenwriter Mike Rich, Finding Forrester is a 135 minute movie that feels like it should have been longer. The film touches on a half dozen plotlines that never get developed or that just get discarded. Anna Paquin has several appealing moments as the rich white girl who's attracted to Jamal. But her story arc is abruptly dismissed. And Jamal's rivalry with the rich point guard on the prep b-ball team? Also dismissed. And Jamal's relationship with his friends from the Bronx? Patched up all-too-neatly at the end. Ethical issues involving the end of Jamal's basketball season are passed off as well. It would have been tough to resolve these things without more clichs, but leaving them hanging is even more problematic.Yet through it all, the film coasts on the charm and professionalism of all of the actors. As Forrester, Sean Connery isn't really breaking any new ground, but like Paul Newman, our memories of the actor as a young man add additional gravity to everything he does as an older man. Rob Brown may not have acted before, but he's a natural, giving his role the necessary physical and intellectual characteristics. While F. Murray Abraham's bitter English teacher is a stock character he's always fun to watch, and in smaller roles Trevor Smith Jr. (sometimes known as Busta Rhymes) and Paquin excell.Van Sant and ace cinematographer Harry Savides make everything look beautiful, a decision which sometimes weakens the film's sense of place. An overpolished subway stop and a selectively shot playground don't give any depth to the Bronx and Manhattan settings. Van Sant was much more successful with Good Will Hunting's Boston locales. But Van Sant moves the film at a good pace despite its length and continues to be a master with actors.Finding Forrester's greatest gift is that even with all of the recycled material, nothing is ever so obvious as to be painful to watch. And since you've seen it all before, you can concentrate on positive theme and the excellent acting. As nice as those things are, though, they only add up to a 6.5/10 light recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT MOVIE ABOUT WRITING GENIUSES (OLD AND WHITE, YOUNG AND BLACK)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had known about this movie before, I would have seen it earlier. I thought it was about a scout and a would-be basketball star, so I put it off despite all kinds of rave reviews. I had had my fill of basketball movies.But this was a pleasant surprise that unfolded organically, and it was really about an African-American basketball star in a run-down black neighborhood in the Bronx, who also happened to be a writing genius who knocked the top off all the IQ tests, which is 180 degree opposite the stereotype of the disadvantaged, underperforming inner-city black. He was not on drugs and he did not use bad language. Neither did most of his friends, despite their being rambuctious teenagers. He was quickly screened out of his local high school and offered a scholarship to the top prep school, full of snobby whites and one particular nasty English teacher, who questions his veracity.Central to the movie is the unlikely but growing relationship between a reclusive great author, who limited himself to one novel, and who remained in the changing neighborhood, defying demographic trends, and this neighborhood kid, who is curious about what and who is behind the window in the top floor apartment.The relationship is ultimately rewarding for both, despite many inherent obstacles, which are overcome slowly over time, leading to a dramatic and developmental climax which is uplifting and bittersweet at the end.The theme of the movie is that we are all in the same family, the Family of Man, and that age and race differences can and should melt away as individuals get to know and love one another. But the treatment of this love theme is not overly smarmy or sentimental, which is the movie's strength.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finding Forrester is very instructive. It should be shown to film students to instruct them away from bad filmmaking. What's up with the basketball scenes being shot as just torsos? Who are these lesser characters and what movie are they in? Hoosiers? Save the Last Dance? Dead Poet's Society? Why, oh WHY, are there scenes where all I can see is glare?Maybe you'll like it when Forrester rides around on his bike. Nobody talks, lessening the chance for Connery to overact, Jamaal to imitate a Stone Buddha, the Director to screw up camera angles and the scriptwriters to hack up klinkers like "When you were showing me defense, Jamal, are you sure that's ALL you were showing me?" Ohh, I still shiver over that one.If that isn't flavor in yer ear, here's how bad it was: The best scene? Stock footage of the Bronx projects; Busta Rhymes as Terell is so miscast, which would be an issue if we cared about the rest of 'em; F. Murray Abraham was most recognizably human as the malevolent professor.Lastly, Sean Connery mailed this one in. Go watch Avengers again if you don't believe me.

		<shortDescription>good will hunting without the vulgarity and violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had the same director as Good Will Hunting and pretty much takes the same pointless direction. It starts out really slow and gets even slower as the movie 'progresses'. The romance with Anna Paquin isnt tied in with the lackage of plot and is completely irrelevant to the rest of the movie. It just shows them together a couple times and leaves it at that. Theres a scene where Jamal, a high school student with an amazing aptitude for writing, is able to give the author of every line his professor reads and then finishes with a smart alic retort that gets him in trouble. The whole scene is suspisciosly reminiscent of the Harvard bar scene in Good Will Hunting, which ironically has Matt Damon saying "Yeah, well at least I wont be unoriginal." Another great scene is where Sean Connery, the revered author, reads a work of his 'prodigal son'. You can hear the first few lines and classical music is heard as he reads the rest. They should of had classical music for all of it. The impression gained after the first few lines is not that of a talented writer. But the part that really gets me is Matt Damons arrogant little cameo at the end. At this point I turned it off and got some chicken soup for the upset stomach cause I was ready to puke. If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. I felt the movie was indebted to me after I spent the longest two hours of my life watching it.</fullReview>

Why was he so one-dimensional. Murray Abraham did a great job with this one note character, all hate and resentment and no real motivation to it. Also I dislike the fact that Forrester himself had used blackmail to stop the publication of Crawford's book. No true artist, and particularly a Pulitzer prize winner no less, would have done that. A lot of it did not feel real, a not so good Hollywood treatment of a potentially fabulous film about the true nature of friendship and the mentoring role that can be played in a young person's life. Rob Brown was very good for a first film. Sean Connery excellent. I gave it a 6 for the actors involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie moves a bit slow at the beginning but catches up for a good ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie moves along a bit slow, but the story is good. Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown VI) is a talented, young, African American writer. He meets William Forrester (Sean Connery!!) who after reading Jamals' journal takes an interest in his writing skills. The way the two meet seems a little far out, but with William keeping himself locked inside his home, I suppose it was the only way for the two to meet. There was a love interest of Jamals', but their relationship did not steal the show which I was thankful for. The movie stayed focused on Jamal and Williams friendship throughout the film. In many movies there are predictable elements like at the last game the main character always makes the winning points and the boy always kisses the girl. Not in this movie, and for once it was refreshing to not have those things distract you away from the plot. I especially liked the man that acted as Jamals' teacher who I thought acted very well to the point where his character was very good at being disliked. The bad guys are so fun to hate. This was a good movie and very much worth watching. Oh, did you ever notice that in any movie when the kids are in class, the bell rings and they just automatically get up to leave as the teacher is yelling thier assignment over all hustle and bustle? It was never like that for me in school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant is known for introducing many young stars. In 1991, he made My Private Idaho with River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves and helped them secure their careers. (Of course, one of them is dead and the other one is a really bad actor.) Then in 1997, he made Good Will Hunting and gave the world two of the most popular actors in the world right now: Ben Affleck &amp; Matt Damon. With Finding Forrester, Van Sant introduces another young star but also recycles a grizzled veteran.Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) is your typical 16-year-old Bronx kid who loves his mom and basketball. He goes to public school with his friends and leads a totally normal life. Jamal gets average marks in school, but his mom claims he is always writing in his books and Jamal scores very high on his tests. Every day, while Jamal and his friends play basketball, they see a figure in a window, watching them. This figure has never been seen and never goes out. To investigate, Jamal and his friends decide to break in at night.Jamal goes in by the window and snoops around, but is discovered by the occupant of the apartment. He runs away, leaving his bag in the apartment.When he returns to get his bag, Jamal finds that his writing has been noted with lines like `constipated writing' and `love this part'. So it seems that this mystery person has taken an interest in Jamal. Jamal finally returns and meets an old Scottish man (Sean Connery) who has been living in the shade for 20 years. Eventually, Jamal learns that this man is William Forrester, author of the timeless novel Avalon Landing. Jamal becomes friends with Forrester and teaches him about the world he's missed. Forrester helps Jamal with his work at his new private school.Obviously, the character of Forrester is based on J.D. Salinger and Avalon Landing on Catcher In The Rye. The movie is also quite similar to Good Will Hunting in its theme. The characters of Forrester and of Jamal are believeable and the story never takes cheap, unbelieveable turns to try and make the viewer think. The story takes a slow, methodical and totally natural procession.The video box boasts 3 Oscar winners. The important is of course Connery as Forrester. (he won an Oscar in 1987 for The Untouchables.) This is one of Connery's meatiest roles in quite a few years. His performance as the genius recluse ranks amongst his best. Robert Brown, in his debut, is totally believeable and natural. Noticeably, he isn't plagued by some of the problems experienced child actors have. His performance and chemistry with the other actors promises great things for him. The second Oscar winner is Anna Paquin, winner in 1993 for The Piano when she was all of ten years old. She plays Jamal's friend at the private school. Her performance, like everything that came after The Piano, doesn't stand out but provides solid support. The third winner is F. Murray Abraham as Jamal's evil teacher. His acting is adequate at best, but I think I feel this way because of his character, which I will discuss later. Busta Rhymes has a small role as Jamal's older brother and I only want to point out that his acting here is much better than in Shaft.The biggest problem is that Finding Forrester's story dawdles along at a strange pace. I don't like how it turns out, with Abraham's character accusing Jamal of copying. The twist in the story is unneeded and turns the movie more sour than anything else. It has a great beginning and plenty of potential, but because of this and Abraham's character, the movie seems to have achieved less than it could've.The script includes many views on writing and the meaning of books. Forrester laments how critics thought he was identifying with the character and the character was a metaphor for his own problems. Forrester responds by saying he wrote a book to write a book, not reveal some dark thought about himself. The meaning of words and of writing is also tackled and mostly comes out very well. Some of the dialogue is pretty strange, border weird, such as Connery's famous `You're the man now, Dogg!'. As much as I like his performance, lines like this are silly.Finding Forrester is a good movie, not without flaws and somewhat vanilla in parts. The acting and morals more than make up for it, however. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Finding Forrester" is a film that had a lot of potential. It was a bluechip recruit, if you will. The story line is a blatant ripoff of "Scent of a Woman" and "Good Will Hunting" with a little "Field of Dreams" and "Hoop Dreams" thrown in. But if you're going to 'borrow' plot and thematic elements from earlier movies, these four are good ones to choose. So the fact that the story was unoriginal bothered me only slightly.When I read the synopsis of the film, I was actually quite excited to see it. I've always enjoyed stories of people rising above their status and the expectations that others place on them. I also enjoy films that feature a character who excels at something society tells them they're not supposed to excel at. But I thought Gus Van Sant - who's a vastly talented director - and rookie screenwriter Mike Rich really shortarmed this effort. Several critical characters, including Forrester, weren't developed to their potentials. Why exactly did Forrester hole himself up into a cluttered apartment for 20+ years? Why did he write books only to leave them unseen and unread in a file cabinet? Because his brother died and the nurse caring for him was a fan of Forrester's novel?The Robert Crawford (F. Murray Abraham - who gave a typically terrific performance) and Clare Spence (Anna Paquin - who did not) characters were also very bland. I never really hated Crawford like I should have hated him. I don't think Abraham's to blame for that - his character was simply underdeveloped. I still can't figure out how Clare was at all relevant to the story - given the different-sides-of-the-tracks love story was hinted at but never resolved for or against.And whatever happened to the John Hartwell character that Jamal began developing a competition with on the basketball team? A conflict between Jamal and Hartwell was introduced but also never resolved to any particular satisfaction.Some of the acting also left a lot to be desired. It's hard to imagine that a film featuring 3 Oscar-winning actors could suffer from mediocre acting. But somehow "Forrester" pulls it off. Sean Connery gives a passable, if uninspired, performance as a Pulitzer Prize winning writer who sees writing talent in Jamal and crawls out of his hole to help him develop it. But Busta Rhymes may perhaps be the worst rapper-turned-actor since The Fat Boys did "Disorderlies" in the 80's. And I was also unimpressed with newcomer Rob Brown's performance as Jamal. Don't even get me started on Anna Paquin and the basketball coach.I might also add that I've never seen such uninspiring basketball game scenes in a movie. I think I liked the basketball games in "Teen Wolf" better than I liked these. Van Sant did amazingly little to develop any suspense with these games.I've been a fan of Gus Van Sant's since I saw his powerful road-crime drama "Drugstore Cowboy" over ten years ago. With the possible exception of the remake-that-never-should-have-been "Psycho", this is his worst major film. It's slow, depressing, and at times frustrating. It's a shame when such a promising concept as this suffers from marginal writing, directing, and acting efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grumpy Old Man helps out Gifted Young Writer. It's kind of like Good Will Hunting, only without the crisp script or the gorgeous Boston scenery. Sean Connery plays William Forrester, a J. D. Salinger-like recluse who published one book in the distant past. (Salinger published the English-class standard Catcher in the Rye way back when, and has done little since, choosing the life of a hermit instead.) He lives in a tenement building in the Bronx in New York, always peering out from his small apartment at the pickup basketball games below. One of the kids who plays in those games near Forrester's apartment is Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown), a talented high schooler who carries a C average. Well, "carries" is the right word, because Jamal is apparently a lot smarter than his grades would indicate; he's well-read and articulate. But having great grades in an inner-city school is apparently not cool, so Jamal holds back. So the boys playing their games see Forrester watching them, and they make up stories about the place - it's the domain of a ghost, of course. And on a dare, Jamal climbs up the side of the building to check out the mysterious ghost - and winds up leaving his bag. Naturally, Forrester goes through the bag and reads Jamal's latest compositions and marks them all up. And that's how the two meet - Jamal comes back after getting his bag tossed down at him and seeing the critical comments from Forrester, and they strike a deal: Forrester will help the young lad with his writing, and Jamal won't mention Forrester's identity to anyone. Jamal, on the advice of school counselors, begins to attend a private college (on a scholarship, of course), and he runs into Professor Crawford (F. Murray Abraham). Anyone who's attended college has had a teacher like this - pompous, arrogant, snooty. And of course, since Forrester is acting as Jamal's muse, problems ensue about that oldest of college problems - plagiarism, not alcoholism. Will the recluse stand up for his friend and leave his apartment building? Will Jamal be vindicated? Will Jamal help the school win the basketball championship? Geez, all this film was missing was a sick mother or a wisecracking best friend. Oh wait - we DID have the best friend, played (and played very well) by Busta Rhymes. This movie is absolutely exploding with cliches, and most of the characters seem to be one-dimensional. But it's Brown who stands above everyone else, who makes this more than just another mentor-student movie. His timing is impeccable, his delivery astonishing, and his talents should - repeat, should - take him miles from this movie. He's so good he makes even Connery look like just another old fart, but I think Connery mailed this one in. Even so, his character is too coarse to be interesting, and I wound up not giving a rat's ass about him. Unfortunately, his situation is supposed to be one of the driving forces of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Forrester indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film season is becoming on of the most disappointing in recent history. One film after another is a real let-down. This film is no exception.All right, the acting is quite good, especially by newcomer Robert Brown. The most surprising thing about the acting however was the casting of rapper Busta Rhymes as the main character's brother. In my opinion, Busta is one of the few really good things about this movie. The rest is formula all the way, one clich after another. The character development is far below par too. What happens to Anna Paquin's character for example, or with that of Jamal's great rival at school? And is the villainy of Abraham's character not a bit too much? But the biggest problem here is that the story is awfully similar to that of GOOD WILL HUNTING. Just compare the opening scenes for example, or the characters (played by Busta Rhymes/Ben Affleck, F. Murray Abraham/Stellan Skarsgard, Anna Paquin/Minnie Driver,...).And is the cameo appearance in the last scenes just a cameo, or more like a reference to that other film?However, where GOOD WILL HUNTING succeeded in avoiding clichs and making a simple and familiar story into a great film, FORRESTER fails. And if you think you've seen it all before, but not in the earlier Van Sant film, it might have been in WONDER BOYS, SCHOOL TIES, even THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE and almost every teen sports film in recent memory. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finding Forrester was a very charming, warm &amp; funny movie. I have seen some reviews that suggest the script is not up to scratch, but whilst there were a couple of bits that could have been better, don't use these people's comments as a reason not to go see the movie. Robert Brown (Jamal Wallace) was delightful &amp; engaging &amp; intimate - totally disarming in fact as a brainy high school trying to just be one of the boys. Busta Rhymes was entertaining as Jamal's brother. Anna Paquin was a bit of a wet blanket &amp; could have almost been left out, apart from one pretty sweet scene where she is getting some 'defence' tips. There were some odd camera angles, almost like arthouse/experimental which were a bit out of place. But I mention that only as a passing comment - I don't want in any way to be negative about Finding Forrester, because I enjoyed it immensely, more than Good Will Hunting, if I'm allowed to say that! It was cheeky &amp; clever &amp; thoughtful - a very well-spent Saturday afternoon. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was billed as 2 and a 1/2 hours long. So one thinks to oneself this better be good. Well if you want too see a real good movie this is it. Its damn good. If I was Ebert and had a 3rd thumb I'd give hold that up too. 3 thumbs up. Sean Connery spoke highly of Robert Brown (Jamal) and I can see why. He's a natural and very good (3 thumbs up good). Sean Connery is his usual phenomenal self as the reclusive genius. The story flows along quite nicely and leaves you feeling inspired at the end. The other characters are played well (notably F Murray Abraham) to give the story the x factor. So if you want to spend that hard earned cash on something watchable see this if nothing else...**** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catcher in the Bronx</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wurlitzer in the Cremorne Orpheum played hits from `My Fair Lady' before this film was shown, an apt piece of programming since the plot owes a little ? no, more than a little - to that famed musical based on Bernard Shaw's play `Pygmalion'. Jamal, black Bronx kid with writing talent (`Look at him, a prisoner of the gutter?'), is taken up by reclusive famous novelist William Forrester and taught some of the tricks of the trade (`The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain ? I think he's got it'), to the disbelief of his English teacher who thinks the kid is guilty of plagiarism (`Miss Doolittle is a fraud!'). It's Eliza Doolittle meets J D Salinger. His snobby school however is a little reluctant to can Jamal's scholarship since he is also a basketball star. Jamal, like Eliza, ain't taking no sh*t from no-one (`What kind of a sentence is that' ? William Forrester), but in his case it takes intervention from the reclusive one to save his ass. There are some nice scenes. I liked the quotation duel between Jamal and his teacher (including one from Shaw) though of course Jamal couldn't win, and there is plenty of fast-paced basketball action. Rob Brown as Jamal is excellent as the cool centre of all the action, and Sean Connery is a proven performer who can convey the agony of the proven performer who just can't perform anymore. F. Murray Abraham, in a reprise of his Salieri in `Amadeus' does a well-judged portrayal of the bitter and twisted teacher (`Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach' ? Shaw again).The rest is pretty conventional stuff ? the poor but worthy black family and friends, the interested white girl (though nicely played by Anna Panquin) and her wary father, the school snobs, the climactic basketball match etc. I am also left wondering why Jamal's precocious literary talent, fed it seems by reading just about every book in the New York Public Library, should have to be accompanied by sporting talent as well. Must the American writer always be sports star as well? Perhaps it's the Hemingway tradition ? a man can't write until he shoots something. Hemingway of course shot himself when he could not write anymore. Perhaps it is that in the US, in contrast to the UK, sport is regarded as a proper subject for high art.I really enjoyed a previous film of van Sant's, `My Private Idaho,' which dealt with the `progress' (downhill) of a couple of genuinely marginalised characters in the American boondocks and which provided rich comedy and pathos. This film on the other hand is very studio-ordinary, with a distinctly feeble ending that could easily have been left out. I was left with the impression of inherent improbability and punches pulled - studio interference perhaps. But we do learn about when it's proper to start a sentence with a preposition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting, Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even without its cheekily reminiscent title, or the involvement of Gus Van Sant and Matt Damon, this film was always going to be a poor relation to "Good Will Hunting". At one point writer Mike Rich has Forrester tell Jamal that one can kick start the writing process by beginning with someone else's work. Start by rewriting it, and when you find your own voice, let it takeover. Perhaps this is what Rich did with Damon and Affleck's script. The parallels are remarkable. The film that results isn't.The premise is virtually identical: a dazzlingly talented kid from the wrong side of the tracks enters into a relationship with an older man, and both learn and grow from the experience. Now there's nothing wrong with telling this story again (Damon and Affleck were hardly the first to do so) as long as it's told well. But "Finding Forrester" isn't. It lacks a crucial element that makes "Good Will Hunting" so marvellous. That film is driven by a strong central conflict: Will does not want to spend time with Sean and resents the interference of him and other authority figures in his life. He only gradually comes around to admitting his core emotional problem and, in doing so, drags Sean and Gerald into the light with him. In "Finding Forrester", Jamal wants to spend time with Forrester and, after a few early quibbles, Forrester is only too delighted to help him. There is no conflict here. Jamal falls out of favor with his new teacher, certainly, and there is a minor rivalry with another student on the basketball team, but these are secondary to the central relationship of the film. That needs to be the emotional powerhouse it was in "Good Will Hunting", but it just isn't. The result is a story that drags and dawdles along to its pleasant and inspiring though gratingly obvious and inevitable conclusion: Jamal finds his voice, and Forrester regains his.To be fair, this predictability wasn't helped by a stirring preview which gave away every key story moment, save the redundant epilogue. Hollywood marketers are going to have to do better than this if they want to continue to rely on their most effective advertising medium: word of mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellence in every aspect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, it was not till I read up on this film here on IMDB, that i realized it was directed by the same person who directed Good Will Hunting. The name Gus Van Sant seemed familiar as the film began, and the plot of the mentor student relationship, did during the film remind me of Good Will Hunting, but this film was clearly not the same.On a personal level my thrill of watching Sean Connery doing something this deep and relevant, really touched me. His whole career he has stunned the audience with one brilliant performance after the other, but this performance made him from one of my all time favorites, to the favorite.Anyway back to business, this movie is just brilliant.The story about the young black kid living in a world where brilliance of the mind wouldn't keep you alive for ten minutes if you didn't know how to hide it, and earn the respect of your friend in some other way. In this case basketball. You cannot help connecting with this kid, Robert Brown makes this kid come so alive.The relationship between Forrester(Sean Connery) and Wallace(Robert Brown) just develops in breath taking steps, the acting is just brilliant.I won't get into too many details about the film itself, because this is something everyone should go watch, films just don't get much better than this. Great story, deep and touching. Great acting, very real and very touching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfairly criticised as just another "Good Will Hunting"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst "Good Will Hunting" dealt with a mentor helping a troubled prodigy, this film is really about the apparent mentor (Connery) being helped, to face his problems. If you think about this film, it's not neatly resolved at the end, since, to me anyway, it's not made clear why Forrester did not write another novel. Was it to protect his privacy, or had the death of his brother and the waste of life he'd dealt with in his novel been too much for him? Was there always a second novel, the one Jamal receives at the end?Apart from the scene where Forrester reads Jamal's work to the students and teachers, I think it's fair to say that there aren't any memorable scenes. What you have, is a story about the change in one man, back to how he used to be before tragedy intervenes, he finds himself again. When Jamal looks through his photo album, you are being shown how Forrester used to be, a sociable and amicable person, not the irritable hermit he is to begin with. It is also emphasised towards the end, when he returns to Scotland, back to how he was.Overall, a film I'd watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my friend and I wanted to see a movie a couple of months ago, we narrowed it down to two movies:'Finding Forester' or '13 Days'. We both decided on Finding Forester. When I walked in the movie theater, I thought Sean Connery was going to do one of his 'I'm tring to lose my Bond image' performances. Boy was I wrong!!!This movie was so good, I saw it two nights in a row! It is great! I just saw 'Good Will Hunting', it was good, but I thought Forester was better. If you liked GWH, you'll love this. Wonderful film! See it in theater while you still can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but falls prey to a bad script and unoriginality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Finding Forrester" has a lot of problems, yet I still recommend it. It's pretty much inevitable for me to compare it with "Good Will Hunting", so I might as well begin now. Frankly, "Good Will Hunting" is a much much better film. One way "Good Will Hunting" succeeds where "Forrester" fails is in showing Will's genius. We saw Will solve complex mathematical equations, tell off a Harvard student, and humble the best psychiatrists in the country. On the other hand, we see almost nothing of the sort with Jamal Wallace but only learn of it. We learn that he has "high test scores", but never are given any scores to know what so impresses everyone. Nor do we see any other real examples of his writing or genius, besides a pretty lame scene I'll go into detail with later.Another problem the film has is one that would inspire Sean Connery's character to immediately dismiss it as garbage. This is one of the most formulaic films I've ever seen. Everything you would expect to happen does, as we even have the privilege of seeing Jamal start a romantic relationship with a "perfect meet cute" Anna Paquin, have an encounter with the typical "ignorant white male", humiliate a ridiculously portrayed "villain" character, and have a gradual relationship with Sean Connery that is exactly reminescent of other student-teacher films. Another problem is that constant plot avenues are introduced but are never explored, like Jamal's rivalry with another African American basketball player, his old friends' reaction to his relationship with Forrester and place in the new school, and an ending that doesn't make as much sense as it should. Still, the acting is of quality, and the story the script has to tell is an intriguing one. Despite my grievances about the film, I enjoyed watching it, and felt for the characters.Despite my misgivings, I am pleased to give this film my stamp of approval. Perhaps that is because I only payed fifty cents to see it, but nevertheless, it was a well spent two hours.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would have been a fabulous movie if it could have been done with an original concept. Excellent portrayals by Connelly and Abraham. It had an equal hero and portrayal to Pacino's Col. Slade and a better protagonist in Abraham's Crawford. Brown's Wallace was at least as good, and actually somewhat better, as O'Donnell's Simms. There was the minor originality of the Salinger-like character of Forrester. It's the kind of feel good movie that I'd like to give a 10 to, but I dropped it to an 8 because I felt a movie with plagiarism as a focal point should not have "plagiarized" the Pacino film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "must-see" for Connery fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because of Sean Connery, and I was not disappointed. Connery's greatest attribute as an actor is magnetism. Whatever the role, Connery fills the screen like few others. He has a knack for magnifying the strengths of the characters he plays so that we, the audience, instantly believe in him, not as the everyday man, but as the hero that each of us aspires to be. The indestructible secret agent, James Bond, was not a challenge for Connery; perhaps that is one of the reasons why he eventually chose to abandon the role. William Forrester is a flawed hero. A gifted writer who recluses himself from the world, Forrester is a fearful man. James Bond would probably not have much patience with him. But with a pen in his hand or sitting behind a typewriter, Connery transforms Forrester into a man of strength and purpose. The wall into Forrester's little kingdom is literally broken down by an inner city youth named Jamal. Jamal is a young man of great contradictions. He has talents both for basketball and for writing; sort of like Magic Johnson and Ernest Hemingway together inside one body. His writing ability, however, is liable to be wasted but for his serendipitous introduction to Forrester and the unlikely friendship that blossoms thereafter. Newcomer Rob Brown, as Jamal, meshes with Connery on screen. He has his own particular magnetism which is never dwarfed by Connery's. His performance as Jamal is mostly understated, but never obsequious. He plays the young man as quiet, but confident, although with a certain degree of fatalism. After all, he's black and he lives in the Bronx projects. What chance does he really have to fulfill his enormous potential? "Finding Forrester" is a movie about soaring above the restrictions of one's environment. Director Gus Van Sant's opening montage introduces that theme, as we soar above the tenement buildings, streets and asphalt playgrounds of Jamal's neighborhood, getting a bird's-eye view of the surroundings; a favorite device of Alfred Hitchcock. Illustrative of the struggles facing both Jamal and Forrester, the camera comes to rest on Jamal, so closely that the pores on his skin can almost be counted, and at that moment we realize that we are no longer riding on the back of a bird, but on that of a fly. A second theme is that of the prodigy, a young person blessed with the skills of a virtuoso, previously addressed in "Searching For Bobby Fischer," and in "Amadeus," the deservedly acclaimed saga of the composer Mozart. F. Murray Abraham co-stars as Professor Crawford, who is very much a character styled after Salieri, the part for which Abraham won his Best Actor Oscar in "Amadeus." For Sean Connery fans this film is another in a long line of "must-sees." Aspiring writers may even find it inspiring.</fullReview>

Anyway, Sean Connery is great in this, too. I was never a Connery "fan" but his acting was tremendous. So many movies today are politically correct pap, so this one shows courage in (1) having men as its main characters, and (2) showing men who care for each other, and (3) allow these men to be depicted as having a relationship that is deep and warm without being sappy. Great job. After having wanted my money back from so many contemporary movies, I'll see this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Confession time. I haven't seen "Good Will Hunting" The good thing about this is it leaves me free to talk about "Finding Forester" based on it's own merits."Finding Forester" is about the challenges of discovering ones potential and the importance of making a difference. We have all had the one teacher in our lives that made a difference to us. Jamal Wallace had William Forrester.Jamal Wallace (played by Rob Brown) is an inner city kid who needs his to belong. His skills on the basketball court win him much-needed acceptance among his peers. Jamal has a private world his friends know nothing about, a world of literature and writing. A world he is afraid his friends will never accept him in.William Forrester (Sean Connery) wrote "The Great American Novel" in his youth. That was it. His claim to fame is one book, written 50 years before. He has become the mystery man of the neibourhood, isolated, watching the world through a pair of binoculars.In a sense they teach each other. Forrester teaches the passion and art of writing, and Wallace teaches the value of living life, instead of hiding from it, and the importance of integrity in friendship and in life.Yes, this is what can be called a "feel good" or a "formula" movie, but what the heck? It is a story about being true to ourselves, what's wrong with a little reminder from time to time?Go see it. Take a friend. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a movie with no blatant display of social stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so nice to walk into a movie and watch it for the story and not all the hoopla that accompanies many films today. Jamal Wallace, played by newcomer Robert Brown, is a 16 year old kid who keeps his intelligence to himself. He and his friends play basketball everyday with a curious stare from a nearby apartment building window. Jamal breaks into this stranger's apartment and accidentally leaves his back pack. The man returns the back pack and Jamal finds all of his personal writings have been corrected. His curiosity is piqued even more now. He begins an interesting friendship with Sean Connery's character, William Forrester. What I really like about this film is that there is no racial tendencies that scream out at you. For example, Jamal starts up a friendship with Claire (Anna Paquin) at a new school that he has received a scholarship to attend. Claire immediately takes to Jamal and eventually tells him of her feelings for him. There is no talk like, "We cannot date because I am black and you are white". Even in scenes where he is attending this prep school there is no act of racial behavior towards him because he is a black kid from the Bronx, but rather because he is a new kid on the block.It is a story that simply plays itself out for the sake of the story. It is not filled with racial out cries. These actors all do an outstanding job of sticking to the story. I believe that if you watch this you will really be surprised. It is a slow mover, but one well worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Finding Forrester" is the first film that director Gus Van Sant ("Good Will Hunting") directed since his questionable remake of Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho", a few years ago.The film is mostly about the strong relationship that is formed between Jamal Wallace (newcomer Rob Brown), a black teenager who lives in the Bronx with his mother and William Forrester (Sean Connery), a very reclusive author who has written only one novel.One of the movie's key moments that sets the stage for the rest of the film is when one of Jamal's teachers and a foe of Forrester's, Robert Crawford (F. Murray Abraham) doesn't buy the idea that someone from the Bronx like Jamal is a gifted in writing and he laters suspects Jamal of plagurizing.Throughout the film, there are a quite few humorous one-liners that are either said by Jamal or William that made me giggling. The two best one-liners that Forrester tells Jamal: " Women won't sleep with you if you write a bad book." and he refers to people like Crawford as "very effective or very dangerous." In one scene, Jamal tells William while they're watching "Jepaordy", "I'll take "Poor Assumptions for" '800'."Perhaps the best scene is when William shows up in Crawford's classroom to get Jamal off the hook. That scene quickly reminded me of the hearing in "Scent of a Woman" and unlike that scene, there's isn't any negative comments here. Forrester simply tells the truth.Brown, Connery, and Abraham give very good performances and so are the supporting performances by Anna Paquin, who is a friend of Jamal's and rapper Busta Rhymes, who portrays Jamal's older brother, Terrell. Also, Matt Damon, who starred in Van Sant's "Good Will Hunting", appears here in a small role at the end. I'd be stunned if Connery or Brown don't get an Oscar nomination for their performances here. Screenwriter Mike Rich creates a terrific story for the film and it takes the time to make the viewer understand the movie's message.In conclusion, "Finding Forrester" is a sweet and heartwarming tale of two men, young and old, form a strong friendship. It's like an urbanized version of "Stand by Me" in a way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting 2.0</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding Forrester (Gus van Sant, 2000)Gus Van Sant hit the big time in a big way thirteen years ago with Drugstore Cowboy, and promptly went to hell in a handbasket. I mean, come on, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues? Oh, please. He came back to some prominence with Good Will Hunting, then immediately shot himself in the foot with a frame-by-frame remake of Psycho. It took him two years to recover from that blunder, and when he came back, he retreated to better-known ground. Unfortunately, it wasn't the better-known ground of Drugstore Cowboy, one of the hundred best films ever made; it was Good Will Hunting over again.That's not to say that Finding Forrester isn't a good film. Excellent performances abound in this movie, especially by newcomer Rob Brown, who certainly didn't have to travel far for his first acting job (the Brooklyn-born Brown plays a Bronx native). The boy is _good_. You'll be seeing more of him. F. Murray Abraham, as has been suggested, does reprise his role as Salieri, but hey, if you've got an approriate shtick, use it. Busta Rhymes turns in his second fantastic performance of the year (he was also Sam Jackson's on-again off-again sidekick in Shaft) as Brown's brother Terrell, a wannabe rapper who supervises parking attendants at Yankee Stadium.That leaves us with Sean Connery and the oft-repeated critical remark that this is his best performance ever. Not even close. But then, in the past ten years, Connery really has done some godawful movies (First Knight, anyone? How 'bout The Avengers? Boo-yaa!), and some critics with short memories may have forgotten there was anything at all between Bond and Dragonheart. (For the record, I think Connery's finest performance was in Outland. But that's just me.)Yes, it's true that van Sant and screenwriter Mike Rich (this is his debut, as well) went to the well of Affleck and Damon many, many times in this film. Scenes lifted straight from Good Will Hunting pop up with disturbing regularity here. But Connery is more suited to the mentor role than Williams was, and the chemistry between Brown and Connery works better. Think of Finding Forrester as Good Will Hunting 2.0 if you must, but remember that the next release of the software is almost always an improvement over the original. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. That was the most cliched, formulaic movie I've ever seen. Bad teacher at good school gives new kid from inner city hard time because he's an athlete and black and he proves everyone wrong and I'm not spoiling anything because you could see all these moments coming from a million miles away. It's too bad the premise of the reclusive author helping the talented kid couldn't have been told in a not so obvious fashion. Still, it's fairly enjoyable. I'm glad I saw it. It's an intelligent movie and Sean Connery is as always cool, the music was amazing, and the New York locale great. It is kind of odd watching a film (a visual medium) all about writing (non-visual).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I,like many, went into this film thinking it was going to be another "Good Will Hunting". After all, the same man directed it, and it seemed it had the same premise. In a way, it did. But, that is were the similarities end and the differences begin.I was genuinely impressed,first off by the performance of Robert Brown in this film. For a first timer, he's got something good in there. Perhaps what thrilled me the most,though, was the fact Sean Connery was in this film. Besides being a naturally cool guy, Connery can ACT. He did a SUPERB job with this character, William Forrester.Kudos to Gus Van Sant, Sean, Robert, F. Murray and the rest of the "Forrester" crew. This is definitely the FILM OF THE YEAR.It shines in the quality of storyline, character structure and overall mood.Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.</fullReview>

It is a tough world out there and things are not always as rosey as they seem in this movie but there is a hint of the dark side.

		<shortDescription>Excellent writing and well-handled social commentary; what more could you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who enjoys writing (and, judging by the other posts, as someone who hasn't seen "Good Will Hunting" yet), I thought this was one of the better movies I've seen recently. Robert Brown as Jamal and Sean Connery as Forrester were excellent in this film. At points, I just wanted to boo Mr. Crawford, the English teacher, because I knew one or two teachers like that in my private school days, so, although F. Murray Abraham kind of played the stock "jerk teacher" role, I still thought he gave a great performance. The story was absolutely beautiful, and it was wonderfully told. (I could tell that the writers of this film shared Jamal's love for writing!)Most importantly, though, I thought this movie dealt with social topics in a very good way. When Jamal gave his first line that about being denied something because he was black, I was afraid that it would only deal with him being an angry black kid stuck with white people, which could conceivably have grown into 2 hours of pure bitterness from our protagonist. The movie, however, rose beyond that level and showed how he overcame the stereotypes and gradually began to earn some respect. How he did it, I won't say, because I don't want to spoil the movie, but it was dealt with well.Overall, "Finding Forrester" was a great movie and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was totally disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say that I am a smart viewer and I don't appreciate the same plot being shown to me twice! I mean, come on, did this really have to be GOOD WILL HUNTING all over again?Don't get me wrong, I loved Jamal Wallace. I think he did an awesome job, especially for a newcomer, but I was still disappointed by this film. Spoiler AlertI was disappointed because Gus Van Sant was lazy and recreated the same relationship/plot but left out all the good things...ie Matt Damon gets good loving and his twin, Jamal Wallace gets none! He doesn't get the girl. Why didn't they just pair him with a token black girl if they weren't willing to see him hook up with a white girl? I mean, why have Anna Paquin in it at all if she wasn't going to cross the racial line and date him and vice versa?I just think that it was unnecessary to touch on some romance when it didn't bloom at all. Why did Van Sant even bother?The other thing that upset me was that the Brooklyn/Bronx (they mentioned both in the movie, couldn't follow where it actually took place) setting was not believable. The street language that the black people used was so CORNY! I live in the East Coast and work with black kids in Philly and they don't say stuff like that. And I didn't really need to hear Sean Connery say, "You are the man now, Dog." Like that, in proper English. That was unnecessary.I did like that they portrayed two positive black females, his mother and his teacher, and even his older brother, played by Busta Rhymes, was good.But the thing is, I wasn't surprised in this movie. I knew the ending. And I also knew that the black man wasn't going to get some loving.I just don't think it was worth paying full price for it. And I wish Van Sant would see his viewers as intelligent. I hope next time he goes out of his way to direct something he HASN'T already done before.Oh, and for the record, I felt like throwing up when Matt Damon appeared in the movie! Now that was TRULY corny.</fullReview>

If you thought Good Will Hunting was a little over the top, then you will like Finding Forrester. Even if you didn't think Good Will Hunting was over the top, you will like Finding Forrester. The on screen presence of Sean Connery and the fairly "held back" nature of the film works even more perfectly than the director himself could have hoped for. Connery's line "You could learn something by holding back a little" is the perfect way to some up the film. Everything in this movie is well done, from the acting to the little instrumental strummings of Somewhere Over the Rainbow, this movie is truly fabulous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting in the Bronx</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, with the addition of this film to his Good Will Hunting credentials it's now officially a (winning?) movie-making formula for Gus Van Sant:1.) Take a down and out kid with a life somewhat destitute, yet full of the love of a strong family and circle of friends, including thug-like buddies with hearts of gold,2.) accidentally discover he's a genius, 3.) put him in a good school were he doesn't fit in and few accept him,4.) where he meets a wispy, brainy and free-spirited love interest that is his complete opposite, 5.) give him an awkward, once-great mentor with a secret past he doesn't want to reveal played by a big name actor,6.) have the two bring out the best in each other, along with some tears,7.) change the world, 8.) go on to bigger and better,9.) win a few Oscars.So, now that I got that out of the way... While this was formulaic and even somewhat predictable, it was actually well worth seeing! Connery is, no kidding, at his best here, as a likeable recluse with whom you can sympathize. He brought my review from a 7 to an 8. Although lacking in range, Robby Brown holds his own in this piece, as is no doubt on to a great career in film.I'll leave it at that. My recommendation: go see it. Although there will be times you know what's coming, it remains an uplifting story with great characters, solid acting, and a good script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some minor potholes but overall, a wonderful ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title indicates, Finding Forrester is a movie about discovery, in its many forms. Jamal (played with understated grace by Robert Brown) is a busy young man living in the Bronx. He's busy wowing his friends and schoolmates with his basketball abilities. He's busy scribbling down notes in his small notebook late into the night. He's also busy trying to hide the fact that his bedside table holds reading material many adults, much less teens, have never read by authors like Henry James and Hemmingway. Amid all this activity, he's also trying to figure out who he is.Jamal stumbles into a grudging friendship with William Forrester (Sean Connery) who's spent the last several decades hiding behind the curtains of his shabby apartment window. Once an acclaimed author, Forrester shuns the world. But upon meeting Jamal, the crotchety Scotsman begins to think perhaps there are a few things he can teach this budding writer...and learns a bit about himself in the process.Others have pointed out some of the subplots that are left hanging and it's true. The Anna Paquin friendship and her father, the school president (Michael Nouri, whose role is more of a caricature than the other characters). The baskteball team issues. Jamal's "in the hood" friends. But honestly, the flowering friendship between Jamal and Forrester outshines those details.I think the reason I liked this movie is that the relationship between Jamal and Forrester is subtle. You're not going to see Jamal hugging Forrester at the end of the movie, blubbering about what a great guy he is. And Forrester doesn't give Jamal any more credit than he's due. Yet they acknowledge quietly that each has learned from the other and grown a little in the process. Van Sant could have easily slipped into some cliched areas, like having the basketball team members from Jamal's exclusive school take on Jamal's Bronx buddies in a fight. Or had Jamal's brother end up overdosing on drugs to add some tear jerking moments. They could have added some gratuitous sex scenes. But they didn't. And I was glad.The movie lasts well over two hours but you never feel it. Look for Robert Brown in the future. He's got definite promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery seemed to me the perfect choice for a crusty old author before I saw this film. His beard, those owlish eyes behind wire rims. It worked for me on that imagined superficial level. I was pleasantly embarrassed at my own cliche assumptions when I actually saw the film today. I was also glad I had just caught Van Sant's "Birdy" on cable recently. What this film shares with "Birdy", "Good Will Hunting", and "My Private Idaho" is a core theme about male relationships and the necessity for intimacy of various kinds for real learning or growth to occur. The resulting mutual benefits of such growth are made wonderfully concrete, and perhaps somewhat cliche. Yet, the portrayal of the struggle without getting bogged down in schmaltz or stereotypes is the art of this film, in my opinion. Schmaltz and stereotypes abound, but they are not distracting, if you are really paying attention. I cried several times. I laughed. I was entertained visually. I even found myself humming an old song used in the movie, as I walked down the steps to the subway afterwards. A secondary joy for me was the accurate, in my experience, presentation of some of the basics of being a writer and of the art/skill/craft of Writing. Finally, as a writer of middle age, who lives in an ethnically diverse and relatively poor neighborhood close to where I grew up, I fully appreciated "The Window" characterization of Forrester in the beginning of the film, as seen from the playground. Go see this film! I'm headed back to my window.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting" was a handsome, well-textured film that mostly steered clear of shameless heartstring-wringing; "Finding Forrester," tried to be like "Good Will Hunting," but was full of the shameless heartstring-wringing. Does this make this a bad movie? NO.Does this make Gus Van Sant a bad director? May-be. In this movie he's trying to recreate the movie that made him famous. Why not, his version of Hitchcock's Psycho got less then great reviews. So when in doubt, go back to what the people liked, please the audience... it is entertainment afterall. It is very hard to make a movie about a writer as writing is very un-cinimatic. Gus did make a good movie, the only question is, can he improve in his future efforts.Rob Brown &amp; Sean Connery did a great job, and there is talk of oscar for Sean. He had a great performance, and with the movies out this year, you never know... he may even take home the statue.This review may give the impression that I disliked the film, however that is far from the case.

		<shortDescription>Good messages, great acting, some inexplicable holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding Forrester is my kind of movie. It is about something without hitting you over the head with the message. It has strong acting performances, especially from Sean Connery. And it doesn't rely on CGI effects or big explosions to keep things interesting.That being said, it was about 15 minutes too long, and bogged down from time to time. It also was probably too easy on some sticky questions, such as why Jamal's friends from the hood were, while not supportive, also not angrily fighting the change in Jamal's life and the choices he made that no longer included them (especially considering the fact that the movie made a point of Jamal's effort to do just enough to not be singled out as "smart" in his public school; he must have been hiding that for a reason). In fact, Jamal's family and friends (old and new) were all pretty much ideal people in their reactions. Even the one guy who had issues with Jamal, a rich kid on the basketball team, never actually caused any problem other than some pushing and shoving in practice. It would be great if everyone were as understanding as the people Jamal knew. I have a feeling that is rare.But to me the biggest, most annoying failure of the movie was the climactic scene where an essay is being read by Forrester. The essay is supposed to be so great, so touching, that Jamal is finally recognized for the talent he is. But the movie chooses to drown out the essay's words with sappy, rising music, and then lowers the music to bring in the last sentence. How in the world can a movie about writing, for pete's sake, refuse to tell the audience what was written that was THE key to the film's plot?!! I know movies are about visuals and emotions, but if you're going to have the guts to do a good movie about writing and people, at least share with us the focal point!Still, Finding Forrester was a gem. We gave it an 8, even if we will never know what was so great about Jamal's essay that the entire school suddenly forgave him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully, Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about Gus Van Sant's "Finding Forrester isn't that it's a good film-it is-but that it could have been so bad. The plot covers much as the same ground as Van Sant's hit, "Good Will Hunting," but it looks and feels like a totally different film. It stars Sean Connery in the type of role that makes audiences turn to each other and say, "Isn't it great that he's transcended James Bond to become such a great character actor?" But the director allows Connery's character to be vulnerable and a bit bizarre. Van Sant puts an unknown, Rob Brown, in the key role across from Connery, and coaxes a wonderful performance out of a non-actor. And it ends with a scene reminiscent of "Scent of a Woman," but one not nearly as over the top.What makes "Finding Forrester" work is Van Sant's visual style. You realize 15 minutes into the film that the director has told you everything you need to know about the world of its main character, Jamal Wallace, played by Brown. The only problem with the film is casting F. Murray Abraham as Jamal's adversary, an English professor at a private school that Jamal attends. Abraham plays the character so much to type that we can't find an ounce of humanity in him. Better that Van Sant would have cast someone against type, or allowed Abraham to become multi-dimensional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A warm heartwarming film we all wish could happen -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful inspirational move that I think the audience wishes could actually happen. Though that might be wishful thinking, the movie is extremely entertaining and compassionate.The story involves a young 16 year black youth from the Bronx, a talented basketball player with exceptional intellectual ability. Robert Brown, who plays the character Jamal Wallace, a sixteen year from Brooklyn at the time of shooting, (who had no previous acting experience and hoped to be hired as an extra in order to pay for a cell phone bill) has a gift and love for literature. He is befriended by William Forrester, played by Sean Connery, a reclusive writer who had won a Pulitzer prize for his writing abilities but who has remained unpublished for years because of his own emotional problems.Wallace, who plays hoops with his friends on the street below Forrester's apartment often see the curtains of Forrester's window move in a ghost like manner. On a dare Wallace climbs up to he apartment at night and invades the sanctity of Forrester's book strewn abode and is discovered. From that unlikely beginning a mentor student relationship begins between the old troubled writer and the aspiring basketball star.The plot has some minor basketball scenes, a budding friendship between the white daughter of the headmaster, and a bitter literature instructor at a prestigious private high school in Manhattan. The school, while recognizing Wallace's intellect really recruited him to really to play basketball. Not an uncommon occurrence in this country.The relationship between Connery and Brown is heartwarming. Both characters actually rescue each other before the movie film is over. The movie portrays the Bronx and Wallace's inner city friends in somewhat of an idyllic sense - but that is OK, it is the way we would hope the characters could actually coexist and live in the troubled inner cities of this country.The movie is a must for those wishing for miracles to happen. Brown does a great job of playing a reticent but conscientious ghetto teen that has values. Connery is outstanding and extremely credible as a disgruntled old academic. A must see.</fullReview>

But Rob Brown was for me a delightful discovery, showing such poise, such a strong, quiet center in his role as Jamal.I was struck by the great division of opinion among critics, and for many an astonishing inability to grapple with the idea of a young black man being intellectually brilliant.I saw the film, and then saw it again with my son.

		<fullReview>This is a delightful movie. Sean Connery is the quintessential choice for a "writer". The new actor playing Jamal Wallace is fantastic opposite him, very well and appropriately understated, with simple eyebrow lifts or glances saying more than some actors can say with a hundred lines.The setting is well created, the actors fit into the setting perfectly. It is believable, and full of thoughtful moments. Little things, like Sean Connery pushing a book back all the way on the shelf, take on significance and meaning as the story unfolds.It shows the conflict between two cultures living side by side, joined by one man who shuns both. It tells the story of a maturing teenager making life-decisions, and choosing wisely.But... but something is missing. It's a great story, with no real meaning. I know, many will say it describes the culture conflicts, the adolescent experience, the choice between family and friends, etc.But honestly, what does it say? Nothing, really. The acting takes precedence over the purpose. The story is meaningless in the end.Why did he go to the two-comma school? He would have gotten a scholarship by playing for either school's team. He didn't get a better education at the new school, the professor didn't teach him a thing. He learned his lessons from "forrester", which is the story. So he learned to write better. Okay, so??? He learned the white girl has a dad who won't let him get closer. No brainer there, unfortunately. Typical stuff in stupid people. Nothing new there. He lost his friends, but they welcomed him back. Still no depth.It's a great movie, but if you want to learn something, to be uplifted, I would recommend a good book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you triumph in a world of low expectations? Jamal Wallace is blessed with grace of mind (writing) and grace of body (basketball). His academic brilliance is an impediment in his Bronx home neighborhood and his race and background are an impediment at the superior private school that has sought him out. New Yorker Robert Brown turns in a stunning first performance alongside legendaries Sean Connery, F. Murray Abraham, and Anna Pacquin. I hope to see a lot more of Robert Brown -- he's good. Anna Pacquin likewise provides a far more substantive and worthy performance than some of her recent works. Kudos as well for cinematographer Harris Savides for a beautiful, rich presentation.

		<shortDescription>Busta Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Reading, Writing, Teaching, Basketball, Baseball, and Class Differences all in one movie. A nice story with no sex scenes and very little profanity (relatively speaking). Gus Van Sant directs with a very heavy hand rather than just letting the story speak. Newbie Rob Brown shows some promise as Jamal, a ghetto basketball player who has real ability as a writer. Sean Connery stars as William Forrester, a reclusive, once-great author, who becomes Jamal's mentor. Predictably, Jamal opens the door to the real world for Forrester. Some great moments in this one including Connery's statement that a shunned writer can become a "dangerous" teacher. F. Murray Abraham, one of the hardest working character actors around, recreates his Salieri role from "Amadeus" as the not quite good enough evil authority figure. Anna Paquin (really grown up nicely since 1993's "The Piano") has the minor role of rich white girl interested in poor, smart black boy. This theme is not really explored, although the potential with her rich, powerful Dad could have provided new insight. As a matter of fact, this is definitely a story of the two leads. No other character is really developed, including F. Murray Abraham's. I did enjoy the tribute the Connery on Jamal's basketball "The Rock". Duality provided a nice touch. My tidbit on this one is to watch for Joey Buttafuoco (yes, from the Amy Fisher mess) in a brief role as a night guard. Also, check out the amazing instumental "Over The Rainbow" performed by Bill Friesell (not the butchered vocal version at the end). I'd like to see Busta Ryhmes in more screen roles, the camera loves him - and he appears to reciprocate! Overall nice movie with interesting script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant has a knack for taking an average story and making it interesting to look at. At least with "Good Will Hunting" he had a great script to work with. The story carried that film, not the direction. "Forrester" has good ideas but often tries to cover more territory than it is able to.The story is of a gifted student, Jamal, attending a Bronx high school. Jamal (Robert Brown) fears alienation from his friends if he reveals his love for writing and reading. As far as they're concerned, all he wants to do is play basketball. He bites his tongue in class when asked answers he knows the answer to--and he knows the answer to almost everything. His gift is exposed when he scores surprisingly high on the state standardized exam. Not even his own mother knows how brilliant he is. A nationally-renowned private school in Manhattan comes calling, offering him the opportunity to play basketball. But no one seems interested in his academic performance as long as the basketball team wins.Jamal meets William Forrester, a Pulitzer prize-winning author for his first and only novel, who is living in seclusion in the same neighborhood as he and his mother. Forrester will help Jamal develop his writing in exchange for a vow of secrecy. Forrester lives under an assumed name, not wanting anyone to know where he is. He sits and writes all day, never leaving his apartment. No one reads his work, he reasons, because he doesn?t need someone else to tell him what his writing means. He hides behind this so he can continue living in self-pity for things that happened in his past and things happening in the present. His tutelage of Jamal forms an unlikely bond of friendship between the two. Forrester finds the courage to finally share his pain with another person, which leads to the end of his seclusion.Jamal and Forrester's friendship is the focus of the story. Writer Mike Rich adds other subplots that are supposed to support this main story, but end up getting in the way. A subplot involving Jamal and the only other black player on his school?s basketball team is explored, but never followed through with. Another is an attempt at a love story. The first person Jamal meets at his new school is Claire (Anna Paquin), the daughter of the school's headmaster. The issue is supposed to be the he's black and she?s white but it?s just another subplot that's left hanging.The story also relies coincidences that are difficult to accept. For instance, Jamal's writing professor, Dr. Crawford (F. Murray Abraham), just happens to assign Forrester's book to his students at the same time Jamal is discovering who his mysterious tutor really is. The two events, at this point, are completely unrelated. We are soon shown that the book is enormously popular, so there's some likelihood a professor would assign it to a first-year composition class. It's the timing that makes it so hard to believe.Connery and Brown's performances are what make the whole film worthwhile. If newcomer Brown was intimidated at all by the legend, it doesn?t show. If anything, there's the sense that Connery respected his co-star enough to not hold anything back, making Brown?s performance that much stronger.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Finding Forrester</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has limited distribution, so you may have to seek it out. It's well worth your effort to do so. Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown), a young black man from the Bronx with an IQ off the charts isn't living up to his potential until he meets up with reclusive writer William Forrester (Connery) who becomes his mentor. Their friendship creates synergy -- with each character achieving more than they would have individually. Excellent performances by Brown, Connery (in spite of his garbled brogue) and F. Murray Abraham as the professor who clings to outdated stereotypes. I came away thinking that humans are simply "packets of potential," who realize their greatest rewards when they synergize each other. Oddly, I didn't make a strong connection to "Good Will Hunting," until the very end when Matt Damon made a brief appearance.</fullReview>

His character is supposed to be deep, but a lot of what he says is just incoherent.And the black guy is not believable at all. He does nothing that suggests intelligence except know some arbitrary trivia. There seems to be a misconception in Hollywood that smart people think and talk like everyone else, except they happen to know some wildly arcane trivia.Where is the great writing? After all the buildup and proclamations that the kid's writing is brilliant, I expected some damn good writing. But his entry was no better than the other kids, even though Connery was reading it. Much like Mr Holland's Opus, this was a film that was ostensibly about a great artist that had no great art in it.Oh well. The Matt Damon cameo was neat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just about the best movie ever made involving friendships.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people will tend to discourage you from seeing this movie, because they think it is predictable and unoriginal. A movie about friendship yes, has been done before surprise surprise, but this movie gives not just a new look at friendship, but the strongest form of friendship.Everyone has friends, but usually it is because of convenience. Friendships are not normally contrived from a respect for each other despite differences in age, race, and economical status. With so many obstacles, and lessons learned it is a struggle in the least. Jamal is forced to endure many lessons by Forrester. Although Forrester teaches him many things, and probably shaped his life for his future to come, it is Forrester the most noble of men, who learns the biggest lesson. With Sean Connery looking so wise, along with his perfected acting ability, we see him as noble and wise in everything he does. When we see him display his weaknesses, and his mean side, we know that he is in true fashion a hero, and underneath his sometimes cold exterior he has a heart of gold.I saw the Golden Globe nominations, and I was upset to see that three of the catagories were missing Finding Forrester. Sean Connery gave the most awe inspiring performance that I have ever seen. He may not receive so much credit for it now, but in 10 years people will look back to it, and wish that they had begged him to take the Oscar. I hope that the Oscars look more kindly to this movie in the Best Picture, Best Director(fantastic by Van Sant) and of course the Oscar for Mr. Connery, who after this movie should have proved that he truly is the most inspiring and in turn the greatest actor of all time.</fullReview>

For instance, in a very important scene, the audience gets a "music-over" instead of the author's words.Also, while providing a pro-social message, the movie over-simplifies racial and socioeconomic factors, and comes across as cliched in this regard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*ONE SPOILER TOWARDS THE END*Most of the user comments already said what I am going to say. This movie is filled with contrite and cliche verbage. The comedic one liners are the only thing that keeps this movie from totally dying.The acting was fine, but there was so much shmaltz and cheddar cheese in between the nice moments. And of course it was predictable.I can forgive predictability if they come up with SOME originality. But I quit being on the writer's side halfway threw it, that I just got mad. My eyes hurt from rolling them so much.There were almost no obstacles to overcome. Drama is conflict, yet there was hardly any. This wonder kid's life just seemed to fall magically into place. I'm not saying that doesn't happen in real life, it can, it just makes for a boring movie. Not every idea or experience in life should be attempted to the big screen.I thought the relationship between Sean Connery and the kid was only believable when they were being funny. That what people do when they don't know eachother that well. The nervous tension makes sense. What didn't make sense is how quickly Sean Connery's character seemed to open up and trust this stranger who broke into his apartment. Like I said...NO OBSTACLES.In fact, this movie felt so silly at one point, the audience laughed because MATT DAMON shows up and plays a lawyer. Everyone thought the director was mocking Good Will Hunting. Then it turns out to be a serious scene. Oops.Too bad. But not that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a touching story, directed and acted quite well. I live in New York and this movie made me see that a river separates two totally different cultures. In the Bronx, the buildings are very run down. The attendants of the schools are African-American. When Jamaal, the main character, is accepted into a prep school in Manhattan, he is the only black person to attend. Sean Connery beautifully acts his role as a reclusive writer who, by chance, reads Jamaal's writing when Jamaal's friends dare him to break into his house and accidentally leaves his notebooks in his house. Jamaal goes back to his house and, at school, finds out that the writer is William Forrester, an author who wrote what many think was the best book of the 20th century. I don't want to give it all away so you will have to see it for yourself. Even if the closest theater is an hour away, take the trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Readers wondering what happened to the likes of J D Salinger and Harper Lee will gain insight from this film. Writers will learn something about `heart,' and how it fits into their composition process. And New Yorkers discover they can now lean their vintage Schwinn bicycle against an iron fence beside a city prep school unlocked, and it'll still be there an hour or so later. This is a wonderful this film I will see more than once.The movie is aptly named. It is about discovery on many levels. Friendship. Digging to find what's important in this life. Finding and sculpting talent. Gus Van Sant brings us a movie as good as Good Will Hunting, swapping in Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown's debut role) as a brilliant scholar confined by the circumstances into which he was born in the Bronx, NY. The scarce, severely introverted, famous author, William Forrester (Sean Connery), crosses paths with Jamal during a neighborhood prank (aka B&amp;E in some neighborhoods). A friendship kindles through unusual yet plausible circumstances. It transported me to a place I love to be.This is 2 hrs+ of perfect entertainment. I could fantasize, laugh, cry and learn as I wandered down Mike Rich's script revealing the conflict between human emotion and genius intellect. Life can get complex. A perfect friendship sparked by a common passion for writing is born for Jamal and William. It simplifies the complexity and arcs both characters to a better place. Sean remounts his `safe and sound Schwinn' to head back into the mainstream at film's end. And he leaves Jamal the perfect gift as the movie closes, remaining a true and balanced work from first frame (the clapboard!) to the last. I loved it.Remember Joey Buttafuoco - the body shop owner who had an affair with 16 year-old Amy Fisher? He has a brief role in a Yankee Stadium scene. Gus uses a long lens against a shadowy security guard character (the lighting, not to typecast Joey) here, but JB does indeed speak and I found it to be an exciting 9 seconds curiosity piece. Just a note. I don't think Harrison Ford's career is threatened . . . yet.See Finding Forrester. 8 out of 10 is my rating. It is in a class with Almost Famous, Good Will Hunting and American Beauty. Looking for explosions, gratuitous thrills and meaningless action, see Vertical Limit instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Might be some spoilers...A good premise, some solid acting by Sean Connery and Robert Brown in his debut. But the pacing is poor at some points, and some of the supporting characters are so contrived and one-sided that they really hurt the movie. Professor Crawford? Not a complex bone in his body.Claire Spence's father? A racist businessman who lives for high school basketball and appreciates well-written prose? He simply didn't ring true.And can any of us imagine our high school English classes sitting still for every member to read a 20-page assignment? (Note that I used a conjunction at the start of that sentence to emphasize it. You'll get it if you see the movie.)And there are too many loose ends. I wanted Forrester to have a more interesting story -- why was he hiding inside his apartment all those years? Was he agrophobic or just depressed? Who is that guy in the BMW? I know he delivers stuff to Forrester, but why? I thought something was going to happen with Busta Rhymes, but nothing ever did.Frankly my guess is that the problem was in editing, not in writing or directing, given that we've all seen what Gus Van Sant can do elsewhere. I liked the opening. There were a few good lines. But if it were a book, I'd have read as far as page 40 (and no further).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Famous Wonder Boy Forrester Writes With Familiar Quills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few minutes into Finding Forrester, a young writer opens a book he's been writing only to find someone has read it and has even made some suggestions. At one point, he comes across a message that reads, `Where are you taking me?' I love when I'm watching a movie or reading a book and that particular question comes up. It rarely happens these days. Usually, I'm saying, `I know where you're taking me. Now, let's hurry up and get there.' Finding Forrester takes both phrases and combines them into one sentiment: `I know where you're taking me, but I'm with you anyway, because I like the moment.'Gus Van Sant's latest drama concerns a young writer, Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown), who lives in the Bronx hood. The film opens almost like a ghost story would, where four friends dare one another to go and visit the neighborhood creepy-old-man's house. Jamal, curious as all great writers must be, takes the dare, walks into the old man's apartment, has quite a scare and accidentally leaves his backpack behind.He returns the following day to retrieve it. Through the little peakhole in the door, the old man (Sean Connery) orders him to never return again. Jamal goes home to find the old man has read his words. Intrigued, Jamal returns to get more feedback from this ragged old hermit. The old man, named William Forrester, suggests he write a 5,000 word essay on why he should stay the hell away from the apartment. Not one to turn down a challenge, Jamal returns the next day with the essay, and there begins an unlikely friendship between the two faster than you can say Scent Of A Woman.Jamal also deals with problems at school. His teachers and faculty see him as an enigma. He tests well, but his grades have been low. He plays basketball with the grace and wisdom of Michael Jordan, and he writes like Hemingway, but he also has limited income and little opportunity. An upscale Academy wants him to join their school, all expenses paid. There, he befriends a young girl, Claire (Anna Paquin), and catches the skeptical eye of Professor Crawford (F. Murray Abraham).Meanwhile, Jamal receives writing lessons of life from Forrester, who has only written one book, but it has been studied in high school and colleges for the past 50 years. In turn for the writing lessons, Jamal teaches Forrester to step out of the apartment once in a while for some fresh air. Forrester insists early on, `What we write in this house, stays in this house.' At this point, you know where the film will take you.The magic of Finding Forrester comes from the chemistry of the two leads. Films such as this usually do sink or swim on chemistry, and here it basically takes center stage with its otherwise thin storyline. Forrester, in his best role since The Rock (of which it may seem eerily similar), does not upstage newcomer Rob Brown. The two give each other equal time on the playing field, each one winning their share of arguments and one-two punches. They argue the use of `and' and `but' in literature. They compete against each other while watching Jeopardy. Eventually, of course, a bond breaks, and Jamal `is sick of all these lessons,' and he leaves.We wait for one scene throughout Finding Forrester where Professor Crawford and Forrester meet in a classroom. We know from the get-go that it will happen, and we feel certain that it will be near the end, much like Al Pacino's showboating in the aforementioned Scent Of A Woman. Unfortunately, Van Sant cuts the scene short by doing a montage of Forrester reading Jamal's words and the students looking inspired. I would rather have actually heard the words, so as to know why the kids felt inspired and why Jamal received so much attention for writing those words in the first place. Like this years Wonder Boys, Forrester would rather you concentrate on the writers rather than their prose.The end also feels a bit tacked-on (I won't give it away), and Van Sant's use of the True Romance-sound-alike score sounds as though the audio recorders forgot to remove the temp track. Still, while Finding Forrester does take us on a familiar journey, it does not sell its audience short. The movie has sharp dialogue, smart characters and a desire to teach a few things about words and language.But like all writers, great or otherwise, it could still use a few lessons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>would appeal to those who liked "Good Will Hunting"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Finding Forrester" is a bit reminiscent of "Good Will Hunting," a bit reminiscent of "Dead Poets Society," and has a whiff of "Rocky" about it to boot. It is an enjoyable movie with natural, unaffected performances, and the relationship between the two main characters, which is the heart of the movie, is well-drawn. On the other hand, it is rather predictable throughout, and the script seems to shrink back from dealing with substantial issues that seem almost to stare one in the face. There was surprisingly little conflict or culture-shock, for example, when Jamal is suddenly sent to a wealthy, all-white private school. He has surprisingly little trouble fitting in or adjusting. F. Murray Abraham's character, a teacher, the only source of conflict, may have been motivated by hidden racism, but that is never brought out or dealt with. The movie has potential to have been so much more. Nevertheless, "Finding Forrester" is an enjoyable movie, recommended to those who like literate and character-based stories, and, especially given the weak movie field this past year, I think it has a realistic shot at some Oscar(r) nominations.</fullReview>

It sets up great relationships and characters, and the potential to tackle some serious issues; it then proceeds to squash them into two-dimensional, easy-to-digest representations and clumsy, contrived plot twists. By the end, the movie wants to sweep you off your feet, without quite earning it. For a story that's supposed to be about great writers, I think the writer of this film wasn't up to the task. Which is sad, because I think it could have been a great film.Despite all that, it's still going to have a broad appeal.

If you are a suffering poet type who doesn't mind sitting through two and a half hours of nonsensical mediocrity in order to feel good about yourself, then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie - Short of Anything Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen Good Will Hunting, which was directed by Gus Van Sant, the same director as from Finding Forrester, the you will definitely feel a small bit of deja vu at certain points of this movie. However, contrary to what many people say, Finding Forrester is not so similar to Good Will Hunting that you can't enjoy it, and I still recommend that everyone watches this movie at least once in their lifetime.Finding Forrester is about a 16 year-old boy named Jamal Wallace, played by Rob Brown, who happens to be both a brilliant student, as well as an excellent athlete. He gets offered a full ride to a private high school because of his basketball abilities, but before he even attends a class, he discovers the man that will help improve his writing skills the most. Jamal breaks into the apartment of a reclusive man on a dare from his friends, where he accidentally leaves his backpack with all of his writings. Jamal later finds all of his writings to be corrected. Curious, Jamal returns back to the man's apartment and eventually bonds with the man to the point where Jamal finds out the man helping with his writing was actually the Pulitzer Prize winning author, William Forrester, played by Sean Connery. Over the course of the story they help each other overcome their problems, and while the movie is predictable at times, it has the great message that you can find the best of friendships in the most unlikely places if you just look for them. Finding Forrester was a very well put together film, and while it fell far short of anything extraordinary, it still was a very good movie and I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really a wonderful Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't recall a drama I enjoyed as much as this movie since I watched Mr. Holland's Opus. A story of boy destined for greatness who befriends a great man and how these two impact each other's lives. The young protagonist plays basketball to make a connection with his peers and find acceptance but when by himself reads words of great authors and writes as an intellectual outlet. This story that encourages the viewer to not settle on the easy decision but to make the decision they feel right about. It balances deep symbolism with a story that can be enjoyed and watched just for the story making it fitting for casual movie watchers and serious movie watchers alike. This movie will likely leave you with thoughts about your own life after viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Connery Is The Only Reason to find "Forrester"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery gives a crusty but charismatic performance as a reclusive novelist with a tragic secret who mentors an African-American teenager in "My Own Private Idaho" director Gus Van Sant's "Finding Forrester," co-starring F. Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin, Busta Rhymes and newcomer Rob Brown. After helming the ambitious but abysmal remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror chiller "Psycho," Van Sant apparently wanted to remake his own classics rather than those of others. Sadly, lightning doesn't strike twice, and "Finding Forrester" pales in comparison with "Good Will Hunting." Whether Van Sant intended to plagiarize himself or not, the two films remain bear an unmistakable similarity. Connery plays the equivalent of Robin Williams morose therapist, while Brown performs wonders in his film debut as a disadvantaged but brilliant ghetto teen modeled on Matt Damon's attitude-driven, blue-collar genius.Although it is an above-average, slightly claustrophobic drama about two guys who bring out the best in each other, "Finding Forrester" suffers from slow paced, melodramatic plotting. Cast as a 16-year old South Bronx high school pupil Jamal Wallace, Rob Brown brings quiet but believable dignity to the role or an unassuming, middle-class black whose superlative skill at sinking hoops complements his high academic test scores. Although he scores well on the SAT achievement test, Wallace deliberately sabotages his own grades at school so that his friends won't ostracize him as an egghead.Since Jamal and his pals frequent a local blacktop basketball court for pick-up games, they have noticed a mysterious old white man watching them with binoculars from his third-story apartment. William Forrester (Sean Connery of "The Untouchables") never comes outside except at night to clean his window. Appropriately, they nickname him the 'Window.' When his friends dare him to break into Forrester's apartment, Jamal sneaks in late one night. Forrester surprises him and the frightened lad flees in such a rush that he abandons his backpack with his personal journals. Several days pass and Jamal spots his knapsack hanging in Forrester's window like a trophy. Eventually, Forrester pitches Jamal's incriminating backpack into the street at the youth's feet. Later that evening, Jamal inventories the contents and reads the helpful writing tips that Forrester has scribbled in his notebooks.His curiosity whetted by Forrester's comments, Jamal knocks on his door and the crotchety oldster demands a five thousand word apology before he will help him. So begins the mutually beneficial but improbable friendship between a man at the dusk of his life and another at the dawn his creativity. At the same time, Jamal's superb basketball skills come to the attention of Mailor-Callow, an exclusive Manhattan prep school looking for another star basketball player. Waiving tuition, the school awards Jamal a full athletic scholarship so he can start attending classes. When he isn't in class or dribbling on the basketball court, Jamal visits Forrester and the irascible curmudgeon teaches him how to enrich his writing."Write the first draft with your heart. Rewrite with your head. The key to writing is to write, not think," Forrester advises Jamal, but Forrester sets some important conditions. Anything Jamal writes cannot leave the premises, and Forrester allows "no questions about me, my family, or why there was only one book." Gradually, as the glacial frigidity between them melts and their love for the written word cements their friendship, Jamal learns that Forrester is a renowned Salingeresque author.Director Gus Van Sant, of "Drugstore Cowboy" and "To Die For," and freshman scenarist Mike Rich should be commended for shunning negative racial images. The problem with Rich's deeply moving screenplay is that neither Van Sant nor he is content with strictly exploring the surrogate father and son relationship between William and Jamal. Instead, they expand the plot with disposable subplots. They follow Jamal to his finishing school where he encounters Claire (Anna Paquin of "X-Men"), a rich vanilla-white girl who likes him, in an episodic love story. Worse, they contrive an adversarial relationship with F. Murray Abraham's snobbish English teacher, who also turns out to be one of Forrester's old enemies. Indeed, "Finding Forrester" has a touch of "Amadeus" to it. Dr. Crawford, the supervisor of the school's creative writing contest, is obviously jealous. He has unbridled contempt for athletes, insists Jamal lacks the intellectual flair to pen the work that he has turned in for credit.Altogether, "Finding Forrester" qualifies as a rewarding film flawed by half-baked melodramatics, slow pacing, and inconsistent characterization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park, and I wanted to revisit this film, which like Paranoid Park is focused on teens, an apparent theme of Van Sants.Jamal (Rob Brown - Stop-Loss) is a typical black teen that plays down his intelligence and love of reading and writing and focuses on basketball to fit in with his homeboys.Jamal has some great lines, like when he give a history lesson on B.M.W. to Massie (Glenn Fitzgerald). But, he was about to find someone that would stretch him to the limit (William Forrester - Sean Connery), and get stretched himself.His test scores get him into a prestigious school, where he meets Claire (Anna Paquin - The Piano, "True Blood"). He also has to deal with a snobbish professor (F. Murray Abraham) and a threatened black student (Matthew Noah Word).He learns some valuable lessons about life while his writing improves.An amazing movie. It even has a cameo by Matt Damon at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Punch the keys for God's sake! Yes...Yes! You're the man now, dog! And with those simple words, a legend was born. Some say that Sean Connery was found and raised by a pack of wolves, only to later create a city, and kill his twin brother for the rights to name it. Others say that he sprung fully grown from the head of Zeus, King of Olympus. Whatever the truth may be, the fact stands today much as it did several thousand years ago, when this piece of Canon was created. With the utterance of these single words, empires crumbled, the dead rose from their graves, and fire and brimstone rained down from the heavens. But, fear not, my flock! Saint Connery knows what he does and why he does it, and who are we as mere mortals to question the workings of the Gods? And yea, that is what this piece of cinematic genius is, dictated to Saint Connery in a way very similar to Mohammad's reception of the Qur'an directly from God. From these five simple words, a generation of servitude to the divine and righteous spawned, dedicated to the spreading of his good word, and the opposition of the evil works of the devil, Bauman. For, though he may have material wealth, it is easier for a camel to get through an eye of a needle than it is for Eric Bauman to get into Heaven. Indeed, he was cast out of heaven for stealing content from God. Saint Connery took his divine mission to that men the world over could gaze in wonder at the divine beauty of God's creation, and know that it was God who created it, and to praise him rightly for it, and disallow the devil Bauman to escape God's wrath. For our God is a mighty and vengeful God, one who strikes down pride and who accepts no man who claims that he is greater than his master and creator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better than I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding Forrester's previews, when it was released, did nothing to attract me to the movie. Hearing Sean Connery bark "You're the man now, dawg" just really turned me off.However, now having seen it a few years later, I think whoever put together the preview footage did this movie a terrible disservice. It is a great story, well directed and with beyond competent actors for their roles. Rob Brown turns in a fantastic rookie effort, paired against such a screen powerhouse as Connery. The supporting cast flesh out the film very well, among them are F. Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin, Busta Rhymes. Joey Buttafucco is also in the cast for some inexplicable reason, but fortunately if you blink, you'll miss him.If today's street culture bothers you, this movie does a very good job of balancing it well with the rest of the world and doesn't beat you over the head with it...much. There's a spot or two where it might seem that way, but that's all.For a quiet movie with a good story and a clear underdog to root for, do yourself a favor and watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a very nice surprise for me to find out that this movie is about accomplishment, friendship and character. It is so because for sometime i was asking to myself why all the recent movies are obsessed with unexpected endings. Can't we enjoy a movie without being surprised? I think this film answers this question better than most... A teenager seeks approval among his friends by playing basketball(he does well) but there is more than sports in him. By chance he meets his mentor and things start to improve. See, there is nothing unexpected but somehow we love it. Besides, it is not only the student who changes, the mentor also is influenced by interacting with him. These being said about the plot, keep in mind that it is supported by quality acting. Sean Connery is as usual the confident free spirit, which obviously he does best and won't disappoint you. Furthermore the Jamal character, his student, is also played with excellent talent. Is that all? No. Directors etc. have done a fine job by putting all things together beautifully. I have one complaint though, if the story included more humour this movie would be even more memorable. In conclusion, if you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor. Find yourself a copy and sit in front of whatever you sit in order to watch movies and prepare a nice ambiance with snacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling depiction of both mentoring and a unique friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I have not seen Good Will Hunting to which this seems frequently compared, I found this to be a wonderful film. It depicts the mentoring of a novice writer by an expert and the common bond between two disparate people who share a literary talent...one aging and white, the other young and black. Above all, it follows the gradual development of a genuine friendship between two people who very much need each other, the mentor actually being the more needy of the pair.Jamal Wallace is an Afro American boy at an inner city Bronx public school, consistently earning only C grades but an avid reader who displays gifted writing talents on a standardized test. He is offered a scholarship to a prestigious Manhattan private school, whose administration primarily seeks his basketball skills for the school team. Meanwhile, Jamal has gradually befriended a reclusive author named William Forrester, who watches the public schoolyard games from his apartment window. Forrester has published only one novel many years earlier and has since avoided all public attention, to the extent of self imposed captivity within his own apartment.Some claim that this is Jamal's story, but I find it to be more Forrester's tale. Sean Connery is absolutely superb as the grumpy, secluded Pulitzer Prize winning author. Indeed, like a fine wine, Connery simply improves with age. Rob Brown is perfect as the relatively laid back, never blatantly emotional Jamal. F. Murray Abraham has a villainous role here as the jealous, racist, and egotistical private school English teacher, who feels threatened by any truly knowledgeable student and is disbelieving that an Afro American Bronx kid could actually be such a gifted writer. This bitter teacher is himself a failed author, with something of a personal grudge against Forrester.Jamal's life situation is well conveyed, beginning with a less than ideal home and school environment. Though his mother seems very caring and supportive, his brother and drug addicted father have left the home. It's clear that Jamal does only average work in public school because excelling would prove unpopular or possibly even dangerous with his peer culture. His integration into the prep school isn't followed in close detail, although he does develop a potential romance with Claire, the rich daughter of a school board member. Claire's father is obviously not thrilled with his daughter's interest in this less than affluent Afro American boy, but in any case the romantic relationship is not followed to any conclusion. Also, Jamal's basketball rivalry with a fellow black student isn't pursued in any depth.Primarily this story is a compelling portrait of the developing relationship between Forrester and the budding young author, who share both a gift and a passion for writing. The movie has generally a well written script, unfortunately a bit of 'strong' language (though not much). There are indeed some memorable quotes otherwise, including a few of the expert's writing tips: You write better for yourself than you do for others...Forrester's observation after experiencing public reaction to his writing, my own having been forced (like everyone else) to write school essays! Also, write your first draft using your heart, then your second draft using your head.Personally, I found Forrester's own life story to be the major point of interest in this film. Why did he write only one book? What is his mysterious family situation? What has caused him to shut himself into his apartment, shunning and even growing to fear the outside world? The most gripping scenes take place inside this withdrawn author's own private abode. Not only the literary mentoring but also the personal interactions between him and Jamal, including a cute, funny scene where the pair watch Jeopardy together on TV. Their unusual meeting revolves around an interesting adventure with Jamal's backpack. Initially Forrester is extremely reluctant to allow Jamal into his life, remaining crotchety &amp; skeptical and revealing very little of himself. He even forces Jamal to promise never to reveal their relationship, a promise that will eventually be put to the test. Gradually Forrester allows himself to become vulnerable to a potential friendship, begins to take an interest in Jamal's personal as well as literary life, and comes to trust his young Bronx protg, even with fragments of his own life story. I won't give any spoilers, but you'll obviously wonder...will this reclusive but compelling man ever emerge into the real world once again, leaving the sanctuary of his cage? This is an incredibly moving film with some truly touching scenes and an ending both bitter and sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb acting and involving story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Connery has always been one of my favorite actors and in Finding Forrester he really proves why. Finding Forrester is in my opinion underrated simply because of the similarities it has with Good Will Hunting which Gus Van Sant also directed and that is a shame because Finding Forrester deserves to be recognized as a film on its own. Connery isn't alone in making this film as good as it is as both Rob Brown and F. Murray Abraham perform excellently in the film. The third "character" that makes this film as good as it is, is the story which is extremely well put together.As you have probably gathered from what I have written above I really enjoy the acting in this film. Connery doesn't appear for quite some time but when he finally does appear you get the feeling from his first scene that what you are about to see is not a typical Connery performance. His performance has the usual Connery traits. He brings his usual indescribable something to the character which becomes almost instantly likable. He is also a teacher character which he is in many of his films. Where the character truly differs from many of his previous roles is the emotional involvement which is almost awe inspiring. It really is quite a sight watching Connery struggle with his demons from the past while at the same time mellowing out to Rob Brown's character. His overall line delivery and presence is excellent and his experience really shows. In short Connery is great. Rob Brown does an excellent job as well. You can feel that this is his first film in the fact that he has a little difficulty with complex emotions but his performance and especially his scenes with Connery work great. F. Murray Abraham is thoroughly despicable in his character and he serves his purpose beautifully. Anna Paquin appears in the film as well. She isn't great but she is definitely good. Her relationship with Brown's character isn't always plausible but overall she does a good job.The story is aside from being very well told brilliantly paced. There are basically no boring scenes because of the pacing. The editing is sometimes a bit rough but nothing serious and it certainly does not lessen the value of the film. The story is both heart warming and intelligent and the dialog is also very well written. I dare you to watch the film and not be moved by the story. For me the story was very engaging and once I started watching I was hooked until the end. Very well done.Finding Forrester is one of the most emotionally engaging films I have seen in recent years and it is definitely one of Connery's best performances and that is saying something because the guy is brilliant.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Effort at Showing Writing as a Struggle, But Too Heavy-Handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Finding Forrester" is "Good Will Hunting" (also by Gus Van Sant, a long way from "My Own Private Idaho" and reinforced with a cameo by Matt Damon and "technical consultation"(?) by Casey Affleck") and "Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner" (one of my all-time favorite movies, also about a disadvantaged prodigy plucked for his athletic prowess, but who tries to play the game on his own terms).The Scotsman-in-the-Bronx premise turned out to be made more believable than I expected as done in the script, and the relationship between Connery and the kid is the best part of the movie, which drags a bit. But sorry I do have to fault the kid's performance. I'm not sure whose idea it was to have him be a young Sidney Poitier -- but Poitier's old movies are always made brilliant by that moment he relaxes from the mask he puts on for whites or outsiders and shows the human underneath. Here the kid isn't comfortable either with his homeys (in contrast to a quite wonderful Busta Rhymes as his brother), or in school (yeah, yeah, there's a message there, we got it, ho hum), but even on the basketball court where the final foul shot doesn't match the sublime marathon race in "Long Distance Runner."And since when is literature taught in both public and private schools these days as only by a series of Quotes by Famous Writers? That's a false straw man to compare Connery's character's hard work ethic writing tutoring. But I did like that writing is shown as hard work, not effortless scribbling as most movies show it.I was going to give the movie extra points for filming in NYC, particularly the Bronx-- but it turned out to have been filmed in Ontario! Boo!Surprisingly bland music choices. The listings claimed various Miles Davis pieces had been played but I didn't notice, while the song from the e-toys commercial is too prominent. Lots of missed musical opportunities.(originally written 1/7/2001)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off all I don't think it is totally right to compare the movie with "Godd Willing Hunting". Yeas at some point Godd-Will Hunting is an Oscar rated movie though that movie did not get any. The difference is on the titles actually. Finding Forrester is about a black teenager, Jamal Wallace, played by Rob Brown, who gets accepted into an prestigious private high school. He befriends a reclusive writer, William Forrester, played by Sean Connery.During the reclusive writer as Jamal's mentor is the one who has gone through some changes.In GOOD WILL HUNTING Will is the one who challenges changes by being guided by a mentor-like psychologist. Anna Paquin and F. Murray Abraham's performances are really satisfying besides the performances of Connery and Rob Brown. The story is really great it could have been 30 minutes longer maybe the end smells like sudden hurry end but you know when you get to the point of shooting a 3 hour movie this may bore the general audience so I guess there was no choice. All in all even if it is not in IMDb 250 or did not get an Oscar it is still a great movie and it worths seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is trite, clich, and badly written. Many of the ideas seem to be lifted off other movies that came out prior to this one. The scenes are disjointed, there are several cinematic goofs, and the acting is stiff on more than one occasion. Sean Connery is the saving grace of this movie, but the pure inanity of the movie as a whole continues to stun me. The movie is, in short, about identifying goals, fighting against the assumptions of others and barriers of experience, and forcing yourself to find your dreams. The writing 'tips' Connery's character spouts at every possible opportunity were about the only reason I did not turn off the television. The beginning is slow and stuttered, as well as painfully uninteresting, although the movie seems to find its pacing toward the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FINDING FORRESTER Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSA super-intelligent Bronx teenager (Rob Brown) befriends a reclusive writer (Sean Connery) who teaches him to explore his capabilities to their maximum potential.Having suffered a critical mauling for his insouciant 1998 remake of Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960), director Gus Van Sant redeemed himself somewhat with this low-key drama, in which a talented young writer rises above the expectations of his peers with the help of an older character whose own gifts have alienated him from society. Van Sant explored similar territory in his earlier GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997), but the director's savvy combination of street-level realism (note the unscripted dialogue between Brown and his contemporaries) and old-fashioned melodrama (cf. the nick-of-time climax, in which a miscarriage of justice is narrowly averted) is enough to lift it out of the ordinary. Connery is worth the price of admission, as always, but Brown is every bit his equal as the young man torn between family and ambition. Mike Rich's complex screenplay examines issues of class, race and personal integrity, and while it doesn't always scale the same dramatic heights as GOOD WILL HUNTING, it works on its own modest terms. Also featuring F. Murray Abraham (as the jealous teacher who plots Brown's downfall), Anna Paquin (the potential love interest), Busta Rhymes (Brown's protective older brother), Michael Pitt (THE DREAMERS), and Matt Damon in a brief climactic cameo.</fullReview>

And its even better that the characters, who are totally different, yet similar, join together in a mutual bond. The story is perfect. Don't take away anything.

		<shortDescription>***** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A writer's duty is to meld works in such an abstract pattern that they can turn a lifeless page into a meaningful journey through the unseen. So it comes, as no surprise that most films about writers stray from their thoughts in fear of their characters becoming something unwanted. Look at films like How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days or Runaway Bride. Both featured central characters bent on their writer's craft, but neither attempted to show the passion behind this trait. Maybe it is because we don't understand writers, so we stray from them with diligence. And just like films of this nature we lack originality. How many people have sat down to write in hopes of being the next Stephen King with a number one best seller? Now tell me how many of you have sat down and claimed that the next big thing will be yourself? I am willing to be that option number one held majority. It is like films these days are trying to measure up and be one step ahead of the game. Maybe that's why when a film like Finding Forrester comes along someone has to sit up and take notice. This film is not only a fictitious look into the history of creative art, but a fascinating exploration of a boy who represents this is and an old man who represents everything that lives on inside. The story is familiar in formula, contrived in purpose and unoriginal in terms of output, yet nothing short of genius in method, wiping out all negative forces in the name of pure graciousness. This is not a happy film it is rather bleak. It does not promise hope or affection, it merely offers it. Could it be that that is why it is such probable cause for fascination? It turns the light out on films like Dead Poet's Society that preach false-morals in a collage of unexpected sympathy and unwanted morality. Integrity is not at stake here, but morality is surely on sale for a price today. At this end of this film I didn't want to stand up and cheer, nor did I feel resentment for actions that these characters took prior to their offering of them. I just sat there, interested, intrigued, maybe a little confused, yet I craved more because stories like this don't have fixed endings and this film knew it. The story is far too simple and yet far too complex for full disclosure on these pages. The story is just a backdrop for things of further assembly within itself that will be surly talked about. What will be stated is that, after a dare from some friends, Jamal, a black youth from the Bronx, comes into contact with a grumpy old Scottish man, who just so happens to be William Forrester. The basis for this initial meeting relies on the fact that Jamal is given a scholarship to a posh, private school due to his remarkably high test scores, and his passion or both writing and basketball. What makes Forrester such an important character is that he was once a writer, maybe one of the true greats, who never wrote a second book? Not because he felt he couldn't but because he feared he could. The fact that his name was in public circulation was not a factor that scarred him, but rather the fact that people thought they knew what that name stood for. There are sub-plots herein involving basketball rivalry, blossoming teen romance, fraudulent misrepresentation, and a belligerent English teacher named professor Crawford, who feels no greater passion than for that of the sound of his own voice, even if what is coming out of it is void of educational promiscuity. Yet this film does not stray, it does not talk about violence or drugs, which would be a cover-up. This is a film that has a story to tell, and an honest means in which to tell it, there is enough material here for at least two films, but director Gus Van Sant knows where to keep his aim focused. The blunt of this film's greatness lies in the relationship between Jamal and Forrester. This relationship fuels the film because it never stoops low enough to be considered a friendship. This isn't like Scent of a Woman where the characters dislike each other later to become friends. These characters feel awkward, like they don't want each other around, but need it. Jamal need Forrester to teach him about himself and to develop his craft into something of perfection, and Forrester needs Jamal to remind him that there is a world outside of his apartment and he is still a living part of it. These are not picture perfect character that you could scrape off of a magazine add, they are normal people who boast flaws, but feed off of each other in order to help them survive. We care about these characters not because they enthral us but because we are curious as to why we would care about them. Because of this the film works as a rapid provision of appointments that never leave the viewer questioning long enough to require an answer. This is not a film that I will draw distinct scenes forward in hopes of description. This film is a chronicle not a collection of image. It flows together, one scene after the other, using the last to accent the next and provide with the means in which to fuel the engine forward. I beg anyone to give me one scene in this film that you believe, in having cut, would profit the story telling potential of this material. And still it is not just the two central characters that these attributes can be placed upon. The Crawford character also drew me. He is a character that films like this use as a means to dispense their frustration upon but F. Murray Abraham plays this character for so much more worth. He plays Crawford as a man who does not want us to hate him, just hopes we can try to understand him. Watch this film, and than watch it again, see if you can give one means in which this character gives you to stipulate this irrelevance as a caring individual who only wishes the best. Anna Paquin also stars in a small but slender role as Claire, a white girl who draws interest in Jamal. Paquin also finds the proper balance that her characters needs in order to fulfill her presence. She is a free spirit in a subdued body who takes pride in gaining her dignity, not earning it. Probably this films biggest surprise is first timer Rob Brown in the position of Jamal. Not only does young Brown find reverence in his scenes next to Sean Connery as Forrester but also he also never places himself in a position where he feels to the left of the star-studded cast. He never makes a joke of his surroundings, but never allows himself to discover more than those same surrounding need provide, finding a natural balance between cunning and insipid. He reminds me of the Mekhi Phifer from Clockers, a good man in a bad situation. Connery on the other hand is a great actor on his own, a seasoned veteran who knows the stakes and is willing to coincide himself to them. Yet it is not the performance that Connery gives that I give amends to. It is how he places that character inside his own little world. A bad film would have played this character for sympathy. Connery plays it for respect. He makes a character that you don't have to be partial to, but can't help to respect due to his extensive motivations. Van Sant also uses an interesting gadget in the scoring of this film. A lot of films play with music to brew emotions, Van Sant plays with silence. Silence is dark and haunting, silence is dull and silence does create memories it subsides with mysteries. This film doesn't want to provoke emotions, it wants you to realize them, or in this case re-realize them. This is not a perfect film; I will be the first to admit that. It uses a tired formula that we have seen many times before and in some cases raises certain points above others of equal opportunity. But it does relish a perfect score because even though it leads us down a path that has been journeyed many times before, never has getting down that path provided its viewer with so much to think about in themselves. It is bold and daring. When we think it will go one way, it goes another, only making us feel sorry for such naive assumptions in judgment. This truly is film making at its peak literary form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent follow-up to Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to top a film like Good Will Hunting, and Gus Van Zant was able to deliver a good film which wasn't too overbearing in the sap department. As a wannabe writer myself, I enjoyed the concept of the film and its inquiries into the mind of a writer. Rob Brown was especially good in his role, meaning he could be one of the better Black actors if he sticks with his acting. However, the man that carried the film was Sean Connery. For once, he plays a fallible man that was both reclusive and less than perfect. An interesting film to watch, even if it does appear slow at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>3 out of 10Gus Van Sant was obviously eager to repeat his acclaimed success for Good Will Hunting, and the result is Finding Forrester, which is virtually the same movie, excepting the fact that our young genius protagonist isn't a troublemaker like Will Hunting. Rob Brown plays the part of the gifted writer and he's jaw-droppingly flat and monotonous every second he's on-screen. Sean Connery gets the Robin Williams role, meaning he gets the opportunity to spout a lot of cliched dialogue that are supposed to hint at little life messages. Connery's played the grizzled, world-weary warrior before, he could do the part in his sleep.Finding Forrester is nothing more than Oscar-bait, using a tested formula to hopefully fool viewers into believing they're actually watching a quality movie that has "Something To Say." There's not a single surprising moment in the script, it goes through cliche after cliche and ends in a silly "crowdpleasing" fashion (you could almost say the crowdpleasing is literal, judging from the embarrassingy overdone classroom finale). Van Sant even has the huevos to give us a Matt Damon cameo in the concluding moments, at such a moment the parallels between this and Good Will Hunting become blatantly obvious. Skip this one and check out Wonder Boys instead, the year's other writer/protege drama that was actually original, quirky, and genuinely funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's heartening to see urban African-American teenagers portrayed as kids instead of as thugs, and the hard working adults that are raising and mentoring them portrayed as, well, compassionate, caring adults. In "Finding Forrester", the urban African-American family is presented with affection that is all to often missing in today's exploitation-driven movies. Unfortunately, most of these characters are not central to the story, a story that is all together most unoriginal. The plot is a rehash of "Good Will Hunting", now set amongst African-Americans in the Bronx instead of Irish-Americans in Boston. And Gus Van Sant made them both! That's just too much. As well acted, tender, and feel-good as it is, "Finding Forrester" has that 'been there done that' feel which it's good intentions just can't overcome. For pleasant Saturday night feel-good fare for the family, it makes the cut, but only barely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Minor spoilers included)I noticed, that most of the people here gave 8 points to this movie and so did I. This movie might not be a masterpiece of all times but it certainly is a movie, which is not to be forgotten three minutes after you walk away from the theater.Right after the movie started I did not feel too well about it, there were some redundant scenes, but the situation pleasantly changes after Jamal and Forrester start to respect each other. From that point on there is not much bad that could be said about the movie. Both main characters are portrayed equally well and even though you would not certainly expect somebody like Sean Connery to play really bad, he has certainly always something that can surprise. Plot is smooth and there are no abrupt changes that are typical for most dramas nowadays. Even the character of a bad guy, professor Crawford is beautifully crafted and acting of Murray Abraham was good as well.The music and cinematography was soft as it should be in these movies but still strong enough to properly emphasize the strongest points of this movie.And finally we should thank producers of this movie for not giving in to the temptation to expose us to the banal lovestory between millionaire daughter Claire and poor boy from Bronx Jamal, which, even though suggested at some points, was (fortunately enough) not developed.8/10 - two points off for some redundant scenes and overall feeling that suggests this was not a masterpiece but definitely pleasant and far above average film.</fullReview>

I'll say that there was a little injustice as the young actor who acted this movie as his debut in this movie should have gotten more awards than he did. Rob Brown was inspirational in this movie as if he were an experienced actor. Sean Connery, as usual cannot be compared in this. He did his acting just like he invented the act of acting.

		<fullReview>*Spoiler warning*FINDING FORRESTER (2000) Rating: 8/10There are some great, hidden films that just come and surprise you out of the blue. Finding Forrester is one of them. It's a sometimes stunning, rarely boring picture that made me think about my further talents as a writer, and, better yet, it made me want to use them. The film is about writing and race (but it doesn't annoy you with the annoying `black and white' issue) that is sure to be remembered, thanks to it's stunning performances from the ultimate man, Sean Connery, from the amazing newcomer Rob Brown and the impressive Anna Paquin. I'll admit the film is over-long, but it is still very much worth the price you pay to see it. The thing that may annoy viewers with this film is it is not based on a true story. However, the script is fantastic, the acting is brilliant and this movie has a lot of power in its good spirit. Look out for a surprise cameo from Matt Damon as a lawyer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best dramas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding Forrester was a very good movie and a very good drama. It has a plot that was well-written and a good dialogue. The acting was well portrayed by Sean Connery and Jamal Wallace. (I don't know Jamal's real name). It has a good beginning, to show what Jamal's life is like in the bronx and what his school is like in the bronx compared to the new prep school he'll be going to. The movie is unpredictable which makes it very good.  This is the plot. Jamal is playing basketball with his friends one day. Him and his friends spot a person in an apartment building spying on them who was a former writer. His name was William Forrester (Connery). He never goes outside because he is afraid of the public. When Jamal sees his high school test scores, the private school he'll be going to offers him to go to the best private school on the east coast. Jamal goes to Forrester's apartment to ask help for his writing to help him become a better writer. He soon becomes a very good writer indeed, but his English teacher is trying to do anything he can to get Jamal out of the school. Crawford (the English teacher) doesn't believe a kid from the bronx has the capability to write that good. In this movie Sean Connery is a writer who was the author of a bestselling novel. He never wrote another book, and later in the movie you'll discover why. I'm not going to give out any spoilers. Overall, this is a very good movie. It has a good set of main characters and a good plot like I said before. I may even buy the movie. This movie gets 9/10</fullReview>

If this weren't improbable enough, he also has a babe (Paquin) practically throw herself at him in spite of the absence of any perceptible personality on his part. As "Finding Forrester" wears on, the implausibilities mount as our young hero (Brown) manages to win the friendship of a reclusive Pulitzer winning author (Connery) who just happens to live across the street from the projects. Hrump! Those who can buy into this typically commercial Hollywood no-brainer fantasy with a one-dimensional hero will likely enjoy it in spite of a too long (2+ hours) run time which doesn't quite accomplish what so obviously set out to.

The whole idea of a high schooler in a poor environment using his genius to overcome the greatest of odds is a story worth making and a story worth repeating.Robert Brown and Sean Connery were indeed THE story. We learned a lot about the dreams of each and how, despite their overwhelmingly different backgrounds, they could help each other achieve their dreams. Pure energy and pure synergy. I really didn't want to go very bad because the whole notion of a couple men becoming friends just didn't do much for me, but if you haven't seen it and you don't think you can get excited about the notion, think again.Finding Forrester is a little about sports, a little about social acceptance, a little about writing. But, it is a LOT about friendship, personal growth, hopes and dreams. And, true dreams never die. Wonderful movie that almost anyone would enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many have noted that this is almost just a remake of Good Will Hunting. That's true, except Finding Forrester is about a supposed teenage genius author and already at this premise the entire movie is destined to fail miserably. There is one question that the movie can never quite answer, namely: What is the kid writing that is so clever? Just ehm... literature, the movie states. And behind that statement lies the idiotic thought that art can be measured in greatness, just like you measure the distance between the bull and the sh**.The movie just goes along without ever touching the secret notion of what the kid is writing, until in the end there is no way out for the director. Gus Van Sant must have been wondering for hours and hours on what to do. How do you write something of genius when you are not a genius yourself? I will spare you the hilarious solution for this problem. Then at least you will have some comfort left for having been annoyed and irritated for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Connery keeps it flowing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure "Finding Forrester" will have its share of comments, comparing it to the earlier success "Good Will Hunting" and rightfully so. In a way, it does seem a little derivative and after already seeing the magic that Robin Williams and Matt Damon sparked on screen, it's hard to feel a tad shortchanged. One thing I was really impressed with was the opening sequence. Instead of boring us with a corny title sequence, we have a montage of shots giving us a great feel of its Bronx atmosphere. The montage is played to the soundtrack of a rap song, sung by a random street rapper. We have shots of different people in the neighborhood smiling at the camera. Basically, it starts off with a bang. And just like "Good Will Hunting" the interactions between the young people are perfectly realistic, though some could've been edited out for the purposes of shortening its running time of 2 hours and 10 minutes. This is Rob Brown's first movie and he does a great job. But Sean Connery steals the show in his offbeat role as a hermit writer who has only published one book in his lifetime. His days of dodging bullets as 007 are over, naturally, so this is definitely a fresh new role for Connery. I don't think anyone could've played it better. And his character has some great, insightful things to say about the writing process. Being an aspiring screenwriter, I found his words to be somewhat uplifting. In the scene where Brown is at the typewriter and thinks about what to write, Connery exclaims "What are you doing!" He replies, "I'm thinking." "No thinking. That comes later. For your first draft, you write with your heart. You use your head for the rewrite." All this time I've been reading a book by this veteran screenwriter, who talks about all these special techniques about "preparing" for your new screenplay. "Preparing" doesn't work in the writing process. You simply have to do what William Forrester (Connery) says and write with your heart. And the film never really takes a corny, sentimental route. Something else I appreciated.However, the cliches were here and there. When Brown goes to his new school, he's faced with Anna Paquin who (guess what?) turns out to be the headmaster's daughter. Later on, we have the inevitable scene where Brown and Paquin are having a ball and the father barges in, none too satisfied. So sometimes the film does get predictable, but never mushy. I like how the racial issues are never firmly pressed. Any amateur writer would've stressed the whole idea of Brown's character being African-American, going to a prep school and heavily bonding with Connery's (white) character. And of course we would've had the supporting characters complaining to Brown about how he's not "black enough" because of his decision to express himself intelligently through poetry. But none of that happens. I appreciated that."Finding Forrester" is most notable for one of Connery's best performances ever, but it's overall a good film. Not Gus Van Sant's best, but as others have inferred this is a hell of a lot better than his update of the Hitchcock classic "Psycho."My score: 7 (out of 10)P.S.: If others haven't given it away yet, expect a surprise cameo in the closing minutes of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I did a fair amount of research on this film before seeing it, so was prepared to hate it. I knew that it had been commissioned by Uncle Sean to emulate `Good Will Hunting.' That film gave me a toothache with its complete lack of understanding of the pain associated with mathematical insight. I expected the same with writing, but this time instead of Williams' excesses, we'd get the bombast of Connery.I was largely right, but some things pleasantly surprised me. The young lead, Robert Brown held his focus. (He is the 17th Robert Brown to be listed in the IMDB!) It is not precisely good acting yet, but he lent comfort to the enterprise. And Van Sant had more competence with the angles and editing than he has shown before. The framing and underlying jazz set a pleasant beat.But the effort was a failure, I think for two reasons.Many films are written about writing, some even using this weakly self-referential device of the word and action on the screen having congruence. To make it work, you have to show the power of words, the power of the choice behind them, the commitment of soul that each concept demands in forming. None of that here. Writing seems equated to typing somehow -- `Pound those keys!' -- or that writing is a "natural" talent -- or that it has something to do with "test scores." This is the same prime weakness as in `Good Will,' but it is not because a popular film cannot accommodate a deeper vision: see `Wonder Boys.'There is a secondary weakness too, and this alone would have killed the film. The writer knew enough to sketch the cinematic metaphor of inside and outside. (Oh how I wish he could also have given us overlying narratives of inner and outer poetry!) But with all of Van Sant's polishing, he completely missed the opportunity for tight versus open spaces. Forrester's cubby seems spacious, unconfining. How could he miss this opportunity to cramp the camera!I think I know why. In doing so, he would make at least partly an architectural film. That means the camera wouldn't focus so exclusively on the boss. And the boss wants a statue.</fullReview>

All that the film did was talk about what great writers they were. They never once actually showed it! I will never forget the end of the film when you think you are about to hear something brilliant come from the mouth of the young writer and just as he begins to speak the music comes it and all we get is a loud symphony and a visual of his mouth moving.

		<fullReview>This movie is, among other things, about finding your talent, that one thing that you can do better than most other people, and figuring out what you're going to do with that talent. This is material that nearly everyone will be able to relate to, and it's handled pretty good, with only fairly few cliches. The plot is good, and it moves along nicely throughout the movie, at a reasonably good pace. The acting is pretty good, both Sean Connery and the other male lead did good jobs, though I found that Connery overacted a bit in some of the scenes. Most of the supporting actors were pretty good. The characters are well-written and their actions are credible, though I think Connery's character was overly eccentric in some scenes. Something that continuously annoyed me was the erratic camera movements which are especially obvious in the basketball scenes. I think they were meant to emphasize on how intense it was, but I think that 8 Mile did a much better job at that than this movie. I guess some people will like this for its message, some people will like it for its good performances... I have to admit, even though the message is good, and the performances are pretty good, I wasn't *that* impressed by this movie. I've been told that it's very similar to an earlier Gus Van Sant movie, Good Will Hunting; I'll have to check that out, to find out if it's better than this. I recommend this to fans of Sean Connery, people who find the plot appealing and/or fans of drama movies. It's pretty good, but not great. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After striking out big time remaking "Psycho," director Gus Van Sant turns to making a TV movie version of his previous hit "Goodwill Hunting" but without one fully developed character. Instead he trusts a predictable, rigged, by-the-numbers script that plumbs no depths whatsoever. Jamal, a brilliant black kid, also happens to be a brilliant basketball player. He is brilliantly sensitive enough to intrigue the brilliant daughter of the most important alumni of the preppy school Jamal wins a scholarship to. All the time, Jamal receives tutoring from Forrester, a brilliant one-time novelist recluse loosely meant to evoke the image of J.D. Salinger. Sean Connery plays Forrester and he is cranky and cute as he frequently is now. Anna Paquin is very good as the brilliant daughter, but her relationship with Jamal is never given any depth so as not to offend anyone. F. Murray Abraham is the one-dimensional villain, an English teacher who can't believe Jamal is all that brilliant. One can find no fault with Abraham if all he's given is what is in Mark Rich's screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film when it was first released and thought above all else what a fine future the lead actor, Rob Brown should have, in a perfect world. Upon seeing it again, my opinion has not changed about the film but only in disappointed that Rob Brown is not a bigger star. In this, his film debut, he stars opposite Sean Connery as a kid from the South Bronx with a lot of talent and quite a bit of sense. He can play basketball, he can write, he's a charmer. He has a lot going for him. On a dare, he enters the apartment of a reclusive writer, (William Forrester, played with feistiness and vulnerability by Connery in surely one of his best roles in some time) and so begins a contentious relationship but one founded on respect.Rob Brown is just fantastic as a hoops-loving high-schooler named Jamal Wallace who lives with a loving mother (well played by April Grace) and a caring brother named Terrell (Busta Rhymes) who makes a living as a parking lot attendant at Yankee Stadium. F. Murray Abraham is also great as the oleaginous teacher who won't admit that he's racist although it's pretty clear he is.The script is great. It gives Rob Brown the ability to be a kid-talking trash with his friends and talking to girls and yet it doesn't emasculate him, subject to the goodwill and intervention of the Benevolent White Man as happened in "The Help". It also doesn't emulate a movie like "Shawshank Redemption" or "The Green Mile" in which a black character is seen as a magical talisman whose mysterious wisdom makes Everything Right In The End.In this movie, while Jamal is helped, Forrester is helped more. Indeed, the film is calling "Finding Forrester" rather than "Finding Wallace" which would seem to indicate that the writer and director considered Forrester more in need of help than Wallace. This seems plausible given Wallace's athletic and academic gifts. Forrester's prickliness is finally dissolved when he realizes Jamal's desire for his help is genuine and when puts a scholarship to a prominent prep school on the line in order to keep a promise he had made to Forrester.The script by Mike Rich can't be credited enough for giving Jamal agency and power over his life but at the same time allowing him to learn from Forrester. That said, the fact that Jamal helps Forrester more than the other way around nearly makes this the exception to the rule of movies featuring black and white characters. It is nice though to see two characters helping each other gain from what the other can offer. It's nice to see a film that realizes that the surplus of help does not need to be massive and that there can be a fair exchange of support among two able, imperfect characters.Gus Van Sant continues to prove himself a versatile director, reaching large audiences without making terrible movies. Van Sant makes interesting movies and tries not to pander audiences and this is a fine example of filmmaking in which you don't feel stupider when you're finished watching. Truly a film that many could watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever changing educational theory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamal, the black kid, under performs at school (though not at taking tests) and makes a point of showing an interest in basketball to maintain his standing with his friends. Not to seem too academic you see, basketball being an acceptable activity to them.Back in the heady days of 2000 the prevailing theory to explain relatively poor black educational performance was still Fear of Acting White (do a search). Jamal is a means to illustrate this theory, carefully hiding his intellectual and academic prowess from scrutiny from his peers.These days the Fear of Acting White theory has fallen out of fashion. Now hip educationalists and sociologists have a new theory. Stereotype Threat (do another search) - this puts the blame for relatively poor black educational performance on black students buying into negative stereotypes. They are expected to do badly - so they do.I'm not sure a movie has been made yet utilising the Stereotype Threat concept, it might be a bit more difficult to portray perhaps, lets keep watching.Not to worry about that though, as the movie shows, when you get down to it, narrow minded white folks are to blame either way, either for creating an academic stereotype that black kids fear to emulate or for creating negative stereotypes that hold them back.Some may have noticed the problem - what is the predictive power of these theories - given that they largely contradict each other. In fact therein lies some of their power, since neither stands up to much inspection both are still in circulation happily contradicting each other. Back to the movie - Sean Connery plays the no-nonsense tough guy author. That role appeals to liberal types, fancying that they would act in the same way in the same situation. With the same conviction that somewhere buried inside those seemingly threatening black youths on the street are bookish, nerdy, white kids struggling to get out. And those black kids would understand their white mentors tough approach is in no way racist, just telling it like it is.Bonus marks here for interracial love interest and cynical elite/white dominated school exploiting black kid for his basketball prowess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative writing beyond all bigotry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a lot more than the story of a black boy from the Bronx finding his full realization in both basket-ball and creative writing. This film is a lot more than the skimming of black public high schools by white private high school to find the winning sportsmen they need. This film is a lot more than the story of a black teenager who finds his mentor, a father substitute since he has no father and his elder brother is not the model he wants, in a famous and yet totally marginal writer, Scottish by origin and bird-loving by choice and passion. This film is a lot more than the exacting tyrant a failed writer can become when he decides to compensate his failure in writing by becoming a creative writing and literature teacher. And this film is also a lot more than the phenomenal emotional shock it is for an aging man, diagnosed with cancer, entirely solitary and marginalized to find by accident and the insistence on the side of the foundling, the younger man who is going to be his follow-up next generation. He gets out of his cocoon. He gets out of his seclusion. Even so much that he will save his foundling from academic probation and even open up the door to his future. This film is all that together and a lot more. It is the story of loyalty, commitment and yet betrayal and salvation. Deeply emotional all along the film gets to a poignant ending when the death of the older man is announced by a lawyer to the younger man, and when this younger man is given the full legacy of the older man: the keys to the older man's den and sanctuary in the Bronx, a final farewell manuscript letter and the manuscript of his second and posthumous novel to be prefaced by the younger man. The racial problem is dealt with delicately but thoroughly showing how little race has to do with creative imagination, or even plain human love, but also that it has a lot to do with some preconceived ideas that a black basket ball player cannot be a creative writer of any excellence. A film to watch several times just for fun and emotional inspiration. You can always trace and track all the visual or situational allusions to many other films, like Matt Damon as a young lawyer. I have seen that somewhere else. Solve the many riddles of the type like the older man on his old fashioned bike cycling to the private school to save his black younger friend from ostracism and rejection. He just misses a black gown flying around him.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Val de Marne Crteil, CEGID.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe that Sean Connery plays a writer's role in this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best things about American cinema is its ability to allow some its successful directors to make personal films.This is the only manner in which they are not forced to follow the diktats of Hollywood studios.There are two names which come immediately to mind : Steven Soderburg and Gus Vant Sant.Both of them are known for their innovative,independent films which are able to leave a mark on audiences' minds.Finding Forrester can be hailed as one of Gus Van Sant's most personal films where he has been highly successful in bringing international audiences closer to themes related to American culture with a humanist perspective.Positive depiction of an impoverished black boy is the true highlight of this film.In "Finding Forrester",Gus Vant Sant nicely chose not to highlight the question of class differences.This is the reason why much stress has been laid on the friendship of two people who have a lot in common including their love for books.This is a film to watch if you admire watching good films and have penchant for reading good books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cerebral Film Within A Unique Context</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery can make any movie seem better, as if you think of films like Robin Hood-Prince of Thieves - a cameo, or The Hunt For Red October- a full feature. Without him, these films could have been successful maybe. That is the same with this film- maybe.This is a film which tries to inspire by using an often used theme which rarely happens in real life. That is the rise of someone for a poor neighborhood to a rich one. It is supposed to make you feel good.Sean Connery &amp; Ron Brown act well together, a special chemistry in this movie. To me the ironic thing is Browns character- Jamal Wallace, actually having a similar name as a former Syracuse University basketball player. I am not sure why this happens in this film as from watching it, it does not appear to be based upon a real story.It has a lot of a typical feel good story which other films like Good Will Hunting has. The difference is this film takes it slow &amp; easy. It dwells deep into the lead characters. It does leave the major issue- Jamal's possible romance UN-resolved entirely. It hints that even though there is heat between Jamal &amp; an attractive white girl, her daddy would stand in the way &amp; she is too afraid to go there, but leaves this thread dangling as if the film were running too long.The English Professors drawing of conclusions about Jamal's real abilities illustrates a big problem in our society today. It seems that all our colleges now feel they only need to brain wash students who get straight A's while leaving the rest of them scrambling to scratch out a future. This is a direct parallel to our government dropping it's support of our American economy &amp; forcing our workers to scratch out a living the same way. The sad part is how these brainwashed students think this is fair. They are not old enough to realize how foolish brainwashing their thoughts can be, &amp; how far the media &amp; the system are doing it to them.This films attempts to rise above the typical level of thoughts with a cerebral theme that can generate thoughts &amp; try to be inspiring. While I found it worthwhile to watch, &amp; entertaining, it left me dangling too scratch out just how good a movie this could have been if it went on to challenge normal more than it winds up doing.Jamal does challenge Forester, but does not take up the challenge himself. That leaves this film less than a full inspiration &amp; more of a perspiration effort.</fullReview>

This movie shows how very specific events can change the whole life of the person either if he is strongly evolved to them or not. I tell this because if the boy in the film did not play basketball in the specific court under forester's apartment, the whole life of the boy and the conclusion of forester's life would have been totally different. The movie also indicates how strong can a bond be between people who share the same passion, specifically in the movie the writing. Sir Connery had a brilliant performance! I really enjoyed this movie and I strongly recommend you to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look all I have to say is this is a great film. While many see this as van saint revisiting good will hunting, i feel the acting of both leads as well as the scene where Connery's character reads Jamal's essay are very powerful. No scene captured that feeling of see i told you so or in your face like that scene for me. Believe me or don't, but in the end I think its a great film. The kid who plays Jamal is great and Conrey is solid as well. Anna Paqawin is adequate in her role as the rich upper class kid, but I must say van saint is one of the best directors out their and his stuff gets better every time. A man who goes out and dose the film he wants to make. The film is about a young boy who has a talent for writing but feels that he must find acceptance in other areas such as basketball in order to fit in with his friends. This changes when he transfers to a new school and meats a old author.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Forrester only takes up part of the film and do not say its a metaphor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding Forrester is a good movie trying to be a great film. I think the name Busta Rhymes is a joke and I would say that regardless of nationality. The cast after Connery looks B list acting and it seems like a loop hearing Connery films always saying "Of course you are". The top Hollywood actors ask for so much money that you do not see ensemble casts much anymore with the exception of Oceans 11 and Oceans 12. George Clooney joked that he attached a twenty dollar bill to the Oceans 12 script of Julia Roberts saying I hear you get 20 a film now referring to 20 million dollars. My Daughter Julias artificial intelligence computer on the planet Coaltrain just said "Artevan is R Texas cactus Daddy." Thank you Julia. Daddy loves you very much. Your computer Artificial intelligence is so accurate that I may be talking to you as a six year old forever. The code Johnny Cloud Captain Storm Gunner Sarge gave me Annsonpt when I encoded the word President. It would be nice if my Daughter Julia Ann had a son and a Pt boat some day. The word son may be a reference to me and maybe American Shadow President Jack Kennedy is represented by the Pt letters. Both the 1964 created Captain Storm and JFK skippered Pt boats in the Pacific. Storms character is fictitious of course. Now you know the top three highest ranking Americans. With King Henry V Lancasters knight satellite uplink laptop computer he could see the future of the holodeck so Ann Son and Pt have been known about by the members of Brushpass since 1415 AD. The character of Daniel Jackson from Stargate spends a lot of time in the Cheyenne mountain bunker. I have worked at three Bunker complexes. My Daughter Julia and I should be in an American bunker right now. Also all the members of Brushpass were supposed to have a turn on the Knight Satellite uplink laptop computer. I was given a laptop computer but it is clearly not the knight laptop computer that King Henry V Lancaster had from 1415 to 1422. Check out Sean Connerys other movies as well.</fullReview>

Importance of following our personal legend. Guadiance. Friendship. And realizing what can our life can be. In Addition it makes us feel the pain of the sentence "suddenlly they give you everything and then taking it back without a reason.". You can have an unique talent but it is never important if anybody else knows it. The movie shows how things can transform into a different life with a friend. However it is never late to see what can we do at the rest of our lives. The most important thing is to never lose the spirit and keep doing what we can do best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing great?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when Finding Forrester was released there was all this buzz about how great it was, just like there was about Almost Famous, another movie, like Finding Forrester, generally about getting the respect that you deserve, although neither movie deserves the respect that they get. The plot is an exercise in exploring massive clichs from movies about finding talent in unexpected places, and not about doing anything new within any genre. The basic theme is of the rugged genius who is held down by a jealous and/or suspicious and accusatory ? one might say racist, in this case ? superior, but who breaks through all of the barriers erected in front of him. Luckily, here we have the addition of the character of a great but lost writer, who wrote a single classic but subsequently disappeared from the public eye, only to have his heart captured by this inner city kid with the gift of a great writing ability.Sean Connery has a difficult time fitting this role, or maybe I just have a hard time seeing him as a great writer, the real talent in this movie is Rob Brown in his film debut playing the part of Jamal Wallace. There is a great scene where his jerk teacher starts reciting quotes from great writers in an effort to show Jamal and the rest of the class how much smarter he is than any of them, and Jamal repeatedly identifies each author after only a few words. It's a great lesson about teaching methods, although I like to think that there are few teachers who deliberately try to make their students feel inferior to themselves, but I know they're out there. I've had a few myself, although I don't think I've had any as bad as this guy. His problem might be that he's teaching at an inner city school, since he is so obviously racist.Sean Connery and Rob Brown work well together, despite their relationship being so contrived. William Forrester is the author of a single classic who apparently has spent the last 40 years or so rarely leaving his apartment and writing masterpieces that he refuses to publish because of a paralyzing fear of being critically misinterpreted, a risk that every artist of any kind in the history of mankind has run by publicizing their work. The ones that never publicized their work are quickly forgotten.Jamal plays basketball with friends near Forrester's apartment, from which he watches them with binoculars, which is creepy indeed. On a dare, Jamal sneaks into his apartment and is scared away by him in such a rush that he leaves his backpack behind with a notebook with some of his writing in it. It's not long before his backpack comes sailing out of Forrester's window with lots of corrections and suggestions in it. This setup for the relationship between Jamal and Forrester is clever, until you realize that this guy has been holed up in that apartment for decades because he doesn't want anyone to read his work. All those years and all he needed was someone to leave some experimental writing in his apartment to get him going again.There are lots of movies that get a lot done along the way. Finding Forrester, on the other hand, exists entirely as a setup for its conclusion, which is indeed satisfying. It's like every schoolboy's dream. One of them, anyway. I suppose schoolboys have a lot of dreams. One of my stranger ones was the wish that I could freeze time and go up and erase everything on the board anytime the teacher wrote something up there. The ensuing mayhem would have been too gleeful for me to contain. The movie is essentially about Jamal's transition from getting through school on athletic scholarships and getting through school because of his intellectual prowess, and in that way it succeeds very well. It is a satisfying movie that will make you feel good, but it is undeniably a formula film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, you don't really see many films specifically about writing very often. When you do find them, though, you hope they are as good as this film. Finding Forrester is an entertaining and intelligent film that strives to knock down cultural barriers and even personal barriers. It has several strong points including performances, story, and direction. First of all, Sean Connery's performance is wonderfully truthful and inspiring. It's entertaining to watch him, especially when he's given lines that only he could possibly get away with. New-comer, Rob Brown, is also very good, perhaps not as good as Connery, but considering this is his first film, he does an excellent job. There were certainly some interesting camera angles as well, which made the film more interesting; props to director Gus Van Sant on that.A weaker point in the film was the music which, although it worked in this particular film, was not terribly interesting to listen to, nor did it really heighten the film for me.On the whole, Finding Forrester is a strong film with good messages about overcoming obstacles, racial issues, and our own personal fears. Highly recommended.8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good tiny movie a la "Dangerous Minds" or "Lean on Me". A lot of fuzz has been spread about it.Indeed Rob Brown does a good job with it, being this his first movie ever, but Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington or Morgan Freeman he ain't. Let's wait and see how he grows, possibly also on stage, as well as on camera, to see if he's really worthy to be called an actor.F. Murray Abraham does a good job, but doing what? What he has always been doing, the bad, sadistic and twisted jealous mentor. Wouldn't it be refreshing to see him do something totally whacky just for once? I felt he was wasted once again by the movie machinery...Connery is always good in whatever he does, but at times this bothers me, because he could do much better still.In this one, produced by him, he rather prefers to lean back and watch others work. I simply can't see him as a weak character. His true stamina and adrenaline is always overcooking. I could've seen an older William Hurt playing Forrester, but Connery? He has too much power and life in him that simmers through every pore of his skin to be a poor, isolated, secluded and frustrated writer.He was far better in "The Rock" and in "Entrapment" than in this high-minded intellectual work. I could see it played on stage, but for a movie it's too little. I couldn't sense the immense struggle that both men had to go through in order to win the world. Still it's watchable, but a far cry from "Dead Poets' Society" or "Lean on Me"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>appropriate Title? Definitely!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just happened to see this movie recently and was checking it up. I read a post asking whether the title was appropriate or not. I think it was.... In the end when Jamal reads the letter that Forrester wrote to him before, he says that even in the winter of his life, Jamal enabled him to truly discover the person he was and realize the more wonderful aspects of life that he had not had the chance to explore.... So it truly was a way of 'Finding" himself, wasn't it? You'd think William was teaching Jamal, but the truth is that it's not always quantity but quality even in years that can change the way people look at themselves and ultimately at life. A truly wonderful movie with the most appropriate closing song :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to call this movie of Mr.Gus Van Sant, one of todays most talented directors, a feel good movie similar to his outstanding 'Good Will Hunting'.( By the way, there's a funny cameo appearance at the end of the film which suggests that too, go see it asap !) Whenever you feel bad or lonely, maybe just sick and at home watching videos, this movie will make you feel much better... It's about life and it's difficulties, about destiny and fear of the future and fulfilling your dreams whatever it takes. As an old but very wise man William Forrester(S.Connery) teaches a young but very gifted Afro-American by the name of Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) how to overcome his fear. How to exploit his talents and how to manage himself while attending College where he is the only colored one of his class might be circumstances not every soul engages in this life, but looking for a family when you haven't got any surely is. Altogether a movie of a kind, with very strong acting ( even Busta Rhymes excels himself as Jamal's older brother Terrell), strong dialogues and a message on top of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, but flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a good film, but not a great film. The plot is rather formulaic and predictable, and it many ways is a typical coming-of-age film about a troubled boy with special talents who finds a mentor that is troubled in many ways himself. (I am curious as to why there are so few coming-of-age films about troubled young women finding female mentors -- does Hollywood believe that just boys are troubled and only male mentors can help them?) However, in this film, the boy is an African-American going to a private, white school in New York on a basketball scholarship. More importantly, he is a talented writer who finds a mentor in a reclusive writer and alumni of the school (Connery). The boy comes into conflict with the expectations set for him as a low-income black student in a high-income white school, and this conflict is explored in much of the film.However, this conflict is not explored enough, in my opinion. This film could have been an interesting and poignant exploration of the immense challenges African-American children have in breaking out of the confines of poverty, violence, and low expectations that prevents them of obtaining an equal opportunity in education. However, the film falls short in this area, which was disappointing in that this would have made the film much stronger.That being said, the acting was excellent, and there were some real gems in this movie that made it worth seeing. It doesn't reach its potential, though, and instead comes across at times as trite and clich, with characters that are rather shallow and not fully explored. A good movie, nonetheless, but one that was not all that it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read about this movie on IMdB and have been wanting to watch it ever since. To be frank, after watching it, i was not ecstatic but wasnt disappointed either. A lot of nuances have been left unsaid. Gus van Sant is capable of much better. But on the whole the movie is watchable on account of the new comer [Rob Brown] and of course Sean Connery himself, though i must add, there's not much scope for his acting prowess here. This is a "coming of age" movie ... a "follow your heart" kinda theme.. within the backdrop of the Bronx. Bottomline: Worth a watch without expecting wonders!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something I felt after watching this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really touched me on various levels. Maybe more so because I am still at college in one of the best Institutes of my country and I know how the Professors at these big shot colleges tend to behave.I will not bore anyone with details but just to give a brief idea, most of the teachers you will find in a top college are really acclaimed in their field of work and have sufficiently large egos to suck the fun out of studies.Anyway, I loved the character development in this movie. The way Jamal grows confident enough to let out his anger and frustration and still managing to stop himself from going overboard. Somehow I was reminded of "The Dead Poets Society" and the last hearing scene in "Scent Of A Woman" while watching this one. The major difference being that the Student this time is a tough kid from the street who will not throw his life away and will certainly never kneel down to take an undeserved punishment.In spite of all this he is not a senseless rebel. He is still just a 16 year old smart kid with real problems and mature enough to handle romance in his life like a grown up. I think thats what I liked most about him.Definitely worth spending two hours for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Finding Forester" is a serious drama. Sean Connery is brilliant as the reclusive William Forester. Rob Brown is a delightful surprise to the screen as Jamal, the young black basketball player. Jamal befriends Forester in a way that ties the film together in a spiral twist. This technique is a directorial piece of art. One can hardly overlook the strict professor played by F. Murray Abraham. He is convincing as well as dislikeable in this role. One cannot help but appreciate his talent as an established actor. Connery is equally as convincing in his portrayal. The basketball scenes are exciting, and Rob Brown gets great credit for his versatility. It is a should see movie and another directorial success for Gus Van Sant. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finding Forrester is without a doubt one of Sean Connery's greatest performances. Rob Brown truly shined in this movie and showed some incredible film presence. Originally I only wanted to watch this movie because Sean Connery was in it, but after watching the movie, I was equally impressed with Brown's performance as I was with Connery's.Finding Forrester not only is worth the time ti watch, but it is worthy of anyone's video collection. This will hopefully be the beginning of a long career for Rob Brown and just one more of many more outstanding movies to come from Sean Connery. To everyone who hasn't seen this film, watch it and enjoy the fantastic story, the wonderful performances, and always fantastic Sean Connery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is like The Karate Kid, but with books; a kid feels estranged from his new neighbourhood, seeks out a lonely old guy, who initiates him in the noble art of ... well, this time it's writing. The comparison becomes eerily close in a very silly scene that was already rather contrived in Finding Forrester's better and ancestor, the one where the skill is instilled by going through the motions. In The Karate Kid, the kid had to paint the wall to learn effective karate movements; in Finding Forrester, the teacher lets his pupil punch the keys of a typewriter.I suggest you watch The Karate Kid instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insulting disappointment that cuts corners.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of supposedly intelligent film that employs a quality cast and seemingly conscientious premise but is irretrivably sloppy and cliched. A prodigy film about a promising teenaged writer from the Bronx, it even employs the synonomous participle to Good Will Hunting and Finding Bobby Fischer. Unlike those films, it relies on and never moves beyond a hackneyed premise and shortcut cast (Sean Connery as a secretive wise mentor and F. Murray Abraham as an embittered authority figure). The film's protagonist is buffeted between the two older men in a plot that is heavily derivative of Scent of a Woman (including the implication that private school denizens are mostly petty and amoral). Vaguely trying to show that bright African American youths at risk can be straightened out with guidance from old, famous white guys with time on their hands, this movie ultimately says nothing insightful about maturation, race, class or the process of writing. A waste of time that insults the films with which it would associate itself.</fullReview>

His early obsessions with drug addicts and underage male prostitutes have mellowed into milquetoast in-the-closet tales about attractive and gifted young men who require the guidance of a much older man.

		<fullReview>FINDING FORESTER is best described as GOOD WILL HUNTING meets SCENT OF A WOMAN. Since the director Gus Van Sant directed GOOD WILL that wouldn't be surprising. That the film looks like a nickel and dime NYU Film School Film is. If it were not for the immense talents of Sean Connery this film would be totally without merit.They began with an excellent concept. An African America youth, a terrific basketball player, happens to be brilliant and well read. In his public school he is a C student. He does just enough to get by, but here is the hook, but NOT enough to get noticed. Jamal Wallace is comfortable having his ghetto friends believe he is rather average, but after he scores high on some city wide academic tests he can no longer hide the truth. This point could have and should have been made in the first ten minutes. Then we should have been launched immediately into the story of the boy discovering Connery. Instead Van Sant lumbers aimlessly for what seems an eternity bringing in superfluous characters and situations. All the while utilizing the worst cinematography I have seen in years. His hand held camera is in constant unsteady motion. Some might think it gritty or arty, it made be seasick and as a result you never have a chance to focus on anything on the screen.With a tighter screenplay, better casting and a bigger budget this could have been a wonderful film. With all of the experienced actors there are out there why Van Sant chooses to use a totally talent free young man in the pivotal lead is beyond me. His total lack of experience is being trumpeted on all of the magazine and talk shows to amaze us. I suppose. After seeing the film the only thing that amazed me was that I had paid seven bucks to see such an amateurish performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finding Forrester is without a doubt, one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It's about friendship, family, loyalty, hope, dreams and I could go on and on. But most of all it's about two people who find each other, two people who save each other. The more often I watch this movie, the more I learn to appreciate it and I see more and more what it's really about.Many people I've talk to think it's about how Jamaal saves Forrester, but really they save each other. And that's what friendships are all about.I think the actors are great, especially Rob, who had never acted in his life before he got the role as Jamaal. I really want to see much more of him in lead roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Connery's best drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well acted movie, a great movie about finding your dreams. Great family movie without the crude language, and sexual suggested scene. Brown play his role with great skill. Connery gives another wonderful performance. A must-see, don't not miss Finding Forrester.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta be an Oscar for Sean here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery got into our hearts as James Bond, and over the years he has mellowed like a very, very fine wine. One of my favorite scenes is where Jamal is looking at the cover photo of the young Forrester on a book jacket, and it's one of the more famous Bond publicity shots (minus Walther, of course). If Sean Connery doesn't get an Oscar for his portrayal of the reclusive Forrester, then there ain't no justice in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The plot was good and the characters were very real. Sean Connery and Robert Brown (XVll) were excellent choices. I loved the seasoned against the fresh. And the intellect was refreshing. Oh my I just realized I just saw a movie with no outrageous sex, no obtrusive violence, and hey I didn't even learn any new swear words, hope it stays in the theaters long enough for you to see. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As an author of six best selling books, I found this to be one of the best films of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best films of the year! After reading so much about the movie and the boy who got role by happenstance. It was an absolute delight. The story was well done and Sean Connery remains one of the crown jewels of the acting profession. As a writer myself, I enjoyed the entire concept from start to finish. The boy was simply spectacular and this with no acting experience. I loved seeing F.Murray Abraham and miss seeing him for such a long time. I hope this gets him to make more movies. He was great as well. Highly recommended and certainly oscar worthy for the movie and the principal characters as well</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max is the man now dog! On a more serious matter though, I'm commenting on Sean Connerey's movies.He is nearly a god in the eyes of my peers and I.It is truly an inspiration to see someone who can be a movie star and not be Joe Hollywood; Much like Han Solo's actor (his name escapes me at the moment however.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, without it, we'd be sitting in the corner watching Ebaum's world all day. (Inside joke regarding the fan community of this movie) I really felt that the actors were (for the most part) at the top of their game in this picture.The only performance of his that trumps this one is the one given in DragonHeart as the voice of Draco.May God rest your soul Sean...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I wasted 3 dollars on this total piece of crap. I can't think of one good thing about this movie. Dialogue was horrid and despite average showing by Connery the acting was bad too. This Rob Brown character was pathetic, I mean come on people don't patronize that crap performance. This being his first job is very apparent. I also can't believe Damon cameoed this piece of crap. Oh well, the bright side is that with time machine technology we may be able to delete this movie from existence. That is all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER Finding Forrester is about a black teenager named Jamaal who loves nothing more than playing basketball with his boys. There's an apartment building overlooking the court where he always plays, and he notices a man who always watches them. One night, Jamaal breaks into the man's apartment on a dare, and accidentally leaves his backpack there (Personally, if I were to break into someone's apartment, you better believe that I wouldn't be taking my bag off, but that's a movie for you). Anyways, the man returns the bag, and when Jamaal opens it he sees that the man has been critiquing his writing. Intrigued, Jamaal returns to the man, and he and William eventually become friends. Meanwhile, Jamaal recieves a full academic scholarship to a private school in Manhattan due to incredibly high test scores. At this new school, he meets Claire, the movie's token love interest. This movie is about as dull as you can get. Everything that I summarized above happens within the first half hour or so of the film, and you're left sitting, waiting for some interesting revelation to happen. My attention wavered many times during this film (which I was forced to sit through in careers class) because I found it to be unbelievable and boring. Firstly, the actor portraying Jamaal had zero charisma. I didn't like or relate to him in any way. Sean Connery was poor, too. I didn't believe a word of the dialogue coming out of either of their mouths. And the love interest? Yeah, I didn't believe for a second that they really liked each other.Nothing all that interesting happens for awhile, unless you mention Jamaal and William's "field trip". I don't, because it wasn't all that interesting. Finally, towards the end, Jamaal is accused of stealing some of William's writing, so Ol' Will goes to the school and gives this big speech. Then *gasp!* he says that Jamaal didn't copy, and that he was really reading Jamaal's work! Wills decides to go to Scotland, and this is the only remotely interesting scene. Why, you ask? Because of Matt Damon's brief cameo. He plays William's lawyer, who tells Jamaal that William had cancer and died in Scotland. Hmmm... that sounds very familiar. One movie with a similiar ending? Y Tu Mama Tambien. My entire class knew, even before Matt spoke, that William was dead. How predictable. All in all, I don't recommend this movie. Boring, predictable, unbelievable... need I say more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good drama about finding your way in (and back out) of the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant almost totally makes up the fact he made a terrible remake 2 years ago (Psycho) by going back to what he does best- drama. Like Good Will Hunting, this film has a young person who has a gift and is good at it, but needs the right direction from a teacher. That is pretty much it even though that's the main theme. While in the other film it dealt with a Boston math genius who gets help from a therapist, here in Finding Forrester, a Bronx writing genius gets help from a person who wrote one book and went into the dark. This person is Forrester (played by Sean Connery in one of his more unbelievable roles) who is found, by accident of course, by a brilliant though pretty much unknown writer named Jamal (Rob Brown in a good breakthrough). They make a deal, and soon the two deal with not only some personal issues (like in Will Hunting), but also in social issues. It has it's most powerful moments with Connery and Brown as the pupil and mentor as they sometimes have there roles crossed. Not great, but I'm glad I got to take a peek at it. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to watch "Finding Forrester" in my English class, and I thought it would be the most boring movie in the world. To my surprise, it was one of the best. I guess sometimes a drama can be fine. The part I really hated was the end when you find out that William Forrester (Sean Connery) dies of cancer. It was so sad that I cried. I'm glad it all worked out for Jamal though. My only thoughts are......did Jamal ever get "Sunrise" from Forrester's apartment. I want to know what happens next. Does anyone know if they are ever going to make a sequel? If they do that would help me out a lot with all of my many many questions. I rated this movie a 10 out of 10 because it surprised me so much!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only good thing in this movie is the acting of Sean Connery, he really keeps the story straight. This is for the rest a movie without soul and without a touch with reality. You do not become a writer because you are gifted and when you are gifted you cannot be gifted for something else like basketball. It is just that being gifted with the art of good writing is very rare. I did not like the movie because of its overall sentimentality and its slight touch of racism involved against rich youngsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't for the life of me figure out what possessed Gus Van Sant to take on this material. It's a rehash of Good Will Hunting with a weaker script. The movie is long, very slowly paced, and completely predictable. It features some really bad acting, especially Jamal's nemesis on the basketball team. F. Murray Abraham is phoning in his own rehash of Salieri, the bitter, untalented artist in a position of pseudo-power. Finally, if Jamal is such an incredible writer, why don't we ever get to hear his words? Obviously the screenwriter wasn't up to the task of writing the material that would inspire the kind of awe that this kid's prose is supposed to elicit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly inept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, which is a strange copy, of the far better Good Will Hunting is probably the most inept movie about literature thus far. It basically gets EVERYTHING wrong, and it is hard to go into details about here. Obviously the producers have counted on an audience who does not care about literature anyway, so why not just ridicule it - that might be more in the taste of the audience. Moreover, the story is so so inept and without meaning or purpose. Good Will Hunting is not a perfect movie but it, at least, had some psychological credibility. Finding Forrester has about as much credibility as Ghost Busters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Find Me A Good Enough Reason For Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts off in the same way as I`ve been taught not how to write screenplays , a slow start with no hook . It`s difficult not to notice that all of Gus Van Sant`s films start off in the same way . Isn`t there something wrong with this ? As a great number of people have noted this movie is just a cliched remake of GOOD WILL HUNTING . Rob Brown plays Jamal Wallace a 16 year old kid from the ghetto who knows everything about anything . It is very possible a homie could be so erudite on subjects as diverse as English grammar and the history of BMW ( Though it is unlikely ) , but the main problem is William Forrester a man who was once world famous after writing his one and only book . Think about that for a moment he only ever wrote one book and he was famous . Adolph Hitler wrote Mein Kampf but he`s infamous for his deeds not his words . Stephen Hawking wrote A Brief History Of Time but he was already a renowned physicist , helped by the fact that his book became fashionable because it was above everyone`s head . So can you name anybody in history who is famous for writing a grand total of one book ? I know I can`tSean Connery is always a good reason to watch a film but he never really makes enough films that deserve him and you can add FINDING FORRESTER to a long list of disappointments . It`s not a terrible film but is rather cliched , slow and predictable . If you want to see a good movie with Sean Connery and F Murray Abraham watch THE NAME OF THE ROSE instead</fullReview>
