		<shortDescription>Did the screenwriters even read the original story by Wilde?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not a single thing inherently wrong about adapting old stories in new and surprising ways. Unfortunately the writers removed all of the original class and gender subtext in the original story and then added naked ladies. Really that's all there is to this adaptation. Some unusually bland acting goes with the bland writing. I have a feeling the actors knew the movie wasn't going well, took the paycheck, and just went a long for the ride.I have to express some discontent that some others say this adaptation does justice to Wilde's story. I just don't see that at all sorry. This is "lowest common denominator" kinds of movie making. The good news is that this is the sort of movie that disappears in a heartbeat after a quick release to DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about the Picture of Dorian Gray becoming a movie I was excited and overjoyed. I thought with this new technology the 21st century has, The Picture of Dorian Gray will receive the justice it deserves. However, I was very wrong. I just finished watching the movie and I felt compelled to write a review about it.The movie was horrible. A grand disappointment which had such potential to be great. Firstly, the movie should have claimed to be inspired by the novel not based on it. I say this because the movie was very different from the novel. All of Oscar Wilde's wit and beauty which truly made the novel classic was ruined and overshadowed by the changes the movie made. I understand that there can be biased when reading a novel before seeing the movie adaption, but this movie adaption was appalling. I wont give anything away but the movie seriously ruined Oscar Wilde's vision and above all his memorable characters. Once the movie changed aspects in the novel the whole thing became horrible. Trust me, you'll agree if you've read the novel first. Ben Barnes is simply gorgeous but he hardly brought any character development. I never felt pity for him throughout the movie compared to the novel. The novel brought the characters to life and described the reality of London life. The movie made the classic novel very shallow. I must add that as much as I love Colin Firth he was not convincing as Lord Henry. The character was someone who was vindictive and unchanging. He drained Dorian and was never affected by the consequences of his own evil; Colin Firth failed at reincarnating the abhorred character. Whats worse is that the whole ending is changed, which ruins the whole message of the novel. In the end, Oscar Wilde's masterpiece remains legendary in its pages as opposed to its film adaption. Seriously, I think my rate of 4 is being to generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy it for what it is: A picture show and nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Picture of Dorian Gray, as penned by the Irish wit Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900), is a tale of high-brow debauchery and limitless pleasures of body and soul and the corruption, by one Lord Henry Wotton, of the young, handsome and soon to be narcissistic 19th century rock 'n roll hell-raiser Dorian Gray.Ealing Studios have translated Wilde's controversial novel into a celluloid den of iniquity that somehow comes across as rather shallow. Like the characters seen here too; it seems that as a work of symbolic gesture of how the upper classes conduct their sordid lifestyle of hypocrisy, deceit and lust it lacks any deep and thoughtful intrigue that any good 19th century Gothic horror story should be.To fully understand the ethics of a Victorian London that Oscar Wilde has so wonderfully reflected with his novel here, we see, too, with this latest interpretation using, as Wilde may have done, the picture purely as a metaphorical means. Yes, we see the selling of souls here and the lamb to the slaughter and the hedonistic teachings of Lord Wotton, but toward the end, the whole sordid affair becomes predictable.Penned with an undercurrent of realism and too fantasy of the love of sin. It's a dark, dirty, dingy setting of a self-indulgent Victorian London that we are lead to believe is prim and proper on the surface but lurking just below this weak, temperate society lies pure greed, greed for experience, experience that will transcend the mind, body and soul to the wondrous dealings of what life has to offer. For, as always, a price, a price both Oscar Wilde and Dorian Gray would pay the highest sacrifice.It is with a taint of sorrow that this latest performance too has paid a price too high, sensationalism over content, ironies aside, the film seems too concerned to show the sordid details of this lifestyle and its inhabitants'. It lingers on too far in the bedrooms of London and strays too far from the mental anguish that may have been. We see the trouble mind of our young (looking) man but we see not enough of his fears, regrets, sorrows and repentance, which are cast aside and squandered. Welcome to the 21st century Mr. Wilde.By the time the chimes of time are echoing in the distance we have Dorian fading into the far reaches of the eternal abyss of the afterlife. With all the time in the world we are still wanting more to feed our palates, it's all to aesthetically pleasing, but at the same time oh so unrewarding, a taster we are given but the full flavour we are, regrettably, spared.This too may have its target audience and in so having picked its target out it may have trouble standing the test of time, due to its lack of wit, lack of diversity and a lack of daring and commitment of its original source. It is a sad loss that such a literary work of historical meaning and wealth should have been robbed of its qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising concept. Horrendous execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is inevitable that when any classic novel (Oscar Wilde's being no exception) is adapted for the screen, certain liberties will be taken to make it an engaging story to an audience present for 2 1/2 hours. In this 21st century execution, Oliver Parker includes an interesting theme certainly real in Wilde's Victorian era and widely discussed on the social AND artistic scene today: the failure of paternal figures. The longing for an admirable father figure serving as Dorian's ultimate Achilles' heel is a fascinating theory to draw from. It could've certainly presented itself as a unique theme to distinguish the film from Albert Lewin's 1945 version.Unfortunately, this is all completely drowned in gaudy pornographic material (not dissimilar to the undoing of "Caligula"), overdone special effects, and terrible performances.Ben Barnes is arguably a very promising actor who could've effectively played the role within a few years of performative maturity and growth. In this film, the lack of the aforementioned makes his acting painful to watch. At this stage, he simply lacks the severity and command of the famous character's evil to be believable. Barnes is weakly tossed from scene to scene and presents very little to persuade the viewer.The most appalling performance comes from Rachel Hurd-Wood as Sybil Vane. It is perplexing as to why a more mature, capable actress couldn't be chosen to play the role instead. Hurd-Wood, probably due to lack of experience and performative maturity, is simply incapable of convincing anyone watching that it is a winsome, naive theater girl we're seeing. One of the first rules of acting is to live and be the role, NOT anticipate from line to line (which she does obnoxiously every moment she's on-screen) Mercifully, she's only present for 15 minutes of the film, but it's enough to be among the greatest of the film's flaws.Not even the remarkable Colin Firth can save this travesty of a film, as his Henry Wotton fails to emit convincing sinisterness that his mere words will corrupt the young Dorian. When he illogically changes his tune in the film's final 15 minutes, it only leaves awkward confusion and embarrassment. Understandably, this could mostly be the fault of the director drowning character study in favor of saccharine visuals, yet Firth is certainly capable of doing better even when his characters have limited screen time.Granted, a film discussing the theme of self-indulgent hedonism will depict occasional free love, just enough to get the point across as to what the central character is up to. Pornography running at the rate of every other scene, however, is too much. Parker has made the mistake assuming that this is necessary to appeal to a 21st century audience, figuring the vast majority lack the intelligence to have understood long ago that this is among Dorian's long list of vices. A few scenes of the character smoking opium in a burlesque was already serving this purpose. The theme then plunges into the annoying with unnecessary (and terribly performed) scenes of mid-ball rendevouxs and orgies that smack of pathetic attempts at convincing eroticism.Another item to note: Wilde's novel was notably controversial during its time for its homeoerotic overtones. In this more tolerant age, the visual beauty of male characters and settings is enough to represent this very theme Wilde presented. The addition of an absurd snog between two characters (which not only strays from the plot's logic but also glaringly from the relationship dynamics depicted in the novel) once again betrays Parker's belief that audiences are too stupid to gather the homeoerotic elements already present.A portrait that moans and emits maggots like a hungover zombie might frighten those who've been spared years of horror movie parodies. In watching this film, the scenes with the ever changing picture provide an embarrassing orientation to this, enough to have Wilde spinning in his grave. No sooner are syrupy pornographic scenes temporarily not on-screen than the film is dragged down again by overdone special effects that have been the undoing of many, many movies in recent years. A director of Parker's caliber should've been aware of this long ago. Thus, there is absolutely no excuse for this to be present in a film that is intended to carry a theme deeper than late 90's movie era eye-candy. There are no words to describe how utterly ridiculous, even border-line laughable, the ending to this film is. In brief, it competes with the over-the-top, embarrassing ends of various characters depicted in "Van Helsing". Once again, visually (already mentioned as ruining this film). If Parker was attempting to end this picture with a bang distinguishable from previous versions, he renders it a complete joke. There is certainly pornography available that costs less than the price of a movie ticket. Corny special effects 101 can even be obtained for free in many places. That said, anyone interested in this rendition of Wilde's work should save his money.Oliver Parker has directed some exceptional films. This one, disappointingly, is greatly under par having resorted to cliché special effects reminiscent of cheap horror flicks and squanders artistic talent.What a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>picture perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have to admit, i had my doubts about this movie at first. After reading the odd couple of reviews, i wasn't entirely sure if this film was for me. i am not a fan of horror and, like quite a few people i suspect, was put off slightly by the "horror" classification that most reviews seemed to mention. However, as it turns out, it is not like your conventional thriller.i have never read the book, and so i cannot compare it to the film, but the story was extremely enjoyable. A young man who trades his soul to the devil in exchange for eternal youth and beauty, after seeing an incredibly lifelike portrait of himself, does not seem entirely unrealistic given todays cult of appearance-obsessed celebrity youth, and in fact most of the film stuck to the realms of reality. Set against a beautiful Victorian style backdrop of London, the film managed to mirror life through a visually delightful time period that managed to modernise itself in its content, and maintained a nice contrast between light and dark throughout.I was also throughly impressed with the casting. Ben Barnes was the perfect choice for Dorian Gray himself, managing the conversion between the innocent young man, to the seductive charmer, to the fear-possessed psychopath effortlessly. Add that to the fact that he is breathtakingly perfect, and even as an audience you begin to be drawn into his youth and extreme beauty. Colin Firth was unlike anything i've ever seen him in before, much in contrast with his cheery "mamma mia" role, as he played Dorian's enticer, lord henry. Harsh and often sexist, he very much had a "frankensteins creator" character, desperately striving to corrupt Dorian's innocent nature. Ben Chaplain was also good as the creator of Dorian's special portrait, Basil. And then of course there were Dorian's two main love interests, Rachel Hurd-Wood and Rebecca Hall, both of their characters bringing contrasting characters to Dorian's affections.As for the content of the film, it had what i believe most good films should contain - a shock. And it certainly shocked. It opens with a scene which you are certainly not expecting, but succeeds in capturing your interest for sure. It then falls into a kind of lull as we meet the innocent and gorgeous Ben Barnes, but then hypes up again as we are introduced to rude and obnoxious Colin firth. The film continues in this fashion for the majority of the time, with a few unexpected shocks along the way as Dorian begins his soul destructing spiral. There is obvious sexual content but it is certainly not excessive, and plenty of mild drug and alcohol abuse too, although again the film does not go overboard with these. Also, there is a reasonable amount of gore, although not enough to spoil your enjoyment of the film, and these moments are also fairly obvious and so the squeamish (including myself) can simply close their eyes during these short scenes. The only other thing to mention is the horror which occurs at the end of the film when Dorian's painting reveals his mutilated soul. I personally didn't watch this bit and would certainly recommend to those who don't enjoy being scared to not watch it either, as it is apparently rather intense, but again, it is also fairly obvious of when it will occur.Dorian Gray is a fabulous, fast paced drama-thriller that provokes thought into our own "celebrity" lifestyle and the pressures we put on appearance, as well as a visual description of the price of eternal beauty on the soul. I would definitely recommend this film - it is truly picture perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been puzzled by the negative reviews i've seen for this as i really enjoyed it. It looks superb, with some excellent atmospheric Victorian locations. Ben Barnes is perfect as Dorian, good looking but not bland &amp; still sympathetic throughout the film. The character of Emily which has been invented for the film works very well, and Colin Firth is magnificent in his pivotal role. Dorians gradual deprivation is well shown without heading off into exploitation and he is given real depth. His tragedy is very obvious.I must admit to not having read the original book as yet, but I do intend to now. I really enjoyed it but for its full benefit I recommend seeing it at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant - until the last 20 minutes where it becomes the picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The end of this story is like a perfect diamond that completes a beautifully crafted ring and the producers of this film replaced it with a cheap zircon.It was to be expected I suppose, books are never transferred well on screen, yet that is as infuriating as when Fran Walsh diddled with the character of Faramir for whatever selfish reasons. Sadly, the movie started so well, which doesn't justify that choppy conclusion.Colin Firth's character 'Henry' was absolutely let down in the end. He was NOT supposed to be remorseful, certainly not for the sake of a daughter that did not exist and frankly, it's about time the myth that some gormless, gap toothed, opinionated girlie is the answer to a corrupt man's redemption, provided that man is appealing. Even at a strain, I do not see how her presence suddenly blotted out a lifetime in Dorian's memory, bringing the overwhelming need to become 'good' again. Dorian Gray never chose to repent, his portrait certainly didn't CG itself out of the frame and nobody set it on fire.Just to set the record straight, the whole purpose of this story is to show the unrepentant, forever handsome youth, who's only concern is the existence of proof of what he's done, the destruction of it being the all too human fallacious belief that if something is out of sight, well, you guessed. He chose to stab the portrait and was then FOUND dead, a disfigured, revolting old man before a splendid portrait. A magnificent end the movie robbed us from, all for the sake of having a magic, purifying GIRL.I wonder if Oscar Wilde would have been as incensed by the ending of one of his best works as I was but since he can't protest, perhaps the voice of one of the fans of his work and particularly this novel, will do. It is unfortunate that, like the portrait in the story, the movie begins marvelously and yet by the time it concludes, one wants to take a blade at it, in the vain hope that the original story may be redeemed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This disaster could have been avoided if the director had a Sassy Gay Friend, or at least a copy of the damn book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Problems with this movie:1. Ben Barnes as Dorian. I guess he's kind of good-looking in a gawky sort of way, but he's not blindingly gorgeous and charming enough to seduce every man, woman, a child in the British Isles. In fact, he's kind of awkward.2. The whole plot line with Sybil is just....FUBAR. I don't even know what to say about it, other than to wonder whether the director actually read the book or not.3. The boobs-to-intelligent-discussion ratio is alarmingly high.4. Remember in the book how Basil had a lot of great lines? Well, that's all been replaced by bitchy glares and an awkward blow job.5. When Dorian smells the bloody scarf after he kills Basil. I don't know, I guess it's a petty thing to complain about, but it just made me laugh hysterically at an inappropriate time.6. The ending. Where did that even come from, seriously. I really want to know whose idea it was to completely change the whole second half of the plot, because really, if you think you can write Dorian Gray better than Oscar Wilde did, you should be lobotomized.Good things about this movie:1. Lord Henry. Spot on.2. They have some really nice costumes.3. Um...no, that's about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughably Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hardly know where to start describing just how bad this movie is. First I will say that the movie, especially the first half, feels terribly choppy and rushed. The relationship between Dorian and Sybil, for example, from initial meeting to marriage proposal, to break-up and suicide is covered in the space of TWELVE MINUTES. This is including the scenes in between in which she is not involved. The director probably could've put a montage of them running through tall grass and painting each other with paint rollers while giggling merrily and it would've done a better job of establishing this relationship in believable fashion.I feel like the director just wanted to get it out of the way so that he could spend as much time on the lurid details of Dorian's life as possible. Director: What? I have to provide an explanation? OK here goes...Dorian: hi I'm Dorian want to get married? Sybil: yeah sure **2 days later**Sybil: you slept with a whore! I'm going to kill myself!Director: OK now that that boring storyline garbage is out of the way I can get to the S&amp;M sex montages, murders, and a painting that actually GROWLS AND HISSES.Which brings me to my next problem with the movie; the cheesiness and unbelievably heavy-handed symbolism. The first time that we actually see a heavily altered version of the painting hidden up in the attic, the camera zooms in on the painting and yes, it actually hisses at the audience. I feel that this is a massive cop-out on an attempt to create a frightening and tense atmosphere. It is as if the director was unable to use lighting, shot framing, scenery, etc. effectively to create the atmosphere which he desired, and decided instead to have a ghost pop up on screen and yell "BOO!" at the audience to startle them into a state of fright.The symbolism is something I would expect to see from a first year film student. The montage of S&amp;M sex scenes inter-spliced with scenes of Dorian spreading jam on a biscuit made me burst out laughing. Possibly the most obtuse symbolism I've ever seen in a movie takes place when Dorian seduces Hallward at his party while some kind of sexually charged African drum dance involving a large snake takes place downstairs. That's right, snakes look kind of like a penis, and they're representative of sin! BAM! Double the symbolism! I was so convinced in the final scene where Lord Henry speaks to the painting that it was going to blink or start crying, I'm sure someone talked the director out of that one. I wouldn't even have been surprised to see a caption saying "Dorian is in the painting" with an arrow pointing to it.A great deal of Oscar Wilde's sharp wit is cut from the story, and what does remain I would call the most redeeming factor of the whole movie. There are still a small handful of wonderful Wilde quotes that will have you laughing and thinking, but you can save yourself the trouble of viewing this travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent modern adaptation, does Oscar Wilde justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended the World Premiere of "Dorian Gray" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Starring Colin Firth and Ben Barnes, this newest adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic Gothic horror story was directed by Oliver Parker from a Toby Finlay script. Set in Victorian England, Gray (Barnes) and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton (Firth) embark on an adventure that will lead them down paths they could never have imagined. I'll leave it at that for those unfamiliar with the story."Dorian Gray" is definitely a crowd pleaser. Ben Barnes is on screen almost every second from opening to closing credits and is frighteningly brilliant as the titular character. Together, Barnes and Firth carry the film.As a period piece, art and set direction are unsurpassed. Roger Pratt's cinematography flawlessly places the viewer into the hazy London setting and the costumes are stunning. Capturing both the deplorable conditions of the urban poor as well as the debauchery of the moneyed class is critical and perfectly executed here.Parker's take on the story is dark and surreal, placing slightly more emphasis on the real than imagined. Today's technical abilities allow the images to be more explicit than in the previous black and white version of the story, so visual and special effects are dramatic and effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Oscar Wilde's novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, Dorian Gray is a compelling story about a young English nobleman who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for eternal youth. The story begins in late nineteenth century England, where Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) has just inherited his familial estate following the death of his father. Gray is young, naive, and wholly innocent, at least until he befriends Lord Henry Watton (Colin Firth). Watton is an avid believer, though not a practitioner, of a hedonistic lifestyle. Every pleasure should be sampled, every desire indulged. The young Dorian Gray is completely taken in by this philosophy, thus begins his long, slow decent into corruption and madness.Early in Dorian's slide, Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) paints a stunning portrait of Dorian Gray. So remarkable is the painting that Gray agrees to exchange his soul for the eternal youth captured in the picture. Thus the picture becomes a mirror, reflecting the quality of Dorian Gray's soul.Both Ben Barnes and Colin Firth turn in terrific performances. I particularly liked Ben Barnes' transformation from naive young man into a cruel, murderous monster who has remained timeless as the world grows old around him. The sets are spectacular, showing all the splendor of nineteenth century England, mixed with the Gothic horror that becomes Dorian Gray's life. Dorian Gray is a fantastic cinematic adaptation of a classic novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really troubling version of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a young aristocrat arrives in London and begins to indulge in a life of hedonism and excess, he finds he doesn't age physically despite trying to harbor a deadly secret that will shatter his image forever.This was a dull, utterly horror-less Horror/Drama that, once again, falls victim to that one singular, nearly inescapable aspect of recent British horror films, a dreary pace that drags stuff out far longer than it should by showcasing scenes that have no horror in them yet are supposed to be presented as such. Watching a person drink, smoke, do drugs and engage in orgies with highly unattractive women while everyone around him wonders why he still looks the same isn't horrific, yet that seems to be the entire crux of what passes as horror in the film. That the mystical painting isn't shown at all until the end might have something to do with that, and the total lack of explanation for such an event is also glossed over, and it's not until the final ten minutes that something starts happening, and while it's good stuff with the reincarnated spirit and the grand old-school Gothic burning-down-the-house scenario, it's too little too late.Rated R: Violence, Nudity, sex scenes and drug use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haven't read the book in years and was very much looking forward to watching this but from the opening shot I knew I was in for a big disappointment. It looked and felt like an episode of a period TV series, even making the first shot a quick flashback to last weeks episode. It felt like a cheap dated effect.Drab lifeless lighting throughout the film managed to make some beautiful sets and costumes look flat and uninteresting. Surely the warmth of candlelight would give someone in the lighting department a bit of inspiration, a chance to increase the sensual feelings necessary for a lot of the laughable debauchery scenes? Pedestrian, bland, painted by numbers, adequate acting but it all lacked a decent script, an editor who gave a damn and grr maybe a bit of soul? Occasionally it lifted itself up out of the mire (probably scenes from the beginning of the project) only to come crashing down again as everybody got bored and even more disheartened.I was astonished to find how quickly I got bored watching this which is such a shame as it could have been something so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unsurprisingly handsome portrait of a man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish, good-looking and presented in the best possible light - the movie of Dorian Gray can be described with exactly the same words befitting it's titular character.Directed by Oliver Parker, this is a filmed adaptation of Oscar Wilde's novel "The Picture Of Dorian Gray", a supernatural tale of a handsome young man who ends up being given a great gift indeed, eternal beauty and youth. It's all thanks to a painting that he protects, a painting that takes all of the ravages of excess and time upon itself while the young man portrayed can get up to what he wants without a care in the world. And what Dorian Gray (played by Ben Barnes) eventually wants is . . . . . . . well, anything he can get really. Drink, drugs and sex. His reputation soon precedes him. He even starts to outpace the man who first introduced him to the many pleasures of the flesh (Lord Henry Wotton, a marvellous turn from Colin Firth) and that takes some doing.Mixing the lavish stylings and the accessories of the upper classes with the grimy, earthy textures of the drunk, the drugged and the debauched, this movie provides a great balance and also lets the viewer vicariously pick up on the sensations that end up impressing Dorian so much before things turn inexorably sour and start to darken.There's no shying away from the more adult content either as the young man beds his many conquests and does so with no sense of attachment or remorse for those cast aside afterwards until he finds himself unexpectedly affected by his predicament when he fears that his soul may have gone beyond saving.The cast are all very good although nobody comes near Firth for quality. Barnes starts off believable naive and his transformation is well sold, Rebecca Hall is lovely, as is Rachel Hurd-Wood, Emilia Fox is very good, then there are fine turns from people like Douglas Henshall, Johnny Harris, Ben Chaplin and many others.The whole thing reeks of quality and uses a great mix of audio and visuals to immerse the viewer in Dorian's world of decadence. I have not seen other adaptations of Wilde's book but must say that this one was about as good as I could have hoped for, having read and enjoyed the source material so much. Great stuff.See this if you like: The Picture Of Dorian Gray, Dorian Gray (1970), Valmont.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no justice for Oscar Wilde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the film the other night and all I can say is that I'm very, very disappointed. If you are a fan of Wilde, DO NOT WATCH THIS. If you have not read the book, then you might like it. All the wit of the author is lost upon this movie. The Dorian they found (Barnes) has just a bit more expression than a stuffed doll. I'm sorry, but he doesn't do justice to the part. If you want to have a truly "wilde" experience, then read the book. Oh, and Dorian does NOT sleep with half of London society. His moral decay is hinted at, and precisely because of these hints the author gives, you can actually feel the fear and fascination people have for him. I also strongly suspect that Dorian never really loved any of the women (it seems to me that he liked boys more). This is his tragedy: a constant struggle with himself, with the demon inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely Twisted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first read the book and absolutely loved it, so I was looking forward to the movie in order to materialize the writing, but I was really disappointed. First of all Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray! definitely not a good choice, the original Dorian Gray of Mr.Wilde is elegant, beautiful and has an aura of purity and innocence about him, which the actor fails to display. The Dorian Gray in the movie seems unintelligent and apathetic, his emotions are plastic and fake. Although it is not surprising that the movie has twisted the story as it has been done countless times before, the fact that some of the most significant concepts of the original story have been altered bothered me, such as displaying the portrait to the public eye! I dare say the story began with Basil, the painter, not wanting to show it to the public since he believed he had put so much of himself into it and then of Dorian's fear of anyone seeing his soul! HUH! not to bore and bitter you with my criticism. anyway the fact that the movie had distorted the original story to a great extent bothered me and the characters are very dull and lifeless compared to the book. I prefer Oscar Wilde's version hundred times more. Hope this review has been helpful. Rin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Barnes a surprising performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed it quite well, being vaguely familiar with the story. The movie should be evaluated on its own merit as opposed to comparing it against the original story or other movies made of the story. Ben Barnes did a good job playing the evolution of Dorian when he first arrived in London to that of a corrupt heartless man towards the end. Ben Barnes has unusually dark eyes which help with the whole man-of-mystery persona. Colin Firth did a good job as the man who led him astray although his role was a bit subdued. The period costume was also nicely done with attention to detail throughout. The house where Dorian lived also did a good job showing the contrast between Dorian's societal standing versus the whores and even his first girlfriend that he brought into the house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Version of Oscar Wilde's Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of his grandfather, the naive and pure Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) returns to the Victorian London, where he befriends the talented painter Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) and the corrupt Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth). Basil paints Dorian's portrait and gives the beautiful painting to him while Henry corrupts his mind and soul telling that Dorian should seek pleasure in life. Dorian makes a deal with the devil, trading his soul to keep his beauty and youth, while his picture ages and displays the effects of his corrupt life. He leaves his fiancée Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood) that is pregnant and commits suicide and lives a self-destructive life of orgies and drugs. Dorian Gray travels abroad for many years and when he returns to London, his friends are aged while he is still the same. When Dorian meets Henry's daughter Emily Wotton (Rebecca Hall), they fall in love with each other and Dorian wants to revert his life. However it is too late for salvation and his soul that is trapped in the painting is doomed. "Dorian Gray" is an enjoyable version of Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. When I was a teenager, this novel was one of my favorites; I do not recall details of the book, but I liked this adaptation a lot that has a wonderful cinematography, great acting and a good screenplay. The relationship of Dorian and Sybil should be longer and better developed, but to adapt a novel to the screen, it is necessary to have the capability of being concise and the screenplay writer never disappoints. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Retrato de Dorian Gray" ("The Picture of Dorian Gray")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing and shallow adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is, The Picture of Dorian Gray is pretty much unfilmable. The 1945 version was close to doing it justice, but changes must be made whenever an adaptation is attempted. Still, when I see a new version coming out, I hope that it would bring more to the table than this sorry affair.Oliver Parker is apparently thinking less of Oscar Wilde and more of himself with every adaptation. The very same director who did a fantastic job with very loyal and conservative adaptations of An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, strayed this time so much from the source material that it's barely recognizable - and I mean less the plot, and more the atmosphere, the message, the smart dialog and the fascinating characters who made the original novel so compelling. Parker chose instead to focus on the horror and erotic elements of the story, making it a pretty standard Dark-Side-of-London Victorian era horror film, perhaps in a feeble attempt to cash in on the success of From Hell and Sweeney Todd - and at its worst moments, it feels almost like a Twilight follower. Though the production values are clearly pretty high - cinematography, costumes and sets are all pretty good - they're also uninspired and completely lacking in originality.Even worse are the cardboard characters and the shallow horror-movie dialog that replace the witty and dark banter Wilde was famous for. Ben Barnes is a very weak Dorian, showing no emotion or development over the course of the movie, but it's not solely his fault; Colin Firty gives his whole to a very complex and interesting character, but it's not enough to make the dialog ring with any kind of depth.Thanks to a solid production and a couple of good actors, Dorian Gray is watchable, but just barely; and when it's supposed to be darkest, it's the most ridiculous. A pointless adaptation of a classic piece of literature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I gave up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A frustrating, irritating CGI'd mess, filled with swirling cameras and predictable orgy scenes that ultimately failed to accurately portray Victorian London or the contents of the book. In between bouts of depravity people wander around in Victorian clothes looking very pretty and completely lost. Ben Barnes is neither pretty enough, nor possessed of sufficient character to be the eponymous Dorian. In his hands, Gray is lifeless and somewhat uninteresting. Sybil Vane appears, there is no chemistry, and she drowns herself after his rejection. There are no reasons for his rejection, he just rejects her and she drowns. In the book the reasons for Sybil's suicide are more complex and interesting, and her death is through swallowing poison not drowning. After that incident the film careers downhill with the brakes off. Unlike the source material it is devoid of any kind of personality and just limps on. Basil the artist goes in the river in Gray's truck, which any number of people could have identified, yet miraculously Basil's body is found. There is no rhyme or reason to any of it, rarely has Colin Firth been as dull as ditch-water, but he is both boring and irritating in this story. There is no sense of time passing. The action of the story takes place over at least a couple of decades, there is no suggestion that this is the case. Unfortunately, the complete lack of time-line, charisma-free zone, and just the sheer tedious drudgery of it put me off to the extent that I did not make it to the end. My advice, if you want a ghost story of significance, this is not the one for you. If you are looking for Dorian Grey, Stuart Townsend played him with verve, wit and charm in The League of ExtraOrdinary Gentlemen.</fullReview>

Other than the scenery, there was nothing particularly enjoyable about this. Not all movie-goers (esp me who is female) care to see gratuitous sex and body parts. It is insulting to my intelligence that they think I can't grasp the story unless I'm fed visuals like a first-grader. Like one reviewer said, Wilde would be turning in his grave.

		<shortDescription>What a waste of pretty costumes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it seems they have taken some liberties with adapting the story from the original novel, which sadly for Hollywood films, almost always leaves the movie just a bit worse than than the book. My first thought about the movie after the ending was : "well they had some gorgeous outfits".Though Dorian depicted here wasn't what I expected (I expected a life- size porcelain doll), Ben Barnes was nevertheless charming and did keep my attention during the film.The portrayal of Lord Henry was exactly what I expected and fun to watch, but not as nearly as interesting as reading his words from the book.The actress playing Sibyl Vane was beautiful, but her storyline was completely ruined, she wasn't given any personality and they cut out one of the best parts from the book: the real reason why Dorian breaks off the engagement(which is not her nagging about him going to the club, but her obsession with his love) which signifies the start of him becoming shallow and eventually evil.What lacked in this film was more of Wilde's philosophy, charm and Lord Henry's paradoxical opinions. I guess they had to cut all of that out in order to make room for a couple of sex scenes and a pointless subplot about Henrys daughter Emily, which of course did nothing good for the film. I know that literature back in the 19th century was subversive, but good Lord, they really read between the lines. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't remember Dorian sleeping with half of London in the book. They also dedicated a few seconds to advertise autocompany Fiat which ddidnt exist at the time.One more thing, the musical score made the film sound like a horror movie.The photography, the visuals and production design were amazing, but it is a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more than a painting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) is a young naive man arriving in Victorian London to live in his newly inherited mansion. Artist Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) befriends the newcomer. The cold-hearted Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth) leads him astray especially from his love of sweet young actress Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood). Basil paints him a portrait and he proclaims a deal for his soul.This is a cold stiff unimaginative movie. Ben Barnes is barely a pretty picture but he is certainly not much more. His character is not interesting enough to be compelling. The movie has no excitement and barely any tension. It limps along with as little drama as possible. Colin Firth plays with so much anger in his eyes that I find none of it appealing. If he was charming, then I could see the appeal. Everything in this movie moves at a tired pace. It is moderately watchable... barely. There are problems inherit in the story. Sibyl Vane comes and goes so quickly that their love feels superficial. The relationship doesn't have any time to develop. Rebecca Hall has slightly better chemistry as Emily Wotton. Her character is slightly more complex and most importantly has more time. Overall, the movie just isn't very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A half-hearted affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorian Gray is the sort of film that receives a lot of hype at its release, including the promising new acting talent, and then quickly vanishes into obscurity, in this case taking the 'promising new acting talent' with it, never to be seen again.Both, the film and Ben Barnes, clearly failed to live up to people's expectations. Nothing against Ben Barnes personally, he may be a good actor but talented is something else. Good looks just aren't enough. I don't want to go into too much detail here about how it's not the most faithful adaptation of the novel, etc., but watching Dorian Gray you get the impression they were trying to come up with a fresh interpretation of Oscar Wilde's famous novel, but didn't quite know how to go about it.The one thing keeping this film from being a total let-down is Colin Firth (no surprises there), although it has to be said that his performance is a bit more lacklustre than we're used to. Still, he hopelessly out-acts everybody, most of all Ben Barnes. The kid just doesn't stand a chance. Colin Firth has the only script worth mentioning, although his character's pretentious one-liners do start to grate half-way though the film. Other than Firth there is nothing in or about this film that stands out, or makes it a worthwhile exercise.In a nutshell: it's bland, it's boring and it does test your patience on a few occasions. Dorian Gray is not the kind of film you should have seen at some point in your life. If you have, chances are you'll have liked it, but are in no rush to see it again any time in the foreseeable future ... or, indeed, ever. It's the kind of film you want to watch relaxing on an evening, without having to think too much, and then feeling afterwards that you should've watched something else instead. It leaves you strangely dissatisfied.Worth a look but ultimately leaves you wondering, 'why did they bother?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK film, bad adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film some days after I read "The Picture of Dorian Gray". If you watch the film and haven't read the book, you will probably find it an OK movie. However, if you have read the book, this adaptation will leave you disappointed.The original storyline by Oscar Wilde is very good, so I do not see why the adaptation went so far from it. I have nothing against a modern touch, but here the original ending is changed to a large extent. If the author wanted a girl to change Dorian, or a whole new second part, he would have written it himself.The character of Basil had some very strong lines in the book, but in the movie he just seems like a weird artist. Also, the scenes which show Dorian among naked women were, to me, totally irrelevant.However, I have to say that Barnes was OK as Dorian. Even if he could have shown some more character development, his acting was not bad. Also, Firth was really good as lord Henry, I would like it if he had more lines.I'd give a generous 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been better...don't know how though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather visually appealing adaptation of the book, Dorian Gray fails on most other aspects. For those who haven't read it, it is a rather short novel about a young noble who has a portrait of him made and through reasons never explained, the portrait is supernatural, aging and visually deteriorating while Dorian stays the stud that he is, no matter how many years pass and how many evil deeds he perform. It is a nice idea and the book is a rather nice read. But, was a screen adaptation really necessary? I mean it is a short book and not that much happens in that sense. The movie stays true to the book, in a sense the slow descent of a handsome and promising man into a decrepit life within the facade of the lavish and luxury life of the rich. The environments are well detailed and the characters are well played out but to be fair, there is very little to them. Dorian's betrayal of Sybil(who is played by maddeningly pretty Rachel Hurd-Wood) is so glossed over and artificial and although Ben Barnes portrays him as charming at first, the character is not all that appealing to watch. In the book the portrait is never illustrated in full detail, you have to assume what becomes of it as time passes. Here you see the creepy thing and worse, the movie treats it almost as a horror movie object, with groans and twitches emanating from it.(admittedly freaky) All in all, I did not like the movie, because there is just so less to see in it, most of the scenes are padding between the portrait being painted and what becomes of Dorian. Nothing interesting happens in between and Colin Firth is non-existent even with his usual charm and quirks, he could have been the perfect Mephisto to Dorian's Faust yet he plays the role poorly. Not bad, but not worth the time either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-glossed adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even before one gets onto the mixed performances and self-consciously edit-propelling of the story I was somewhat put off by the oleaginous slick of the HD in which this adaptation of Wilde is filmed. For a tale that pops out of the shadows - with its supernatural themes, hallucinatory episodes, nightlife scenes and the simple chiaroscuro of the (book's) titular picture - this is too well-lit, too glossy a film.In addition to this I found Ben Barnes' Dorian a profoundly neutral character. Metaphorically botoxed by his unwitting compact with his portrait it's as if the actor has assumed the same attitude in front of the camera. It doesn't help that Barnes is surrounded by some pretty strong performers in Colin Firth, Fiona Shaw and latterly Rebecca Hall; I might also mention Johnny Harris' James Vane, a strong showing in such an ensemble cast, and the all-but cameo of Maryam d'Abo (whose beauty, ironically, even prosthetic ageing cannot disguise).The nail in the coffin of this exercise may well be the snuff-movie comic scenes of sex and gore. I also considered whether Oliver Parker's excessive grip on the story is some extra layer of overdeterminism to further stretch the sense of the meta, the occult that the film toys with. I doubt it. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's 1 given to announce first here: the hardest part of a making a great movie is creating a great story. Oscar Wilde has already created a great story and it is not reflected in this movie one bit.Perhaps as a standalone movie for people who have not read "The Picture of Dorian Gray", this might be passable, but to watch the horrific and lazy alterations made to the original story was unbearable.This is more of "A Dorian Gray story" I suppose; but it really is quite terrible. The casting is often odd too - Sybil Vane is horrific. Ben Barnes makes an excellent Dorian Gray, and Colin Firth makes a good Lord Henry by appearance, but his character is so unlikable and dry - he's quite hilarious in the book and it's a shame that he isn't in the film.Essentially, this is a vulgar and lazy remake that is not worth watching.

		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film two days after I finished reading the book. In short, it missed out every single thing that makes Oscar Wilde's book great. As well as the subtleties, it misses out the great speeches, and even fails to enforce the real themes in the book to any depth. Henry, Dorian, and Basil's characters are poorly explored and established, which I would say is a massive part of the books appeal. This is further enforced by very poor acting! I was dubious about Colin Firth's suitability for the role, but with some more time i believe that he could have worked, but the scripts didn't allow it. Dorian's character possibly has the look, but depth of acting just wasn't there. I'm hardly a film critic, but this is my opinion. Incredibly disappointing to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very much wish I could take back the hour and fifty-two minutes of my life that this movie robbed from me. I have read the book and I have seen the 1945 rendition of the book, and I must say that this abomination should not even be called "Dorian Gray". Now, I remember bits and pieces of the book and it has been a few years since I saw the 1945 movie; but, why is Dorian such an awkward goose in this movie? Dorian should be gregarious, even when it comes to new company. He is pleasant, well-spoken, and charming even WITHOUT his looks; however, in this movie, he stutters all over the place and does a horrendous job portraying somebody who is youthfully ignorant and superficial. Dorian should be all about his looks and just goes giddy over the simple things in life because he cannot see past his own nose in terms of planning ahead in life. It's all about the "now" for him, so why can this so-called "Dorian" at least LOOK like he is young, carefree, and a little bit up in the clouds?This movie skips past important scenes that actually give character development and more-or-less focuses on how many sexual situations they can throw Dorian in to make girls squirm in their seats. The scene where Basil is painting Dorian's portrait with Henry watching is the point where Dorian sees Henry as a cool person to follow! The numerous episodes with Sybil which shows that Dorian has no idea how love works! If this was a normal movie, yeah, go ahead Parker, do what you wish, but don't pull that mess with a classic. You look tacky and make a good read look boring.Why is this movie so dark and dreary? This is a "moral-to-the-story-is" type tale not a Twilight 2.0 tale. There are no vampires in this story, you can cut the whole dark and mysterious look because Dorian, as a character, is not supposed to be "dark and mysterious" character. For all things right, Dorian is bright with his golden hair and blue eyes!Even if you have not read the book, this movie is bad just because it runs like a soft-core adult movie. There is no character development, scenes skip from one event to the next with no reason for it, and it all just seems like a rush to get to the "juicy" parts. If you have read the book, just stay away from this abomination, you would HIGHLY wish you did so.Also, it is LORD HENRY WOTTON. HENRY. Not HARRY. If your actors cannot get the NAMES right NUMEROUS TIMES then you need to find a new actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just having read the novel the second time, I also wanted to see how this works on the screen - so I put the DVD in the player.. BIG mistake. The movie features nice pictures and decent playing - but the PLOT!!!! I am flabbergasted, how one can take Oscar Wilde's masterpiece, remove everything interesting and fascinating, add random meaningless crap and call it a movie. There is nothing wrong about altering a book for a movie to make it more accessible in "modern" times, but that does not mean that such a great book should be raped in a merely brutal way. Sure - the original has chapters that I'd have gladly seen to be omitted. Still, the movie just did the book SO wrong - the characters have been changed / perverted in so many ways... I do not mind the introduction of some daughter, but how Dorian was introduced, how the relevance of Sybil Vane for him was (shortcut/ridiculed/stripped/argh)... I lack words to describe my disappointment. The murder of Basil - it is not only an important chapter in the book, but it also meant Dorian to cross the border to being evil - in the movie, I do not know what it meant. The "country girl" in the book, which Dorian "spares" attempting to be good (in a vain way) - replaced by some depressing love to a woman that accidentally happens to be Lord Henry's daughter (oh, what a twist.. HA!). Lord Henry, the man who is not bad by definition but simply denies any moral - turns into a caring father for the sake of this parody of a plot. Oscar Wilde, I am sorry to have given money to those morons that created this joke. For anybody not having read the book - enjoy the movie, it is not really THAT bad by itself, I think. But for me, it was the worst disappointment I ever had, watching a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is generally accepted that a book will always outdo its inspired films and this movie is no exception. It fails to even scarcely live up to Oscar Wilde's novel. In fact, the movie is so poorly executed and has altered so much of the original story that it might as well have been titled "Screw You, Oscar Wilde." This film is utter garbage and a a complete waste of time. All of the author's profound, memorable and beautiful characters have been re- written to become shells of their former selves. The shy, romantic Basil Hallward, who was so completely devoted to Dorian Gray, became a flat background character with as much love for Dorian as a jealous, horny teen with a stupid crush. His death was neither haunting nor pitiable. Sybil Vane, a talented actress whose beauty was beyond compare, was played by an actress with no talent whatsoever. Funny that the loss of Sybil's talent was never really portrayed in the film. Dorian himself was played by an actor who should have never been casted. Although Ben Barnes is a very handsome young man, he barely matches Wilde's description of Dorian. Couldn't they have least dyed his hair blonde? His dark hair and pasty skin made him look more like and Edward Cullen clone than a beautiful Adonis. Additional characters didn't help to save the movie either. Emily, Harry Wotton's supposed daughter, was boring, but laughable, with no absolutely no personality or charm. Adding her into the mix ruined Harry and Dorian alike. Harry went from being a comedic, carefree fellow to a typical, over-protective dad. Dorian went from being a manipulative, selfish and cruel individual to a misunderstood boy who just wanted to be with his lady. I mean, really? This is what they came up with? It ruined the ending of the movie entirely. Dorian was supposed to die as he was: a terrible, corrupted soul. Instead, he says farewell to a woman he is in love with. A cheesy, overdone and predictable ending to a terrible movie.There is no chemistry between the actors and their acting is stale. Although it was shot well, every second of this movie makes it look like a cheap Tim Burton rip-off, from the scenery to the characters. The pacing is horrible; the scenes are far too rushed. The script is cheesy and all of the romance the novel possessed was swept under a rug. There was nothing that saved this movie at all. It was just one big mess of crap. Just stay away from this movie and pick up a copy of the novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another adaptation of Wilde's renowned novel about a young man named Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes in the title role) whose portrait ages while he remains eternally youthful . It starts with Dorian who arrives in London to move into the mansion he has inherited . Almost immediately he falls under the influence of rake Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth), leading to a life of increasing vices, excesses and even violence . Through many years Gray stays as youthful visage , while a painting made by Basil (Ben Chaplin) grows old , reflecting his increasing perversion . Eventually the portrait, now secreted in his house, shows worms and a horrible vision . When his true love (Rebecca Hall), the Henry Wotton's daughter, ultimately enters his life he realises he must hide his secret at all costs, even killing . Dorian retains his young-looking as ever while his picture shows the corruption physical ravages of aging guarded in the attic and becomes almost hideous to behold.Modern-day take on of the known story by Oscar Wilde about an ageless, fresh-faced young man whose portrait reflects a life of debauchery and the ravages of time . This features Ben Barnes giving a nicely restrained acting at the beginning and excessive on the final. Good performance from Colin Firth as calculating and amoral Lord and gorgeous Rachel Hurd-Wood as unfortunate actress . Rebecca Hall is particularly appealing in the lead as Emily Wotton . Large support cast is frankly well as Maryam DÁbo , Emilia Fox, Fiona Shaw, Caroline Goodall among others . This rendition not nearly as good as the original classic and contains sex inserts throughout the movie . Although talky and sometimes slow moving , this movie nevertheless keeps you glued to the screen for its nearly two hours running time creating a foreboding sense of terror accompanied by a frightening musical score. Excellent and dark cinematography generating a chilling atmosphere made by the magnificent cameraman Roger Pratt . The motion picture is professionally directed by Oliver Parker , though with no originality . Other versions about this famous story are the following : The vintage version directed by Albert Lewin and starred by Hurd Hartfield , Angela Lansbury and George Sanders ; European version (74) by Massimo Dallamano with Helmut Berger , Maria Rohm ; and TV version by Glenn Jordan with Shane Briant and Nigel Davenport .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London as the hellhole of the nineteenth century - yet again, sex, drugs and rock n roll. A good trailer then for 'Sherlock Holmes' - except this is about real good and evil and its consequences. Or it should be, but isn't. I never believed Gray's corruption, even if Colin Firth is a tempter par excellence, as Mr Barnes just looks the part and women cannot help themselves but lift their skirts for him. In fact, Dorian Gray just drifts through the film like a slightly bored teenager (why didn't they go the whole hog for the USA and make him a real slacker with Seth Rogen or Will Ferrell in the lead?). I saw the movie on an aeroplane - did I miss any really good orgies or porn? or was it all just non-erotic sex scenes that didn't deliver? Redemption is around somewhere at the end with the Colin Firth character seeing the error of his ways because his daughter is about to fall into the clutches of Gray, but Mr Barnes can't save his performance or his character as the picture is finally revealed complete with worms! By this time I was past caring and wondering how warm it was going to be in Orlando! And what happened to Emilia Fox's character, apart from showing how one could fall in Victorian times (unfortunately there was no Oprah or Jerry Springer to get the whole family together to forgive and apologise!!!!!!!)? A strange film that I am glad I never had to pay to see. British film making dies another death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather failed adaptation of Wilde's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very curious about the adaptation of what I consider one of the best pieces of English literature, mainly because, besides the worldwide known plot, what distinguishes the novel and makes it difficult to be adapted for the screen is the subtlety of Dorian's character, and the complexity of relationships.After a promising beginning, which seemed to be well focused on the three main characters, Dorian, Basil and Henry, the movie gradually shows a precise intention by the director to reduce the moral corruption of the protagonist, which is the core of the novel, to a mere sexual perversion, rendered in terms of orgiastic, opium intoxication, which I found really excessive for the viewer to stand, who has perfectly perceived that his corruption included also sexual life but, not only. Moreover, I found this choice quite inadequate for a modern public, unfortunately overwhelmed by sexual references in today's society, I think that other aspects, such as the relationship with youth, and beauty could have been exploited to get a more modern appeal.As far as the cast, Colin Firth is really good, his interpretation is subtle and credible, the young Ben Barnes playing Dorian does his best, but he has too an angel-face, a more mature and experienced young man would have been more suitable. Female performances are quite insignificant, at least underdeveloped throughout the story, and not given enough space to make an impression. The general atmosphere is rebuilt with sophistication, undoubtedly outstanding some locations of 19th century London, as well as some inner settings, although sometimes exceeding in mannerism, and darkness, and too claustrophobic.As a conclusion, a rather failed attempt at adapting a great novel to a movie produced, probably, with the aim of attracting a modern audience with strong and still excessive visual effects (in the end, Dorian's hideous portrait showing his corruption awakens like a monster in a too spectacular way), and erotic scenes which drown it to a kind of sexual horror-movie, incapable of giving justice to the greatness of the Wilde's masterpiece. The only merit, that of making one feel like re-reading the novel, in order to appreciate its writing, and, unfortunately, to discover new flaws in the movie.</fullReview>

I never read the book so i don't know how close the book is to the film but i must say the writer has done a great job updating this, with a story that really grip you.The directer has done great job making it very dark but not too dark you can't see thing. Making feel like you are in back street of London in 1800's. The casting was top notch with newcomer Ben Barnes and an really outstanding performance by Colin Firth. Was really surprised to see Ben Chaplin from the comedy show "Game On". He is not bad drama actor too.You can really connect with characters in this film which it make it really interesting film to watch and an story that alway make you think. Must see.</fullReview>

Only then is it Advisable to give this one a Go.Because the 1945 Film is Infinitely Better and the Book is, well, The Book. This Movie's Watchability is Only So Because of the Witticisms and Cynicisms of Oscar Wilde. Otherwise this Mediocre Movie is Nothing More than a Bad Version of a Good Hammer Film.It Relies on Nudity, Bloody Violence, and Modern Cinema Trickery to make this a Product of its Time and Persuade Current Audiences that this is Hip to the Jive of what Today's Moviegoers Expect. But it is done Without Much Style and is Rather Pedestrian.Ben Barnes as Dorian and Colin Firth as His Mentor Henry are Adequate Both, But the Film is Forever Pushy with its Ridiculous CGI 3D Painting and Long Sex Scenes that Bury the Story with Excessive Overkill that is Frankly a Bit Boring. The Things that make the Classic Book and the Better Forties Version So Much More Rewarding is Charm and Style. This One has Precious Little of Both and is a Middle of the Road Exercise that should Only be Seen as a Curiosity after Experiencing the Aforementioned Book and or Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was never enchanted with Dorian Gray in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I am what you made me! I lived the life that you preached... but never dared practice. I am everything, that you were too afraid to be."Dorian Gray is the third film Oliver Parker has directed based on the work of one of the greatest Irish writers of all time, Oscar Wilde. "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is Wilde's only written novel and perhaps one of his most famous works which was censored at the time due to the source material. It has become a masterpiece for Wilde's sharp critique towards the aestheticism of Victorian society. This double life that Wilde's novel captured perfectly didn't really resonate with me in the film. I found it un-engaging and dull with characters that weren't developed really well. Dorian is completely hedonistic and there was nothing about him that made me believe that the people would be so sympathetic towards him. This double life he lived wasn't explored as well in the movie because everyone saw him as he really was, young and beautiful but completely hedonistic. Lord Henry Wooton's influence on him is the main theme in this film as he is the one that introduces Dorian to this lifestyle which he immediately embraces. Despite its good production, I felt the film wasted its potential and lost its appeal quickly. The screenplay was loosely adapted by Toby Finlay. The film begins with the arrival of the young Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) to Victorian London. He has inherited a huge estate from his abusive grandfather. Dorian is a nice and naive young man who is quickly swept away with the charismatic Lord Henry Wooton (Colin Firth). Lord Henry also feels attracted to Dorian and reminds him to take advantage of his beauty and youth because it won't last forever. He introduces Dorian to the several pleasures the city has to offer. Lord Henry is married to Lady Victoria (Emilia Fox), but he isn't faithful to her. Lord Henry's artist friend, Basil (Ben Chaplin) also feels admiration for Dorian who hires him to paint a special portrait of him that will capture his youthfulness and beauty. When Basil finished his painting, everyone is entranced by it and it becomes one of the painter's best work. Dorian adores it so much that he makes a pledge saying that he will give his soul to maintain that youthfulness forever. As he becomes more and more obsessed with the painting he begins living a life of debauchery and hedonism. Nothing affects him, as the painting absorbs all his scars and unveils what his soul truly looks like. Dorian hides the painting and lets everyone see him as this beautiful and youthful young man.Ben Barnes gives a decent performance but his character did lack more depth. It was very difficult to engage with him as he becomes completely obsessed with maintaining his youthful appearance. I couldn't see that spark that I needed to see from him to believe that all the Victorian society would become so obsessed with him. Colin Firth is a great actor and he played a key role in this film as he is the main influence for Dorian's narcissistic obsession. However I never felt this guy could have such an important influence in Dorian's life, he was lacking that magnetism. The addition of Rebecca Hall's character in the second half of the film didn't help either. I couldn't help but feel this film was missing something and it fails to draw the audience in. Dorian Gray is just too explicit in its portrayal of debauchery and nothing is left for the viewer to imagine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks nice, goes on a bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DORIAN GRAY suffers from the same problems as other recent adaptations of Victorian-era novels (I'm thinking the 2011 BBC dramatisation of GREAT EXPECTATIONS): it looks great, but in the screenwriters's attempts to present relevant themes and concerns to modern day viewers, it loses something in the execution. The result is more often than not a production in which the actors look like they're playing dress up while there's no real heart involved.I've never read The Picture of Dorian Gray, but the central conceit ? about a man whose portrait ages but not himself ? is a great one. This adaptation is ho-hum, and that's because we don't care about any of the characters involved. The anti-hero Gray is played by Ben Barnes, who was fine as the square-jawed youthful hero of PRINCE CASPIAN but who really struggles to find depth in the part ? any male model would have done the same job. Colin Firth is more interesting as an amoral creep, although he's largely detestable. The only character I really liked was Ben Chaplin, and he gets far too little screen time.There are other familiar faces in the cast ? not least Fiona Shaw, Maryam d'Abo and Emilia Fox ? but they get lost amid a welter of repetitive sex scenes designed to show the central character's descent into moral depravity. Unfortunately, with the overly long running time, the sex bits are repetitive in the extreme and the film goes nowhere with them. The movie is far too Hollywood friendly to ever be really shocking, and the late-in-the-day attempts to make amends just don't hold water (and neither does Rebecca Hall's anachronistic suffragette). It all ends in a CGI bubble of silliness, and you're left wishing for a proper adaptation with real bite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who picked Ben Barnes for this? He was OK in Prince Caspian, but he's completely wooden here. I know he is meant to stay the same while the picture changes, but Barnes seems to have interpreted this to mean that there should be little or no character development at all. He takes part in some debauchery but is otherwise much the same.As others have noted, Colin Firth and Ben Chaplin are good in this, but they cannot save a film where the main character is a dud.The whole thing could have been done in half an hour. Most people watching will know the story more or less, so there is little tension. It just drags its way to the inevitable end.Don't bother with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is atrocious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen any other Dorian Gray adaptations, nor have I read Oscar Wilde's book upon which this movie claims to be based. But I can hardly believe there would be any worse adaptation than this one, and that anyone could do a poorer job out of having such a rich material to adapt as Wilde usually produced.The movie tries to be a fable about the choice between pleasure or morality, and where each path leads up. There are some good lines and thoughts, no doubt coming directly from the original literary source, which invite us to reflect on our choices in life, and which of the paths is more fulfilling, at the end. It aims to be a reflection -and a deep one, at that, I can imagine- on the futility of hedonism and the pleasures of the world, and of what is needed in order to get back on the "right track".However, the movie fails in every possible way. I believe it is heavily weighed down by a poor, poor choice of the main actor -his acting is wooden, and he just doesn't convey any of the powerful emotions that he is verbally claiming to feel -his feelings of love, exhilaration, anguish, etc. are completely unbelievable. We hear him say he is feeling those things, but his acting is so cold and insufficient, that the character -and, therefore, the whole movie- suffers very much from it. Add to that the inexplicable addition of Rebecca Hall's character, which never really fits into the movie (and, in my opinion, is another bad casting error) and you'll have two leading roles that are a pain to watch. Colin Firth, on the other hand, is excellent as the insidious friend who leads Dorian into a life of dissipation, and he composes the most interesting and ambiguous character in the whole story.Secondly, the movie lacks pacing, tension, and cohesion. We witness Dorian Gray's rise and fall, but it all feels cold and lacking the passion that such a story requires from the director. It is just a series of episodes that are vaguely connected to each other by the main character. There are several orgy scenes sewn up together, probably to spice up the whole thing, but they are just thrown in and they become ultimately boring to watch, giving the impression that Dorian Gray is basically a promiscuous dude with some substance abuse, at least most of the time.The end finally comes a bit out of nowhere, and again, it is as lame as the preceding 100 minutes.For such a publicized and ambitious movie, this is a huge disappointed, and a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never a substitute for a good book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dorian Gray" is supposed to be based on "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde. Although I have not yet read the classic novel, I can assure you it shares none of Wilde's intelligent, captivating originality. It is "based" on the novel the same way the TV Series "The Tudors" is "based" on the life of King Henry VIII. It just uses an historical hook as an excuse to show sex, blood and naked breasts.As it is just an independent film, the production value isn't particularly high. The extravagant sets which are often required in Victorian-set films are lacking which makes the atmosphere pretty much non-existent. None of the characters?which had already been written for them by Oscar Wilde?had any interesting aspects about them.There are supposed to be "hidden" meanings like the superficiality of society, but that thought isn't all that hidden, or original, or consequential. Everything was boring, drab and ultimately empty. Go to your public library and borrow a copy of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray", which is exactly what I'll be doing now. As this film has reiterated, there is never a substitute for a good book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bullshit; spoiled Oscar Wilde altogether; watch the 1945 version instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the book "the Picture of Dorian Gray" twice and have watched more than two adaptations of Dorian Gray before I come across this one. This latest version is utterly bullshit. I was about to laugh out when I read one review entitled "does Oscar Wilde justice". Does the reviewer read any Oscar Wilde at all? Is it possible, that one of the most celebrated authors of the Victorian era(which is characterized by its comparative prudishness) would compose a book of lust and eroticism?In Wilde's original Dorian Gray, he focused on the mental and internal progresses and controversies of various characters; and especially regarding Dorian Gray, Wilde wrote nothing whatsoever manifestly related to sexuality.This version of Dorian Gray, on the contrary,emphasized on a variety of corporeal adventures experienced by the protagonist. I would fairly say this movie is more adult-video like than the notorious Japanese adult video. Why wouldn't the producers of this version entitle it "our interpretation of Dorian Gray as the Victorian Casanova?"Dorian Gray is not a sexy flirt. He is rather naive, and truthful. I remember reading an account of his relationship with a theater actress. The description is rather moving, and quite "spiritual" to an extent, meaning that there's no discussions on the corporeal side of their relationship. Yet in the movie, as far as I can see, the producers put a huge effort to emphasize the physical aspects of Dorian Gray's various relationships. Is it allowed to stain Oscar Wilde's classic so outrageously???? To judge fairly, the movie might be a good movie if those people don't call it "Dorian Gray." Call it whatever they like, but NOT DORIAN GRAY. DORIAN GRAY IS NOT PROMISCUOUS; HE'S NO DON JUAN I ASSURE EVERYONE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The novel is like a play itself; it's one of those books that would look best on the screen just as they are, line by line.Far from that, in the movie, they make a very bold -and unrealistic, from my point of view- interpretation of Lord Henry Wotton's character, and some serious changes in the story development.Scenes that looked great in the book were changed with no apparent object but the desire of being original, and other good scenes from the novel simply didn't make it into the movie.While eroticism in the novel is only suggested with sharp delicacy, it adds some explicit, unstylish scenes to the movie.Only good thing I can point out is Colin Firth's acting. I already thought he was perfect for the role before knowing about the film.The story is so different from that of the book that I'm really amazed at how some people dare say it's as good an adaptation as they could expect. It's not just that I have seen far better than this in other book adaptations, but this is really one of the worst I have ever watched.Finally, since, besides Colin Firth's acting, everything good about the movie is what little was taken from the novel -and also looked better in the novel-, I must say this movie has no credit of its own, therefore, I consider it terrible.</fullReview>

To me, the best thing about this movie was the acting. Ben Barnes is completely riveting and I'm not some teenage girl that things he's just so cute. He had such a strong on screen presence, I almost confused him with Ben Whipshaw who did a movie called "Perfume" and both actors in each of these performances are exceptional. It's fun to watch period pieces for the set design and costumes. Again, this movie did not disappoint. I have read Oscar Wilde's story and always found Wilde to come across as a bit enamored at his own cleverness. This script flows. The dialog comes across as witty and not pompous.

		<fullReview>Mostly praise for this film. The script, acting and costumes were really great. The women were especially good, given this is a male-centered film (written by a hedonistic gay individual - not that there's anything wrong with it!) Colin Firth's hypocritical hedonist is scene stealing. Ben Chaplin's Basil is also very convincing. The problem is that our lead character's acting chops don't measure up to the two supporting actors. I'm not labeling Barnes as a bad actor, he'll likely develop into a fine one. But given the disproportionate number of scenes with Barnes and/or Firth and/or Chaplin....well....the disparity in skills becomes apparent. Barnes is not all to blame. We never really see the "change" in Dorian; e.g., he seems to go right from being naive and good-natured into a Mr. Hyde in the blink of an eye - despite the obvious attempts of Firth's character to debauch. Still, there's enough here to enjoy, including generous portions of sex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manages to avoid every single thing that was great about Wilde's only novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not often moved to write reviews here, I read them quite a lot but I believe this might be the very first I've bothered writing. I'm sorry it's not a happier occasion:On IMDb occasionally, you'll find the odd gem that hasn't quite achieved aggregated greatness when played out across the masses - and maybe scraped a 6-7. This is definitely not one of them. Having conscientiously avoided this film I finally succumbed and rented the blu-ray version; somehow watching it in high definition made it's myriad flaws all the more grotesque - not unlike the Picture of Dorian Gray itself. That though is the only similarity I could find to Wilde's fantastic fable.Quite why Oliver Parker decided to focus on pretty much everything that the book has so subtly hinted at is anyone's guess. The (perhaps only noteworthy) cover review was from Cosmo and, frankly, from beginning to end this is a film designed to titillate the gossip column reader. A more polar opposite to the original audience for which Wilde intended it, you'd struggle to find. I was gripped with an almost suffocating ennui as soon as it began it's wild departure from (Wilde?) the book and by the midway point I could barely muster the enthusiasm to sneer at the ludicrousness of it all.Were I to try and highlight the elements so sorely lacking when compared to the Wilde's brilliant craft and wonder, I might be mistaken for someone who cares about this film. Essentially though, a great story has been poorly translated into a tragic missed opportunity. This story carries none of the gravitas of the original - in fact it barely even resembles it. It's utterly dire and clumsily grabs odd lines from Wilde's text, placing them crudely in hackneyed scenes that sully their artistry.If you've read The Picture of Dorian Gray, read it again and hope that someone, someday does this again with the flair and panache it deserves. Joe Wright, Saul Dibb or even Jean-Marc Vallée perhaps could create something that might erase the painful memories of this debacle. Though I like Colin Firth, Lord Henry Wotton should be Stephen Fry every day of the week (and pretty much is I think.) As for Dorian, well, I can't possibly blame Ben Barnes for the characterless fool he plays here but Wotton's brilliance in the book was illustrated by his ability to manipulate a young man who was naive but also articulate and intelligent. Traits that Barnes avoids quite deliberately.If there were a picture of this film I'd stab it in the hope that Oscar Wilde devotees should never stumble across it with the same prying curiosity that I did. Rest assured, this is to Wilde what He's Just Not That Into You is to Shakespeare. Avoid, desperately.</fullReview>

For the most part its very well acted by the name cast that includes Colin Firth, Ben Chaplin, Fiona Shaw and Maryam d'Abo. However in the title role of Dorian Gray, Ben Barnes, leaves little impression. He seems to have been cast not because of his acting ability, rather because he looks good. This isn't to say he's bad, he's not its just that he comes off as rather bland and not really compelling even when he's deep in the dark side.

Colin Firth has great fun with his role as the corrupted Lord, Ben Chaplin is his usual beautiful mournful self as the love-lorn artist and Ben Barnes is simply gorgeous in the title role, not really stretching his acting wings but he puts in a good performance. He is very well cast as the eternally youthful and good-looking Dorian Gray. The female leads suffer, only Rebecca Hall is given decent material to work with and tries ably with her role as the love-interest and Dorian Gray's saviour. The cinematography is stunning, evoking Victorian London beautifully. All in all, Dorian Gray is a beautiful Gothic Horror. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"No object is so beautiful that, under certain conditions, it will not look ugly." - Oscar Wilde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dorian Gray', directed by Oliver Parker, is definitely a more graphic adaptation of the spirit of the book written by Oscar Wilde. Throughout, I wondered how Wilde would react to the film, were he still with us. On one hand, I believe he would have appreciated the touch of horror; I certainly felt it in his writing. He was quoted from another of his books (Lady Windermere's Fan) "In this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it." In this movie, the latter was certainly true for poor Dorian.On the other hand, the book 'Picture of Dorian Gray' seemed fairly minimalist in affect (as was Barnes' interpretation of the character) so, would Mr. Wilde be a smidge put off by all the melodrama and overt sexual content? Who knows? He used a lot of symbolism and subtle innuendo in his writing, but the politics of the time could account for some of what he didn't literally spell out, I suppose. After all, he was imprisoned for his lifestyle and beliefs, for a time.Wilde lived a deep and complicated life. His personality and character were revealed through his writing and oh, what I would have given to be on his list of friends. "A good friend will stab you in the front." -- Oscar WildeAlas, the book, in this case, pleased my pitiful imagination more than the movie. While the acting was superb, I had a difficult time reconciling myself with what I felt was an over-reach on the tenor of this great story. You know, the old 'less is more' adage. My disclaimer to the literary elite: I am simply an appreciator of art, not a professional, so take my opinion with a grain of whatever you prefer."I don't say we all ought to misbehave, but we all ought to look as if we could." -- Oscar Wilde</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's enough of both directorial punch and flair on top of a feast, visually, for this incarnation of Wilde's novel to come through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorian Gray is a passable enough tale of a man whom sinks deeper and deeper into an abyss of self gratification; misogyny and pride, it is a film from the London born Oliver Parker whom has explored various roles of a writing; acting and directing nature over the years and is furthermore an adaptation of an 1891 novel by a certain Oscar Wilde. Ultimately, the film does a studious job of detailing a man's gradual sinking into a sordid lifestyle of ego and sin and the consequent realising of the pratfalls this entails by which time the proverbial horse has bolted. The study is played out behind lavish cinematography and an effective eye for the respective period it's set; where director Parker disappointed with his last film: the leery, overly sexualised and highly charged 2007 flop St. Trinian's, he hits the right notes in 2009's Dorian Gray - a film that seems to be about the consequent decline into a world full of all that, and more, but with this time something to say, eventually coming to see it just about emerge as an engaging piece of cinema.It's Victorian era England and we begin the film with the disposing of a body, in a river, after a murder has taken place - the perpetrator being none other than Ben Barnes' titular Gray doing his dirty work under this canopy of a dark, dank and unwelcoming aesthetic. We flash back to one year ago, with the film having set out its stall as to where it'll end up as a fresh faced Gray steps off of a train to brighter, lighter and more welcoming hues. The film suggests degrees of innocence upon Gray's arrival, with its using of binary oppositional lighting as a representative of unspoilt psychosis, successfully instilling a bleak and knowing sense of where the character will end up in a year's time hovering over most of the early exchanges as the immediate opening lingers.He is greeted by a Lord named Henry Wotton, played by Colin Firth, and Wotton enjoys the high life, very quickly bringing Gray under his wing of mostly sleaze and nastiness. Gray's adapting to this lifestyle comes quickly and easily, his uncannily handsome features eventually coming to represent every inch of the word as women fawn at the sight of him and both his playboy image and reputation gradually coming to precede him. The women love him; the men come to love his company and the film makes a distinct attempt to objectify him by focusing, in close up format, on both various parts and aspects of his face to get across a sense of flawlessness in this man's appearance. The trouble begins when Gray first tries to drink some gin and we observe his initiation into the very fabrics that arrive with Wotton's way of life get the better of him; he coughs, flinches and appears briefly as the centre of the laughs his contemporaries produce. As an outsider to the lifestyle and its content, the spectrum of his sinking into a newer existence is highlighted here by his initial naivety to it.Gray's beauty is captured by way of a painted portrait constructed early on in the film, a painting which comes to represent the physical manifestation of the man's soul representative of all the evil; wrong doing and immorality which plagues Gray's life. Initial signs that all is not well with both the painting and Gray's attitudes are not heeded by the man, the confining it to the attic of the large house he inhabits a shutting away or burying of righteous attitudes for a more crass living. Instead, he carves his way through the inner circles of socialite-laden Victorian London; mixing and preening with the uppers, refusing to look too regretfully back on a marriage with Sybil (Hurd-Wood) that ends horrifically. The film sees its lead channel Christian Bale's American Psycho (of both book and film infame) Parick Bateman in his facial features, mannerisms and attitudes as he swaths through life overdosing on indulgence in immorality; Bateman himself, we recall, being based on true to life serial killer Ted Bundy as that opening scene still lingers.Women come and go; nights out blur into one and death creeps into the equation as he eerily maintains his glowing looks and while time envelops those around him, Gray stays the same in his appearance and attitudes. It is the item of modernity that greets him after the first decade of the twentieth century comes and goes, The First World War rages around the world, itself being an item which signalled a jump in both technological and political modernity in its aftermath, with Wotten's daughter Emily (Hall) arriving on the scene and speaking of her want for a woman's 'vote' as well as her interest in an art form in the form of photography. But for all the heterosexual indulgences with women during the film's pomp it is Gray's relationship, or bond, with Wotton himself that presides at the core of the film. Wotton incepts Gray into the life they led and it is he whom spearheads the push for the film's final act. What keeps the film itself from being crass and indulgent itself towards this lifestyle is the constant threats and reminders linked to the engaging in what the lead Gray does. Rather than pile on all the nasty content before cheaply rounding it all off with a five minute moment of exposition masquerading as demonisation, the film keeps the aforementioned portrait looming in a physical sense above all others in the attic of the manor house as threats on his life in the meantime become prominent. Eventually, the film builds to a somewhat terrifying conclusion in which the lead is forced into confronting his lifestyle, a conclusion of which a decent enough tale that is worth seeing precedes it.</fullReview>

However, a painting reveals the cost of this pact.Great adaptation of the Oscar Wilde novel. Excellent plot, as you would expect. Edgy, dark direction, with great CGI and settings.Great performances from Ben Barnes, Colin Firth and Ben Chaplin. Colin Firth is particularly good, delivering all the quotable Wilde-isms with perfect timing and cynicism.

		<shortDescription>How Ominous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another adaptation of the Oscar Wilde story. Film is about Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes), a man taken by the hedonism bug shown to him by Lord Wotton (Colin Firth). Upon having his portrait painted, Dorian comes to never age, but at what cost?Clearly not faithful to the literary source, Oliver Parker's film is an interesting misfire. As a sexy chiller it kinda works, having more in common with Hammer Films of the 70s than with Wilde's prose. Yet it often feels like style over substance, blood or nudity for blood and nudity's sake. While strong performances by Firth and late in the play by Rebecca Hall hold the attention, Barnes is bland and apart from being pretty, is unconvincing. Also irritating is Charlie Mole's musical score, it's good, it's just not in the right movie!The makers try to make a Gothic horror film from a Gothic horror novel, but never quite get to grips with the undercurrents of the story. Shame. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start? First I'd like to warn you - do NOT let yourself mislead by the rather low rating of the movie, it deserves 8 out of 10 at least. (I really can not imagine what kind of people could rate this one less than 8.)The acting was just AWESOME! Yes, excellent and awesome. I'd really like to accentuate Colin Firth's portrayal as Lord Henry Wotton. I haven't liked Firth's acting much so far, but this has completely changed my opinion about him as an actor. Henry Wotton, the lord who teaches yet innocent Dorian how to enjoy life in bedding every woman (or man), in drinking, smoking, in being arrogant etc. Yes, Firth has captured that better than any actor would ever have.The next excellent portrayal is from the main character himself, Dorian Gray. Ben Barnes has showed us his real TALENT, and I wish him a great acting career in future. How he portrayed Dorian was just wondrous. Dorian's changing throughout the movie from the young innocent boy, to the depraved arrogant man and at the end a suffering creature of a man, whose sins come back to him to torture him inside himself. Excellent, you could just see how the character changes, and you could see that clearly only thanks to Ben Barnes's portrayal.The actors who portrayed the minor characters also did not disappoint, far from it. I'd like to highlight the acting of Ben Chaplin (as Basil Hallward, the painter) and Rebecca Hall (as Emily Wotton, daughter of Lord Henry Wotton).The sceneries, surroundings, furniture, costumes, manners of the high society people were made EXACTLY to match the touch of 19th century, when the story takes place in.It's evident from the beginning that the director Oliver Parker, producers, costume designers, music department...foreshorten, the whole crew did their job perfectly and definitely DID NOT huddle the job through.As for the music, there is always a touch of mystery tones, every time the portrait is mentioned, that makes your skin goose flesh.A masterpiece of a movie and of an adaptation (as sometimes it happen, we are not pleased by the adaptations of our favorite books), but this is definitely NOT the case.I highly recommend to watch it and have rated it highly with 10 out of 10, because the movie deserves this rating.Like my review or not, I can say for myself, I LOVED this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dorian Gray as a ghost ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oliver Parker transformed the great novel by Oscar Wild into a ghost ride speeding like a rocket. Sometimes the movie has the looks it needs to represent Oscar Wilde's time, sometimes it looks like a cheap horror flick filled with clichés about London. Of course it has a handsome Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray too, but it misses the witty dialogues, the behavior of the upper class members and so on. Sir Henry Wotton becomes a cynic wisecracking jerk who doesn't really believe in what he's saying and we, the audience, don't believe him either, in contrast to the character in the novel. The only person I really liked in the movie was the character of Basil Hallward played by Ben Chaplin, but to soon he leaves the stage.Dorian Gray (which is already a shortening of the title: "The picture of Dorian Gray) is a version for the non intellectual working class movie goers who don't have the time to read the novel nor have any interest in doing so. It is not bad to watch bad movies but there is a saddening effect. After they have watched this movie they don't pay attention to the novel anymore, because they think it's all been said. So they miss a great chance to read a great piece of literature and culture that has something to say especially in our times where we have contests for models like Next Top Model on TV and a youth fetish in the media and society. Everybody wants to stay young and fresh and powerful and beautiful.So I suggest better read the novel than watching this movie!</fullReview>

I have read the book quite a few years back and it' s one of my favourites. Having said that, I found the changes to the story in this film very plausible and interesting.

		<shortDescription>They messed up with a classic but at least we have an eye-candy playing Gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read the book. Seriously, read the book. Did I tell you to read the book? Do it. Now! It's not that this free adaptation is bad, it's just a case of taking an excellent piece of literature and transforming into something a little hollow, subverted to accommodate people who don't read books and don't have imagination, instead of just translating into a classical fashion which is a pleasure to see but the majority find it old-fashioned. If reading is really not your style (and chances are you're not even reading this review) then watch the 1945 film version directed by Albert Lewin, a true classic.The story is the same: Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) wants to keep with his youth and beauty after seeing how gorgeous he was portrayed by friend artist Basil (Ben Chaplin) in a magnificent portrait and realizing the tragic truth that is to grow old, poisoned words courtesy of cynic Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth) who keeps telling the boy to live life to the fullest. A pact is made: he sells his soul, the portrait becomes an old and decaying figure while Mr. Gray keeps forever young, indulging himself with pleasures of the flesh. But tragedy, misery and sorrow follows those great moments, hitting hard on his conscience and decomposing the beautiful face that lies in the painting. Until here, it's OK. All the famous characters were there, the fore-mentioned and also Sybil Vane, her brother James, the loyal butler, etc. But they excluded some and added some to create a different effect, signs of modernity. Some work interestingly as a way to break conventions (this time, Dorian has affairs with both men and women, in the novel he is adored by men, specially his acquaintances but there's no indication of deeper relationships); others are there to create a sense of horror non present in the Wilde's work. It would be a greater film if director Oliver Parker wouldn't turn this into a MTVesque kind of project, poorly edited and strangely written, throwing the eloquence, the tasty dialogs and the wit of one of the greatest novels of all time, a powerful criticism of the moralistic Victorian Era. It's a weird movie that has admirable moments. The only thing this version has that it's better than the 1945's film is the actor playing Dorian. Everything's perfect in that film except for Hurd Hatfield playing the title role. He was classy but it's not someone you would imagine as being ridiculously beautiful like Ben Barnes is. Although playing such role is probably the worst curse that can ever happen to an actor (Hatfield almost doesn't have any other role), since we're dealing with a character that just happens to be handsome, do everything that pleases him and there's no great pleasure or challenge in playing such role, the hedonism part was well captured here and this Dorian seemed to enjoy life more than the other Dorian's I've seen. And let's face it: Barnes is a watchable Dorian. However, good acting wasn't much of a positive point here from almost anyone, and even great names like Firth can disappoint. Rebecca Hall manages to rise above and delivers good moments as Wotton's daughter, appearing in last third of the movie. It's a little impossible to do great harm to a literary classic such as "The Portrait of Dorian Gray" is, and the movie doesn't fail all that much. It's decent despite its strangeness and problems - it was really bizarre seeing the story jumping until the 1910's. OK version, doesn't replace the novel, so if you're thinking of skipping it and watch this instead because you have a test to do, you're gonna flunk big time. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilde about the boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The darkly amoral Oscar Wilde novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is one of my favourites and naturally lends itself to both theatrical and cinematic dramatisations with its gripping story-line and sharply-drawn characters. This latest adaptation takes some liberties with the story-line in giving a possible reason for Dorian Gray's headlong dive into hedonism in the form of a bullying father who locked and beat his young self in the attic where he's forced to hide the offending portrait, introduces Henry Wotton's daughter as a love interest and moves the action on in time to the First World War, although the source is so strong, I don't think it needs embellishment. The Gothic element in the story is frankly maxed out as Doran descends the slippery slope to corruption, in short order corrupting a young actress who falls in love with him, deflowering a young virgin at her coming-out ball (and her mother too!) indulge in a homosexual act with his artist friend, before bottoming out with outright murder. These scenes are lurid in their depiction and justifiable I suppose in demonstrating the levels of depravity Doran Gray has sunk to. Less convincing for me in particular were the back- story of his troubled childhood as it weakened the influence on his character of the Machiavellian all-talk-no-action Henry Wooton character plus I think the action should have been contained within the Late Victorian London era, even allowing for Dorian's ageing. All the British cast acquit themselves admirable, Ben Barnes very good as the eternally young devil-may-care Dorian, Ben Chaplin, fine as the doomed artist Basil and especially Colin Firth as Wooton, who initially inspires and encourages Dorian's increasingly heartless actions but who realises in the end the monster behind the facade that he as helped foster.The key climactic scene where Dorian confronts his own self-image is excitingly done and indeed the film plays like a thriller in terms of pace. In general though I think the director placed too many logs on the fire and sacrificed narrative flow and character motive in so doing, but at least the film was exciting and always trying to move forward, the London exteriors of the 1890 in particular</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go into the story itself, everybody knows what it is all about and on who's novel it is based. Did I enjoy it, yes on some parts. Did I like it, as a horror buff, no, and that's the strange part of it. It is always available on the horror shelves and be honest. I don't think that an actor like Colin Firth would appear in a horror. But I'm stuck with this flick and the thing I didn't like was naturally the use of CGI. When the face of the painting is shown and is decaying some maggots are running in the face of the picture. Sadly that was done with CGI. There is of course some red stuff in it but don't hope to see the knife going in. That was another let down on my account. Okay, Dorian do get a lot of red stuff on him when he's killing a friend but it's never bloody. On the other hand Dorian do has a lot of sex, again it is never explicit. There is a bit of nudity, a nipple there and a tit here, but not to graphic. So it is clear for me that it was made for the main public. Naturally in these kind of flicks the acting has to be sublime and it does. If you see what Colin is doing, he has a lot of text, well it's normal that he got his Oscar. But if I look purely as a geek in the genre then I thought it would be better. But don't get me wrong. I don't have anything against blockbusters, just look at Dracula or Interview With A Vampire. I liked them. To end, it's so strange that the director Oliver Parker had failed a bit, as a director I haven't seen any of his other flicks but if I tell you that he played Peloquin in Clive Barker's Nightbreed or was in Hellraiser 2 I thought it would have been gorier or at least bloodier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fantasy-thriller drama is loosely based on Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray - and this "looseness" using modernisation is likely the biggest shortcoming. The spirit and background of British vanity is truly recorded and the cast is at least, if not great - Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray and Colin Firth as Lord Henry Wotton are really good to watch; they spend most time on screen as well. Female characters are more perfunctory, no "flashes" of memorable performances.But it is no flop or waste of time. This film makes you ponder and consider, but the moral outcome is too plain - especially under modern, capitalist understanding of hedonism, success, achievements etc. I am confident many would prefer to be rich, beautiful and forever young at the expense of lack of soul or bad habits. 19th century romanticism is just a horizon and paragon in the present consumer society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie a lot. That is, once I finally decided to watch it. I had tried so many times but it just wouldn't work, there was something bothering me. I guess tonight was the right moment to watch this Dorian Gray. And I am so pleased I did.I had read the novel, 25 years ago when I studied to be an English teacher (I never became one...) and as it seems, some changes have been made. It is often the case when a movie derives from a book, so I don't make a fuss anymore: this was a nice movie after all.I was impressed by Ben Barnes. I have known him from the Narnia's, and I liked him a lot in "Easy Virtue". "Killing Bono" was "too much" for me, I couldn't watch it till the end. But here, he was at his best.Someone wrote that - without clothes - he looked like a 12 year old... Well... I found him to be attractive, with or without clothes (you really don't see much "without"...), so I guess I will have to talk about this with my psychiatrist...Colin Firth was, as always, very good. I think he can manage very well being "the bad guy", or other dramatic roles, such as in "A Single Man" and "The King's Speech".Rebecca Hall was very good too, for the few minutes we had the pleasure of seeing her... I didn't know her but will be watching what she does in the future...As for all British movies, I was also impressed by the decors and the overall historical approach (I mean how London was at that time, and the Bourgeois mentality, etc. etc.) The movie is sometimes slow, sometimes too fast. For this, and other minor details, my vote is 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Gothic horror and was a looking forward to this. Not exactly a 100 % hit, but I did enjoy it. I don't know how the original story goes, so my interest was always on the screen not having to figure out what is the same and what is different. Having said that, some prior knowledge may have had been a good thing, as there were quite a few things that were left a bit fuzzy, like the whole painting vs. selling ones soul to devil scenario. Maybe I wasn't as sharp as I could've been while watching. There are flashbacks of abuse in Dorians childhood and some hints of a pact with devil, but I couldn't figure out how it all came together.The Victorian look of London is gorgeous and that's one reason I crave for these movies. To detach you from now and throw you back to times when everything was different. Rise of the industrial revolution, gas lights, artists drinking absinthe, it's all there and I really did get drawn in. There are a few obvious 3D shots of old London and some fx that could've been better, but most sets look pretty darn good as does the cinematography and lighting in general. Soundtrack is pretty interesting too.I can't decide whether Ben Barnes was good or bad in this one. When I watched him in Narnia 2, I felt he was completely miscast. His acting is wooden and his stare is even a bit creepy. To me it feels that his characters are not sincere at all. This may actually work for it's benefit here, but in the beginning when you're supposed to think he's all naive and kind, I wasn't convinced. He gets better as the story lives, but he's still a bit Keanu Reeves of his generation. Wooden. Colin Firth is good, but Ben Chaplins character is a bit underdeveloped. As are the rest of the cast.I recommend this if you are into Gothic atmosphere, not for much more. Luckily the atmosphere here is well done, so it makes up a lot of the shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altogether More Sinister.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Barnes is Dorian Gray, a beautiful, innocent, wealthy young man in Victorian England. Ben Chaplin is Basil Hallward, a friend, who paints his portrait and captures his inner goodness. Another friend is Colin Firth, as Lord Wotton, the cynical guy who keeps coming up with these Wildeian apothegms. In an earlier film he was played perfectly by George Sanders as the flippant, catty gay man he was. But Colin Firth is no simple cad. He's an agelast. His smile is that of a reptile.And although Hallward the artist warns Gray that rotten Wotton often says things he doesn't mean -- such as equating pleasure with happiness, and observing that even what seems like a tragedy is an experience one should undergo -- Gray takes his advice seriously.Gray pursues his pleasure regardless of its cost to others. He proposes to the pretty naif, Sybil Vane, impregnates her, then brushes her off. She does a nosedive into the river. Gray shakes this off and really gets on the hedonic treadmill.In the novel, this is the dullest part of the story. Wilde has Dorian Gray collecting overly ornate art, mooning over moonstones, caressing fabrics, and other michigas. Well, after all, this IS Victorian England, and Wilde couldn't very well write about the stuff we see here on the screen. Gray smokes dope, smooches with women in low places, draws blood (and maybe drinks it), seduces Hallward, and engages in other naughty bits of business.After acquiring a devilish reputation, he travels abroad for years, picking his nose and smoking in public and Lord only knows what lesser sins he's committing. Yet, when he returns he glows with youth just as he always has. Meanwhile that portrait of Gray's early self, secure in the attic, has turned into a pustulating horror.I doubt that this kind of story could have been so successful after Sigmund Freud and the discovery of the unconscious. Neither could "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." These are literary adumbrations of all those buried and unacknowledged libidinous impulses. That's what the portrait represents, of course. And of course we still lie to ourselves and each other -- beginning with "How are you today?" -- but not so dramatically.It's impossible not to grin when George Sanders comes up with a line like, "The only way to conquer temptation is to yield to it," but this is a far darker version of the tale, taken quite seriously. You won't laugh when Gray dreams he is breaking the neck of Wotton's now fully grown and quite attractive daughter. When Wotton finds out they've been seeing one another, he doesn't laugh either.It's a very different take on the story from what most people are used to, but it's very well done. By the way, that word, "agelast" is pronounced "AH-juh-list" and means "one who doesn't laugh." It's very rare. I had a heck of a time finding it, and I hope everyone appreciates that effortful enterprise. If they don't, well -- I think I'll just brood for a while and then have to get over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did an Oscar Wilde novel become Hollywood trash?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see that a lot of people who don't have a problem with this movie never actually read the novel. That's a shame. Honestly though, I'm not sure I could have liked this movie even if I hadn't read the original work. The horrible effects and unnecessary and disturbing sex scenes were enough to ruin the movie all on their own.I mean seriously, I like to see nudity as much as the next person, but this is an Oscar Wilde novel... I didn't see this movie about an intellectual story from the 1800's and hope to see explosions and boobs and pornographic sex scenes. If I wanted that I would turn on a movie with Jason Statham.All in all though, I disagree with all the comments that Oscar Wilde would be rolling in his grave; I don't think he would. This seems right up the alley of his cynical, satiric take on society. He wrote a story that was beautiful and inspired great thought, a story that has become a true classic, and they made a Hollywood-ized movie from it that appeals to the masses more than it appeals to true Oscar Wilde fans. That is irony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No storyline, just sequential scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has no storyline, and is little more than a sequence of scenes strung together. I have not read the book, yet it seems that this was a prerequisite for watching the movie. It's absolutely astonishing how they thought this was a coherent rendition of the book. Firth recites his lines in a tone of voice that suggests he's a radio talk-show host, and nearly all of his lines 'feel' odd because you're not drawn into the story at all. While I couldn't care less whether the protagonist is classically pretty or not, his acting (as the acting of his first female love interest) is wooden at best, though this may be in part because of the fact that there is almost no context to the scenes, no doubt making it hard for him to get into his role. Regardless, the arbitrariness with which scenes followed each other, and the way his emotions and cognitions changed without us being given even an inkling why this is the case through the telling of the story, makes this movie a joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad acting or type casting for most of the main characters; storyline too far from the book; silly plot; unbelievable ending. I streamed it from Netflix, as I often do; when a movie catches my attention while I'm doing other things I focus on it. This one, I barely watched, realizing early on that it was going to be a complete waste of time. How could anyone go from being totally devastated from the suicide of their fiancée, because he had abandoned her, to being totally uncaring, and thereafter devoted to a life of nasty hedonism, within about 15 minutes?Both Dorian and the Lord's (Colin Firth) acting were superficial and mostly unbelievable. Dorian changed character too quickly, and Lord was just too type-cast to get me to believe in his nasty character. dAnd, how long was Dorian away for; must have been about 20 years or so, why else way everyone else so old when he returned? Just too many inconsistencies and poor story-telling for this movie to work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull and ill-judged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Picture of Dorian Gray can probably never be dramatized satisfactorily. The BBC once did it faithfully, but without the narrative passages the story seemed even more incomplete than it had on the page. The novel reads like a partial reconstruction of a damaged original; Wilde tells the story with a curious reticence, so that many pivotal scenes go unwritten and the deterioration of Dorian's character is shown in suggestive vignettes rather than in its entirety. Part of this indirection was no doubt deliberate, to leave the supreme horror for the climax; and in that regard the author succeeds. However, he also introduces confusions: he states in his preface that there are no immoral books but proceeds to make a book the instrument of Dorian's corruption; and not only the painter Basil but Wilde himself seems to treat youth, beauty, and innocence as identical. Yet despite these and other weaknesses the novel evokes genuine distress--alarm mingled with sadness--in the scenes it does depict, such as Lord Henry's casually malicious temptation of Dorian and Dorian's equally casual and malicious casting aside of Sybil Vane. Some at least of this distress has come through in every film telling of the tale....until this one. When I first read the novel I found it vague in some respects, but when I turned back to it after seeing the film it seemed crystal clear. The motives for Dorian's descent into decadence were insufficiently described, perhaps insufficiently understood, by Wilde, but in the film, as portrayed by a particularly dull and lifeless Dorian, they don't exist at all, and despite the plethora of orgiastic detail one can't even tell what's supposed to be going on with him. His evil angel Lord Henry is all wrong: not Wilde's jaded amoralist but a stock Victorian villain, until he is made to have a change of conscience after Dorian takes up with his daughter (daughter?). This Lord Henry belongs in Dickens or Wilkie Collins rather than in Wilde. And then the film has Sybil Vane's brother meeting the young Dorian in person, making nonsense of their later encounter. Finally, in an especially poor stroke of judgment, the painted Dorian turns three-dimensional, pops out of the canvas, and tries to wring Dorian's neck. The filmmakers seem not to have understood that the ominous power of the painting lies in its painting-ness, its inanimate quality; bringing it to life renders it innocuous, as if a haunted house were to get up on its legs and dance. In all, this production tends to take on the air of a cartoon (and parts of it, like the computer-drawn buildings, are almost cartoons). It is certainly ambitious; but as a well-known wit once remarked, ambition is the last refuge of the failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't read much, But the Picture of Dorian Gray is one of my favourites, which is why I find this movie an insult.Oliver Parker has taken Oscar Wilde's master piece and rewritten it to make a b-movie, His product is overwrought, superficial and utterly devoid of credibility and intelligence. Furthermore, If I didn't know better I would swear that this picture was edited with shears. It is choppy beyond believe, and it feels like so much is missing. This movie comes apart fast. Around the end, there are a couple good bits, but by that point Dorian Gray is way beyond savingThis movie's portrayal of Dorian Gray reeks of stupidity. True, the character as seen by Wilde is not supposed to be a nice guy, but Gray in this movie is way out of place for Victorian England. Considering the fact that during the middle section, he attempts to make love to anything that moves, you'd think Parker was filming the behind the scenes life of the actors or something. I'm very disappointed in this movie. If you have any respect for Oscar Wilde, you should not even look at this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story... Frankly didn't work well on film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Oscar Wylde's classic story about Dorian Gray, who sells his soul in exchange of eternal beauty. A great story, greatly written and with good terms of interpretation, with its roots in themes such as narcissism. Somewhy it just doesn't work. There might be different reasons for that. So let's sum up. First and for all, there seems to be no drive... The film just doesn't catch very much, and the story quickly stop evolving. Secondly, the direction is somewhat poor. Too many clichés. Perhaps the main problem simply lies in the fact that this story wasn't ever meant to be filmed. It's a very metaphorical story, and it's supposed to be interpreted, and the director of this film does little to nothing to show this, and therefore loses the... direction... of the story. Not made better by the fact that about half an hour of the film could've been thrown out... In the last 30 minutes we're just waiting to get to see the portrait anyway... Overall, this film is just objectively poor... 4 stars feels like stretching it, but it wasn't like one of the worst movies i've ever seen... Even with the poor direction, and somewhat poor acting performance by the main character (outweighted by Firth's great performance though), i guess i'll say "nice try, just wasn't meant to happen"...</fullReview>

In fact, if you blink, you would miss the only segment in the movie that is any part the same as the book. What should be said is that this is a remake of the 1945 movie staring Angela Lansbury and Hurd Hatfield. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's then like me you will be disappointed. It seems to explore Dorian's dark side without regards to the true storyline. If you have never read the book then you will probably enjoy this very dark Gothic story. Ben Barnes's portrayal was excellent. He managed to capture Dorian's dark personalty very well. He's a talented young actor who I'm sure we will see more of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Forfeit of Boring Gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one is titillated by the film's actually boring visuals - stage design excepted and congratulated - then I must say one is really duped into believing that opulent visual description is film-making and that "debauchery" displayed is really transgressive. It is also a total misconception of what the book is really about.So, let's unpack some things. Some people say that the book hinted because the times did not allow full-blown depictions concerning sexual matters. Wrong. Oscar Wilde was quite clever to know that hinting at...those things was actually more effective. It just takes a hint for Victorian prudishness to get heated by its unassumed imaginings. This seems does not go for our times: some get lured into believing that graphic depiction means surmounting a censoring obstacle, while this in truth falls flat. Hitchcock knew that playing with identification, expectation, the frustrations of the imagination was more sexual than shots describing sex. Or Kubrick: some reviews mentioned his "Eyes Wide Shut", and for the sexual orgy scene as something clumsy and laughable. Wrong again. Kubrick rather wanted to show that a luxurious elaborate orgy is actually rather cold and boring. Sex cannot be directly pictured. It is a matter of representation, and, even more, its gaps and discontinuity. That is where we really invest, where our fantasies lie, and tell the truth.The problem lies not in how one should depict the underlying sinister atmosphere of the novel concerning sexual matters. The lead has no charisma at all: he plays Dorian Gray as Harry Potter. Colin Firth is good in a misconception of his character. As Wilde himself wrote Lord Henry is his reflection "as the world thinks" he is. Colin Firth played the part without any of the delicious sarcasm this would demand. Et cetera et cetera for the rest of the cast. It all is irrelevant.Irrelevant because this is not the nature of the book: the book has a very peculiar quality that is difficult to pin down. It is a take on the Faustian myth. It is part of the decadent movement. It is Gothic, it is aesthetic. All that it may be, it is something else. It is rather a writers' book for its themes are mimesis, or imitation, and influence.Oscar Wilde is one of a handful of great thinkers on matters of (literary) influence, and this is the main tension that propels the book onward, contrasting with a rather catholic concept of sin, and bursting with the conceptual inversion of mimetic principles. Lord Henry is the representative of influence, a socialite luring Dorian Gray into paradox. How can one live in such times? he seems to say. Well, by living in paradox. Paradox is here for us, is our natural environment. It would go to lengths, elaborating on nuance, anxiety, and in general the tropes on which the book relies, making it a permanent read beyond its moralistic, or corrupting, surface, but this much is sure: Oscar Wilde knows that influence, as fantasy, could be equally frustrating and liberating. Influence and fantasy mean we are not Adam, first thing in the morning, for better and worse. Or, in another way, Dorian Gray suffers from an imbalance between himself and his mirror image: the price to be paid for retaining his image in all its harmonious consistency is that the entire horror of its amorphous leftover falls to him. This amorphous leftover is the material correlative to the gaze. For all the good influential paradoxes of the world, not until the very end does he abandon his image. The film did not catch any of that. The book is also stuffed with lengthy chapters about artistic specimens Dorian Gray impulsively collects, making it something of a period piece. And this is where the film resembles the book in its most unfortunately hilarious.Although not one iota of this is represented in the film, it strikes quite a note: as in the end of the 19th century prevalent, period preoccupations were presented with, say, an "imperially informed" innocence, so the decadent movement (portions of the book read as takes, critiques and elaborations on Pater and Ruskin, that is why it risks being something of an inside, undramatic joke) displayed a style of journalistic mannerisms and purple prose - so does the film exemplify respective aesthetic misfires: an (M)TV aesthetic, soft-porn libertinism, same old horror in the attic, into an unimaginative pile, thus showing its lackluster take on mimesis. The photography fails to establish a consistently sinful look: it should insist on, for example, that ebony sinister quality of the hall that leads to the attic. Where is the book's opium polish? The ashen look, when the portrait happens to look at the outside world is good, but whatever ambiance it aspires to, tumbles down when we are shown the portrait in the end, which actually looks like a parody of a damned Pirate of the Caribbean.It's a pity because with intelligent elaboration the daughter-of-Lord-Henry theme could yield to a really good take on a certain kind of neo-Darwinism by introducing tension to the theme symbolic child via influence vs biological child as responsibility; but in the end it ludicrously becomes another take on familial-ties-must-remain-strong. And it so resembles the book's dated, absent from the film, lengthy and inconsequential parts. The film is absent from itself, locked somewhere up in an attic of clichés.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who have read the Picture of Dorian Gray you'll know it to be a well written, dark and engaging story with witty social commentary and a dazzling philosophical edge.The transformation of the innocent Dorian Gray, the hell raising charisma of Henry Wotten and Wilde's own permeating personalty that reaches out from the text and grabs you with it's charm.The movie, however, is a farcry from its origins.Whilst the cinematography does, admittedly, exceed expectation the pacing is awkward, the story dulled and the characters unconvincing. The added plot theme, which I shall avoid explaining for fear of a spoiler, while an interesting concept actually hinders the movie and the frequent scenes of "debauchery" come merely across as boring and, quite frankly, seem more like filler than anything else.The movie drags after the first half hour and sometimes gives the impression of an overly budgeted pornographic. Colin Firth puts up a better than expected and is surprisingly the highlight in regards of actors for his performance but falls short of the charming devil that is his character.And finally on a devoted reader's note: Who the hell is Emily Wotton!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cosmetic surgery or real substance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>www.craigiandavylewis.blogspot.comOscar Wilde once said Lord Henry Wotton was 'what the world thinks me' and Dorian Gray, 'what I would like to be - in other ages, perhaps'. It is just possible the age we live in today - with botox and plastic surgery more than a match for Basil Hallward's painting - would have allowed Wilde to embrace the Dorian Gray within him. Certainly it has given director Oliver Parker the chance to explore parts of Wilde's classic 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' that Victorian society would simply not have allowed to be seen. So we have Ben Barnes' Dorian visiting gin palaces and whore houses in a bleak London which seems to welcome his pact with the devil for eternal life. For those unaware of Wilde's story, Gray is a beautiful, but naive, young aristocrat who becomes the muse of the probably homosexual (overtly in the film) Hallward. But twisted by the hedonistic wit of Lord Henry, Gray becomes jealous that the painting will keep its youth, while he must lose his.He makes a wish that the picture will become old, while he remains forever young - in return for his soul. While Parker's film makes real many of the inferences of Wilde's novel it also pushes the boat out further; celebrating Sibyl Vane as Ophelia, adding elements of horror to the plot with a moving, gurning picture and even incorporating a whole new chapter of Gray's life to the plot. The film certainly maintains the Gothic horror of Wilde's novel, and even some of its wit, but it is doubtful whether it is as thought provoking or intelligent. Perhaps, one might say, more cosmetic surgery than real substance.</fullReview>

As far as the story goes - I very much liked it. I realize there are changes from the book which is nothing unusual. So many films are different from the book and yes sometimes criticized harshly for the changes OR they are praised for it.Ben Barnes is a nice looking man in my opinion. That is just a matter of personal preference as to if you think someone is nice looking or not. Not everyone will agree on who is the perfect man to play Dorian Gray. So those that review this movie and bash Ben Barnes' looks should think twice - and remember that everyone will not agree on who is "good looking" enough for this role! The truth is NO ONE is.... NO ONE is so good looking and charming that they can seduce almost anyone -- that's the fantasy and fiction aspect of this fictional story! The movie is very good and should not be dismiss as bad because some people didn't like the film. Simply watch it an judge for yourselves.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When innocent Dorian Gray arrives in London, he is exactly like his newly painted portrait ? young and beautiful. He is soon introduced to the devilish Lord Henry Wotton. The lord shows him the darker sides of London, a life full of sin, drugs and sex. Dorian can have it all, as long as he stay the way he's captured in his portrait. He is desperate to keep that life, so desperate that he is willing to give his soul. However, keeping his secret is harder than Dorian originally thought, and his actions become more and more evil, as he slips deeper into this sinful life. Everything changes when he falls in love, but is it too late? Or can he still save his soul? Dorian Gray is a dark, sexy and thrilling story. It is sarcastic, shocking, morbid, and mysterious, everything you would want from a thriller adventure. Barnes gives his best performance yet, and with Firths brilliant acting they make a marvellous team. The set and costumes are authentic and give you the sense you're in the 19th century. However some of the supporting roles are bad actors and the blood used in this film looks like juice, not convincing at all! But the storyline is good, and it will have you interested from beginning to the end! The film is based on the book "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde.for more reviews visit http://malinlystad.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a faithful adaptation but it's still a well crafted movie for the most part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some critics seem to bash on this flick comparing to the novel. I personally thought it was a pretty decent movie and had enough substance to carry the movie with some good dark atmosphere going for it. The moral of the novel basically came down to the difference between pleasures and happiness. And it did a pretty good job of visually showing that in this movie. Ben Barnes or Prince Caspian who I think Hollywood is trying to sale as the next Johnny Depp is alright as Dorian Gray. He needs more better acting chops but he fit the look and change in character well. Colin Firth in this plays Henry Wotton, who claims the only thing in life worth having is youth and beauty. And is basically the tempter who drives Dorian Gray into madness. The novel also had to do with the inner nature of men and how a lot of people tend to wear masks because they are too afraid to show who we really are. In this case the ugliness of Dorian Gray begins to show in a painting drawn of him. Even if he stays forever young and handsome in his outward appearance he is rotting in the inside. Which I thought was pretty unique when it came to the novel, since in today's society. The outward appearance means more in the human eyes than what is underneath. Again if you constantly compare this flick to the book you will probably be disappointed. But if you look at this flick as just a adaptation that focuses a lot on the visuals but also has some substance to back it up. You just might enjoy it. But it's not a faithful adaptation from the novel.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an aficionado of Oscar Wilde, I approach each new adaptation of his work openly but cynically. I encountered a pleasant surprise when watching this film. Although it strays from the novel,as most versions do, the changes worked.The less veiled relationship between Dorian and Basil played nicely, as did the shades of humanity given to Lord Henry in the final half hour of the film.I wasn't sure at first of the addition of a daughter for lord Henry worked or not. (The addition of a niece for Basil in the MGM film didn't hurt the story any but also added nothing), but in Te end having Lord Henry's open-minded and rebellious daughter fall for Dorina creates an extra layer of moral dilemma.The film is captured brilliantly in it design and cinematography. the shadows and color greatly enhance the mood. The performances are mostly excellent.Colin Firth gives a well rounded portrayal of Lord Henry, equally cynical,charming and careless..as mentioned before..Firth is allowed to show a more human side of Henry as well, a jealousy and a realization of his own hypocrisy, something denied the other screen Henrys. Firth is in my opinion one of the greatest and most versatile actors working today.Ben Barnes gives an electric performance as Dorian,with facial features resembling Hurd Hatfield, the Dorina of the MGM version, his young aesthete is more dangerous and even more selfish that other portrayers of the role. equally, Ben Chaplin is a real and tortured Basil Hallward. Fiona Shaw's AUnt Agatha adds class and charm to the piece as does Emilia Fox's all too brief portrayal of Lady Wooten.This is an under rated film, that taken as a whole is a wonderful experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was originally put off from seeing this film by the vast number of extremely negative reviews on here. I haven't read the original book but most people seem to believe the film to be a good adaptation. It would seem that many of the negative reviewers have missed the point of the film as it is not like anything else I have seen and was probably not what they were expecting. But I liked this entirely new idea and it makes a nice change to see something different.The story is certainly gripping showing a shielded innocent man, influenced by his new friend into detaching his sole, descend to a life of debauchery, becoming increasingly corrupt and living out every impulse of a young person whilst being unable to scar or age himself. The rest you can gain from other reviews as I am weary of accidentally giving a spoiler.One thing that makes this film prosper where it otherwise could have failed is in the acting. Ben Barnes plays the part of Dorian spectacularly, showing his character develop as he succumbs to a life of sin. Colin Firth (who I am not usually a fan of) takes the role of the friend who influences Dorian becoming what he is in the film but who also seems to live his life through Dorian, becoming almost obsessed with his life.I would give this higher than a 7 but it is not generally my type of film but I was still thoroughly impressed by it and would recommend watching it if you have a taste for deep films and would like to see something almost entirely fresh.</fullReview>

Well his "mentor" has some and Rebecca Hall does bring some too (late in the game), but you could be excused for feeling this is very cold indeed.Of course you could argue that the movie does not portray the character as he was intended in the novel.

		<fullReview>In Victorian London, young Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) inherits a grand house and makes friends with the posh crowd. He has his portrait painted and falls under the influence of hedonistic Lord Henry (Colin Firth) who encourages Dorian to indulge his baser passions. As the years pass, Dorian becomes cruel and violent but his appearance never changes; only his portrait reflects the vicious, soulless man he has become.Ben Barnes is so flawlessly handsome that it's almost distracting. He can act but lacks depth and looks too young to play the demanding lead. His performance is geared toward teens, I think. Colin Firth is very good playing the truly loathsome puppet-master who leads Dorian down the wrong path.The Victorian period is faithfully recreated and the costumes and sets are lavish, although much of the charm is lost when the story inexplicably moves into the WWI era. There are also some changes in characters and plot from the Oscar Wilde novel, but I think the film is entertaining - if you haven't seen the Hurd Hatfield version made in 1945. That one is better all-around - darker, more serious, and scarier. It's fun to see them both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I'm not going to rant on and on about how this movie will effect the audience. To be honest with you, this movie is difficult to explain. The actor who plays Dorian Gray is average at best. He was good in terms of body language and gestures. However, he did not pull off the fact that he had lost his soul. I have not read the novel. The scenes where Dorian Gray was effected by what he had done lead him into being psychotic, were glued together with a casual glimpse of sexual images. I thought that you needed to see the gradual change of Dorian Gray's emotions and the loss of his soul. Or maybe it just needed something ... else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't compare it to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the book but have read many reviews on how the movie suffered in comparison. Even if the book was that much better then the film doesn't mean that the film itself wasn't good. It simply means the book was better which is usually the case for any movie inspired by a good novel. Its important to notice that films like these are always based on something else. Whether fictional or true the keyword is "based". This means the movie can be whatever the hell they want it to be as long as the ending result is coherent with the true/fictional story. So, to put it bluntly, the picture looked good, the acting was up to par, and the story was compelling. What more do you need to enjoy a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't look at it as an adaptation, its a FILM, and it's fantastically stylish and sexy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Dorian Gray expecting it to be like the novel, and when it wasn't, I admit I was disappointed. However, I decided to give it another chance and watch it for the second time. I think the users of IMDb need to stop comparing films to books and see this film for just a film in itself, and when I did, what I saw was in fact brilliant.There is controversy over Ben Barnes acting, and I admit, his absolute beauty maybe does distract from any flaws, but I thought he was fantastic, his complete contrast from the sweet innocence he displayed at the beginning of the film, to the seductive charmer was subtle, yet sexy and stylish.I believe people who say this is far too 'Hollywood' need a reality check, if it was far too Hollywood, Sybil and Emily would have been played by barbie-ish women, and there would have been a dramatic but typical speech at the end delivering a failed moral message in a "what have we learned from this experience" format.I also realise that the vice displayed in this film isn't nearly as subtle as it is displayed in the book, but lets face it, films are not as subtle as books. I think the sex scenes were shot wonderfully, the moving, hazy camera shots gave it all a fantasy, dream-like feel, and made everything seem all the more sordid, and it was accompanied by an amazing soundtrack that enticed you in. I think the reason the vice displayed was mainly sex was to attract the audience, the audience are supposed to feel as Dorian does, enticed and enchanted by the blatant sexuality of the Victorian underworld. It would be difficult to show the attraction of drugs in todays 21st century as they are looked upon as life-ruiners, and disgusting dirty things, and obviously it is difficult to show the attractiveness of murder. However sex still remains an enticing taboo, which I think was why the film-makers decided to centre around Dorian's debauchery in this way.Also another criticism brought forward is the way the homo-eroticism present in the book is shown in the film. Some have said that it could have been shown as it is in the book, simply with the beautiful descriptions of the men and such. However in the 21st century every man in film is described beautifully, and we are of course trying to avoid this 'hollywood' attribute you are all going on about. Anyone who knows of the 'twilight' phenomenon knows that it is not unusual nor considered to be homo-erotic for the men to be described as beautiful. I think the kiss between Basil and Dorian served the purpose of this well, yet I do not think this was the main intention of the scene, I think it was more to show the arrogance and control of Gray. If you actually listened to the words of the scene rather than simply watch the actions, you will notice that Dorian is distracting him from ting to borrow the painting, and he uses his beauty and sexuality to do so. It shows the absolute power that his beauty gives him, and shows the limitless-ness of it, that it can be used of woman or man, young or old.All in all, Dorian Gray, when looked at as a film in its own right, is fantastic, it draws you straight in and lures you into the scandalous underworld of Victorian life. You'll scorn over Gray for his sinning but still crave his charm and beauty, and want to be that man or woman whispering in his ear.I finish with my favourite quote from the film, "Conscience? It's just a polite word for cowardice."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent adaptation of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is probable that few people have read the book Dorian Gray, but I am sure that most of the people know the premise: a man sells his soul in exchange to look forever young and healthy while his portrait grows older; at the end, he will have to pay a very high price for that privilege. The easy moral lesson from the story tends to darken two fundamental elements: author Oscar Wilde (1854-1900)'s brilliant prose, full of sharp and cynical (but true) observations; and the deep emotional arc from the main character, whose reflections on human nature bring substance (and to some point, justification) to his transformation from a fresh and naive young man to a monster whose corruption goes beyond than any redemption. The most recent film version of Dorian Gray could preserve those valuable elements, and it ended up being an excellent adaptation of the book, adorned with modern techniques and a classic sensibility.This is the third movie based on a Wilde's work directed by Oliver Parker (the previous ones were An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest), but Dorian Gray is very different from the other ones, because it has nothing of their light humor in order to present a Gothic horror story set in the complex Victorian environment. And Parker made a very solid work in recreating both things, because we can find a competent recreation of that period, complemented by a perfect atmosphere and good moments of violence and tension. However, the best elements from this film are the brilliant performances from Ben Barnes, Ben Chaplin and Colin Firth. The film could preserve various great phrases from Wilde's work, and it was a pleasure to hear them from those actors' mouths. Besides, they are absolutely credible on their roles.In conclusion, I very enthusiastically recommend Dorian Gray (2009) mainly due to its high level of energy, dramatic ambition and the magnificent performances from Barnes, Chaplin and Firth. The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few changes made by screenwriter Toby Finlay feel a bit unnecessary. However, that small fail did not avoid me from enjoying this excellent movie very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DORIAN GRAY as adapted form Oscar Wilde's famous novel 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' and directed by Oliver Parker is about as fine a transfer of a period novel to the screen as has been made of late. The settings, costumes, and acting are all outstanding and with Parker's 'enhancing' some of the debauchery in the transformed life of this famous character updated to allow for more sensuality and brutality than prior cinematic versions, the tale really becomes dramatic. Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes), an orphaned, abused child who happens to inherit a mansion in London upon the death of his only relative, comes to London as a young inordinately handsome yet shy man. He is immediately seizes the attention of Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth) who believes that the only goal in life is to respond to your desires, to your sensual needs. Dorian is introduced to a young painter Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) who is attracted to Dorian's beauty and as he paints his portrait he becomes enamored with his model. As the portrait is completed Lord Henry suggests that Dorian could always remain as beautiful as his portrait if he 'sold his soul' to remain ever youthful. Dorian takes up the idea and follows Lord Henry's tutelage to drink, smoke, and carouse in brothels, opium dens, and in the boudoirs of all the middle aged ladies of society. He encounters a beautiful young actress Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood), falls in love only to cast her aside (we later discover that her body has been thrown into the river much to the chagrin of her brother James (Johnny Harris). As Dorian's thirst for lusty and scandalous behaviors increases he causes much harm: the mutual attraction between Dorian and Basil eventually results in Dorian butchering Basil and discarding his body into the river grave. Dorian decides to leave London and travel to exotic places to try to fill his lascivious appetite: he returns twenty odd years later and every one has aged except Dorian. Lord Henry's daughter Emily (Rebecca Hall), born when Dorian departed London, is Dorian's intellectual match and the two are mutually attracted but Lord Henry violently objects, knowing what the real Dorian Gray is inside. Dorian's secret - that he remains young eternally while his portrait ages and reveals the vile aspects of his corrupt life - is finally revealed and the ending is a gruesome one. Ben Barnes, Colin Firth, Ben Chaplin, and Rebecca Hall are all superb in their roles - as are all of the many well-known fine British actors who fill minor roles. The DVD adds comments from many of these actors in a way that focuses on Oscar Wilde's novel, making the commitment of everyone involved seem more acutely aware of the film's purpose. It is a very well photographed, costumes, and lighted piece of cinematography - a truly excellent period piece for this great novel to come alive again. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Picture of Dorian Gray" is definitely one of the greatest books ever written. Shooting a film adaptation based on its plot is a rather difficult task to accomplish. Since a film adaptation only demonstrates us its director's own interpretation, it may differ from what we imagine while reading the original text and that may cause some to harshly criticize the film makers.This motion picture has certain artistic value yet it cannot be claimed flawless. The beautiful architecture, the fancy clothes which reflect a certain period of time, the dark atmosphere of the streets in the night time and the colourful parties are the major elements that will keep you interested in Dorian Gray's world.Dorian Gray, portrayed by Ben Barnes, is a convincing one. On the other hand, I remember back in college when we were dealing with the major characters in the book, my classmates argued which actors might portray "the pretty boy" best. And that gives me the very idea that everybody has their own ideal Dorian Gray portrait in their heads.If you have not read this marvellous short length novel by Oscar Wilde, you should first read the book and then think about it for a couple of days and nights, because it is going to give you a lot to think, and maybe after that you may watch this film on DVD to have a pleasant time in front of your TVs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many critics do not understand book or movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I would never claim that no critic of this movie has good reasons to dislike it, I must say that several of the reviews I have seem on IMDb seem to have missed a great deal about both the book and the movie. First off, I would recommend that those who were appalled that the book did not conform perfectly to the plot, themes, and feelings written down by Oscar Wilde go back and re-read the beginning of the Portrait of Dorian Gray. It is a scene between Basil and Henry, in which Basil explains how much of himself he has poured into the painting. It is not simply a captured image of Dorian. The picture contains an image of Dorian's beauty, yes, but even more importantly, it has captured Basil's passion for that beauty and the infatuation he has with it. It is Basil's image added to the painting that gives it its power. In the same way, a film should never be simply a reflection of a book. To do so would rob the film of any power it might have on the audience. Instead, it must capture not only the story from the book, but the director's passion and vision, his infatuation in the story. Only then can a film even hope to also capture the audience. Oliver Parker's version of Dorian Gray does just that. There are changes in the plot, certainly, but these changes neither detract from Wilde's story, nor from Parker's if you understand them. For example, the addition of the character Emily was not an entire departure from the book. Dorian had met a young woman, and when he came back to gaze upon his painting, he expected the painting to be changed and reflect the clean soul he thought he now had. In the same way, the film's Dorian found a new love and thought he could become a better man because of it. In both the film ending and the book ending, Dorian realizes that this is not the case. Here's where the real difference between the two comes in: In the book, Dorian stabs the painting only to rid himself of the pain of having a conscience. In the movie, Dorian stabs the painting hoping to ruin both it and himself because of the pain of having a conscience. In this act, the film gives us a bit of literary symmetry, in which it is his realization of the way he treated his final love that drives him to destroy the image that came from his refusal to dwell on how he treated his first love. Though the way the two messages Parker and Wilde send are decidedly different, they do share a common point. You cannot go back, you cannot avoid your conscience forever, and you cannot escape the responsibility of your actions. There is no question that the film is different from the book, but those differences give us an engaging, new vision of a classic story that I personally found to be very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best version of Dorian Gray I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally was able to see the 2009 version of Dorian Gray, adapted from the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.I am writing this review AS an Oscar Wilde fan. I have read The Picture of Dorian Gray twice and I have read The Canterville Ghost twice. I am going to tell you right now that these negative reviews that claim that this film is an insult to Oscar Wilde are WRONG! It's as if people who know very little about th works of Oscar Wilde are following a trend.Those that say this would make Oscar Wilde roll over in his grave clearly have never seen the dreadful mid 2000s version of The Picture of Dorian Gray that re-sets it in the 1960s with a female Basil with horrendous acting. And they clearly have never seen the 1940s version of The Canterville Ghost that turned the entire story into World War 2 propaganda about a solider having to prove himself against a nazi. I will admit that this not a word for word faithful adaptation of the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray however it is very true to the heart of the novel, the meaning and purpose. The character portrayals are perfect and accurate. All changes are purely superficial. I know Ben Barnes as Dorian does not resemble the character of the novel however he does resemble Oscar Wilde himself and since Oscar Wilde saw himself in Dorian I felt this was a brilliant use of visual symbolism in Wilde's own relationship with Dorian Gray.I know that some people have complained about the adding of the character Emily Wotton, whom does not exist in the novel. What people fail to remember is that nearly all film versions of The Picture of Dorian Gray have this 'redeemer' character. In the 1940s movie her name was Gladys. In the 1973 version of The Picture of Dorian Gray her name was Beatrice. In most versions she's Basil's niece or daughter but in this version she was Lord Henry's daughter.What many don't know is that this character does exist in the novel. She's mentioned briefly near the end as a country girl named Hetty. Her part in the novel isn't as big as in the film adaptations but she does still exist and she works to add sympathy to Dorian's character.You cannot see the inner workings of Dorian's mind in a physical medium like films or plays as you do with the novel so you you need a new way to see his moral struggle. And this is done through the presence of Emily. Collin Firth was incredible as Lord Henry. That was the best portrayal of Lord Henry since George Sanders. This version of The Picture of Dorian Gray has more of Oscar Wilde's witty epigrams than any other version before it. The only line missing that I wish was in here is Lord Henry gives Dorian a cigarette case. In this one it's just inscribed with Dorian's name. In the novel it reads 'The World has changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips re-write history.The only character of the film I did not like was this version of Sybil Vane. (Sibyl in the novel). In this version Dorian seduces her into sleeping with him before marriage (as he does in the original film with Angela Lansbury in the role). When Sybil starts talking about having a family Dorian argues that it is too soon, much thanks to the ideas planted in his head by Lord Henry. When this Sybil kills herself it gets revealed that seh was with child. This takes away from her sympathy. It's true having a child out of wed lock was frowned upon in the Victorian era but it did happen. And it did not mean the end of the world. Look at the character of Fantine in Les Miserables. It was selfish of this Sybil to kill herself because she did not just kill herself, she killed herself and the unborn baby. Sybil does kill herself in the earlier incarnations but at least she had never done it while carrying a baby and knowing she was carrying the baby, and having wanted to raise the child. It's hard to sympathize with this version of Sybil, especially since you know her brother Jim would have taken care of both her and the baby if not Dorian.Basil, however, was very sympathetic. One thing I'm glad they cut was that in most versions Basil didn't just disapprove of Dorian's relationship with Sybil out of jealousy, he also had told him not to marry beneath his class. Basil doesn't do that in this version. Basil is the most sympathetic of Dorian's Victims in this film.Dorian himself is played exceptionally well though my favourite character portrayal in this version is Lord Henry. Dorian goes from ruthless and cruel to sympathetic and tragic in a heartbeat. The struggle is perfect. You can see his conscience, and not just with the painting. He is fighting against his own darker instincts which adds to making him sympathetic.As a true Oscar Wilde fan I feel they captured the spirit of Oscar Wilde's intent. This was the best version of The Picture of Dorian Gray I have ever seen, the black and white version coming in close second for having the better and more innocent version of Sibyl Vane. I am in America and we never got a theatrical release of this version of Dorian Gray. I sincerely hope that some day in the near future America will get, at least, a DVD release of this film because it is truly good, truly exceptional, and far more intelligent, interesting and just plain better than the Twilight Saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a luscious version of this story. Written by Wilde for serial publication. I liked the old version, too, with George Sand, and thought both film versions managed to bring in Wilde's biting wit and clever dialogue. The modern CGI and special effects (thank you, George Lucas since I don't know which company worked on the film) bring the painting to life in an imaginative and spectacular way.Colin Firth is excellent as young Dorian's mentor, leading him down the paths of excess in what would seem to many to be just another weekend at the frat house. But Dorian's activities begin to take on a darker tone and you realize that he may be beyond redemption.I loved the scenery, costumes, the entire production was beautifully done and the story clipped along with great pacing, great acting and a touching ending as well. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did enjoy watching this movie, and for me it was close enough to the book. First, the real positives: The scenery - in places reminding of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the costumes - which feel totally authentic, the props and effects, but above all: Colin Firth!He is the one holding the movie together with an outstanding performance, while he is playing a character that has none of the clumsy funniness of the guy in Bridget Jones, he was a big surprise for me.The story is told well enough, but the downfall of the movie is that I was by far not as moved by the emotional roller-coaster, Dorian is going through in the movie, as I was when reading the book. It felt like standing a bit too far away from the scenery when observing what happens, rather than being inside the characters and feel with them.Still, a good movie with all the right ingredients. Just would have needed the right Michelin star cook to make it an unforgettable masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Picture of Dorian Gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the original classic 1945 version with George Sanders, and I was intrigued that the famous Oscar Wilde story would be remade, and I knew there would be much darker things to come, from director Oliver Parker (Othello, An Ideal Husband, St. Trinian's). Basically, set in Victorian London, good looking and innocent Dorian Gray (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian's Ben Barnes) has inherited a new house in the city, and he is giving in to the pleasures of the wealthy lifestyle with charismatic but calculating Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth). The young man's artist friend Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) has finished painting his portrait, capturing his youth and beauty very well, and Dorian makes a slightly non serious pledge that he would give anything to stay as young as he is in the painting, even his soul. Soon he meets and falls for Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood), he proposes marriage, but Lord Wotton convinces him having children is a bad idea and she drowns herself after hearing that he went to a brothel, and it is made worse finding out from his brother 'Jim' James (This Is England '86's Johnny Harris) that she was pregnant. Jim, her brother, tries to kill him before being taken by authorities, and even though Lord Wotton talks him round again that his life will get better, it doesn't, and he sees from his portrait that it is slowly decaying, and that his pledge has come true. He tells the artist Hallward this secret and is forced to kill him, dumping his body in the River Thames, but he sees a positive to this lifestyle where he can do anything to his body, and nothing will change. Many years later at a party all the guests are stunned to see that Dorian is still looking as youthful as ever, including Lord Wotton, and soon enough the young man gets very close to the Lord's suffragette daughter Emily (Rebecca Hall), which her father is not best pleased with. Dorian seems genuinely intent on changing his ways and making a life with Emily, but then Jim returns wanting revenge for the death of Sibyl, and after trying to convince him he is not who he thinks, and a chase in the London Underground, Jim is killed being hit by a train. He is next planning to leave London with Emily, but Lord Wotton is very suspicious about why he has never aged, and looking back at old photographs he remembers the night he was there and he teased the young man about the selling soul concept, so he goes to the house to investigate. The two men have a confrontation in the attic, and the portrait is revealed as hideously decayed, and this turns into a fight where a lit lamp is smashed and the place catches fire, and when Lord Wotton locks the gate, Dorian decides to give into the destruction, his face decaying like in the portrait, and dying in the flames. We see in the final moments the Lord trying to get back into contact with daughter Emily, who was there witnessing her love die in the fire, and we also see that the Lord has the now youthful looking portrait of Dorian Gray. Also starring Emilia Fox as Lady Victoria Wotton, Caroline Goodall as Lady Radley, Fiona Shaw as Agatha and The Living Daylights's Maryam d'Abo as Gladys. Barnes gives a reasonably good moody performance in the title role, Firth is also lightly sinister in his part, the picture is seen as a living entity in this re-imagining, so there are special effects, and a more violent streak with blood and murder, it is a good enough period horror thriller drama. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Wild was NOT turning in his grave trough premiere of this Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember deciding to have a quiet Saturday. After a long wait- this movie was out and for me- that would do for that evening. Anyway, I am big Oscar Wilde fan. I understand and agree with most of his view's and have read Dorian Gray more than once. During the movie, i had that naughty, very pleased smile on my face, and wondered around the London long afterwords, captured in Dorians world of pleasure and running against time and truth. 1.- if movie left me in the state of mind to do something, to thing about something or simply flow with the thought of it...That is enough by it self. The thing is- this is adaptation of the book- so , yeah, lets be critical- things in book that i imagined that happened-happened on film! So, i congratulate movie makers on their level of imagination and for not letting limits of the book(because it was controversial enough without juicy details) comes into the limitless pleasures. Which BTW in Wilde's eyes are exactly that- limitless! I would like to see more of the actual Wilde's view's trough the words, as he was so good with it. But, his points of view were very obvious trough the motion as well. Ben Barnes gradation was delightful! I would expect Harry to be younger and more charming, but hay- with Colins talent it didn't really matter. Anyway- Well done- I am really happy because of not literal take on this book. As- we have that masterpiece already in that frame of time. It was time for a dirty twist on this eternal subject, and it certainly did a justice to the Oscars being- more and beyond his time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was certainly not what I thought it was going to be! I have not read fully Oscar Wilde's version but had talked about it with a friend who had read the book. She assured me that I would find it intriguing and delightful. I, however, did not. Of course, not noticing the rating before we began the movie was my first mistake. I did not realize is was and "R" rated movie which means anything goes. I was quite appalled at the number of intimate scenes. I know that they were put there to show the degradation of Dorian but I saw little value in the short clips pressed together. If we had fast-forwarded through thee parts it would have seemingly cut out half of the movie. I did not find these scenes to be the ONLY way that they could show the change. The viewer does get a small glimpse at other problems but the main destruction lay in these unnecessary scenes. I felt the the characters seemed shallow in light of the descriptions given by the friend who read the book. She watched the movie as well and was also disappointed with it.Oscar Wilde's work was not done justice.All of this being said, I do have to say that this movie made me think. Our souls really are like the picture. We try to hide who we really are from people and pretend we live perfectly in a messed up world. We do this because we are afraid to see what will happen if the world finds out. I think we see this a lot more in people who are in leadership. The rest of society doesn't help because we put pressure on people in leadership to be perfect; even though such a condition doesn't exist. In reality, however, none of us is perfect. We hide things away and our souls become as disfigured as the picture in this movie. And, because it is our soul that is ruined, we never try to fix the problem because "no one can see it." But, there is one who does. As Christians, we believe that God sees all. He sees the marred soul crying out in pain. So, instead of hiding away these things and allowing them to distort our souls, we should be sharing honestly with other believers and praying together for the strength to change them. Our goal should not be to destroy the soul but to save it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always looked at Dorion Grey at the store. I'm not much a fan of old fashioned UK films if they are like: The Young Victoria or something along those lines. Dorion Grey was described to me as a vampire film at first, well clearly the person who told me that was wrong. Dorion Grey is the perfect example of a much more powerful friend that wants everything Dorion has but never attempted to seek for it. So Dorion decides he wants to live forever and so selling his soul to a painted picture of himself allows that. I finally bought it and watched it, I was not disappointed at all. Other than the gay/bi-sexual traits Dorion expresses in the film I quite enjoyed it. It's dark creepy and quite tense in most scenes towards the middle of the film. I also noticed Oliver's interesting creative choices to use jump cuts and a lot of shallow depth of field in this film. An enjoyable piece of work worth a watch. Well done to the crew and cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i must admit i am surprised. I thought this was going to be a horrendous take on a brilliant story. Actually, it was unbeatably cool. It was full of ideas of social class delusions of the young, mixed with the bittersweet beliefs of the more mature characters. Murder, malice and questions about life after death, this film deals with the issues that most people don't like to face. It is also incredibly sexy, as the eternally young, beautiful Dorian Gray steals the hearts and lives of the women he meets. Enter Colin Firth- a good actor in the best of times, brilliant here. It takes a lot to take sexist ideas, such as women are there to sleep with, and make them amusing in a way that even makes me, a proud feminist, laugh. That is the beauty of Firths acting. He is incredible. This film is a truly beautiful, imaginative, sexy movie and i would recommend it to anyone. Except me grandparents. Obviously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie at which you shouldn't see any trailer before . Spoilers or any descriptive information about the story line of the movie,might destroy the magic of this wonderful film . Every moment of the movie must be unmissable , especially in the first minutes where the idea of the movie is presented ,which will keep you in a continue curiosity.The time takes place in the '40 of a dark London,that will make the characters fit with the atmosphere. The actors are well played,Ben Barnes (Dorian Gray) fits pretty well into the skin of the character ,but it could have been better though; Colin Firth (Lord Henry) has a splendid representation, showing that he is truly a remarkable actor , giving the movie a magical air. The movie can make us understand why pleasure is totally different than happiness, in a way that few of us could ever understand it by our own skin. Although this review is not what you would really want to find out about,after you will see the movie,you will be enough satisfied to understand that for a movie like this , reviews can have its own limits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adequate without being especially thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Barnes, best known as Prince Caspian, plays Oscar Wilde's picture-hiding protagonist. Barnes' key attribute is that he is a beautiful young man, which means that he is eminently suitable as the subject of a movie about someone who retains his good looks while his portrait accumulates the visual evidence of the life of debauchery he leads. As it happens, Barnes gives a performance which is adequate, if low key - one feels that he is never quite whole-hearted about succumbing to the sins of the flesh, and he really needs to be.Colin Firth plays Lord Henry Wootton, Gray's mentor in degeneracy, with a languid cynicism.In truth, this movie is essentially a Hammer horror for the noughties, with a much larger budget and some decent production values. It is moderately faithful to the spirit of Wilde's original if not the letter, and entertains well enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had no real plot other than the main characters lighting up a smoke whenever they could and pathetic sex scenes in a attempt to be an "arty" movie. I stopped watching when the main character threw himself at another man in hopes of showing his "appreciation". A movie to be avoided and I will make sure I definitely see another movie by this director. Did I mention the characters in this movie were more shallow than a kiddie pool? I admit I never read the book this movie was based off of, but it seems the director has done it a travesty, why directors try to incorporate their own artistic license in a movie and render it so convulsed that it can only be regarded as "loosely based upon the novel" baffles me, the author is famous for a reason. That being said, the only thing interesting about this movie was the portrayal of Victorian England (if I am correct as to the time and place).</fullReview>

Eternal life combined with a growing evil... that's a timeless story, which explains the many adaptations.There is something of a lesson to be learned here, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. Don't mess with the devil? Treat your friends fairly? Eternity has its blessings and its curses? I don't know. Those who are familiar with other eternal life stories (such as "Tuck Everlasting") know that there's always a drawback to what may seem like the best of ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Youthful damnation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If offered eternal youth most of us would bow down our souls to the devil. This is exactly what Dorian Grey is does! Loosely based on the Oscar Wilde book 'The picture of Dorian Grey'; and when I say loosely I mean if you go for a toilet break you would actually miss the part which has any reflection of the depths of Dorian Grey and the Wilde classic. The story is of a young man named Dorian Grey (Barnes) who inherits his fortune through the death of his uncle. He embarks on to his uncle's rich estate from a quiet life in the country; to be thrown amongst the elite of London. This is where he meets Lord Henry Wotten (Firth) who encourages him to place pleasure ahead of all morals, consequently leading to his downfall. Dorian inadvertently makes a deal with the devil to maintain his youth and lifestyle. However, like always, with every wish there's a drawback. For Dorian; this drawback comes in the form of his portrait, painted by his friend Basil (Chaplin). His lifeline becomes entwined with this portrait of himself. Grey remains youthful whilst his character falls down the depths of immorality and murder; all the while escaping without a scar on his body because his portrait bears the brunt of his actions. Dorian delves in to a spiralling abyss of sex, orgies, drugs and no moral hold. Barnes displays promising talent as a star in the making but the weakness of the script is the downfall to this classic. Barnes' porcelain face and innocent demeanour captures the malevolence and pleasure that is Grey. Most commendable is his transformation from a Disney actor to a sex craved animal; which will without doubt have tongues wagging. This role will certainly see to it that his Prince Caspian days are behind him. Oliver Parker applies the talents of Colin Firth again and as result Firth dazzles in his performance as Wotten; a cynical womaniser who is responsible for Grey's adoption of a wicked lifestyle. He implores the depths and characterises of a human to the very core of peer pressure and introduces Grey to a lifestyle he couldn't have dreamt up in his stable days. Yet, However entraining Wotten presents himself to be; a tremendous flaw is presented during his discovery of Grey's secret, without a clue, other than a hypothetical conversation carried out by both Grey and Wotten. Though, this is due to the film's lack of closing up plot holes and unexplained scenes and references, not Firth's acting abilities. The Verdict: The story was adequate at best and a disappointment for anyone who read the book or watched the 1945 classic. But for anyone who hasn't read Wilde's classic, will be thrilled! There are enough sexual escapades, both male and female, and exhilarating scenes to keep them enthralled through the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I was only motivated because I am a huge fan of Ben Barnes. To see him from The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian to Dorian Gray was a huge jump for me. I've never read the book to this movie, but I found this very interesting, and it's pushing me to read the book for comparisons of the two. I think Ben Barnes a great actor. He can be dramatic, soft and anything. To see him whore himself and relish on pleasure in this movie was kind of... strange for me. I can see why so many sexual scenes were necessary for this movie because he is a youthful man simply enjoying the world of women and money. I thought it was a bit confusing how he attained the ability to live eternally. It wasn't clear how, but it later explains it. He bartered for his eternal youth by letting the portrait of him suffer instead of the real him. The movie was really dark and bittersweet. And you can definitely see clearly how Dorian has changed throughout the movie. I gave this a 9 out of 10 because it deserved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasure is not the same thing as happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorian Gray is a wealthy, handsome young gentleman who is one of the leading lights of London's high society in the early 1890s. (Oscar Wilde probably chose the Christian name Dorian for his hero because of its association with the French "d'or", meaning "golden", and the phrase "jeunesse dorée", or "gilded youth"). He is befriended by the successful artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait, and the older libertine Lord Henry Wotton. Henry introduces Dorian to the pleasures of the city and to his own hedonistic philosophy. Pleasure, in Henry's view, is the only thing worth living for. Dorian takes this philosophy to heart. He has fallen in love with a young actress named Sibyl Vane, and has proposed marriage to her, but breaks off the engagement on Henry's advice. The heartbroken Sibyl commits suicide, and Dorian's initial grief at her death disappears as he abandons himself to a lifestyle of selfish hedonism. There is also a subplot involving Sybil's brother James, who vows revenge against the man whom he holds responsible for his sister's death.Running parallel with the story of what happens to Dorian is the story of what happens to his picture. When the portrait is unveiled, he says that he would give anything to stay as young and handsome as he is in the picture, and this is precisely what happens. Dorian finds that he never ages and remains ever-youthful, whereas the marks of ageing start to appear on the portrait, which he moves from his hallway to a secret room in his attic. The latter part of the film takes place some twenty-five years later during the First World War. Henry is by now an old man but Dorian, who should by now be middle-aged, still looks as young as he did in 1890. Dorian begins a romance with Henry's daughter Emily, much to the disgust of her father.The film was made by the recently revived British company Ealing Studios. (They seem to specialise in Wilde adaptations, having made "An Ideal Husband" and "The Importance of Being Earnest", both also directed by Oliver Parker.) Ealing were also responsible for last year's "Easy Virtue", and like that film "Dorian Gray" stars both Ben Barnes and Colin Firth. In the earlier film they played father and son; here, as Henry, Firth can be seen as a metaphorical father-figure to Barnes's Dorian. (Dorian is actually an orphan who was brought up by a brutally strict uncle; his adoption of a hedonistic lifestyle can, psychologically, be seen as a reaction against the harshness of his childhood).Henry is not only a father-figure, he is also a corrupter, under whose malign influence Dorian's character deteriorates until he is even more monstrous than Henry himself. What partially saves Henry is, paradoxically, his hypocrisy, something normally regarded as a vice. Henry might preach about the advantages of a totally hedonistic lifestyle, but he is never quite prepared to practise what he preaches. It seems clear that his obsession with Dorian's youth and beauty stems from repressed homosexual or bisexual tendencies, but he never acts upon them (unlike Dorian, who has a gay relationship with Basil). Henry realises that Victorian society, although officially disapproving of promiscuity, is prepared to turn a blind eye to an upper-class Casanova provided he remains strictly heterosexual. Henry's disapproval of Dorian's relationship with Emily may seem hypocritical, given that Henry himself has been guilty of corrupting other men's daughters, but at least it shows that his natural feelings are not completely dead.Dorian, by contrast, is prepared to follow his mentor's teaching in full and allow unbridled freedom to his appetites. The changes in the portrait do not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age but also the state of his soul. By the end of the film the face in the portrait is that of a hideous old man, far older than the forty-something Dorian would have been at this time. The message of the film is that pleasure corrupts and that absolute pleasure corrupts absolutely; if one makes pleasure one's sole aim in life, one runs the danger of becoming thoroughly selfish and immoral.I must admit that I did not think much of Ben Barnes when I first saw his wooden performance in "Prince Caspian", but he was better in "Easy Virtue" and better still here, bringing out the contrast between the na?ve young man of the early scenes and the corrupt roué of the later ones. The one performance I did not like came from Rachel Hurd-Wood, who I thought was rather weak as Sibyl, but Rebecca Hall made an attractively spirited heroine as Emily. The star of the film, however, was Colin Firth, on top form as the seductively sinister dandy Henry.The film is visually attractive, especially the interior scenes. Henry and Dorian's London townhouses are both decorated in a luxurious and elegant, but severely masculine Arts and Crafts style, with much dark, polished woodwork. (The late Victorian and Edwardian period did have a more graceful, feminine, aesthetic exemplified by the Art Nouveau movement, but we see little of this in the film). This was perhaps intended to symbolise the misogynistic nature of their philosophy; indeed, Wilde's novel can be seen as very male-orientated, and the liberated feminist Emily (a character who does not appear in the book) may have been invented to balance this.Complaints have been made that the film is not 100% faithful to the original novel, but filmed adaptations of literary works never are, and I found that "Dorian Gray" was one that works well in its own right. It is a thought-provoking film with its own moral: that, as Dorian discovers too late, pleasure is not the same thing as happiness. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey of a Soul through fall towards liberation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie that I don't want to leave unmentioned. Dorian Gray is the title, and it is an Oliver Parker's film based on a beautiful book by Oscar Wilde. To be succinct, I think the movie tells the Dorian Gray story the perfect way; and I doubt that it could've been told better in terms of a movie at this point in history. It is a huge and timely slap on the face for the folks who are fond of the impulse-gratifying life style and instant-coffee spiritual materialism. It is a story about a Soul trapped exclusively in the sensorimotor world of prerational senses and bodily feelings and flesh by somehow innocently trusting and embodying the rationally formulated worldview of sensual hedonism. (Isn't it true that our minds can rationalize any invented worldview with some sense of reason; and then trust it; and then make others believe it too?) And, surely, it is a story of maturation and liberation. For blessed are we that it is our flesh that decays and not the soul, even though it can lose itself in reflections and shadows casted by apparitions seen in the mirrors of the Spirit's Great Play. And eventually, I believe, the Soul will always have a chance for redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film like the character looks pretty but is deceiving, you might be fooled by the films animated London CGJ but if you want a plot line stand back.This movie i think proves the point that Oscar Wilde can't be adapted into film.The language in the book is what makes it and the plot has a very clear point. The director/screenwriter missed this point totally.Let me put it this way. There were 6 sex montages,yes 6. They were all strange underground orgies involving people dancing around Ben Barnes in weird masquerade costume. Most disturbingly there was one involving some weird SnM burning. Not nice. And a part where for no reason at all Dorian snogs Basil. It felt like it had been made by someone who had been given a synopsis of the book and was just looking for an exuse to put Ben Barnes naked in as many scenes as possible.The acting was OK. The funny addition of Rebecca Hall as a character who does'nt actually exist was OK but just Becca hall. Although i am thankful of this because without her there would have been 4 more sex montages. They we'ent even hot, just bizarre.To make things worse the picture at the end looks like a man in a pig costume, even a 4 year old would laugh. the film has some bloody bits but it's not even slightly thrilling. Also all the murders take place in "the creepy attic," thats in every rubbish horror film.The only thing that redeems it is the representation of London's backstreet's, there were some nice little historical references and the night blues were pretty. Still horrid however To summarise. My dad feel asleep, six people left half way through, DON'T WATCH IT. Buy some socks or something it's a waste of money and time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grossing out Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a master piece of English literature is very tempting if not mesmerizing for film makers. The problem is that it is so well known and so famous that it is very difficult to do something fresh, something new and authentic, something fascinating. Apparently Oliver Parker succeeds in doing that.His first solution is to reduce the dialogue to a minimal presence and especially to reduce it to catch phrases, short proverbial sentences, small philosophical sayings that are really trying to catch flies by preaching full enjoyment of all pleasures but only for the flies it catches and not for the utterer of such lame falsely ethical mottos, like "Conscience is a polite term for cowardice." "Some things are more precious because they don't last." "I want to begin again, stay away from everything, everything but you," he declares to Emily Wharton minutes before he rapes her, takes her, before she gives herself to him in a fully mesmerized state.When this is done you can then play with some sound special effects to create a disquieting and even disturbing atmosphere. The house creaks, cracks and moans constantly. The attic is haunted with a fugacious vision of the father beating up his young son who is finding refuge there or maybe is kept prisoner there, and a piece of dialogue suggests the mother died early and the father is reverting his sorrow onto his son he keeps responsible for the death. And I will say nothing of the moaning people in the bleak night of ;London, of the crying and howling in the various opium dens and other brothels and cut-throat dungeons.Visual effects come next, not so much the very special ones we find in all science fiction films, or horror films. Essentially lights and shadows, and fast camera movements and very dynamic editing. We then start doubting what we have just seen for but an instant or what we have hardly espied hardly a second. The visual work of the film is subliminal and works onto our unconscious to create an atmosphere of fear, fright, danger, horror, cruelty, and so many nice feelings.Then it is easy to work onto our psyche to make us horrified, terrified and grossed out by that monstrous man and at the same time to build up the end so well that we are on the side of the monster who is trapped in an attic from which he cannot escape because the world does not want to believe he has changed, and we actually should doubt his having changed really since he is somewhere between 40 and 50 and he pretends to be in love with a young girl around at the very most 18. And can we believe he has changed when we see him raping her, taking her or simply receiving in some violent contact the love she is giving him in a mesmerized state that prevents her from thinking? Can we? That's why the film is good. It even tries to give some innocence to the most perverted being we can imagine, even in Victorian or Edwardian society. Just one foot off Jack the Ripper and not an inch away from Blue Beard.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

I care dearly for Oscar's book (as indeed for all his writing), and I staged DG as a theatre play once. Especially Dorian, of course, is hard to cast. Ben's wonderful! Lord Henry (Colin Firth) annoys me in the first half. He mumbles and mangles those brilliantly genius Wilde one-liners and he seems malicious and cruel- I never thought Henry was that, in the book. Charming, roguish- corrupting yes, but never with the actual intent of destroying Dorian (and taking pleasure in it)...The costumes are gorgeous and to my great delight there was a costume special on the DVD. Always a big plus! CGI- the painting. I'm undecided and need to watch it again to be sure. It was well done, I think, but I'm not sure it wasn't over the top. Hmm.

But I got lost in the story! Never mind the cast, (applause to you all) but it did Oscar Wilde very well. Not the chick flick the adverts would have you believe. it's a powerful film full of intrigue, love lust temptation and demonstrates just how far people can be prepared to go to have that everlasting youth, that is forever portrayed in picture/ photos. It is more relevant today than ever with not just fame and the life and status of celebrities but of the everyday person and the strive for acceptance, comfort and not to be alone. Without being overly preachy. It was far more dark and sinister and yet funny in some parts than I expected. Fantastic film.

It is really great on direction but falls short in the final outcome its hard to identify the brother-sister relationship between sybil and jim, what was Jim carrying into the room when Dorian met him in the drawing room and what clues did we have that Dorian killed Sybil (did he?) Where did Dorian go half way through the movie and suddenly re-appear/ was it to go to war or to hide from his crimes or to simply to go to Cairo to get Harrys cigarettes? What was the real significance and mystique of Basils painting? Was Dorian dead at the end or not? Watched the film twice all the way through and I keep looking for clues but cant find any. I love the sexual banter scenes in the movie and as I say, the directing and the screenplay are excellent, I cant find those those.Great scenes of victorian London and a lot of thought has gone into that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A posthumous interview with Oscar Wilde, author of "The Picture of Dorian Gray", on which this movie was based: Interviewer: Mr. Wilde, you became famous before death. Could you tell us if this movie captured the essence of your book? OW: As you know, my poignant, witty and sharp opinions on issues of life, most of which people did not dare touch upon in my day, made me a man apart. I was obsessed with the soul, and all doctrines pertaining, for a long time. My story of "Dorian Gray" is a portrayal of my own struggle and the resulting pain forthwith, of how it affected me and the people around me. Whether or not you think this movie qualifies as an adequate representation is up to you to decide.Interviewer: Dorian Gray falls into narcissism to such extremes, it lead him to his own destruction. Did this represent any hidden tendencies or morality issues in yourself? Do you think the movie legitimized the essence of your book here? OW: I am amazed to see how many people saw this movie without ever reading my book, or even understanding it. When I wrote the book, I was married to my long-suffering wife Constance, and we had 2 sons, to whom I was a good father. I don't think I was a narcissist, but I did have homosexual affairs with other men, especially good looking ones, whom I even courted openly, much to the grief of my family and the resulting public scandals. I also paid for sexual favors from young boys. However, though male beauty mesmerized me, I believed in being a moralist, which explains my continuous struggle with matters of faith and religion, God, Christ, and the Bible. I am not sure how much of this, if any, was captured in the movie. I've read it seems an endless parade of debauchery, sex, and murder. Above all, Dorian Gray is a story about struggle, intense personal turmoil. Was that apparent in the film? Interviewer: So would you say Dorian Gray was a picture of a man's weakness? OW: Yes. My own wife declared once I was weak, misguided, but not wicked. That was after my fame and wealth took a downturn. She was right, of course. Maybe trying to reconcile my religious beliefs played a part, but fundamentally, I wanted to show with Dorian Gray that one cannot serve 2 masters, and in this, I borrowed heavily from my own experience, and from what I learned from the Bible. After all, wasn't this how the Devil came into being? One cannot barter, trade, or sell one's soul without nefarious consequences, something which I often criticized about religion too, mostly my own Anglican faith and Catholicism, to which I was also attracted. This endless doubting and struggling does not strengthen the soul, but weakens it.Interviewer: On a final note, would you recommend watching this movie? OW: As a representation of my book, it is grotesque. The Gothic atmosphere, filming, strong effects and acting were flawless, but it misrepresented what I wrote, so the viewer should take this one on a personal basis.Interviewer: Thank you Mr. Wilde.</fullReview>

During the first part of the movie, Dorian is having his portrait done and upon it's completion, it has a debut. After meeting the man who provides him with vices, Dorian sees a change in the picture. He moves the picture out of the public eye and pursues as much debauchery as possible.

		<fullReview>Literary Legend, Oscar Wilde has always been known for his boundless wit ? to see the beloved playwright's only novel be adapted to the screen should be a pleasure right? Haha, Nope not by a long shot! 'Dorian Gray' follows the story of a young English bureaucrat whose blind pursuit of hedonism lands him into a world of supernatural trouble. Visually, the film was stunning - the audience were frequently dazzled by a myriad of immaculate cinematography showcasing the artificial mess that was 19th Century London. That was the good thing, now let's get onto the bad. After the first 25 minutes, the film ran out of steam, it transformed into a lengthy, predictable chore. Furthermore, the film boasts some sort of philosophical edge that is bound to make the ears of some budding pseudo-sophistos to flare up. Once you get past the obvious moral, the film is painfully shallow, made evident by the faltering characterisation in a script that had horrible pacing issues. At times, the film slid over to something you'd find in an old, perverted Italian film rather than a British Costume Drama. But anyway, 'Dorian Gray' was a bore-fest ? I thought of calling it Sweeney Todd's more mature older brother but I really wouldn't want to place it in such a high-flying gene-pool...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar Wilde's story is about the descent of a man's soul from purity into the depths of debauchery. However, much of what Wilde wrote about, seems quotidian and mundane in today's context. And to make a gripping movie based on this story requires particular skill. This is my personal opinion, but I do wish Tim Burton had made it - it may have turned out better than the laboured &amp; painful turkey that Oliver Parker has churned out. Ben Barnes makes a convincing Dorian Gray, but is ultimately let down by the loosely written script and equally loose direction. The music starts to feel like a broken record, and at one point, actually sounds silly. I would recommend you watch the film if you have nothing better to do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, I went to the cinema without having any expectations because I didn't want to be disappointed.The actors were chosen perfectly, as usual in a British film, and I felt no one was out of place, and even Ben Barnes is good enough to carry the movie, together with a wonderful Colin Firth (helped by a good character) and a lovely Rachel Hurd-Wood, which I preferred to Rebecca Hall as Emily.London looked beautiful, and I was amazed realizing how a story more than a century old still catches the audience and can arise questions and considerations about soul, beauty, youth.But there's something in the whole thing that didn't ring true to me, and didn't convince me, but I still don't know what is it. Maybe it's the large amount of sex which was lacking in the book, maybe it's the dark explicit tone in the end, but I wasn't convinced completely so I give only a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Wilde would be tumbling in his grave!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a huge Oscar Wilde fan. I have read a big deal of his stories, poems and Dorian Gray, maybe four or five times.I was looking forward to a Dorian Gray movie, because I imagined a lot of things in my head. When I saw the trailer, I thought that it looked good, but considered it weird Dorian being Ben Barnes, cause Dorian was a blue eyed blond. And what about Colin Firth being Lord Henry? Him being so tall and skinny, and Henry being portrayed as a fat tub of lard? But I tried to get pass that.But the moment the movie started, I just watched and saw all the things gone wrong! The story about a young man becoming a mischievous and later on evil forever young man, turned into a story about his never mentioned abusive father and a bad-action porn. I never recall a single sex scene in the book, and this movie is just full of them! I think the Basil-Dorian scene was just sickening! But I do have to say that Ben Chaplin is what I imagined Basil the painter to look like.And what about Dorian's relationship with Sybil? Also, Sybil was a blonde girl and he met her in a theater and fell in love with her acting? Wrong. In the movie he saw her in a bar, they have been going out on daily basis and she even knew his name? Which is complete nonsense, because she didn't even know his name and called him her Prince Charming, Mister Wonderful or whatever your translation said. And their sex scene was also appalling, just because it ruined the whole concept of their relationship, and well, because it never happened.So goes on this awful movie and they tried to keep up with the novel up to one point. Then, they decided to just stop making any sense. Henry's daughter? Henry and children in general? Basil being dropped into the water instead of being chemically decomposed? The picture being an actual demon with the worms and stuff? More of the never mentioned abusive father? I remember just sitting and thinking to myself - what a waste. If you are making a movie basing the story on the novel, at least have the courtesy of reading the novel at all! Like I said - Oscar Wilde would be, indeed, tumbling in his grave! I have NEVER been so disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dorian Gray or... Buffy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wilde's Gothic horror classic deserves better than this maltreatment. The impression of his subtlety lost builds from the getgo where a mass overbearing ominous strings instruments accompany our innocent Dorian Gray as he explores his newly inherited mansion with it's apparently unsettling Victorian decor, so obtrusive is the din that before there is any given basis for unease we're unavoidably instructed that things are a bit creepy. You know it's going to be tough going when opening doors in a slightly spooky house requires all the anxiety an orchestra can muster, like scary man! This is an unfortunate style that pervades the whole running time, the music and the lighting scream unbearable tension and all of it occurring quite apart from the story and the dialogue. Thus we're left with a film that simply tries too hard frighten.What's good about Dorian Gray is the hair, although Ben Barnes isn't the blond of the book his magnificent sleek crescendo of a haircut does some superb things throughout the movie, it deserves an award and really ought to feature is a shampoo commercial. Similarly Colin Firth's beard, he stops short of twizzling it for the saucier of Henry's lines, at least I think he does, or maybe he did. In all other respects the acting is everything that's asked for an entertainment.The bad, the departures from the book are manifold, some admissible as presumably Oscar Wilde was limited by the times in lived in, his implied homosexually becomes a whole lot more than that in the film and fair enough on that score. Other changes, notably the inclusion of Henry's daughter, are more questionable, disfiguring the story into soap opera cliché - the producers presumably concluding this makes better sense of things for a contemporary audience. And then there's the CGI denouement, it looks like a Meatloaf video, and looks like it's meant to look that way too, so we're a long way away from the book by this point of the film.To look for the positives, beyond that beautiful hair, I'd have to say if you're enjoying the current splurge of vampire films you're going to enjoy Dorian Gray. Clearly the beautiful immortal bisexual anti-hero ticks a lot of boxes for fans of post-Buffy blood fantasies and the abiding feeling is that this a film meant for them, not the readers of Oscar Wilde.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent approach of Oscar Wildes novel The Picture of Dorian Gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a more modern approach of Oscar Wildes novel The Picture of Dorian Gray , Oliver Parker the director of this film brilliantly gave an excellent version of best possible camera's positioning, me personally didn't find not even one mistaken placed camera ,and he tried to marriage the old time classics erotic scenes with a more modern sex approach to cover the gap between the old times and the modern times to give us the sense that this is a beyond time limits story as Oscar Wilde tried to teach all generations that pleasure is not exactly the happiness and also that money don't bring happiness too, the battle between the rich and the poor taking place on this film but who is the winner finally ? the meaning of the family of course is the winner because the corrupt father Colin Firth as the Lord Henry Wotton stands by his daughter at the end and forgets all his mistaken and experimental theories about the meaning of living that he always teaching around the film with an approach to dorian gray as a son that he is not his real son so he can experiment a little bit further than hes time ethics and try things beyond the limits.Ben Barnes as the Dorian Gray the young fool without any parrents listening mistakenly to the only adult that he has by his side ...Colin Firth but biggest mistake he doesn't listen to his heart so its an empty road in the end but don't forget that he never been taught to listen to his heart because of the abssence of his family.So family is the winner. Excellent director , excellent cast , colin firth is one of my favorite actors excellent acting , Ben Barnes not only excellent acting but brilliant acting taking place ,Rebecca Hall as Emily Wotton excellent acting but Rachel Hurd-Wood as Sybil Vane attractive but not too innocent enough to convince.A Film that when watching the pop corn will stay in your hands... Don't miss this film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first film I have ever walked out of in my life. I have never seen something quite so boring, or quite so trashy, given a cinema release - in fact I'm not sure I've even something this bad given a straight to video release. Having seen the 1945 film, I thought perhaps the more relaxed censorship we have now would give a bit more scope to carve out the themes that could only be hinted at, but the main motivator was actually just that I was bored and it was the only thing on when I walked up to the box office. "How bad can it be", I figured. After all, I sat through The Bodyguard, Somersby, A river runs through it, Daredevil, any number of films that a lot of people consider turkeys - but this totally takes the biscuit.It does indeed duly show us some scenes of bacchanalian orgies, but if you thought the sex scenes in Eyes Wide Shut were stylised, you've seen nothing yet. It could have at least been unintentionally hilarious, as I thought Eyes Wide Shut was, but it managed to be both ludicrously unrealistic (African slaves, dancing to drums, in 1850s London - really??) and so badly acted that I think I probably did better in my school drama productions.The only person who even came close to making anything of the hideously embarrassing script was Colin Firth. The lead was wooden, not particularly attractive and the whole naive ingenue thing was totally unrealistic and didn't at all put across the transition from normal (if boring) member of the upper classes to amoral murderer; as if an aristocrat wouldn't know that he can't marry an actress without being ostracised by polite society.I can't comment on the later stages of the film as I only survived 45 minutes, and those are 45 minutes of my life I'll never get back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excuse me? Was I watching porn?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to go and see this because I heard about it and thought it was going to be an old fashioned ghost story. Let me say it was it wasn't what I expected.The story was good at the start but then it got very strange through out most of at. I really seriously thought I was watching a strange porn film. It got that strange I thought to myself 'What am I watching here' Through out I lost interest.The acting performances (through out the normal scenes, not the porn scenes) were good at there roles. I never expected Colin Firth to play the twisted demented Harry.The ending got my interest back, when Grey found out what is really going on. The painting effects were very good and creepy. Even my friend had to look away when the painting came on screen.So if you are looking for a old fashioned ghost story, this is not really one of them. You may be very stunned afterwords. After coming out the movies, my friend and I were very stunned and was laughing our heads off when we were heading back home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>time enough to read</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novel was not one i got past the first 24 pages of, 24 years ago, it is good to have this reminder to pursue someone's if but the screen writer and director's interpretation of it, than assume i know anything about Oscar Wilde, that is correct (politically) now. If nothing else the film deserves credit where OW's publisher could give none, or perhaps his critics, and the Govt of the day.I enjoyed the many twists of perception that film photography can add to the value of one's own interpretation, for what is one man's beauty may be seen as another's beast. How interesting that previous commentators here refer to Sybil's suicide, presumably this is a much clarified part of the book.I however saw this as a murder perpetrated by Henry, whom we saw in the theatre smoking in the balcony in the last seen of this actress. We do not nor are we told in the film it was suicide but are led to believe that Dorian did it by Sybil's brother. When in fact, Henry may have prevented Dorian falling from grace in the society he kept, in the endeavour to steer him towards finding a much finer bride, by taking the girl's life. And there in the last scenes are we reminded of the waywardness of drugs, and debauchery which could in an idealists world still permit marrying a much younger bride, that our own aged appearance seems a match for. Is there room for incest to add to the ideas of sin that OW is famed for?</fullReview>
