		<shortDescription>Just Another "Dog Day Afternoon" in Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highly under-rated and ignored by most in 2002, "John Q" is one of those movies that is sometimes too intelligent for a viewing public unfamiliar with topics never really thought about in common societal circles (health care and insurance policies, rights of blue-collar citizens, media exploitation, law enforcement practices and over-paid medical specialists). Denzel Washington's young son falls out one day at a little league baseball game. The diagnosis is frightening. Without a new heart, the boy will most definitely die. Washington, a normal everyday citizen, lacks substantial resources and benefits from his insurance to even get his son on a donor's list. It is blatantly obvious that Washington and wife Kimberly Elise are being strangled by red tape in a mercilessly heartless (no pun intended) system. Friends Laura Herring and David Thornton (and seemingly countless other ordinary people) do their best to help the couple raise money and soon it seems that most everything they have is on the market to be sold. Work and more hard work does not get the couple much closer to having the money they desperately need. Washington realizes that time is now of the essence. He has been pushed and pushed again and now he takes it upon himself to push back. As a last resort he literally takes the doctor (James Woods) hostage, along with other bystanders who have nothing to do with Washington's war with the hospitals and insurance organizations. Immediately cops led by Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta surround the hospital and the tenseness builds. Hungry media cronies (who would not help Washington when he had asked earlier) also try to benefit from the misery of all those that are involved with their typical exploitation tactics (one thing Jerry Springer got right). Will Washington's son be saved and is Washington actually willing to take his own life in the venture so his boy can live? "John Q" is a very impressive production from director Nick Cassavetes (showing much of the same ability his late father John showed throughout his career). Screenwriter James Kearns gets to the soul of an American society that has been blinded by economics and inefficient big-wigs who have no business possessing the careers they have. Morality has gone out the window and that "hypocritical oath" that is so prevalent in the medical field seems to be little more than a silly afterthought. "John Q" succeeds everywhere just about except in its ending. The ending is a major mistake that took away from some of the good things accomplished before the final ten minutes. Washington, arguably better here than in recent triumphs like "Training Day" (an Oscar-winning role) and "Antwone Fisher", goes to an even higher plateau here. Much like Al Pacino in the equally under-rated "Dog Day Afternoon" (an admittedly better picture), Washington dominates in a role that thrives on a claustrophobic aspect that cannot be escaped or denied within the film's running time. Duvall and Woods are also solid, as always, but Washington is the man here. Strikingly accurate when pointing the finger at things wrong with America these days, "John Q" is a thought-provoking production that will cause its audience to think and learn about sometimes forgotten aspects of human life. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Human and Affecting Drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington continues to prove why he is one of the best actors in the business with his performance in JOHN Q, a moving, emotional, and tension-charged drama about a family man whose son needs a heart transplant; however, due to financial problems, his insurance won't cover the cost of getting his son on the donor list so John Q decides to take hostages in the hospital until someone arranges for his son to be on the donor list. Despite a preachy and simplistic screenplay, the intense direction and first-rate performances make this film work. I particularly loved Denzel's work here because this was a character unlike he had ever played before...Denzel usually played well-educated, intelligent lawyers and/or businessmen (with the obvious exception of TRAINING DAY), but here Denzel is playing an average Joe...a working stiff, struggling to pay bills and keep food on the table and a roof over his family's head who is driven to extreme measures to protect the family he cherishes so dearly. Washington gets strong support from Robert Duvall, solid as always as the hostage negotiator, James Woods as a wimpy surgeon, Anne Heche as an unsympathetic hospital administrator, and especially Kimberly Elise as John's wife. An emotional drama, wrought with tension, that will rivet you to the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington's portrayal of a desperate dad is excellent and compelling as he struggles to find a way to get his son to be treated and operated immediately, no matter what cost. He takes the whole hospital hostage until he gets it. One may say what he is doing is bad and illegal, but at the same time he stands up to the system, and fights the odds, but hey, he's doing it for his son. I praised him when he said "I don't want to bury my son, I want my son to bury me!" In a way, he's willing to sacrifice himself to save his son. The hostages he takes, seems to support him and the mass of audiences viewing are on his side. And he also seems to be calm and friendly to them too. The ending was also perfect, and overall a great film, and not to mention the great performances from Robert Duvall, James Woods and Ray Liotta of The Good Fellas, who uses his Tommy Vercetti voice again! Gotta love that guy, gotta love that Denzel Washington, recommended for those who love him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie full of suspense and meant to open your eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very well cooked thriller, with every necessary ingredient, and a plot meant to surprise the viewer.Full of love, passion, family issues, commercial interests and politics all blended into a magnificent work of art topped with Denzel Washington's performance The film shows many aspects of life, and should be seen by all people to evaluate one's point of view on each of the parallel stories depicted.The Author takes an everyday situation and sows the seed of self - criticism in every spectator, making this more than a thriller to pass the time away.The Director plays with the characters as a Master would play his pieces on a chessboard, giving each actor enough role and having a defined objective: to checkmate the audience, and I must say he does this with very few elements, mainly dialog sequences and very few Special effects, thus turning this film into a masterpiece.Denzel Washington is the perfect choice for this film, due to his ability to play poker face situations, and his ability to play any kind of character he is offered.I do highly recommend this movie, to see it two, three or more times. Every time one sees the film, gets a new detail to one's collection and a new question to answer. Ideal for family discussion and highly recommended for teenagers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep Acting of Washington! Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie, with a great acting of Denzel Washington as John Q. I felt the deep problems of health in the USA. My cousin lives in the United States (i don't), and she told me a few complaints about this problem; in the movie i finally understood about that. I don't understand how, the most powerful country in the world does have such bad health services to it's people?. For the benefit of the Americans, i hope that they change this system soon. Denzel puts his hearth on this movie, playing a normal guy with financial problems and a hard work; the way that Denzel shows his love to his son is remarkable and demonstrates why he is one of the actual best actors in Hollywood. If you have seen Searching for David's Hearth (2004), this is as the other side of the story.About the Movie: Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald (John Q.) a husband and father with some financial problems that works almost 20 hours a day on a factory but who can't afford his expenses. John is trying to get a second job in order to earn an extra money. In the middle of this John's son Mike (Daniel E. Smith) is found to have a disease caused by a bigger than normal heart, and the doctors told him that he will die soon if they don't make a heart transplant. Here everything is hard but it gets really harder when John goes to the insurance company and get the notice that his insurance suddenly don't cover this type of procedures. John and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) start to make everything possible to collect the money (a lot of money) needed just to get his son on the donor's list, with their son dying an not much money, John desperate and takes the hospital's emergency room staff and patients hostage, demanding for to his son to be put on that list and that doctors do the transplant. The story evolves emotionally deep trough all this; in a remarkable script.About the Cast: Denzel Washington put his soul onto this role, being by far the best of all!!, Kimberly Elise does good too, but a little exaggerated sometimes, Daniel Smith as Mike is pretty poor in his acting, he didn't had to do that much but this kid (sorry) still isn't a good actor; he has years to perfect his performance. James Woods acting as Dr. Raymond Turner, as always is very good and professional, also Anne Hache as Rebbeca Payne is great and show a coldness that ripped me out. Robert Duvall acting is good but his character could have been deployed even more, for the good of the film. Ray Liotta does good; Eddie Griffin is good too as one of the characters of the emergency room (Wow, this was a great cast!) 8/10! Excellent for Denzel Washington performance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what people have said, this movie is NOTHING like Dog Day Afternoon. The only similarities between the two is that both films have to do with holding a public place hostage (In Dog Day Afternoon it was a Bank in John Q, its a hospital). Sure, you see a sort of homage to Dog Day Afternoon in John Q, but thats it, the movie has its own plot. I enjoyed this film, Denzel Washington is really believeable as the down-on-his-luck father, and the rest of the supporting cast executed their characters very well. Most notably the great Robert Duvall as the hostage negotiator and Ray Liotta as the stuck-up police chief. I won't say more about this movie other than it is heart-breaking and you can almost feel the pain frustration John Q has to go through. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Denzel Washington has outdone himself in this delightful movie. I am getting spoiled when ever I go to see one of his pictures, as his depth is constantly great. Mr. Casavettes does a fine directing job in this poinient story, but with bits of humor thrown in to break up the tension. This may not be academy award material, but it certainly is worth the price of a ticket. Go see it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Q (Denzel Washington) is just an average man, he works at a factory and his wife and his son Michael are his whole world. When his son is taken ill and needs an needs an urgent heart transplant, he soon learns that his insurance won't cover the bills and he has no real hope of raising the cash himself. In an act of desperation he holds the emergency room hostage, it's all he can do to get his son the care he needs.I felt the film was fundamentally flawed, yet it was made and performed with such passion and realism, what at first seems like a far-fetched plot is soon forgotten about, and you have to just go with the flow of this emotionally charged drama.The cast is very strong, and the direction holds the story together very nicely; but most of all it achieves what it sets out to do, and that is move the audience.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Q. is solid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Starring: Denzel Washington, Kimberly Elise, Robert Duvall, and ray Liotta.John Q. is basically what the tagline says it is. You leave a father no options, you leave him no choice. That's pretty much true. Washington plays John Q. Archibald, a loving husband and caring father who must come up with 250,000 dollars to pay for his son' heart transplant or watch him die. You got to see how the hospital is unfair to John. He even states that it gives 75,000,000 dollars worth of heart transplants for free to a certain amount of people and they wouldn't give it to him from good will. John an his family are very poor and you see how hard it is for him to do this. He takes the hospital hostage to get his son a heart transplant. The movie is very solid and intelligent. There couldn't have been a better actor for John than Denzel. He is one of the greatest actors of our time and he helps prove it here. Don't listen to what Ebert says and go rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Overdue!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that America has a health care crisis where about 50 million people are uninsured in this country. The story about John Q. is about his battle to save his son's life when the hospital and health insurance companies have failed his young son by declining to put his name on the heart transplant list. Two time Oscar Winner Denzel Washington does his best to bring life into this character that any other actor would not be able to do. Kimberly Elise is also admirable in her role as his wife. Anne Heche's performance as Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, is quite sickening because she plays the bureaucracy part of the role but she does it well. She can act as well. James Woods plays the rich, blood-sucking doctor who John Q. takes hostage along with other innocent bystanders and hospital staff but John Q. has a heart too. Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall have supporting roles as the police chief and hostage negotiator trying to get John Q. to end the standoff. The actions are understandable since a parent would do anything to save their child's life from known death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A father's quest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington, in my opinion, is the best actor in Hollywood. This movie is another example of his range and versatility. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There were four points n the movie where I cried. I cried when the parents were told about Mike's heart, I cried when he talked to his on on the phone, I cried when he was saying goodbye, and I cried as he drove away. This movie shows us where we as people are coming to. His son needed a heart transplant, but the hospitals said no, they couldn't do it, because they didn't have the money. A little boy almost died because of our greed. And that isn't just Hollywood hogwash; that happens everyday. We have people ripping off other people, people murdering one another, all for greed. Where is this world coming to?I've read some comments on this movies message board of people calling John Q. selfish. Maybe you guys were watching a different movie than I was because he wasn't selfish. Can any of us imagine what it's like to know that our child is dying and yet we are powerless?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington Rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Wasington Rocks! And this fact, is once again proved, with his terrific act in 'John Q'. Though a decent film, it's flaws come up evidently, but Denzel manages to hold you till the end.Denzel stars as John Quincy Archibald, a father and husband whose son is diagnosed with an enlarged heart and then finds out he cannot receive a transplant because HMO insurance will not cover it. Therefore, he decides to take a hospital full of patients hostage until the hospital puts his son's name on the recipient's list.The Idea is interesting &amp; challenging. The film begins with a class, as the writing holds you. But, in the second hour, especially, the writing gets lose and even the culmination isn't as good as one expects it to be. Nick Cassavetes directs this emotional story, with patience. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fine. Acting-Wise: As mentioned right from the beginning, Denzel rules the show. A performance so well-done, that it holds you, even when the writing falters. In the supporting cast, Bobby Duvall, James Woods &amp; Kimberly Elise are efficient. Anne Heche &amp; Ray Liotta are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'John Q' is interesting in parts, but what really stands tall in this film, is it's lead-star's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come on, the other black guy pretending to be John Q and the police falling for it and arresting the wrong guy? Not quite likely.The ending was way too predictable. Of course the movie begins with the white woman dying in a car accident so we all see it coming. But still it was too predictable.Only one cop taking a shot at John in the air vent? And he messes up and get really easily subdued by John? Ow come on! And the cop only had one bullet in his weapon? So he sees John coming towards him and he does absolutely nothing with the gun in his hands? Yeah right. And when John was punching him he did absolutely nothing to put up a fight.But besides the holes in the movie and the cheesy ending I still loved the movie. 7 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is now the second film that I have watched which focuses on Americas health care, or lack of it, I live in the UK where all our citizens get free health care no matter what there circumstances are, What have we come to in this world if money is greater than the sum of a human life, America and it's people should be ashamed of themselves to ever let this situation happen. The film shows this situation up very well, The acting was first rate and the film in the end is a very worthy effort.

		<shortDescription>Hostage-taker who's all heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a scathing attack on the US health care service that would make Michael Moore proud, John Q presents us with the story of a very desperate father (Denzel Washington) who has reached the end of his tether after being bounced from pillar to post and rejected by all those who should help him try to get his son prioritised on an organ recipient list. His lad has a heart problem, it's almost three times the size it should be, and without a transplant he WILL die. With time running out and no other solution forthcoming, Denzel does the only thing he can think of . . . . . . he takes the emergency room staff and patients hostage.This is actually a pretty good film but, despite the "medic-aid" angle, it's also very familiar territory and doesn't really put enough into the project to warrant too much praise. There have been a number of better movies with hostage-takers becoming the sympathetic anti-hero (including the likes of The Negotiator and Mad City, both superior to this in my view) and those movies usually keep tension going throughout whereas this movie just limps along from one minor crisis to the next without letting you ever think that Big Denz will ever be in any real danger.Where the movie does score major points is in it's solid cast list. Fans will already be looking forward to seeing Denzel on form (though he's a bit hit and miss for me) but he's surrounded by some great players giving some great performances. James Woods is less snarly than usual, and all the better for it, as a cardiac surgeon who admits that the system is flawed and still just wants to do his best by it. Anne Heche is suitably bitchy as the "money" woman for the hospital, the bureaucrat who is never helpful but does not see herself as a bad person for sticking to the red tape. Robert Duvall is as good as ever, playing a weary lieutenant who would like a peaceful end to the situation while his superior (played by Ray Liotta) just wants the whole thing finished, whatever it takes. Impressively, Liotta's character is not even a consistent big, bad meanie. He's a very believable official who wants to do things his way until he sees that there may be a better option. Then we have a bunch of hostages including Shawn Hatosy (who plays a d!ck very well) and Eddie Griffin, who is not being as funny as usual but still has a few good lines.Director Nick Cassavettes never gives us anything too flashy and nor does he have to, he simply intercuts at appropriate times to show us things from a different angle just in time for us to appreciate the latest wrinkle that may bugger up John Q's plan.Enjoy the formulaic plot if you're easily pleased and enjoy the acting from a superb array of stars but I doubt it will ever be anyone's favourite movie and it's eminently forgettable.See this if you like: The Negotiator, Mad City, Cadillac Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel does a great job in this film. His performance was moving and made me cry. Just as he did in Man on Fire. The film itself isn't too bad. The music could of been better but they didn't do a bad job on it. It's Denzel's acting that makes the film however. If you are a Denzel fan and feel like watching a well performed and touching film... then get a box of tissues and sit down and watch 'John Q'. It isn't his best film but certainly another one of his well performed ones. This story is about a poor family and the poor health system in America. He loves his son dearly and will do anything for him. This is the tale about a man who will stop at nothing to try and save his son's life who needs a new heart and it truly is touching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as they say it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie came out there was a lot of criticism towards it. I can honestly say that the only good things I heard about about it was these positive reviews on Amazon. I was determined to see it and I was finally able to see it. Guess what? It isn't as bad as these critics say it is but then again the movie going public are usually made up of morons.Premise: John Q Archibald's son passes out during a baseball game. Once taken to the hospital John and his wife find out that their son has an enlarged heart. John goes through great lengths to get money just to get his son's name on the heart donor's list only to get screwed over by the same hospital that was supposed to look out for him. Down on his last luck, John Q holds the whole hospital hostage at gunpoint until his son's medical needs are met.Opinion: This movie is very touching as well as a sad testament to the issue involving healthcare. Many people bash the movie because they figure that the way John Q handled his son's situation was extreme but if you were in his shoes and handled that situation with passiveness then you deserve to get bullied by these corporate warthogs for being docile! Everybody with the exception of the ham that beats his girl fits into this movie perfectly. Eddie Griffin provided brief moments of levity, James Woods was great as the doctor who had to be forced into compromising and John Q is one of Denzel's finest performances. The movie has a happy as well as a sad ending but I wont spoil it for those of you who have yet to see it. They say that the message of the movie was hammered onto the audience but in a world full of proud-to-be-stupid people, the only way to get a message so serious across is to beat it into their thick heads. I'll part by saying that not every movie that is critically panned is bad and not every critically acclaimed movie is good. See it for yourself.</fullReview>

The plot of course has economically strapped John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) taking a hospital hostage to demand medical treatment for his son.But, like I said, they misrepresented a number of things too many to enumerate here. But this movie's strength is looking at the disastrous effects of letting insurance companies run our health care system. You just may want to move to Canada after seeing this (although I haven't moved there). Also starring Kimberly Elise, James Woods, Anne Heche, Robert Duvall, and Ray Liotta.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller, action and family drama mixed into one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'John Q' is a film which revolves around John Quincy Archibald, a decent man who works hard and is law-abiding. But when his ten-year-old son Mike is diagnosed with a cardiac condition and desperately needs a heart transplant that the family's insurer's refuse to pay for, John is force to take matters into his own hands. With his son weakening, John takes the staff and patients of a hospital hostage as he demands doctors perform the surgery.Denzel Washington plays John and, as usual, gives a very effecting performance that shows the strength and determination of a father's love without descending into schmaltz. Kimberly Elise, in her role as John's wife Denise nicely compliments his portrayal as a wife who wants a quiet life but will support her husband in anything if that is what it takes to save their son. The film also has strong support from Robert Duvall, as the hostage negotiator who sympathises with John but has a job to do, and James Woods in an uncharacteristically role as a spineless doctor who is more interested in his own life than the patients.The actual storyline was a bit too overly-sentimental at times but only someone with a hard heart couldn't be moved by John's plight. 'John Q' does highlight a number of ethical questions, such as how far should a parent go to save their child and, ultimately, how could such a tragedy happen in the twenty-first century America that a child is denied a heart transplant purely because their family can't afford it? Living in the UK, we have the National Health Service, which is far from perfect, but at least parents wouldn't have to take the law into their own hands to ensure their child is given the surgery they need to live. Despite the rather happy resolution to the film, there is still a sadness to the story because this sort of thing probably does happen despite America being so rich.'John Q' is a well-made thriller for those who also enjoy dramas and family-based films but it's also one which should be forced down the throats of every politician across the globe about why adequate health care should be provided for all, not matter what their financial status is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic, overly sentimental and over engineered. A vehicle to deliver a sermon on the US medical system.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember hearing about this at the time it was made, and there was some praise for it tackling the topic of poorer people not receiving medical treatment and the dominance of Medical Insurance in the US. There were also two seemingly good factors about it, the first being Denzel Washinton and Nick Cassavetes. Yet it's taken until now to actually see the movie, and quite frankly, I wish I'd never wasted my time...that's an hour and a half I just won't get back.The plot is extremely transparent, and from the moment John Q. enters the hospital it becomes a standard and very formulaic hostage movie, complete with copy and pasted characters and situations.The Police Chief overriding the Negotiator and going in anyway, the Negotiator connecting with the Hostage Taker, and the Hostages connecting with the...you've seen it so many times before.One thing is different though, the moralistic change in James Wood's character of the Doctor. One second he's a money hungry surgeon, and then he just totally caves in and delivers a speech about the injustice of the situation. Oh, give me a break.The movie is over engineered and overly sentimental. The only good moment was seeing Washinton break up while he talked with his kid. The rest was very poor.This is a vehicle to tell us all what's wrong with the US medical system by picking stereotypes and a formulaic story to try and capture you into the movie in order to deliver the sermon. If the movie had been better and the sermon a little less sweet, then perhaps it would be better heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the working poor always get it stuck to them, 'John Q' is a timely film showing the effects of a widening gap between the rich and poor. Rich people certainly deserve the best care they can afford because let's be honest, if we were rich, we would expect the same thing. While the rich can afford private rooms and private care, we all deserve the right to the best standard care that can save our basic lives. There are many in America who say that health care is NOT a right. Of course it is because doctors take the hippocratic oath to help EVERYONE and then it gets distorted into a business. While not condoned, the actions of Denzel Washington do save his son's life in 'John Q' and while America continues to be the only G-7 nation not to have socialized medicine for all its people, here in Canada we are slowly seeing the decay of our health care situation into a two tier system where the rich will get better care than everyone else. As the film tries to make this political point, there are big holes in the script in some of the situations but the conclusion is right on target as it does not excuse John Q's actions entirely. He has the majority of the public support on his side and that is the secret message that if people help each other, namely doctors, insurance companies, HMOs, and rich hospitals, what a better world this would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extreme look at what's wrong with US Health-care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie with a message. While I don't agree with all the premises, and think that vigilante justice isn't usually the way to solve things - this movie does present some strong arguments.But I realize that they did many things to slant the story to get the audiences sympathy - even, if like myself, you are not a proponent of a socialist health-care system for our Democratic country. The best way they did this was by casting an adorable child as the innocent victim of a health-care system gone wrong. Add to that the very loving parents, played quite effectively by Denzel Washington and Kimberly Elise, who are also hard workers, and there is very little to fault them for the situation they find themselves in. Granted, this isn't the case for everyone in the US who find themselves without coverage (as there are many who are just too lazy to work and expect the government to provide all their needs without their making any effort).But, with politics aside, this is a very powerful movie that is heavy on the pulling of the heart strings. They do a great job of building and escalating tension throughout the movie - though some may find it manipulative. There is quite a stirring sacrifice offered near the end that I won't reveal but it really took me by surprise.I think one of my favorite scenes is the opening sequence with the impatient lady driving the BMW erratically through the mountains. It was beautifully filmed in slow motion with a rousing classical score to accompany. It was truly memorable and rather shocking in itself in the outcome and how it later ties into the resolution of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The combination of conventional components result in an overall exceptional movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During a baseball game, John Quincy Archibald's son Michael collapses and is diagnosed as having a major heart defect that requires a transplant ASAP. Sadly John and his wife, Denise, don't have enough insurance to cover the cost of such an operation, no matter what they do they just can't come up with enough cash to save Michael's life. Desperate and angry at the money laden red tape, John takes the ER room hostage and demands that the transplant be done. For the most part it is horribly conventional and certainly doesn't come without flaws, but I find it intriguing, topically. I know the general public will say it's heavy-handed, preachy or something to this effect.I like how this drama turns into a crime picture/thriller after half an hour, which came totally unexpected to me when I first saw it, knowing practically nothing about the movie. It made you care a lot about the characters without boring you during their introduction. It presents a crime to you (a hostage situation) that to most people will seem justified, something rather unusual in movies. (V for Vendetta comes to mind, which makes terrorism seem justified.) Whether the crime is actually justified or not is the question 'John Q' asks the audience. And that's where, I think, the film succeeds. In offering a basis for further meditation and discussion about the topics and questions raised by the film.Furthermore it also is one of those "What would you do in this situation" movies that I like so much. Such motion pictures don't even have to do much to convince me, as half the flick is playing out in my head anyway. Those two things together with the fore-mentioned appreciated unexpected switch of genre half-way through make this overall unexceptional film absurdly exceptional to me. Maybe because the individual, conventional components work in this unusual package.(plot summery contributed by my friend and fellow IMDber Spike)</fullReview>

Desperate and angry at the money laden red tape, John takes the ER room hostage and demands that the transplant be done.Coming as i do from Great Britain, i have no bond of feeling to the thought of having to pay for medical insurance, so with that in mind i viewed John Q from the off with a certain degree of interest. Just scanning through some of the user comments here it's apparent that this is a most divisive picture amongst the American users, no great deal of middle ground, it's either preachy nonsense trying to make a moral stance, or it's a highly involving picture tenderly bringing to light a serious issue.My thoughts are quite simply that as a drama it works considerably well, the issue at hand makes for a compelling picture, and even allowing for an overkilling of sentimental strands, it's intelligent and never less than interesting. However the constant stream of formulaic characters hinders the film and stops it totally achieving its aims, to anyone who hasn't seen this picture i would wager that if i asked you to pick ten characters for a hostage piece, you would get nine of them right. It's a real shame because John Q is a fine film in substance, and is backed up by a competent cast list, even if not all of them are quite utilised to the maximum.Taking the lead as John Q is Denzel Washington, few actors of his generation can give so much emotion into a character, it's a great turn from him and one that deserves far more credit that it gets. Robert Duvall and James Woods have critical roles but not given enough meat to really get their respective teeth into, Ray Liotta is safe and enjoyable in an annoying role, whilst Kimberly Elise {as mother Denise} and Anne Heche {the cold hearted hospital administrator} are merely making up the numbers. A bit more bravery and a bit less sentiment may well have lifted John Q into one of this decades best dramas category, as it is it's a missed opportunity that still delivers enough punch for this particular viewer to give it the thumbs up. 7/10</fullReview>

No, I don't think a father would actually hold his son's doctor hostage to try and save him, that would require real MEN and real FATHER'S to exist in this country, but I thought the concept was excellent. Nick Cassavetes surprised me in his direction of this film. It was great. As a survivor of an HMO fiasco, I can relate to the trauma experienced by John Q and his wife. Again, this movie was...

Denzel's acting in this film is predictable... and by that I mean that it is typical Denzel Washinton, superb, overwhelming and beautiful. He really knows how get into the characters he plays, James Woods is not a bad addition to this either, those two actors in this one film and with such a touching and dramatic story that will most- likely have everyone in the audience weeping with such emotion that this film provokes. A father with no other choice, original and totally a possible these days.

		<fullReview>When I saw the previews for this movie, it looked stupid and simplistic, and the type of movie I most definitely didn't want to see. But since it was playing in my dorm, I watched it.Denzel Washington manages to humanize this extremist character and makes his situation seem realistic. I like that they put in the parts of John raising all that money and stuff, it really made non-hostage takers like myself feel like he didn't really want to take hostages. I still think he jumped to conclusions, but oh well!Don't worry about the healthcare talk (I agree with a lot of it, but it is definitely a polarizing issue), or the stupid caricatures (Duvall as good cop, Liotta as bad cop, Anne Heche as (what else) a mean bitch, James Woods as a "realist with a heart of gold", Eddie Griffin as the token black guy, the mean hostage, the list goes on), just sit back and look at it as a puzzle, where some decent direction and Denzel Washington try to realize a pretty ridiculous premise, and come damn close. 10/10, because I feel like I've done it disrespect in the past.(And btb, if you like Denzel Washington, and you haven't seen Malcolm X, what are you waiting for?)</fullReview>

John and wife are crying at their son's bad news, but the first several scenes are so poorly acted, that no empathy is felt for them.----------***spoiler alert***-----Honestly, the ending was terribly predictable. You know that the intro sequence of the woman weaving in and out of lanes would be required to hold some bearing on the story. It's ridiculous to think otherwise. The movie's hostage situation degenerates by turn John Q. into a hero. We must ignore the fact that he shut down one of the cities busiest hospitals deflecting patients into other undoubtedly crowded emergency rooms. Denzel does give an above average performance in the second half, but this movie didn't move me in the slightest. Another complaint I have is with the fake looking operation.

		<shortDescription>Have a Heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington is a hard-working blue collar father whose son needs a heart transplant but who has run out of money and can't afford further medical treatment. He impulsively takes over Hope Memoral Hospital in Chicago, calling himself "John Q." (as in "John Q. Public"), holds the minimal weekend staff hostage and demands that his son be put on the list of recipients for a donated heart by a doctor (Anne Heche). Outside, the police (Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta) surround the place, a thousand guns aimed at the hospital, and try variously to negotiate with him or to snipe him. No donor being available, Washington decides that since he and his son have been tissue-typed and match, Washington will blow his own brains out to provide the necessary heart. Lots of arguments follow, involving chiefly one of the hostages who happens to be a cardiac surgeon (James Woods). As in a miracle, a young woman with a matching heart dies and the donation comes through just as Washington is wrestling with the damned safety on the automatic he's holding to his head. Whew! A close call, I'd say.Well, it has a truly competent professional cast, no doubt about it, and they play it at par. Also quite good in a small role is Paul Johansson. Nick Cassavetes' direction is functional but no more than that.The movie's up against the wall though. Inevitably we're dealing with de Maupassant's "Boule de Souif," in which a small group of people of varying tastes and backgrounds are squeezed together under pressure and little dramas play out between them. In a case like this the success depends as much on the script as on anything else. Given that it's going to look a little mechanical, and given that none if any of the characters can be given full development, whether the film satisfies or not hangs on what the characters say."Stagecoach" did a fine job, and so did "Twelve Angry Men" and "Dog Day Afternoon," so it's not an impossible task. The characters here are mostly predictably stereotyped. Among the police, we have the negotiator in conflict with the exterminator. We have conflict within the hospital between the pragmatist doctor and the humanist doctor. Among the waiting-room patients we have the noble black couple about to have their first child and the cowardly slapaho sniveling braggart of a white guy. The police sniper is fat, sweaty, sneering, and ugly.And they pretty much stay the way they are. There is a good deal of preaching that goes on. HMOs come in for a good deal of abuse. We know immediately that the chief of police, Liotta, is a simple-minded goon because he shows up at the "hostage situation" in full uniform, dripping with decorations, shaking hands with the press, telling everyone what to do because he knows best -- "How do you think I got THESE?", he shouts at Duvall's negotiator, pointing to the four stars on his shoulder. Oh -- the press. I forgot about the press. I leave it up to you to guess whether the model presented to us is the same as that in the "Die Hard" films (get the scoop at all costs, and make sure my hair looks good) or the idealistic responsible model the fifth estate would like us to swear to. The film overall takes a worthwhile story about a social issue and turns it into and almost unbroken string of sentimental clichés. There are some good things going for the film, despite the weaknesses of the script. A few exchanges stand out. As in "Dog Day Afternoon," when the crowd cheers Al Pacino, there is a crowd here that goes wild with applause when Denzel Washington appears at the hospital door. But Duvall puts it in perspective. "You're just the cause for today. Tomorrow you'll be forgotten." Anne Heche, the hard-boiled doctor, is given a good line too. If we give in to Washington's demands today, tomorrow the hospitals will be filled with gun-toting loonies. Why is it a good line, when nothing more is made of it? Because although it sounds like common sense there is not the slightest evidence that it's true. Our values are filled with such axioms. We never negotiate with terrorists. We only negotiate from a position of strength. Give 'em an inch and they'll take a mile. Skinnerian reenforcement works well with puppies and rats under controlled conditions. But does it work outside the lab? Probably, in a general way, but what's really at stake when we refuse negotiation -- reenforcement or our own pride? Should life and death depend on a notion so simple that it can be put on a bumper sticker? The film isn't entirely original or gripping, despite the tension inherent in the situation, but I'd be willing to rate it above average if it just makes us think a little more about that primitive belief.It's necessary to add that this is not a partisan liberal tract. The economics of HMOs is briefly and cogently explained and they come out looking bad. Not because they're evil but because that's the way health plans were structured. They were a social problem years before they became a political issue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, from the first 10 minutes, attempts to make a deep and philosophical commentary on the United States' poor health care system. The problem is that instead of making these points with plot, actions, and emotions, the viewers are beaten over the head with obvious dialogue that sounds completely contrived. In addition, the messages that the movie tries to pass as revolutionary are infact incredibly old and are insultingly simplified to anyone with a high school education or better! In short, the movie attempts to be deep and comes up extremely short (somewhere between insulting and retarded). One final note, on top of my previous complaints the movie is also horribly acted (with the exception of Denzel) and has a ridiculous number of side plots that are also contrived and never go anywhere.

Of course, the kid should not be left to die; private charity is way better than government welfare, something that the film deliberately hides.

Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) is the hospital president and Dr. Raymond Turner (James Woods) is their cardiac surgeon. Mike needs a heart transplant but the HMO won't cover the minimum $250k. They can't get any help no matter how hard they try. In desperation, an armed John takes over the emergency room. Police Lt. Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) negotiates with him.It's an over-the-edge melodrama. The problem is that everything is pushed to the edge. Denzel is crying in the first 15 minutes. I appreciate the message but it's lost in the montage of frustration. Denzel is pushing so hard to be hyper angry that it's difficult to root for him. If Denzel and Kimberly could calm down early on, the audience could embrace them. In fact, everybody seems to be yelling in this movie. It's a hard movie to like.</fullReview>

But this film is so damn hammy and corny and obvious and ridiculous, that all you can do is grin and wait for the hits to keep on coming. I mean, it makes Spike Lee feel understated.And the sad part is, you can see a great Denzel performance in the making. You can tell he was all in and thought this could be the next Philadelphia...but the movie is about 10 or 15 years too late, and way too contrived and blunt for you to believe in the story or the characters.I love what this wants to be.

		<fullReview>A heart wrenching potential loss of a son and a beautiful scene about the self sacrifice of a father are well acted and touching. Tear jerking and beautiful.However, the movie "John Q" presents multitudes of only positive support for universal health care. The argumentation presented in the movie is myopic, however. I wish to devote my review largely to this incredibly important issue of empathy for others.To claim (and I quote) that "when someone is sick, they get care" is just policy is very selfish; if we are to respect each others' lives, freedom, and choices, then we are to respect that if nobody wishes to perform a surgery on you, provide their heart for you, or perform other services for you, then we ought not receive them.Sometimes, life can be difficult. To be fair to others, we have to grow up and embrace our misfortunes rather than turn them into the misfortunes of unknown people around us. The protagonist was an unrealistic character in that he was self sufficient and respectful in the end, but throughout most of the movie performed every behavior to demonstrate that he was selfish and insensitive in his providence for his son. Without this implausible character who is simultaneously both selfish and self sufficient, the movie would have difficulty presenting a moving for armed heart robbery and enslavement of doctors.Don't you DARE ruin others' lives. Look at the big picture. Get angry about John Q's dangerous message of mob rule enslaving the non-majority.

		<fullReview>This kind of movie intentionally plays and profits upon the worst side of a bureaucratic health care system that is sometimes unfair but much more often makes mistakes in practice and judgement. That said, in the case of the boy heart transplant patient in this movie, there is nearly unlimited foundation, etc. financing for the type of heart issue he faced, but this movie totally downplayed that availability of funding purely to arouse anger and sympathy of viewers to get more butts in the seats and make more profit than would telling the real truth. With absolutely no health insurance at all, the boy would have received free treatment. Special cases such as his get special attention and he would have received all he needed. Not saying that would make him a normal person after, but it would do as much as possible under his specific circumstances.How Hollywood is allowed to totally distort the truth just to make more money is irresponsible at least and surely repugnant to all of us who try so hard to help in these cases, and I for one am disgusted by these lies and distortions of truth. Thumbs way down on any movie that does this, but thumbs not even on the hand for the greedy studio that made it and the "movie stars" who acted in it.</fullReview>

His God-given talent draws the viewer onto a borderline of reality and fiction causing the audience to feel as though they are actually enduring every aching moment. When he cries, the audience cries; When he feels anger or disappointment, so do the viewers. Denzel Washington did not just play John Q. he became John Q. I recommend this movie to all audiences because this movie is thus far the movie of the year. This movie will definitely be nominated and win its share of Oscars this year.

I felt like the script had potential as we watched Denzel Washington (John Q Archibald) and Kimberly Elise (Denise Archibald) family life unfold and watching Denzel interact with young actor, Daniel Smith (Mike Archibald ) was wonderful, but once John takes hostage of the hospital emergency room the film becomes sketchy. I love the climatic drama but the infusion of preaching about how HMOs treat patients started to become a public announcement instead of the great film it started out as. I love Denzel no doubt and Kimberly Elise (I'm so glad they finally let her shine) but I was disappointed in the script's ending it could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not all that bad. Yea they shoved the message down your throat, about how terrible the system is. But the action held it together. You're gonna read alot of reviews that put down the movie. But seriously how long has it been since a movie had you at the climax like that. The whole theater was yelling at the screen saying "No don't do it". There were gasps all over the theater. And I have to give the movie that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Q is one of greatest movies to date. Denzel Washington gives an Oscar-Winning performance as John Q. A father who's son, Michael needs a new heart or he will die. John has insurance, but it can't cover a heart transplant operation, so the hospital won't operate. John has no choice, but to take the hospital hostage so they can perform the operation. Denzel is not the only one who gives a knockout performance. James Woods is excellent as a cardiologist taken hostage. Anne Hecht is great has a ruthless medical supervisor, Kimberly Elise give a amazing performance as Denzel's wife and mother to Michael. Eddie Griffin is hilarious as a hostage and Robert Duvall gave a riveting performance. Ray Liotta is also great,and the hostages are excellent.This movie also shows that you should never get an HMO. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

I was glad this was also a good , decent movie. It is abit predictable but as stated there is a good amount of time you are left wondering about Denzels fate..and more than once. I will admit there are a lot of ultra unrealistic Hollywood moments, but overall, it makes it to a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Underrated movie with Denzel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel's performances are some of the most underrated ever and this is surely his MOST underrated performance. The story is about a father and mother whose son immediately faints while playing baseball and he needs a hear transplantation. The problem is that surgery like that costs too much for the family. There are other problems as well and we realize that there is no way that the son could receive a new heart and the father takes justice in his own hands. It's a wonderful movie about the average citizen whose love is much more expensive than rich people's wealth. The movie is realistic in some ways. I mean a real father is gonna do all he can to save his son. After all family is the most important thing for any normal human being. It's a cliché of course, but I will always say that, cause I feel some people often forget it. I was touched by the movie. I wanted to help Densel's character, I wanted to be in the movie and I was sad at some scenes which rarely happens although I am a huge cinema fan and I mean real cinema. John Q is real cinema. Although I love most Denzel movies, I have a thought that John Q is the most personal while Trainning Day and Man on Fire, although considered as some of the best movies from the last couple of year, I think have some useless action moments. This one could have some as well, but it didn't. The story is great and I love that movie and I have to admit it was a positive surprise. And I want to point one more thing. We have great support actors like James Woods and Robert Duvall who are some of the greatest actors ever and this is not only my opinion. Duvall doesn't give a great performance, but his presence is enough. Woods's character is somebody who I wanted to kill and I guess this is the reason I liked his performance which is rather unusual for him than great or bad and since I like him, I would say he does a good performance. This is everything I wanted to say about John Q. I look in the details far too deeply, I guess, but the movie is incredible in my opinion and if I write a review about an incredible movie, I write it the way I feel it. John Q is one of the best drama movies from the past 10 years and it's a tie with Trainning Day in my Denzel rankings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i saw this movie, I cried... It is crafted base on true to life events, definitely one of the pressing issues in this world that everyone shud discuss. I mean, who couldn't relate to the story? John Q talks about how degraded our system is, favoring the rich and not giving any chances to those who didn't have the cold paper called "mOnEy". And those hospitals that prioritizes those who had their insurances, that even if you're already dying in front of them no care would be given to you if u cannot assure them that you're ABLE to pay... so ghasty talaga! Although John Q hostage the hospital, i think his actions were justifiable... I mean, he is a father who has a dying son... nobody can help but to be bad just to save a son. John Q committed a crime only to the law's eyes and not to the public's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"John Q' Starring- Denzel Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this move last night on the CBS Sunday Night Movie. At first, I thought that this was a movie with a very serious subject matter, which it is. But after the scene where Ann Heche tells the Archibalds that their son will have to leave the hospital, I was sure that this movie was a satire. I am a registered nurse, and I know how things work in a hospital. No one at any hospital would be so cold, nor could they kick a sick patient out legally. That's when I first decided this was a satire. Then I noticed all the really talented actors in this truly crazy movie, such as Washington, Duavall, and Woods. I figured they were all socially conscious people who did this move as a satire, with the purpose of exposing all the heartless, insane, unfair, cruel things about our health care system. This movie was so crazy, I was sitting there laughing at what I was SURE was a satire. But when it was over, I looked in the TV guide, and it was listed as a "drama." Sure, it was a drama, but also a satire, right? Just LOOK at all the crazy behavior! What about the ditsy blonde kicking that guy in the ER lobby? Wasn't that supposed to be funny? Wasn't the whole movie supposed to be funny? Just the idea of a parent hijacking a hospital to force doctors to perform a heart transplant on their child indicated this is a satire on our insane health care system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but why the anti-Catholic subtext?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of the movie has an idiot woman causing her own death by driving recklessly. She has a rosary hanging from her rear-view mirror and is listening to "Ave Maria" on her stereo. The hospital in the movie is treated as a for-profit corporate monstrosity, but there are Catholic statues everywhere. The sad fact is that Catholic institutions in this country are often too bureaucratic and money-centered. And many traditionally Catholic hospitals have merged themselves with secular institutions, etc. But none of these interpretations are offered by the movie. While the word "Catholic" is never used, it is obviously a Catholic hospital and depicted horribly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense drama, great acting, a powerful movie *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand anyone watching this movie and not liking it. Denzel Washington is fabulous as a father who will stop at nothing to save his child. Anne Heche is superb as the cold, formal hospital administrator who lives by the attitude "this is a business". This is a movie that has 2 themes. One is about the love of a parent for a child, the other is about the "business" of health care. Both are equally powerful themes. One will ask themselves, if a parent, would they not do the same thing if their child was gravely ill??? What would one stop at to save their child?? One will also ask, what kind of a health care system do we have in the good 'ol USA to allow something like this to happen (not based on a true story, but could very well happen, as a nurse, I can attest to this). The role was made for Denzel, he aced it. Ray Liotta is great too, but underused. I would have liked to see him in Duvall's role instead..but nonetheless, the three of them, were convincing. This movie is worth watching not only for the fantastic acting, but the message it sends. More people need to see it to become better educated health care consumers and familiarize themselves with what health care in this country is all about $$$...that said...it is a powerful movie, very intense because of the emotions it brings to the surface. Watch it, you won't be disappointed 8/10*. (Grab some tissues too, and if you can, watch the special features on the DVD to learn a little)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film. As others point out, the plot is simple. Son needs a transplant. Father takes hospital hostage to try to get it. But a simple plot is not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes you don't want to have to interpret everything.I thought the characterizations of the little family were so sweet. The trivial spats of everyday life earlier in the film. Later, both parents fighting together, willing to do anything to save the child. Some contrived, but heart-wrenching, moments showing each parent's love for the child. Denzel W. gave a very real performance as the decent, hard-working, blue-collar dad. Yes, he was almost perfect. Yes, the bad people were uniformly bad. Yet, the movie still works because of the strong performances of Denzel W. and the woman who played his wife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel continues to shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington follows his powerful and gripping role in "Training Day" with a strong, powerful and intense performance in "John Q." Immense star power, outstanding performances, a powerful message and a poignant story; these are the qualities, which make "John Q" one of the most powerful movies of the year.With raw intensity, extreme authenticity and powerful intrigue Washington leads an all-star cast that includes Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, James Woods and Anne Heche. With tremendous support from Kimberly Elise, Daniel E. Smith and Eddie Griffin, "John Q." is a solid film that delivers on the promise to satisfy.The best thing about watching "John Q." is the conviction, integrity, brutal honesty and intense emotion each actor ought to their character. Furthermore, the cast is not afraid to tackle the truth surrounding the health care system and the way the system treats society. Washington, Heche, Duvall and Liotta create electricity with each scene they are in."John Q." surrounds a father who has been pushed over the edge as he attempts to save the life of his son, Mike, after it is found that his heart has a defect. Though he has insurance that covers the surgery to give his son a new heart, John Q. takes the hospital hostage until the hospital administrator puts Mike's name on the list for a heart transplant.It always puts a smile on my face to watch a movie that has the courage to tackle the truth. The writers deserve most of the credit for bringing to light one of the most important issues facing America; the health care system. Through creating intense moments and powerful scenes, the writers were able to successfully capture my attention and make me feel as if I were in the movie. Writing is the first thing I look at when I make my decision to give it a thumbs up or down, so when "John Q." passed this test, I knew it was only a matter of time before the rest would fall into place.There is not much one can say about Duvall other than he is a phenomenal talent who along with Washington brings credibility. Each film Duvall takes part in seems to turn into magic because he brings so much to each role. He may not have been the best actor in "John Q." but he was certainly the best suited for the role he had as the hostage negotiator.Heche is an added bonus to "John Q." as her role as the hospital administrator is performed with integrity, brutal honesty and fire that makes her role incredibly satisfying. Another actor who made a tremendous impact in "John Q." is James Woods Woods whose best quality is his ability to play villainous role so well it makes everyone forget that he is only playing a part. I relish the opportunity to watch his next film. Ray Liotta's role as the police chief is far and beyond his best performance to date. It's fun to watch everyone come together to turn in a great ensemble performance."The Hurricane," "Courage Under Fire," and "Philadelphia" are only three films, which has cemented Washington as one of the top notch actors in Hollywood. With his role in "John Q.," Washington brings authenticity, screen presence and ability to draw the viewers in with his unique charm. These are qualities he has been able to utilize in previous films.With the integrity of his performance and intensity of his presence, Washington was able to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. A smile comes to my face with every Denzel Washington film because I know I will get a quality performance from him. It is a pleasure to watch a fine actor continue to deliver on demand."John Q." is a blockbuster with intense dialogue, powerful scenes and a poignant story that will satisfy everyone from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Q was an amazing powerful film. One of the best of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JOHN Q was an amazing , important piece of work by Nick Cassavetes. Wow. Seems both sad and ironic that I watch this during Fourth of July weekend, when we boast again about our Independence from England, yet our country is in a pitiful mess. This is a great performance by Denzel ranking up there with "Training Day", "Glory" and "Philadelphia". A couple of times he goes over the top as John Q, but his acting and emotions make his character believable. John Q is a working man, whose family is just getting by, you can say their poor, as when his wife car becomes repossessed by the bank. His family has medical insurance, where he pays $100 a month or so, although as we learn doesn't mean a damn thing when it REALLY MATTERS. His kid becomes sick and we learn that he has a bad heart. Q's only recourse is to give his kid a heart transplant at the behest of a greedy HMO Chiropractor played James Woods and the greedy , white hospital director played Anne Heche. These are some vile characters. Despite the claims that Hope Memorial hospital helps out everyone, in reality they help out the rich with fat checkbooks.Q learns that PPO former medical plan has changed and that the hospital wont offer any help. So basically he has to watch his son die with the Hospital Director with her million dollar salary and others not giving a damn. Aint that sweet Capitalism and Greed triumphs over Loyalty and Values in America. Q takes matter into his own hands and well the rest is history. Nick Cassavetes through this powerful, great film brings into the focus the Disarray , and Greed in Medical Care in America. Despite the fact that we boast about being the greatest superpower, WE CANT even take care of our people and, sadly it seems that the person in charge don't care. Talk about impact this movie makes it. Sad to say I don't think the situation will change whether a Democrat or Republic will take office. See John Q!!! I bet Michael Moore has as his next movie will supposedly tackle the Health Care Industry. Cassavetes does a great job here I wouldn't be surprised if Moore borrows a lot for that films from this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hesitated to buy it because I read in the critics that it wouldn´t be a realistic movie. Well at part it is true but only what concerns the operation conditions and some incredible scenes in the hospital. For the rest the story is worth seeing. Denzel Washington did a fine job and his wife in the movie too. This films critics in a very sharp way the real problem in the health organization and that everything works only with money. I hope the authorities will learn something. The movie had for me many twists and turns and sometimes I had tears in my eyes. That´s not an action movie but it's dramatic enough to have suspense time. After long time I found with JOHN Q a new DVD for my collection. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, powerful film with some small drawbacks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JOHN Q (2002)THE GOOD:--I liked how this movie had a little bit of everything. John (Denzel Washington) gave a tear-inducing speech to his son near the end of the film, and the film is mostly dramatic showing the struggle John and his wife go through. Though the comedy was very funny, I loved seeing Shawn Hatosy's character get beaten up by his girlfriend, and the little mockeries of media. We also get some good suspense/thriller stuff with the sniper in the building. --The acting in "John Q" is most likely to be it's biggest strength. Denzel Washington, fresh from an Oscar win for the stunning "Training Day", is as good as he always is, displaying fierce determination as an exterior and we also see throughout his performance than John really is just a heartbroken man, so very upset about his son's possible death. Kimberley Elise gives a quite outstanding performance and she's very underrated. The supporting actors (Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, Anne Heche and so on) also do well but not are not as stunning and award-worthy as the two leads.--I liked the messages to American public health in this film. I don't live in America, I don't know how the health system works over there, but this film allowed me a little insight into it, and I've been told from various friends who live in the country that the depiction of the cruel health system in America is very accurate. I found it intriguing, as well as very sad, that money was such a big issue. --The operation scene was quite amazingly done, probably the highlight of the film.THE BAD:--The film is very predictable. I could actually tell what was going to happen at the end very early into the film, and it was a very convenient ending to me, and mished far too well.--MAJOR SPOILERS: The most annoying scene/moment in this film is how you see John about to shoot himself, and then later it cuts to him being alive again? He was fully about to pull the trigger, what stopped him? There was no one there is dissuade him about his decision and the lady who was running to tell him was way away from John.--I found some of the supporting characters in the film to be annoying and rather useless to the film (Ray Liotta). Some also are very stereotyped and underdeveloped, which was frustrating at times. The leads were very well developed though.RATING:8/10 - An underrated, brilliantly acted film with some small drawbacks.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Catch Me If You Can (9/10) Don't Say a Word (6/10) The Hurricane (9/10) Phone Booth (9/10) Training Day (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A plot that actually draws the characters into it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Washington is John Q Archibald, a family man, not unlike a lot of us...a wife, a child, struggling to make ends meet and living the song, "Too much month at the end of the money."But when his son collapses, events unfold that become a parent's worst nightmare...and lead Washington on a quest where even his actions do not make the guarantee that he's ultimately working for: life...This is an excellent movie! Washington was surrounded by a cast that drew upon each other, and the ensuing arguments he had with the characters of James Woods and Anne Heche showed the world just how cold hearted the medical community can be sometimes.But even colder was the police chief on the outside. Ray Liotta appears as the Chief of Police and not so much worried about how they are going to resolve the situation Washington has found himself in, but how they're going to look in front of the press while doing it. His lieutenant, played by Robert Duvall, seems to have more of a grasp of the situation than any one else and the interactions between Duvall and everyone involved was great. His character kept one goal in mind...resolve the situation with as few casualties as possible.I gave this movie 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree completely with cheetah-6 who said: "Cliche characters, implausible story, over the top message about the health care system in this country make this one a real bomb. Although some good issue's were touched upon, the plot is so predictable and the characters so stereo typically weak that the whole thing is just laughable. Has a trite, simplified, made for TV feel to it. Kind of amusing watching fine actors like Duvall, Liotta and Woods look ridiculous trying to salvage their roles with this third rate material. Great movie to make fun of." Spoiler ahead: I'll take it one step further with how this movie could have been so much better. There was a great plot twist when John Q decided he would take his own life to save his kid. What a great way to end the movie. John Q puts gun to his head. Fade to black. Gunshot heard. Or what if great drama led up to the sniper's one shot being a successful head shot and then James Woods the doctor rushes to remove John Q's heart and put it in the kid. Powerful endings that would have made a much more powerful movie. As usual, Hollywood went for the cheap happy crap and cheated us out of a real ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make no mistake, this is not a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie belongs on the Lifetime television network. But, seeing as Denzel Washington is in it, the movie went to theaters. This movie is designed to make you weep. It tugs at your heartstrings with the precision of Rob Reiner, and the overly-simplistic message of an after school special. Sure, it takes a while for them to settle on one message (universal healthcare, eh?) but that's pretty much it.Note: in the scene with the hostages and John Q sitting around talking, I really thought that they were trying to set a record for how many liberal hot-button issues that could be brought up in one scene.So, let's start racking up the cliches, shall we?1. First cop on the scene is an older gentleman who the rest of the force makes fun of for being old...but we know better, don't we? At least he's not retiring in a couple days.2. The police chief is a media hungry, sound-bite hound who does nothing but what looks good in the press and is at the beckon call of the mayor. And we get all this within Ray Liotta's first 90 seconds of screen time.3. The woman who turns John Q down for the transplant is evil. How evil?, you may ask. Well, let me tell you...she smokes. If you haven't been paying attention to movies for the past ten years, that means the character isn't a very nice person.4. John Q's friend spews forth every catch phrase and buzz word that stupid people clamp onto when they don't truly understand a situation. (He actually says, "For those of us whose last name isn't Rockafeller..."5. The hostages represent a very eclectic cross-section of the health care industry and of society at large. The bad guy in there isn't just a woman beater...he smokes too.I could go on, but that would involve giving too much of the plot away. This is a stereotypical hostage/parent on the brink/soap box melodrama. And it also reinforces an idea that has become commonplace in films over the past several years: It's not a national news story until Jay Leno makes a joke about it in his monologue. And now, the John Q heart transplant dancers!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put the movie in short: It's allright. It has most of the elements that will make the standard person in society like it. It bashes government (Whoo hoo) and supports the little guy "by any means necessary." If you're the average moviegoer just looking to be entertained for 2 hours - have fun.However, I greatly dislike some of the perceived statements beingmade in the movie, and of course, many people's reactions - and the idiotic banter that follows.Firstly: Setting up a Socialized Medicare system is quite simple. People will see more money on their dollar going to medical procedures, and everyone will have basic health coverage. Grand. What one does not want to see is this:One: It's basic coverage. Something like a heart-transplant still requires privatized medical coverage even in many socialzed medicare systems. Why? Because it's still expensive any way you slice it and will almost never be included in what you tax-dollars are going towards.Two: Research. When was the last time you saw a great medical advance come out of a socialized medical system that wasn't university based? The fact is that having a competitive medical environment run by people in the private sector will advance at an alarmingly faster rate than that of government run medicine. When you have government funded medical care, the government is going to step in and regulate those giving the care as the next step - so privatized research will take one of the first hits.I'm not saying John Q is wrong - there are extremes. But someone nailed it right on the head earlier in the comments I've read... People want great medical coverage but they don't want to pay for it. If conditions such as organ-replacements, multiple specialist surgeries, or intensive cancer treatment are a concern - research your medical coverage options - then... run in the park instead of going to the gym to save the extra $50 a month it will cost to get the better insurance package. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once the glitter wears off, reality begins to set in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie the first few times I saw it. It initially blew me away, the level that a man has to stoop to in order to save his dying son. It has highs, it has lows, it has medical drama straight out of the play book of E.R. But the more I watch it, the more it grates on my nerves. The clichés and outlandish plot just unfolds like a broken accordion. Kimberly Elise's crying scenes force me to skip forward because her shrieks are like nails on a chalkboard. The more and more I watch and dissect the movie for its take on the plight of the underinsured in America (of course, the guy just happens to be working-class black), the more I realize that the movie is riddled with inaccuracies.Blah, blah, blah. A little black kid from a working-class burb needs a new heart and dad will do anything in the world to get it for him. To think that the story ends there, even though the director does, is foolhardy thinking. What about the anti-rejection drugs the kid will have to take forever? Who will cover those costs? What about the environment he will have to live in and the limitations he will have on life? What about the thousands the kid will have in medical bills afterwards? What will dad sell then? What about if the kid rejects the heart? The movie would lose its feel-good quality if we looked at that harsh reality, but it's irresponsible not to. Let's demonize the health care industry instead. Of course! John Q is entertainment with a bit of social examination thrown in for good measure. But I hope that when one watches the movie they do not think that government will solve all with national health care. I do hope that people won't think that anyone can be saved just by calling the local news or staging a stand-off in a hospital. Take it for face value: it's a first step in a complicated argument.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is incredible. i think is the only movie as far as i remember i actually felt like crying, i had to turn away from the screen for a sec to stop. every single action of Denzel in this movie shows you his role of being a responsible father, a man of his words, and most important of all, it shows what it takes to be a MAN. a great dad, a great husband, a great friend, a great man of integrity who never gave up to achieve what he promised. i think this movie is great to strengthen a father and son relationship. i recommend this movie to young adults, and fathers who are willing to sacrifice anything for his family. this movie motivated me so much almost 10 stars, Denzel is such a great actor and a great man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JOHN Q, in my opinion, is an excellent thriller that'll have you glued to your seat from start to finish. It sort of reminds me of THE NEGOTIATOR, only this movie mostly takes place in a hospital. I really loved John (Denzel Washington). This is because he wouldn't give up hope for his son (Daniel E. Smith). If I were him, I'd do something desperate, but not illegal. Grimes (Robert Duvall) made me feel good, too. It's hard for me to explain why. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action movie that have you glued to your seat from start to finish to all you Denzel Washington or Robert Duvall fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a wild ride. I also guarantee you you'll want to see it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true father; caring and determined. Going to take any risks to ensure that his son is going to be okay. I didn't really like the part when he held them hostage at the beginning but I felt so moved by this movie when he was actually very kind to them and there was no bullet in his gun. All I could do was think; if I had a father like that, I would be the luckiest girl in the world. And I'm not saying my father is bad at all, but this movie just showed me how far fathers would go to save their child. This movie got me so emotional but this is such a great movie! It comes as close to Titanic as I can ever imagine; everyone, please watch this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, I could go on and on about this film's shortcomings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers!!! This reviewer is saddened that the talented, versatile Denzel Washington (and also James Woods) would associate himself with a sub-par film, in this case John Q. (2002). In the final analysis, John Q. is a forceful political/social statement on the merits of universal healthcare at least for all children. We are made to sympathize for universal healthcare because of the unfortunate, albeit tragic case of John Q.'s son, who is likely to die because his family's insurance plan won't cover heart transplant surgery. So, in summary, the film is a voice for liberalism by virtue of the fact that universal healthcare is part of the liberal agenda. And the film makes efforts to conceal this obvious liberal attempt. Who do we see at the end? Mrs. Universal Health Care herself, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton.But what made this film so odious was not its extreme liberalism, but its lack of originality. Was I the only one flashing back to Dog Day Afternoon as I watched the crowd of people ridiculing the police as they surrounded the hospital? I was just waiting for John Q. to come through the doors and prance around the sidewalk, screaming "Attica!" The rip-off of Dog Day was so obvious that it was absurd and insulting. I mean, if you're going to copy another film please do it in a less obvious way!Also, there was so little effort put into explaining how the "hostages" went from fearful to supportive of John Q.'s efforts. At no point did the man actually sit down and explain to the hostages why he had taken control of the hospital. We are just made to assume that at some point they are told about his son. If he had explained his situation, maybe I could buy into the shift of the hostages. Again, in Dog Day the hostages more or less become supportive, but at least in that fine film we see why and it is well done.Now, let's talk for a second about the car crash scene at the film's beginning. Was it me or did that give away the whole plot? Why the director put that scene at the beginning is beyond me. It's as if we are manipulated in such a way as to proclaim his cleverness when the implication of the crash victim's death (a heart for John Q.'s son) is confirmed at the end.Okay, and I thought the film really painted a picture of a very cruel and heartless society. Yes, injustice is a part of life and lots of people are left to suffer and even die without help from others, but the film made no effort to show the goodness in "society." Rather, it constructed a bureaucracy that doesn't care whatsoever about anyone (Brazil is a great anti-bureaucrazy film). It was done in a less-than-believable way.I won't even comment on the end, as John Q. is being driven to jail. Please! This movie's ending is as cheesy as that of, say, A League of Their Own or The Postman.People say this all the time about a number of films, but I really believe John Q. had tons of potential. Had they removed the bang-over-your-head political message and stopped short of ripping off Dog Day, and also developed some of the characters, it could've been a great film. But in the end, there are lots of movies that could've been great that never were because of piss-poor directing.2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nationalized health care is not a bad thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My desire to view this movie was not driven by the high-caliber acting or the director or the score, but rather because of the health care problems that it addresses, even if, as some protest, it is a superficial examination. Considering that, as far as I know, health care access has not been the central focus of any major motion picture put out by Hollywood thus far, I figure that we have to start somewhere in order to get people seriously thinking about this issue and its effect on human lives. And, despite obvious screenplay flaws, Denzel Washington did a really good job of bringing it to people's attention!Some reviewers/critics and people on this comment board seem to feel that the film promotes nationalized health care, as if that were some sort of great evil. Yes, countries such as England and Australia and countless other developed nations do have higher tax rates than those found in the US, but at least they get something in return for their tax dollars: access to health care, higher education, adequate unemployment benefits, less politicized/corporatized representation by the government, etc. Perhaps those naysayers feel that the quality of medical care in those countries is not the same as that offered in the US, but, to those without health insurance, ANY health care, of perhaps not-as-high quality, may be seen as better than none.Nationalized health care would be able to provide at least a basic level of care to EVERYONE. The Clinton health plan proposed, in part, that some funding for such an arrangement could come from employers. However, I presume that those who were so vehemently opposed to the Clinton plan would rather that US taxpayers give their hard-earned money to support corporate tax breaks, pork barrel projects, expensive political campaigns, and corporate welfare (which far exceeds the social services benefits paid out to needy individuals) rather than giving every US resident access to adequate health care. I guess those same people probably feel that the Enron execs DESERVED the multi-million dollar bonus packages that they gave themselves before the company went belly-up, leaving all of the other employees with relatively worthless retirement accounts and severely limited unemployment compensation. Yes, I suppose those people think that, on the back of US taxpayers, those execs were ENTITLED to fat checks and political favors while everyone else can just sing for proper health care if they can't afford it. Employers DO have certain moral obligations to their workers and the provision of health care should be one of them---employees' continued good health is what keeps companies going!Wake up, people! Big Government is already part of your life and in your pocket, but it's currently giving the bank away to the fat business cats rather than the people who really need it! Go see this movie and think about it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare breed: a thriller that actually thrills!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised at all the negative reviews I've been hearing and reading about this movie. I think it's a class-A piece of work! This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole two hours and fifteen minutes. Thinking back, there are a few scenes that are quite far-fetched--and made strictly to intensify the drama--but movies are not reality! They are depictions of reality! And if you have to push the limits of logic to keep the audience's hearts pumping with anticipation--then so be it! Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, and he is great as always. As he said, this role is sort of like an apology for his character in "Training Day"--the meanest motherf**ker on the face of this earth. In this case, he plays one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. Of course, he ends up waving a gun around halfway through the film, but when people are pushed to the limits, you'd be surprised what that person can do--whether it's a priest, a Buddhist Monk or a strict pacifist. The supporting cast is also topnotch. James Woods and Ray Liotta are also high up on my Top 20 list of favorite actors. Robert Duvall doesn't quite make the list, but I deeply admire him as well. All of them deliver riveting performances. About the only thing I have to criticize is the score. I felt some of the music added unnecessary melodrama. As I tell people, filmmakers tend to depend too much on music, and less on the power of the performances. And of course, the film sends out a good message. These HMOs can be cold-hearted. And let's face it, there are many spoiled doctors out there who just care about the money. I know, because my Dad has been in and out of the hospital recently. John Q. did everything he could to raise the money for his child's heart transplant, but those damn doctors still didn't agree to perform the operation. It's easy to watch this movie on a superficial level and say, "That still wasn't right...taking people hostage and threatening lives of innocent people." But what would you do if you were in his shoes? What would you do if you found out your son was hours away from dying and this transplant is his only hope? You have to really think these things through before you base negative judgments on his character. "John Q" is a powerful, edge-of-your-seat, riveting piece of cinema and I will even regard it as a MUST SEE! This is one of the most exciting thrillers I've seen in a long time! My score: 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"John Q" hits the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington follows his powerful and gripping role in "Training Day" with a strong, powerful and intense performance in "John Q." Immense star power, outstanding performances, a powerful message and a poignant story; these are the qualities, which make "John Q" one of the most powerful movies of the year.With raw intensity, extreme authenticity and powerful intrigue Washington leads an all-star cast that includes Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, James Woods and Anne Heche. With tremendous support from Kimberly Elise, Daniel E. Smith and Eddie Griffin, "John Q." is a solid film that delivers on the promise to satisfy.The best thing about watching "John Q." is the conviction, integrity, brutal honesty and intense emotion each actor ought to their character. Furthermore, the cast is not afraid to tackle the truth surrounding the health care system and the way the system treats society. Washington, Heche, Duvall and Liotta create electricity with each scene they are in."John Q." surrounds a father who has been pushed over the edge as he attempts to save the life of his son, Mike, after it is found that his heart has a defect. Though he has insurance that covers the surgery to give his son a new heart, John Q. takes the hospital hostage until the hospital administrator puts Mike's name on the list for a heart transplant.The writers deserve most of the credit for bringing to light one of the most important issues facing America; the health care system. Through creating intense moments and powerful scenes, the writers were able to successfully capture my attention and make me feel as if I were in the movie.There is not much one can say about Duvall other than he is a phenomenal talent who along with Washington brings credibility. Each film Duvall takes part in seems to turn into magic because he brings so much to each role. He may not have been the best actor in "John Q." but he was certainly the best suited for the role he had as the hostage negotiator.Heche is an added bonus to "John Q." as her role as the hospital administrator is performed with integrity, brutal honesty and fire that makes her role incredibly satisfying. Another actor who made a tremendous impact in "John Q." is James Woods Woods whose best quality is his ability to play villainous role so well it makes everyone forget that he is only playing a part. I relish the opportunity to watch his next film. Ray Liotta's role as the police chief is far and away his best performance. It's fun to watch everyone come together to turn in a great ensemble performance."The Hurricane," "Courage Under Fire," and "Philadelphia" are only three films, which has cemented Washington as one of the top notch actors in Hollywood. With his role in "John Q.," Washington brings authenticity, screen presence and ability to draw the viewers in with his unique charm.With the integrity of his performance and intensity of his presence, Washington was able to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. A smile comes to my face with every Denzel Washington film because I know I will get a quality performance from him."John Q." is a blockbuster with intense dialogue, powerful scenes and a poignant story that will satisfy everyone from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring: Denzel Washington and Robert DuvallGenre: Drama/CrimeRated PG-13 for Violence, Language and Intense Thematic ElementsStar Rating: ****1/2 out of 5This was one of my favorite Denzel Washington movies ever! This movie is about a man named John.Q who had a great life until his son's heart stopped working and they had to rush him down to the Chicago Hospital. The insurance didn't cover his son's transplant, so in order for his son's recovery John (Denzel Washington) holds the Emergency Room hostage until the doctors agree to get the transplant successful! I thought Denzel Washington made another good performance in this movie even though it was nominated for any Academy Awards like the movie he did before this one, Training Day with him and Ethan Hawke. I thought that kid was cute especially when he was doing impressions of wrestlers.BOTTOM LINE: GOOD MOVIE AND VERY POWERFUL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it was almost laughable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to a film full of quality actors dealing intelligently with some serious social issues. What I saw was exaggerated portrayals of almost all characters and the issues dealt with in a completely one sided-manner. If one has an axe to grind with hospitals, health insurance providers or the police, I imagine the story would be enjoyable. Otherwise, it was almost laughable to see how cold and heartless doctors and hospital administrators were portrayed. Poor John Q. couldn't get even get a break from the average Joe as they cruelly bought his goods at dirt cheap prices as he desparately tried to raise money. How could anyone take seriously a film featuring the unbelievable antics of the TV reporter? And hostage negotiations? What a laugh they were! Ray Liotta, as the police chief, was a joke. Health insurance issues and organ donations and waiting lists are far more complex issues than portrayed here. I certainly will shed a tear during touching movies, but this one just had me shaking my head in disgust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperation makes you do crazy things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A father who has been paying his life insurance for years discovers that this company won't pay for the medical assistance of his dying son who needs an urgent heart transplant. Seeing that the hospital is making millions every years and that one operation would mean nothing to them, he tries to persuade them to make a benevolent act and help his son. When they refuse, he decides to lock himself inside the hospital armed with a gun and starts negotiating with the police to get what he won't get otherwise. While all this occurs, a TV channel is able to wire the cameras inside the hospital and the whole world is watching both sides of the story: a gunman who desperately wants to save his son, and the police department who wants to make sure that everyone gets out of there in one piece. I found the movie quite entertaining and again a great act by Denzel Washington who is beyond a doubt one of the best actors of his generation. You should enjoy especially knowing that such an act of craziness or faith is actually based on a true story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ethics and John Q</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burg and Cassavetes' (John, Q, 2002) melodrama about a family whose structure, health and happiness is being torn apart by monetary, political and unethical medical practices, has created an interesting discussion of ethics, more so than cinematographic criticism, on its behalf. Interestingly enough fourteen years later, we are put to task to examine bioethical issues outlined in this film. John Q is a film about a man who takes the healthcare system in his own hands in a violent manner after he finds his son needs a new heart whilst his insurance coverage has been changed and does not cover the transplant. He holds a room full of (ED), Emergency Room patients hostage with an empty gun in an attempt to get his son's name on the transplant list declaring "this hospital is under new management, Free Health Care for everyone" (John Q. 2002).(Q) and his family had their self-respect and respect for persons violated. Self-respect entails consideration of the decisions of autonomous persons and the protection of persons who lack decision making capacity as does Q and his family (Phillips, 2000). Lack of health literacy and the inability of the hospital system to engage with the patient are primary problems. Self-respect obligations necessitate treating persons with respect and keeping promises (Phillips, 2000). Promises were violated by Q's employer when they did not inform Q of the insurance change. Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, lied when in collusion, in an attempt to ambush Q in the ED. Therefore, Q's initial and continued action may be the result of indignation and ignorance, and rightly so. Says Q to his son before he is about to euthanize himself "Always keep your promises" (John Q, 2002).Q technically was acting unethically for he inhibited the autonomy of the other patients in the ED, even though the end justified the means by getting his son on the transplant list and a new heart. Additionally, Q was put to task by his wife's words to do something. I am not really sure why the onus was only on him do that something, though.The guiding, bioethical principle of beneficence was broken by Q when he put other persons in harm's way and instilled fear of death by gunshot, though he had an unloaded gun. The gun could, and did, force hostages to act in a manner that was harmful to one another to trump evil. Actually, the alternate evil character was a physical abuser to his girlfriend and a sociopath who received penance though he seemed to change his ways at the end, trumping evil. Though Q was acting in an evil manner by restricting person's liberty, he succeeded in catching and removing the sniper to remove evil and harm. Furthermore, Q promoted good by offering his own heart for transplant in the end. Informed consent for Q's own surgery is in question. It is not in intact for his son's surgery. He did not consult his wife. Though she would agree to a transplant for her son, she likely would not agree to the transfer of Q's heart to her son. She was not autonomous in decision making for her son. For Q, informed consent was true in disclosure, comprehension, consent and voluntariness, but not in competence. A person needs should not be under duress so they can be competent (Faden &amp; Beauchamp, 1986). Additionally, Q tried to force the cardiologist to do Q's surgery and bear witness to suicide, a form of negligence, disallowing James Woods to do what he thought was necessary in his medical opinion (Faden &amp; Beauchamp, 1986). Q's act of hostage taking was evil but the motive and objective was good in action, saving his son from death (JBC, 2008).The decision of the hospital administration to discharge Q's son due to financial constraint, reeks of injustice and to Michael's parents it is an act of hospice without saying so. The hospital is not doing due diligence through education and discharge planning. So the answer is Q acted morally, but unethically and in the manner of a caring and vigilante father. Q had options which he did not understand due to lack of health literacy. As stated earlier due to the pre-emptive discharge of Q's son in such an irresponsible manner, leaves an opening for Q to argue for a longer stay. Other options one could have taken would be to contact civil liberty organizations, advocate lawyers, the American Heart Association, the ethics committee of the hospital, the State Board of Medicine in Illinois, the AMA, the state insurance board, pediatric medical associations, Shriners, and any relevant benevolent society. I did not see a social worker involved either or a case manager.If Q was in California and on the Kaiser Permanente plan, his family would be in serious trouble. This health care systems are run by the insurance companies with doctors working for the insurance companies. My sister-in law, Mary Lombard died of late untreated multiple myeloma because Kaiser Permanente doctors ignored her pain and refused to do x-rays. Instead they sent her to chiropractors (Lombard, 2013). Within 6 months of her diagnosis, Mary at 45 years old was put to rest by her 83-year-old mother. That is hypocrisy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was good, carried for the most part by Denzel Washington who (as always) puts on a great performance. It's one of those movies that will have you cheering for the "bad guy" and also questioning how far you would go for those you love? It also brings into play media exploitation, the American health care system and the lack of rights for the average blue collar worker.I was definitely invested in this story which felt unique and found myself frustrated alongside John and his lack of options. Denzel plays John Q Archibald, a family man whose son needs a lifesaving heart operation. When his health plan doesn't cover the medical procedure and after exhausting all avenues John snaps and takes drastic steps.What I enjoyed most about this movie was probably the interaction between 'John' and the hostages which takes up a considerable amount of the story and are played by some (now) very recognizable faces including Ethan Suplee, Kevin Connolly, Eddie Griffin and Shawn Hatosy.We also have James Woods as a conceited surgeon, Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta in police roles and wow Anne Heche, what a b!tch as the hospital coordinator.The ending was bit too melodramatic but all in a decent movie. 10/11/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A father pushed to the limits...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald, father of Mike (Daniel E. Smith) falls hard all of a sudden at a baseball game, which ultimately set the story in motion. The diagnosis, needing a heart transplant, everything only get harder when John goes to the insurance company and finds that his insurance does not cover this type of procedure.The movie tells about an American society that has been blinded by capitalism. Everything is in the dire hands of 'Money'. The hospital, unwilling to do what they would normally do to save someone's life, turns a head? only to put his son onto the transplant list if they had the money. James Woods who stars as Dr. Raymond Turner, display rigidness of professionalism, while Anne Heche who stars as Rebecca Payne, display utter coldness that nearly got me wanting to pick up a chair and throw it at her.Every day even before what had just happened, John and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) tries their best to make ends meet, and then now trying and doing everything possible to collect money needed just to get his son on the list. A father, loving and caring, must come up with 250,000 dollars to pay for his son's heart transplant. Their friends, and countless others, do their best to help the couple raise money. Soon, almost everything they have is on the market and sold.It was not enough. Out of options, and out of time, a father pushed to the limits to save his son. In all desperation and having hardly enough to get anything accomplished, John holds the entire hospital's emergency room hostage. He sets the one demand for his son to be put on that list so that the doctors can proceed with the transplant. The ending only leaves you chills to the bone as to what a father is left to do in order to be heard.Denzel Washington is one of the greatest actors of our time and he proves it here playing a father in utter distraught. I recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Q really raises a lot of questions. However, it does not do any moral policing. All it does is portray the love of a father for his ailing son and shows the extent to which he is willing to go to get his son back to normal health. There are many loopholes in the story but the portrayal of Denzel Washington as the cornered father whose son needs a heart transplant immediately, but is not able to financially support the huge costs, covers up all those gaps! One of the best performances of Denzel Washington. The song during the final credits, 'The voice inside my heart' is superb and truly makes so much sense after the movie.To provide for his ailing son he takes the emergency room of the same hospital hostage. Only later to made a tough decision to give up his life so that his son can have his heart. The presence of Robert Duvall too is very electrifying. Indeed great actors! Here's the part where the father makes the decision to die so that his son can have his heart.This sort of courage and determination to go to any length does not come easy. At times it sounds insane and beyond logic or reason. Yet that's the love of a parent. A father and mother know no bounds when it comes to their child.http://www.vcastilino.blogspot.in/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 stars for the actors Denzel and Kimberly Elise.First of all, this is a movie with a real cause. (i.e. reminding us of the harsh truth of the American Health Care system). I'm not sure if it did/could have effect on actual policy, but I'm sure it touched many hearts everywhere.This movie could have been 10/10 but for poor script-writing at very crucial points. The level of drama was simply fantastic when Denzel/his wife were on camera, but otherwise suffered (most of the time), especially with the police scenes.In addition, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending was too 'hollywoody'. This movie could have really stood out with an ending that made the movie unforgettable. But it was too passive compared to strength of the rest of the drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The healthcare debate is one that has waged on for too long. It has waged in our homes, our schools, and now in our movies. John Q is about a man who's constant screwing by the healthcare system has caused him to take drastic action to get his dying son the heart transplant he desperately needs. He takes the emergency room of a hospital hostage, demanding that his son be put on the donor list, something that costs $30,000, a budget the John does not have. The whole situation becomes a massive media frenzy with crowds of supporters standing outside of the hospital cheering for John and booing the police, an event that very much resembles the film Dog Day Afternoon. The film is partly an intense crime thriller and partly a touching story about how far a man will go for his family.Upon its release, John Q was not well received by critics. They said it was too preachy and too silly and over-the-top to buy into. I'll admit that the film does have a very in your face message about healthcare and the actions taken to display this message are slightly overblown, but they make for a fun movie. I think a lot of this negative reception comes from the timing of the film. It is blatantly liberal film released very soon after George W. Bush took office. This probably makes it even more in your face. But for me, watching the film in 2011, I very much enjoyed the message as healthcare is still a relevant debate nine years later. I think I enjoyed the suspenseful action more, but the message here doesn't bother me at all, and in fact I can take it to heart.The health care message makes the film important, but what makes it fun is the suspense and the great cast of characters. When John takes the hospital hostage he claims a wide array of hostages inside the building, each with a different backstory and personality. The dynamics between these characters are all very interesting, and the relationship they all build with John is an intriguing social experiment. And then of course there are the relationships John has with people outside. His wife's undying support for him creates an interesting character development, but more importantly is the Officer Frank Grimes(Robert Duvall), the police officer in charge of dealing with this situation. John has a number of conversation with Frank via walkie-talkie as Frank tries so desperately to keep the situation under control. Then of course things are complicated when the police chief Gus Monroe (Ray Liotta) shows up and is more concerned with his image than the actual situation at hands, creating another conflict between him and Frank. This melting pot of different characters creates an overall dynamic that is very interesting and great fun to watch unfold.John Q is a film that I very much enjoyed overall. It has its moments where logic seems to fall by the wayside, and there are times where things aren't executed as well as they should have been. I can't deny that the film is a tad preachy and it does wave a very obvious message in our faces. But overall this film is truly exciting, thrilling, and compelling. It is a lot of fun and my keen interest in hostage films makes me enjoy it even more. There is raw intensity and riveting suspense which makes this a very worthwhile film that shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good As A Drama, But The Thriller Is Forced And Clichéd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure the epic battle between good and evil has been done a million times, but you ask yourself, what happens when the good takes on a another rivalry that's also good. this is the case in the 2002 Denzel Washington vehicle "John Q.". This movie focuses on the confrontation against the health care system, but at times the film tends to drift away from the exciting main plot and quickly drifts away into something more surreal and implausible. In this movie, Washington takes on the role of John Quincy Archibald, a financially inept factory worker who gets bad news upon hearing that his son Mike collapses during a baseball game. John and his wife rush the boy to the emergency room where the doctor reports to them that their son's heart is very large and a heart replacement is greatly needed. the situation takes a turn for the worse when the cardiologist and administrator (James Woods and Anne Heche who look cold and calculated) hands a $75,000 down payment in order for the procedure to commence. John doesn't have a lot of money, as he tries to squeeze out of his workman's insurance as much as he could get out of it, but word comes out that the company switched carriers and the most they have to offer him was $20,000. John goes as far as sell off all of his prized possessions, however that does him justice because he's still short of cash. This leaves John with no other choice to take matters into his own hands. He goes so far as to take the hospital hostage unless his son is placed on the donor's list. John's demands are taken into consideration by the police lead by hostage negotiator, Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Police Chief Monroe (Ray Liotta), who's in the wings for reelection and asks to have John removed from the building in an efficient way. The hostages consist of a diverse group of unfortunate victims such as street thugs, a pregnant lady, another lady who might be or pretending to be a dingy broad, and a foreign woman who can't speak a word of English. Sure the victims are recycled clichés from other films from the past, but when it symbolizes the how health care functions in the United States, it transpires into the most implausible and reprehensible outlooks one could ever encounter. It's even more appalling when they're speaking with a gun near their heads. It takes a turn for the bad as it goes from a tearful drama to a severely cringing thriller with badly caricatured hostages. I'm sure this angle could've had a two-sided perspective to it, but its concentration sticks to this one-sided agenda. It might be due to the limitations of filming or to avoid any further complications so that the audience won't scratch their heads in confusion, or to avoid this movie from looking like a made for TV drama. But this painful ordeal to watch which makes you groan in disbelief.Washington has made some remarkable films over the years, but in "John Q", his credibility goes down a notch, being that he's been in much better roles than this one. Nonetheless, he still manages successfully to provide one of the most selfless characters on celluloid. Here's a poor working class man going out of way to find the money to pay for his son's surgery and the drama that he possesses is carried out to near perfection. The other standouts come from strong support from Kimberly Elise and Robert Duvall. As for the rest of the ensemble, they're reduced to just nothing more than badly drawn, one-dimensional caricatures. "John Q." overall was a well executed film and would have been better if it stuck to being a medical drama centering on a man going out of his way to save his son's life. It sadly falters due to the forceful suspense with cardboard characters, a lopsided script and a manipulative and predictable nature to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "John Q" theme is about one man fight against the heath care system in our country. Danzel Washington played John Q Archibald where he is a factory worker. John Q is trying to support his family after his hours has been cut. Trying to keep food on the table and a roof over their head is hard enough. John Q and wife Denise played by Kimberly Elise were at a baseball game watching his son Michael played by Daniel E Smith and all of sudden their son collapse on the baseball field. They takes their son to the hospital to find out that their son has a heart condition and needs a heart transplant. At that same time John Q finds out that his health insurance policy won't cover the transplant. So John Q goes to his place of employment to talk to them about his health care insurance policy. He finds out that they have changed their health insurance carriers and went from a PPO to a HMO health insurance. Since they have cut his hours, his insurance that they are on will only cover $20,000.00 and he need $250,000.00 for the transplant. In this scene the angles are over the shoulder shoots. He tries to find away to pay for his son's heart transplant with no luck. He made several calls and talked to several services but he couldn't get any help. His family and friends try to raise the money to cover the transplant, but it wasn't enough. After giving the hospital all the money that he has raised he gets a phone call from his wife Denise that they are going to release their son from the hospital. Then it shows the extremes that John Q will go through to save his son's life, starting off with kidnapping Dr. Raymond Turner played by James Wood. The music that is played during this scene is very intense and the shot that are used are close ups. John Q takes the Doctor into emergency room where he ends up keeping several people in there against their will. After John Q takes over the emergency room he comes in contact with Lt. Frank Grimes played by Robert Duvall. Lt. Frank Grimes tries to talk John Q into releasing the hostages and turning himself in. He even tries to talk John Q's wife Denise into talking him into releasing hostages. In the end he was ready to kill himself so the Doctor could transplant his heart into his son. Right before he could shoot himself he found out that there was a heart for his son. The transplant worked and the hospital ended up paying for everything. John Q had to go to prison for kidnapping but his son received a new heart and to him that was worth it. The movie shows that there needs to be changes made to the current health care system in our country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a true example of death panels that have been and are already in place determining who gets health care and who doesn't. Other than that you can relate and feel the pain of the father all to well. From the first of the movie it flows nicely and you can attribute that to the great directing. and the skill of Denzel. The moment that captured me was the score during the period of him trying to gather money which I think is Stevie Wonder. Another part would be the when he first takes the hostage, fumbling with the gun, showing genuine "fight or flight" responses and acting just how I would react to that high stress situation. This movie takes you some where most fathers would not hesitate to go. Considering that we have had recent debates on "death panels" helps the mood even more. This should be viewed by most who oppose health care. The movie is very convincing and relate able.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A downer from son of John (I mean the director)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised at Nick Cassavettes, son of John ("Shadows" comes to mind), who has made a film here that contains some note-worthy elements including fine acting from some of the cast, a great scene during the opening credits, and a good premise. But the execution is something that started to really grate at me by the time the movie ended. Washington is believable as a John Q. who's son's heart needs to be transplanted, and doesn't have the insurance to cover it. Up until the main chunk of the film started to roll with John taking an emergency room full of conventional characters hostage with the also conventional cop characters on the outset, it seemed like a good idea for a movie by examining how insurance companies (as well as doctors and hospitals) screw over people in need. But no, the film plunges instead into scenes that tried way too hard to try and pull at the heart strings of the audience and I'm sure I wasn't the only one not so moved by the decisions and moves by the central characters.In other words, there are a few tolerable moments of cinema squared into John Q., but it isn't worth sitting through all the drek that goes with it (maybe switch on and off from it when it comes on cable).

		<fullReview>If you want to know how to make a film which tells a story, makes several potent points, exposes how shabby life is, and sticks one in the eye of the establishment, then this does it, and has it, all. Super script, super storyline, super acting (across the board), goodies, baddies, and those who change their spots for us, and all packaged in a quite breathtaking order. It has suspense in oodles. It is superbly shot, superbly soundtracked, and cleverly stays completely focused on how morality is a political tool used against ordinary people.And this film hasn't aged a bit. It is as sharp and relevant now as it was when first released. It is worth any money to see simply because it is a lesson in the art of constructing a masterpiece that'll have us talking days after we have seen it.(Still) An excellent film.</fullReview>

It's really difficult to suspend disbelief; logistically the hostage situation is laughably unrealistic. The subplots are out of place and the attempts at comedy are weak. Nothing really gels, and towards the end I got this sinking feeling that I just wasted some time on a boring and insubstantial movie. The whole story should have been shrunk down to a prime time drama at best. Sorry, but the 6.7 IMDb rating at the time I wrote this was outright misleading. This movie basically sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Q. Archibald: Illinois auto worker, husband and father. Down on his luck; the plant is cutting the shifts, so he is on a 20 hour week, and with the wife working in a cafeteria, making ends meet is tough; John's car is reposessed by the bank because he is behind on the payments. (not enough for both rent and car)From bad to worse as his son, during a junior league baseball game gets a heart attack, and is rushed off to the emergency room.Fast forward: The kid is admitted, and diagnosed with an enlarged heart, and a terminally dropping blood pressure; to survive, he needs a heart transplant. An this is what the movie is about: It's gotta be paid.This is also where the downturn of the movie starts because the plot and characters abruptly turn cardboard at this spot. The hospital cardiac surgeon (using overly complex medical terms that make no sense whatsoever to a layman, in a way i strongly doubt no medical doctor would do) and the hospital director who does a good job of acting like a complete bitch with only her sights on the money in face of a pair of parents that have just had a death sentence on their only child, all while sitting in a fabulous and exquisitely designed and decorated hospital board room.Denzel Washignton is a great actor, have no doubts about that, but if you've seen his other performances (fx. Manchurian Candidate, Pelican Brief, Crimson Tide etc.) you know his mannerisms and style of acting, and while he does a very good attempt at being the desperate father here, he overplays his role in a way that spoils it and adds unreality to the impression.The predicament in short: JQ thinks he has "Major Medical" aka PPO, but he doesn't, because his employment is part-time. He ends up counting dollars, from where he can get it; church collection, garage sale of anything worth anything in the house (fridge, colour TV...). And there it goes - the obvious fact is that they just can't make it happen.Cardboard character time: JQ's wife goes hysterical and tells him to DO SOMETHING to save the son. So he does it, and takes a pistol to the emergency room of the Hope Memorial Hospital (which could be any of the 7 in central Chicago, anyway.).The latter half of the movie is not much worth going into detail, because it is boilerplate hostage situation in the context of the movie; a bit of chitchat about the nasty HMO's paying doctors not to check for illness, drama between the hostages, and once in a while the continually death clock of the dying son's lowered blood pressure.Hostage negotiator comes in, starts taking, police chief comes in, makes it abundantly clear that he is only there for show and because it's election year, and, you can guess the rest.It's stuff you've seen before, done better, all of it. A particularly bothersome foolishness of the movie is that the kid, with terminally low blood pressure and barely hanging on to consciousness (if at all), has no trouble talking to his father (though in a whisper voice) in fully formed sentences that you expect from an adult, not from an intubated kid on the verge of death! This is emotional pornography of a particularly poor sort.Long story short, it ends good, yada yada yada. Absolute run of the mill drama with nothing worthy of note apart from the political message, which comes here: YOU NEED UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE It's not me telling you this, it's the movie telling it to you.. no, it's screaming it at you; it's like having a billboard with HUGE LETTER SHOVED IN YOUR FACE telling you.What spoils this motion picture isn't as much the standardized plot and dialogue, or the overly melodramatical acting, no, it is the almost constant overtones of a political piece.I won't go into the political jabbering here, but I will throw a brief comment on the subject; the US medical system certainly has its flaws, but making a otherwise tear-laden family drama into a political propaganda delivery system is unbelievably cheap, and not helped by actual political figures being included (probably why most good movies use generic political figures, such as US Presidents not being named, but just being 'Mr. President' etc.); as mentioned above, just before JQ gets his car reposessed, George Bush is on the tube (looking somewhat indifferent to the plight of working poor Americans), and after the movie ends, lots of footage of protesters carrying "free healthcare" etc etc. slogan signs are shown, and none other than Hillary Clinton is displayed prominently as the Universal Healthcare savior of sorts. (If you *must* ask , I care not for either of mentioned politicians or their parties. There, i said it.).Another reviewer said that this is the writer's "letter to the editor" on his disagreements with US healthcare. On consideration, he is absolutely right; this isn't drama as much as it is a political propaganda piece that uses a deep and true contemporary problem in US society as a launchpad, and on considering that, I feel nauseous I've spent my time watching this garbage, so blatantly exploiting the human misery of an actual, real problem for some with such an obvious goal.Summarizing: Polished and great cast, but bland from the standard plot, acting and dialogue, and destroyed by the political payload it carries.Additionally, I noticed that most of the negative comments on this movie has been rated down a lot, while positive commentary is almost uniformly rated up. Why is that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>underrated phenomenon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highly under-rated and ignored by most in 2002, "John Q" is one of those movies that is sometimes too intelligent for a viewing public unfamiliar with topics never really thought about in common societal circles (health care and insurance policies, rights of blue-collar citizens, media exploitation, law enforcement practices and over-paid medical specialists). Denzel Washington's young son falls out one day at a little league baseball game. The diagnosis is frightening. Without a new heart, the boy will most definitely die. Washington, a normal everyday citizen, lacks substantial resources and benefits from his insurance to even get his son on a donor's list. It is blatantly obvious that Washington and wife Kimberly Elise are being strangled by red tape in a mercilessly heartless (no pun intended) system. Friends Laura Herring and David Thornton (and seemingly countless other ordinary people) do their best to help the couple raise money and soon it seems that most everything they have is on the market to be sold. Work and more hard work does not get the couple much closer to having the money they desperately need. Washington realizes that time is now of the essence. He has been pushed and pushed again and now he takes it upon himself to push back. As a last resort he literally takes the doctor (James Woods) hostage, along with other bystanders who have nothing to do with Washington's war with the hospitals and insurance organizations. Immediately cops led by Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta surround the hospital and the tenseness builds. Hungry media cronies (who would not help Washington when he had asked earlier) also try to benefit from the misery of all those that are involved with their typical exploitation tactics (one thing Jerry Springer got right). Will Washington's son be saved and is Washington actually willing to take his own life in the venture so his boy can live? "John Q" is a very impressive production from director Nick Cassavetes (showing much of the same ability his late father John showed throughout his career). Screenwriter James Kearns gets to the soul of an American society that has been blinded by economics and inefficient big-wigs who have no business possessing the careers they have. Morality has gone out the window and that "hypocritical oath" that is so prevalent in the medical field seems to be little more than a silly afterthought. "John Q" succeeds everywhere just about except in its ending. The ending is a major mistake that took away from some of the good things accomplished before the final ten minutes. Washington, arguably better here than in recent triumphs like "Training Day" (an Oscar-winning role) and "Antwone Fisher", goes to an even higher plateau here. Much like Al Pacino in the equally under-rated "Dog Day Afternoon" (an admittedly better picture), Washington dominates in a role that thrives on a claustrophobic aspect that cannot be escaped or denied within the film's running time. Duvall and Woods are also solid, as always, but Washington is the man here. Strikingly accurate when pointing the finger at things wrong with America these days, "John Q" is a thought-provoking production that will cause its audience to think and learn about sometimes forgotten aspects of human life. 4 stars out of 5.

		<shortDescription>John Q</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook), I think the lead actor was the most appealing and obvious reason to see the film, with some other good people too. Basically Michael 'Mike' Archibald (Daniel E. Smith), son of John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington), collapses during a baseball game as a result of heart failure. Then John and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) find out that Mike needs a heart transplant or he will die, but unfortunately, they don't have the $250,000 for the operation, and their insurance won't cover it. Out of options to raise cash quickly, John "Q" takes a gun into the hospital and holds everyone, staff and patients, hostage until the doctors agree to put Mike on the transplant list. Soon the police show up outside, led by Lt. Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Chief Gus Monroe (Ray Liotta), and their only communication with John is through the phone, negotiating for hostages to be released, but John is not leaving until they have found a heart for his son. There is a point where John is desperate for his son to live and he is willing to sacrifice himself, but thankfully, a recently dead person with the right blood type and heart size is found just in time. In the end, Mike's life is saved with a new heart, and John is found guilty of only one of three charges. Also starring James Woods as Dr. Raymond Turner, Anne Heche as Rebecca Payne, Eddie Griffin as Lester Matthews, Shawn Hatosy as Mitch Quigley, Laura Elena Harring as Gina Palumbo, Ted Demme as Himself and My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Guard Max Conlin. Washington of course plays a powerful role, the supporting cast all do very well also, it is a very watchable gripping near action drama. Good!</fullReview>

I defer to the other comment and everyone deserves health insurance, but if a group deserves it the most, its the hard working poor class. John Q is not the typical father, but is inside every father. The secondary actors also made good impressions and the way media coverage made it through the scenes also added suspense to the movie. I did not really seem to care about medical bloopers, being in the medical field myself, not for the money, but for the service.

The US media prefers to hide the problem and the Bush administration uses the inadequate health care system for political capital abroad, treating foreigners on the cuff and ignoring the needs of Americans like John Q and his family.I would have rated the movie a 9 or a 10 right up to the ending.On the other hand the feel-good ending muddies the point not only in a touch of unrealism that an untrained person could hold off a swat team but also that the police negotiators might ferret him out with lies and deceit.Thus I came to an over-all rating of 2 despite good performances from the cast.</fullReview>

It is a story about the love between a father and a son. Would you give your life for your son? It speaks to the family and the bonds to keep it strong. Bonds like trust, respect and honesty. Recall the scene when John Q's wife recognized the attempt of the Lieutenant to gain information about her husband. The son's willing to give his last 46 dollars. It's about friendship; would your friends support you like John Q's did? If you have a family that you love very much then you can relate to this movie. If you have no children then you can only come close to understanding and may miss the heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Q is your everyday man, the blue collar worker with lots of debts to pay. The kind in which Banks don't hesitate to send the repo man over for a default non payment. The kind whose up late at night trying to work out his sums and play it right. In short, a typical average family person with typical family problems.However, things turn for the worse when his only child Mike requires an urgent heart transplant to save his life. Sure, not that hearts are easy to come by (trust Hollywood to make it within an hour or so), but the bottom line is, John has no money to pay for the whopping 250,000 dollars surgery.Which brings us to something real - medical costs, wherever you are, is always spiralling upwards. While hospitals and their doctors make millions, how many are willing (or able to?) work around the administration to perform a life-saving operation, for free, or a nominal sum. Don't get me wrong, it's difficult to be "free", because everyone will take; it's human tendency. But it does raise some questions as you sit through this movie.Ah, the insurance companies get another stab at being unscrupulous as well. Downgrading and changing John's policy without his knowledge, isn't really ethical. But it's always about business, and with businesses, it's again about the bottom line. John Q tries all avenues to raise funds, and gets caught in red tape aplenty.So when faced with a wall behind his back, John Q finally snaps and decides to take matters into his own hands. By holding a host of characters - the surgeon (James Woods), a security guard, a pregnant woman, a rich yuppie couple, etc, while being made into the local hero by the media, and those who had enough of red tape. It's somewhat satisfying to watch on screen how favors are swung his way, and how incredibly lucky he can get, as John negotiates with Police Negotiator Frank, played by veteran Robert Duvall.It's compelling drama, by Denzel Washington no less. Completing the cast are Ray Liotta as the police chief who screws up a rescue attempt, and Anne Heche as the uncompromising, cold hospital administrator. But towards the end it degenerates into typical Hollywood fare - entertaining, but lacking serious punch to make a statement on topics it highlighted in the first act.Barebones Code 3 DVD with no extras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i my opinion this is one of Denzel Washington's best performances. when his child's develops a fatal heart condition he rushed to hospital only to find that his insurance policy doesn't cover the illness. this is due to the policy being changed by his company. the film is about John q and his wife trying desperately to raise the cash needed to pay for the heart transplant. when John Q finally admits defeat he resorts to taking the hospital staff hostage and forcing them to operate on his son. the film is very moving and will have you thinking about the injustice of the American health system for weeks afterwards. i think that every Washinton fan should see this film as it is the best film i have seen him star in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hostages for Hospital Care ? Not at all like the Food for Oil Programme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Q is one of those kinds of movies that arrives and disappears fairly quietly ? not raising a lot of box office ruckus and media hype. It is however, a powerful story about one man's desire to save his son at all costs.John (Washington) is a character who has little money but a lot of leverage. Mr. Washington plays a fantastic and desperate father who refuses to take no for an answer. Grimes (Duvall) is also well played, albeit filling a clichéd role of a cop.You will find that there are some touching moments and some where you wonder about who Mr. Q really is, and what his motives are. This is largely because Mr. Washington does such a good job of creating his diverse character that is caring yet brutal at times. One almost sees the intensity of his brutality from his role in Training Day. So in essence, Mr. Washington's role as John Q should have warranted at least an Oscar nomination.The strong part of John Q is that the supporting characters that surround him are more useful in building and sustaining his character than in most other movies. In any case, don't want to give away too much for those who haven't yet seen this film. This movie is a character movie - the plot is fairly slow and predictable at least by one moment, and then the story must unfold of how things happen.I mean, at least it was ethical. Right? "I am not going to bury my son. My son is going to bury me." REVIEW: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a short comment: watching the DVD, make sure to watch the deleted scenes. Some of them would be among the strongest scenes in the film, hadn't they been cut - especially the prayer scene.To the doubters if the story is truthful: watch the documentary in the DVD extras where healthcare administrators confirm everything is 100% accurate. It's a true shame that the richest country in the world leaves its citizens without healthcare, at the same time providing full care for illegal immigrants and spending billions monthly on illegal wars. We certainly need more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well done!, all content of this great movie is TRUE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The content of this movie is real, once again I do congratulate to those producing of Hollywood to make so good movies and to show the reality, now I do ask, what in the fu**ing hell in the U.S., people with a poor insurance or without the same one they do leave losing and can they die? Is it they haven't money, the part when John Q., says "if you won $75 million in surgeries, why you don't make one of good will?" The Money, the money is the answer, but don't the doctors maybe have remorses of conscience?, will they be as miserable as to allow to die to somebody that only needs of their help to stop to charge their pay? why they not only make the operation and later do see as the patient or the relatives he/she pays them? I understand that to make that is not always profitable for the hospital or clinic, but they should have political in this respect, that passes here in Venezuela, but nothing else in Clinical, because the hospitals, although the resources are scarce and they are very not well organized and all that there is, poor people are made their operations, although the medical care here is quite inefficient, and many people in a room of emergencies they stay almost expecting an eternity so that they assist them.* * Denzel Washington continues being excellent actor and the movie is excellent, my vote is 9/10 * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Q., starring Denzel Washington, who is one of the finest actors around.I really liked this movie. I thought it especially interesting that John Q. (as in John Q. Public) and his family are African-Americans. I think that the director wanted to challenge the audience's perception of the average American family. Admit it, unless you are a member of a minority group, when someone says "American family", you probably think of a white family with 2.5 kids, a picket fence, and maybe a dog. I know I do. But I enjoy having my perceptions turned on end. The only potential problem I have with this movie is that I don't know if all the circumstances of the movie are based in reality or not. For example, in the movie, the hospital informs John Q. that his son needs a heart transplant to save his life, but that heart transplant surgery is "elective" and so they can't proceed or even put him on the organ donor's list until they receive $75,000 as a down payment. Now I said this was a potential problem because I don't know if this is true or not. If it is, than I have no problem, (other than the fact that I am appalled at our health care system), but if it isn't true, than the movie may be guilty of a little bit of emotional manipulation. But even if that's the case, it's still a great movie that has a lot to say about the health care system in this country. It takes a look at the issue from many aspects, including the effects of HMO's and so-called "managed care" health plans to the fact that hospitals are now in the business of making money instead of curing patients. The end of the movie crosses dangerously into sentimentality, but there's enough substance here to keep us from rolling our eyes. All in all a worthy effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly powerful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a spectacular thriller about the problems with the US health care system, a father's extreme measures to protect his son, the troubles and strains of a blue-collar worker, and the manipulation by the police and the press of a high pressure situation. The title, "John Q", refers both to Denzel Washington's character John Quincy Archibald and to the typical reference to the everyman, John Q. Public.Denzel Washington gives a truly edge-of-your-seat performance as the father out of options, and the rest of the cast -- while sometimes given less realistic characters to play -- still play their parts very well. As usual, though, Denzel overshadows them all.While I don't agree with the nationalized health care system this movie promotes (dollar for dollar, private charities can accomplish the same thing more efficiently than the bureaucratic government), this move is a spectacular thrill-ride and worth any price of admission or purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a viewing or two...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched 'John Q.' again, for the second time, and although I was thoroughly pleased with the film the first time that I saw it, I have to say that I was not too impressed with it this time. The movie stars Denzel Washington in the title role, whose son collapses at a local little league baseball game due to heart failure. Well, it turns out that the son needs a heart transplant, and since John Q. has some shady health care, they will have to put the son on 'the list'. Anne Heche is the bad guy in the film, playing the Hospital Director, and I have to say that I thought that her acting was horrible in this one. Albeit Heche is NEVER that great, I still found this to be her most awful performance. She was stiff with the material. There was almost no emotion in any of her dialog. Still, film faves are abound in this in Ray Liotta, Robert Duvall, and James Woods, but Denzel steals the show with another stellar performance, working his best amidst all of the clichés.Nevertheless, I still believe that 'John Q.' is worth a viewing or two, thanks to its ability to keep the audience entertained for a couple of hours. Like I said before, I really enjoyed this film the first time I watched it. It entertained me, just like any good movie is supposed to. However, I still have two major problems with this title. One is personal, and one is technical. Personally, I didn't like John Q.'s wife, played by Kimberly Elise. She's responsible for pushing her husband to "do something!!". And, of course, he results to desperate measures. Washington portrays a very noble, very brave father, and the wife just came off, in my opinion, as super-stressed and really pushy...and bitchy. She could have been a little more sensitive to her husband's situation. He was doing his best. And, technically, I do not believe that after John Q. takes a handful of patients hostage at gunpoint that the police would just casually hand over the hand-cuffs and tell him to put them on. Don't think so. I'm sure that situations of such threatening magnitude would not be treated so nonchalantly.In summary, if you like Denzel movies, or you like fast-paced suspense or action movies, then 'John Q.' is for you. But if you're sometimes overcritical or you're a logic buff, then you will probably have a problem with this one. 7/10 is my vote.</fullReview>

"Give a father no options and you leave him no choice", present him a bunch of burocracies just to save the life of his only son, and you get a hell of a mess.John Q is a great drama, conducted by Denzel Washington and supported by actors such as Eddie Griffin, it shows us what a desperate father is capable of to save is son's life.During a baseball game, Mike Archibald, suddenly collapses and an heart failure is the diagnosis. Unfortunately, the insurance won't cover his son's transplant and a radical mesure is taken by John Quincy, taking the urgency room under hostage until the name of his son is in the transplant list.Tension and sadness are the words that best express the emotions of this motion picture, where you get some funny moments and tear breaking scenes. In a simple way this movie portraits a strangely familiar reality of our society, and basically it should be interpreted as a LESSON to be taken seriously be each and every one of us.</fullReview>

But the holes in the film aside this movie was carried by absolutely brilliant performances by Denzel Washington and Robert Duvall. Possibly Denzel's best acting yet. Also incredible was the young actor DFaniel E Smith who played Denzel's son in the film. Without releasing any plot points I will say this movie was superbly acted and brings out feelings in your heart you may not even know you have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film, at least from when the action started. It is a typical film structure where there is a build up to certain events and then a dramatic ending. It shows the downside of the American Health System compared to say the health system in Great Britain. It's a very emotional film for people who get emotional about films, and gets you thinking about what you would do in John Q's situation.Well worth if you like Denzel Washington as his acting is excellent. Kimberly Elise also has some hard scenes to act and does very well. I wasn't too impressed with Ray Liotta in this, as his acting seemed...wooden, but he didn't feature in it a great deal.If you watch this on DVD don't forget to check out the special features, mostly just for the documentary on the health system, as it confirms many of the things featured in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a heart-wrenching film illustrating the plight of the uninsured and underinsured in the US. It is a film packed with fine actors (Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, Anne Heche, and of course Denzel Washington), who, with the exception of Washington, turn in rather mediocre performances. Denzel gives his usual superb performance as the desperate father of a young son needing a heart transplant. But times are rough, he's been reduced to part-time at the plant, and his medical coverage was reduced. The doctors and hospital admin. are unsympathetic, so he....well, I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I rated this as a 6/10, mainly because of Denzel's performance. The other characters were so stereotypical as to be ridiculous. The story seems well put together, but comes dangerously close to being a political ad for socialized medicine in the US. But if you like Denzel, go ahead and shell out the $15-$20 for the DVD. It's one you will want to see more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington follows his powerful and gripping role in "Training Day" with a strong, powerful and intense performance in "John Q." Immense star power, outstanding performances, a powerful message and a poignant story; these are the qualities, which make "John Q" one of the most powerful movies of the year.With raw intensity, extreme authenticity and powerful intrigue Washington leads an all-star cast that includes Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, James Woods and Anne Heche. With tremendous support from Kimberly Elise, Daniel E. Smith and Eddie Griffin, "John Q." is a solid film that delivers on the promise to satisfy.The best thing about watching "John Q." is the conviction, integrity, brutal honesty and intense emotion each actor ought to their character. Furthermore, the cast is not afraid to tackle the truth surrounding the health care system and the way the system treats society. Washington, Heche, Duvall and Liotta create electricity with each scene they are in."John Q." surrounds a father who has been pushed over the edge as he attempts to save the life of his son, Mike, after it is found that his heart has a defect. Though he has insurance that covers the surgery to give his son a new heart, John Q. takes the hospital hostage until the hospital administrator puts Mike's name on the list for a heart transplant.It always puts a smile on my face to watch a movie that has the courage to tackle the truth. The writers deserve most of the credit for bringing to light one of the most important issues facing America; the health care system. Through creating intense moments and powerful scenes, the writers were able to successfully capture my attention and make me feel as if I were in the movie. Writing is the first thing I look at when I make my decision to give it a thumbs up or down, so when "John Q." passed this test, I knew it was only a matter of time before the rest would fall into place.There is not much one can say about Duvall other than he is a phenomenal talent who along with Washington brings credibility. Each film Duvall takes part in seems to turn into magic because he brings so much to each role. He may not have been the best actor in "John Q." but he was certainly the best suited for the role he had as the hostage negotiator.Heche is an added bonus to "John Q." as her role as the hospital administrator is performed with integrity, brutal honesty and fire that makes her role incredibly satisfying. Another actor who made a tremendous impact in "John Q." is James Woods Woods whose best quality is his ability to play villainous role so well it makes everyone forget that he is only playing a part. I relish the opportunity to watch his next film. Ray Liotta's role as the police chief is far and beyond his best performance to date. It's fun to watch everyone come together to turn in a great ensemble performance."The Hurricane," "Courage Under Fire," and "Philadelphia" are only three films, which has cemented Washington as one of the top notch actors in Hollywood. With his role in "John Q.," Washington brings authenticity, screen presence and ability to draw the viewers in with his unique charm. These are qualities he has been able to utilize in previous films.With the integrity of his performance and intensity of his presence, Washington was able to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. A smile comes to my face with every Denzel Washington film because I know I will get a quality performance from him. It is a pleasure to watch a fine actor continue to deliver on demand."John Q." is a blockbuster with intense dialogue, powerful scenes and a poignant story that will satisfy everyone from start to finish.</fullReview>

However, the characters have all the depth and dimension of cartoon personalities. This good v.s. evil story is absurd. As a health care professional, I was both amused and horrified at the cold-blooded, uncaring, fat-cat health care providers in this film. Doctors are not in the business of medicine to get rich - and I don't personally know any who are. They decided to put 12 or so years and $150,000 or more in their educations so they can help people, and that's what doctors do. Doctors make many personal sacrifices that most people never think of - and do so because of a deep and abiding desire to heal. I took as much as I could of this silly diatribe against the evils of American medicine as I could; but ultimately, could not stay with it to the end. Gotta go take an aspirin.

Duh!Earth to the producers: when your insurance changes, you're required to be notified of it, something the plot completely glosses over. In real life Mr. Q would at least have known and prepared financially for his son's potential problems. In the movie, we have Anne Heche playing the sterotypical heartless hospital administrator - named Payne no less -- who urges John to let his son die, the stereotypical surgeon played by James Woods who develops a heart, the stereotypical SWAT guy who wants nothing more than to take John Q out, the stereotypical...well you get the picture.The whole film is one giant stereotype. American health care is bad. Well, thankfully America is one of the few free societies left. If you want health care, you must pay for it. If you want to die on a waiting list for real (only for "free"), go to any of the Communist nightmares in Europe or Canada...but don't expect Hollywood to let you in on *that*.

		<shortDescription>Shameless emotional manipulation and political pap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene in this film where John Q. Archibald (Denzel Washington) is applying for a job where the interviewer says, `Your qualifications are very impressive, as a matter of fact you may be overqualified.' That should have been a quote from his casting interview.This is a horrible script with vapid dialogue and a bleeding heart so big that it is this film that needs a transplant; a brain transplant. Films trying to make a political point (in this case an emotional appeal for National Health Care) are usually deft enough to bury the message in the subtext. This one oversimplifies the issue, preaches unabashedly and even sends a parade of lefties to bang the drum and spew liberal pap all over the screen. Films like this never seem to have trouble finding backers, but at least give us some semi-intelligent interchanges and believable scenes.Director Nick Cassavetes seems oblivious to the fact that the film is cartoonish, as he lets inane drivel attempt to pass as serious dialogue. With the exception of John Q, most of the other characters are cardboard cutouts of you favorite stereotype action figures. We have the cold heartless hospital administrator (Anne Heche), the arrogant doctor (James Wood), the good hearted but dopey factory worker (David Thornton), the grandstanding police chief (Ray Liotta) and the street wise career cop (Robert Duvall).The story is totally predictable, telegraphing the outcome in the first three minutes. Cassavetes seems content with TV level production values and milks the screenplay for every ounce of sympathy it can muster. This is the most shameless emotional manipulation that one could imagine. There is a considerable amount of talent that flounders attempting to prop this film up. Denzel Washington gives a good performance with one of the few characters in the film that is close to believable. He makes John a very noble and respectable character with a warm heart and an iron will. Kimberly Elise is also credible as his wife, and Daniel E. Smith is lovable as his son.The rest of the cast should hide in shame. James Wood is a terrific actor, but overplayed the pompous doctor routine to the point of being ridiculous. Anne Heche, who always comes across as a bit cold, takes this character to the arctic, only to become a weepy basket case at the end in a stunning reversal. Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall are more like a Keystone Kops than serious cops. Shawn Hatosy brings new meaning to the word obnoxious as the rich kid who brings the hooker he just beat up to the ER (sure, that's realistic; it happens all the time).This film isn't terrible, but it's close. I really enjoy watching Denzel work, but this script is a total hack job, and as good as he is he can't save it. I rated it a 3/10. Do yourself a favor and don't insult your own intelligence by seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I was going to love this movie. Being a new Denzel fan (because of Training Day) I nearly bought the DVD without seeing the movie at the theater. Glad I rented. I left to return the movie as soon as the end credits started rolling...I wasn't going to leave this stinker in my home another minute.This movie relies on exaggeration and a distortion of facts to make a point. Over, over, and over again!I thought Denzel did a great job acting as a desperate father. His acting fails on a more socio-economic level. He sure is awfully articulate for a man for a man making just 18 grand a year. I am just contrasting his demeanor with that of his co-worker who says sheepishly "What do I know -- I'm just a factory worker."Most of the other principals did pretty well given the script. I don't blame the actors for not being well developed and for changing their guiding principles on a dime. That's just poor writing.The 'heated' exchanges between Duvall and Liotta pretty much laughable. The emotion was hollow and the dialogue too predictable. As were the actions of the people taken hostage in the ER. For some reason they were no longer scared of their abductor and proclaimed him a hero. What was the reason for their change in attitude? It wasn't readily apparent.One of the most laughable parts of the movie was the crowd's spontaneous reactions to a seemingly private conversation between Duvall and Liotta. "Yeah!!!!" "Boooooo!" First of all, how could a crowd of people hear a regular volume conversation between two people? Were they miked or something?? I hate it when a movie tells me how to feel - at least so overtly. We are going to boo here...you should now be mad at that silly policeman who tried to subdue an individual who took innocent people in an emergency room by gun point. He is bad. BOOOO!!!!!By the end of the movie I didn't care whether the boy lived or died. At least we got Hillary, Bill Maher and Larry King...just in case the liberal message was missed for the previous hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A father fighting for his son's life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is more than a film, it is a really good document about the injustice in rich societies, where money is much more important than a life of a child. To pay US$ 250 000 for a heart transplant is just an absurd because only millionaires can pay for it. The society in any country, moreover in rich ones, should try to guarantee life for its citizens, and children should have a priority. The argument of the film is valid and important to be touched although the ways used by the father of the sick child are not the best and may not solve the situation. In fact, the solution given in the film is just for this child but not to other children who may be in similar situation of sickness. Therefore, the film would have been perfect if it touched or suggested any way for parents to present their demands in medical care and medical aid for their children and even for their own lives. Denzel Washington acted pretty well as well as Dr. Turner (the veteran James Woods).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STORYLINE IS WEAK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that could have been much better. Denzel's formidable talent is wasted on a paper thin storyline. A young child dying of heart failure is inherently dramatic. But it should be handled delicately. This movie presents a maudlin exploitation of universal family feelings. Do we really neeed to be reminded that a father loves his son? All the heart wrenching tears in the world won't generate a single compatible and transplantable heart that pumps blood. Bottom line: standard sappy Hollywood treatment of a serious social issue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not THAT bad. I've seen far worse. We all know the rule: a Hollywood movie can get away with being as much of a silly, manipulative and cliché-ridden propaganda vehicle as it wants, provided that the propaganda is right-wing rather than left-wing - which it usually is. Here we have a movie which implicitly argues (sometimes with more subtlety and intelligence than is immediately apparent) that the United States should cough up the money for a comprehensive public health insurance scheme ... either by raising taxes (as one of the talking heads hints at the end), or, say, cutting "defence" expenditure. I mention the latter possibility because of the constant flood of Hollywood movies that implicitly argue, without being challenged on the point, in favour of maintaining defence expenditure. People don't respond to "Top Gun" (at least, they don't do so on the IMDb site) by pointing out that the US military guzzles at least 40% of the annual tax intake and that almost every cent goes towards subverting democracy and ruining peoples' lives around the world; anyone who did point this out would be told to put their personal biases aside and enjoy the fantasy. "John Q" is roughly as obvious and shallow in its manipulation, and neither more nor less enjoyable if you're willing to play along, but it got a much rougher ride. One writer here even chastised the film for failing to mention the high rate of income tax Australians must endure in exchange for public health care, to which I have to respond: (1) sadly, we won't have public health care for much longer, since the present government is determined to abolish Medicare, and, given the cunning way it's setting about doing so, is likely to succeed, and (2) Australians are taxed at roughly the same rate as Americans, and at a considerably lower rate than the Western average.I'm kind of ignoring the whole gun-toting, hostage-taking thing, which made the film dumber, less effective and less enjoyable; but my verdict is still that the film has been attacked not so much because it's bad (and I suppose I have to admit it is - although, as I said earlier, not THAT bad), but because some people will gasp in horror at the faintest whiff of socialism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When director Nick Cassavetes went to work on John Q, I'm surehis heart was in the right place. He accepted this job because, with his daughter Sasha on a donated organ recipient list, he felt a connection with the characters and situations presented in the movie. Obviously, the subject matter stuck a resonant chord for others involved in the production, as well. The cast includes such notable names as Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall, and James Woods. Yet, for all of those good intentions, John Q turns out to be hopelessly mediocre - a poorly scripted, preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent, believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda.John Q tells the story of a man, John Archibald (Denzel Washington), who is having trouble making ends meet. Since his work week has been cut from 40 hours to 20 hours, he can't keep up on the family's car payments, and eventually losses the car. When his son, Mike, collapses on a baseball field and is diagnosed as needing a heart transplant, John is confident that things will be okay, because he has medical insurance. Unfortunately, it turns out that his Tier II coverage doesn't cover $250,000 operations. The hospital director, Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche), refuses to put Mike's name on the organ recipient list until John can cover the $75,000 down payment. The cardiologist, Dr. Turner (James Woods), claims that the matter is out of his hands. But John's wife, Denise (Kimberly Elise), screams at him that he hasto do something. So he does - he takes everyone in the hospital's emergency room hostage. When the police, led by the crusty negotiator Grimes (Robert Duvall) and the chief of police, Monroe (Ray Liotta), arrive, he presents his demand: he will release the hostages when his son has a new heart. Otherwise, he will start killing them. Oh yea, that's fair to the other thousands of people on the donor list.John Q's underlying concept has a great deal of relevance in today's world, where the term "medical coverage" is rarely mentioned without anaccompanying, profane adjective. Yet Cassavetes and screenwriter JamesKearns take this important issue and make it the fulcrum of a story that is divorced from reality by so many contrivances that it's almost laughable. From the moment when John storms into the hospital and takes over, believability goes out the window. There is no way that a lone man, untrained in fighting and with only a small gun, could take over the wing of a hospital, hold off the entire Chicago police force, and turn into an instant folk hero while threatening to kill innocent people. But that's not all - we also get loads of corny dialogue and several pointless subplots. A power struggle develops between Grimes and Monroe, but this is just filler.And there are feeble attempts to satirize media zeal in the person of a TV reporter who's as concerned with his appearance as with getting the story. Films like Die Hard and The Negotiator have offered similar subplots to better effect. Here, they're just an annoying form of background noise.Speaking of annoying background noise - John Q's soundtrack, which features jarring instrumentals and at least one grossly out-of-place ballad, should have been replaced or re-edited at some point during the film's post-production phase. It's almost as if composer Aaron Zigman turned in his score without watching the movie. Normally, for me to notice it, a soundtrack has to be very good or very bad. Here, it's the latter case.There are times when acting almost redeems this movie - almost, but notquite. Denzel Washington is convincing as a desperate father who has run out of legal options and can think of no other alternative but to point a gun and hope no one calls his bluff. Robert Duvall has no trouble playing a veteran cop who probably loves the smell of napalm in the morning. Anne Heche and Ray Liotta don't test their ranges in their portrayals of dislikable individuals. James Woods offers an effective turn as a doctor caught between his oath and the system. Solid support is provided by Kimberly Elise as John's supportive wife and Daniel E. Smith as his dying son. There are no Oscar-worthy performances to be found here, but acting is not one of John Q's faults.Aside from the sheer implausibility of the principal action, the film's most glaring weakness lies in its inability to state its case with any degree of subtlety. People, even those who agree with the political doctrine being espoused, don't like sermons. And that's precisely what John Q turns into - a two-hour attempt to indoctrinate viewers into believing that the current health care system is in desperate need of reform (to me, this seems self-evident). The movie isn't content to show the inadequacies of the system - it talks about them endlessly in speeches that would have been at home in a public service announcement. Not only is this tedious, it's unnecessary - the events happening to John are sufficient to illustrate the situation.At its heart, John Q is a drama, but the movie frames several sections as action sequences, complete with artificially generated tension. There's a scene in which a sharpshooter climbs through the hospital's air conditioning ducts in order to get a shot at John. This is handled so badly (like something in a direct-to-cable B-movie thriller) that I found myself cringing. Sadly, that's the way I reacted to much of this movie - a good idea with noble intentions gone awry because of a poorly crafted screenplay and uneven direction. Next time Nick Cassavetes wants to tell a deeply personal story, he should rely on something that is less obviously manufactured by a connect-the-dots screenwriter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie, one major hole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I thought this was a pretty good movie from an artistic standpoint. It has an obvious political bent (towards providing health care to people who can't afford it). One thing that I liked is that it didn't incessantly drive home the point and try to make the audience feel as if anyone making a little extra money should be robbed and forced to give money to the poor (which is what I initially expected of the movie). Although the movie is slanted towards John Q, the doctors make logical and realistic arguments as well. The ending almost seems like it's going to be Shakespearean tragic, but the writers apparently backed off to give a happy ending. It has one major hole, though...at the end, you hear the gunshot...and then he's alive again. What's up with that? Did they sedate him when he wasn't watching or what?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Q. Flies A Plane Into The World Heath Care System! (zero stars)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does this movie justify terrorism? I think so and I have to ask myself, Who would make such a film after the 9/11 attacks? The main character is frustrated by the healthcare system and thus, resorts to holding hostages at gunpoint. Sounds like a terrorist to me. Venting your frustrations by threatening the lives of others is not what I would call a hero. If this movie want's to send a message, fine. However, I hope that the message is not that the action John Q. takes is justified. Think about it. Is the message that sometimes terrorism is ok? Is it ok to take hostages and threaten people with death if you can't get things your way? Are abortion clinic bombers then justified for their deadly deeds? I see the character, John Q, as another bin Laden and thus, an enemy of civilization. Terrorists in my world are part of the problem not a viable option to solve problems. Once again, terrorism in the name of universal health coverage is not justified, heroic or right. Perhaps a better title of movie might be, `John Q. Flies A Plane Into The World Heath Care System'.</fullReview>

This movie was allllllll over the place. Were we supposed to cry, or laugh? By the end of the movie everything was so hunky - dory that *****Spoilers***** ******************************************************************John Q looked as if he was heading off on a business trip rather than going to jail for a couple of years. After 90 minutes I was checking my watch and wondering how much longer was this thing going to drag out. Why couldn't Dr. Turner just say yes to John Q.'s demand of assisted suicide and then shoot him up with a tranquilizer? How was John Q. able to hear his wife say that a heart had been found while he was off in a room holding a gun to his head? This was a really shallow, overblown movie that could have been filmed for TV. Ironically enough, the actor who played the husband of the pregnant woman who was let go early on, played the role of a father in the same situation(child in need of a transplant) on a episode of ER. In that show, the father actually blew his brains out so that his child could receive his heart--no cop out miracle heart written into the script like in John Q. That episode of ER was much more compelling and heart pulling than this crap. There is no reason at all for running to the theater and seeing this mush. Wait for it to show up on cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"John Q" is the kind of movie Frank Capra would have come up with had he been a bitter burnout under the pressure of a heinous studio deadline and half a bottle of barbiturates.The movie starts out promisingly enough. We meet John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington), a hard-working, decent Chicagoland machinist. He is having money problems in the slowing economy, but dearly loves his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) and 9-year-old son Mike (Daniel E.Smith). In the first few scenes we get to know and like the Archibalds (good thing, too, or the movie would be even tougher going) before the trouble starts. Mike collapses during a Little League game and his parents learn that his heart has a rare defect that will cause him to die unless he gets a transplant.Thus begins the best part of the movie, as John Q slowly realizes the cruelty of the deck stacked against him. Not only has his insurance coverage been changed to an HMO (boo, hiss) without his knowledge, but his status has been downgraded to "part-time", as he works less hours. Vainly fighting against a system that won't help him, can't help him, could have helped him but he filled out the wrong forms, he becomes increasingly desperate, until, having exhausted everything he knows how to do, he pleads, cajoles, begs, and finally pulls out a gun.At this point, everything is set for a fantastic issue picture and character study, as John Q seizes control of the emergency ward and demands that his son be placed on an organ donation list. The scenario calls up pretty heavy questions of individual and societal morality, of how far we can or might go. Is what John Q does understandable? Is it right? Is it terrorism? What would we do?Unfortunately, the movie either shrugs off these questions or gives pat, glib answers, in favor of a standoff thriller that doesn't work. The police show up, with a weathered negotiator (Robert Duvall), and proceed immediately to break every rule of hostage negotiation: they allow crowds into the containment area. They place legions of cops in plain sight right in front of the hospital. They give out personal information in negotiations. They put third parties on the phone to talk to John. They don't talk to his family or friends (and only briefly to his wife). They make concrete assurances they can't possibly keep. They send his son in. They have a special-ops officer in full BDUs plus the chief of police(!) stand next to Duvall while he negotiates with a distraught man waving a gun. They make a move on John Q using one lone guy in the vent shafts to take a shot so dubious even Carlos Hathcock wouldn't have tried it. And more. If I were a member of the Chicago PD's famously patient Hostage/Barricade/Terrorist Unit (which in its first ten years resolved over 200 incidents without killing anybody) I'd be inclined to sue for slander. Incidentally, the movie credits as "SWAT Consultant" something called "Final Option", but nobody from the Chicago police. Small wonder.The movie glosses over the more subtle aspects of hostage situations. With few exceptions, John's eight hostages (kinda sparse for the ER of a big-city trauma ward, but oh well) Stockholm with him in nothing flat, and only one ever asks to use the bathroom (we never see what, if anything, John does about that). He also becomes a folk hero almost instantly.If "John Q" is a mediocre hostage drama, it's a downright irresponsible moral statement. Because the movie obviously approves of what he's doing, it doesn't examine the implications of it. John allows a critical gunshot victim to enter the ER (after shooing away the paramedics), then makes a neophyte resident and a specialist in the wrong specialty work on him without proper staff or equipment. The movie sells this as an act of great humanity, never mind the risks to the man's life. Shutting down a big-city ER potentially puts a lot of people at risk, but the movie essentially leaves that issue alone. While it's easy to sympathize with John, it's impossible to sympathize with the crowd that gathers to cheer him on and hiss and berate the cops on the perimeter. After all, they're cheering for a man who has stated his intention to start killing hostages (most of whom had nothing at all to do with his son's case) in one hour if his demands aren't met. Do they assume he's bluffing? Do they care? Does the movie? We're never sure.The movie's analysis of the health-care issue also fails to satisfy, relying mostly on shrillness and easy targets. Toward the end of the movie we get a montage of wealthy liberal blowhards bemoaning the greed and heartlessness of the "medical establishment" (in a sad irony, sitting silent in one of these clips is the late Ted Demme, who died of heart failure shortly before this movie was released). But the fact is that socialized medicine schemes and rampant lawsuits can screw things up just as badly. While I wouldn't want my barricade pic to devolve into debates on cost/benefit ratios and risk assessment, some acknowledgement of the complexity of the issue would have been appreciated.It is greatly to "John Q"'s benefit that it has Denzel Washington, an actor of such talent and gravity that he lends credibility to any fool thing he's in. From his breakfast table to his siege, he makes a real and likable person out of John Q, and his increasing desperation is vivid and real. It is only because of Washington that this movie functions on any level at all. It's a shame Capra never got to work with him. With the exception of Kimberly Elise's moving performance as Mrs. Q, the rest of the cast is not up to snuff. Duvall seems to be a hazy carbon copy of the tired cop he played in "Falling Down", Anne Heche is an icy caricature as the hospital director (named "Payne", no less), and Ray Liotta leaves little impression as an underwritten glory-hound police chief. Eddie Griffin is along as a hostage to provide comic relief. He provides none. James Woods is a little better as the cardiac surgeon John holds hostage, but he isn't given much interesting to say.Reportedly, director Nick Cassavetes was drawn to this movie because of his daughter's medical problems (the movie is dedicated to her), so it's easy to see where his sympathies lie. But "John Q" pretends to raise tough questions only to dodge them (the ending is the ultimate dodge) and seems to want us to swallow a pretty undigestible philosophy: that using violence to stop a gunman threatening to kill eight innocent people is wrong and reprehensible, but terrorism in the name of universal coverage? Well, that's okay.</fullReview>

But, I came out feeling very, very unsatisfied, feeling like the movie played me for a fool.Why? you may ask? Well, This flick seems a good movie for "entertainment value" but, it's a sappy and shallow as a old chicken grease filled coffee can. Now, you see... a movie can be sappy and work well... (with a good script) even a shallow movie can work (if you got some stuff blowing up in it) but, this movie has neither... and ultimatley, my feeling is that it's too shallow and makes fun of itself too much to much to be serious and it's too serious to be a complete satire of as you may have been hearing about the American HMO system.So, to sum it all up... the movie is good because of the performances of the entire Archibald family (Denzel, Ms. Elise, and the adorable son) (also, The song (by stevie wonder???) proceeding the son's fall along with the images definatley pulls at your heart strings.)BUT...The movie fails in it's scripting departments</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In what seems like a really long public service announcement, "John Q." raises the right questions but provides no answers. Obviously health care and insurance are problems in this country, but that's not anything that the general public doesn't know. It's "preaching the the choir" so to speak. While original in plot, a lot of the elements of the film are not and the character behavior is very stereotypical. There's the evil white person (or people), the cop that sides with the guy on the wrong side of the law, the street thug, the smartass kid, the tough hot girl, etc., etc. All of the characters are more like caricatures. Some of the dialogue is just plain silly, too. This is a film that shamelessly pulls at your heartstrings (see "Pay It Forward") just to get you to emotionally connect with the film. Obviously you're on the side of the "good guy", so why push it over the top with the schmaltz? It may sound like I didn't enjoy the film but I did. Denzel Washington is great as usual and having Robert Duvall and James Woods in the cast never hurt a movie. Most impressive is Anne Heche, back from whatever looney-toon land she was on. This film will do well with audiences and have some people even more up in arms about our country's healthcare system, but what does this teach us? That it's OK to be violent if you're frustrated? That if your family is in danger that it's alright to endanger others? That the hero should always fight the law no matter the cost? Without spoiling the ending, I'll just say that you can pretty much guess what happens. This will win no awards, but could have if it was made a little better. There are plenty of things that stopped this from being a great film. There's no reason why Ah-nuld couldn't have done a movie like this the way it was written. If you're a Denzel fan and think that the movie is going to be great from the previews, then go check it out. Otherwise, there's no rush to check this one out. It would be just as good as a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film comes off pretty desperate in all the wrong ways. Every line of dialogue appears to be geared towards tugging on the heart strings of the audience and it all becomes very formulaic, predictable, cliché and somewhat boring by the end. The character of John Q is played well by Denzel Washington, but like the film you do get a sense that you've seen it all before. Robert Duvall is pretty inadmissible as the cop whom John Q puts his trust in, Ray Liotta is pretty solid in a small role - although again quite samey. And Anne Heche plays her character of queen b*tch suitably well too, until of course right at the last minute when she finally thaws and gives in to Q's demands. The real revelation amongst the cast is definitely the actress who played Mrs Q (sorry don't know her name). She certainly brings credibility to her part and the film is worth a watch alone based on her performance. That's not to say she deserved an Oscar but she is good in it. So all in all, the film is terrifically unrealistic and lacks any real tension, but the cast are all watchable, if a little familiar and so therefore I rate this film 4/10 (2*).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched John Q, and I knew from the start what kind of film this was. John Q is an obvious film, with clear characters. In the begin, you have the sweet little kid saying things like: don't say goodbye etc, and they're a loving family, but then... The kid has a weak heart, and needs a transplantation. This already gives a lot of sentiment and drama. Then the father hears he isn't insured, and his kid will die. more sentiment and drama. There are obvious villains, although they fail in their 'evil' deeds. One of them turns good, and the other just makes an mess of it. The scene where John Q almost kills himself for his little kid, is also very, very obvious. You just know he won't and that the hart will come in time. I also don't think people will be so scared of a gun. My conclusion: this is a film for people who need very clear characters, and for people who like to cry at drama. Sadly enough, I'm not one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Q is not the worst movie I have seen in my life. But that's about the only positive thing I have to say about it. I avoided it last weekend, because of the criticism it had received, but my wife talked me into seeing it this weekend (I wanted to go see Hart's War), and I now wish I had stood my ground. It should be a crime to have actors of this magnitude and then misuse them in a manner such as this. John Q is a perfect example of illustrating the fact that great actors (and a good performance by Washington), does not equal a great movie. It is also a good example of how important good direction and screen writing are, something Q was lacking. To say this movie was just manipulative is probably the biggest understatement of the year. The makers of this melodrama stop just short of sending someone to kick the crap out of you to make you cry. And unfortunately, this leads to a movie that was trying to make an important, powerful statement, but ended up being a sappy, corny wanna-be. But like I have said many times before, that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw John Q Saturday night. Not what I expected. Had I wanted to know more about socialized medicine, I would have read the brochure. Instead, the writer of this movie read the brochure for me and encapsulated it in an emergency room scene in which the "hostages" discuss the woes of health insurance in America. An extremely unnatural and preachy scene, to say the least.Also, this movie doesn't really tackle the issue of Americans not donating organs. It makes it seem that the reason people die waiting for transplants is because big mean insurance companies won't pay for them. When in fact, more often than not, it's because a compatible donor is never located.SPOILERS in this paragraph. The movie is filled with tear-jerking, emotion-manipulating, cheap suspense scenes. The gun's safety being on when he lies down to kill himself at the end is possibly the cheapest bit of writing a I've seen in a movie of this budget. The movie leads you to believe that he killed himself just as the news of his son's new heart arrives. My first thought was, "That's awesome. This movie is truly a tragedy." But no. He's alive. Hollywood, no matter how brash a political statement they are trying to make, will not kill a star. His son has a new heart and is up walking around and flexing for his dad (ala John John's salute to his father in 1963) a few months after the operation. Good old John Q gets a couple of years in jail. Violence is the answer once again. The movie never mentions the various charities that help people raise the money for transplants of this nature. And are we to believe the news agencies wouldn't run a story like this? Would a little boy broke and dying and in need of a heart transplant not pull in ratings unless his father holds an ER hostage?All in all, I think the makers of this film had the best of intentions. But to blow an opportunity to bring attention to the need for organ donors in this country is a crime. And while films like "Cider House Rules" and "Traffic" address social issues, they don't tell which side you should be on. Our government has been known to spend $50 on hammers and $300 on toilets. Do we really want them running our hospitals? Isn't $15 enough to pay for an aspirin?I give it a C because the acting is great and some of the suspense is genuine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because a movie is about something important doesn't mean it's any good. John Q public makes a typically (for Hollywood) brash and broad statement about the state of health care in the U.S. Unfortunately the script is laughably contrived and full of downright silly lines (one of them stolen from The Wizard of Oz for heaven's sake). Background and small role work is poor and the TV movie of the week direction weakens solid performances by Washington and Kimberly Elise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You must be kidding....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A kid needs a heart transplant. Mommy and Daddy are black and poor. The hospital is cold and unfeeling. The insurance company doesn't want to pay. The media is exploitive. Dad, who of course is a good person down deep, takes hostages in the hospital. The police are corrupt. Is there any cliché I missed? Way far-fetched. Unconvincing and over acted performances, especially the ever wooden Denzel Washington. At times downright ridiculous. I suppose it means well, but surely there had to be a better way than this. So for all those people patiently waiting for a heart transplant, you must watch this movie. What you need to do is terrorize a hospital with a gun, take hostages, and you will be bumped to the top of the list! It's that easy! Who cares about the other people patiently waiting for a transplant, screw them! And that ending...you have to be kidding. "It's not good-bye son, it's see you later...." Jeeez.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caring dad flips out and takes the ER hostage at gunpoint after the hospital refuses to grant his son a heart transplant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS*** (if it is possible to "spoil" such an awful film) John Q boasts lots of bankable stars: Denzel, James Woods, Anne Heche, and starts out as a promising drama of an underinsured working class family struggling with the hospital administration cost-of-care runaround, after their beloved son falls victim to an enlarged heart, requiring an urgent $250,000 transplant to save his life.This could have been a dramatic editorial about the lack of universal health insurance in America, which means that those of us who have good jobs or lots of wealth can get excellent care, while many working class, small business people and the un- or under-employed lose out.Unfortunately, after a respectable start, the wheels come off the story when our hero pulls a gun on the cardiologist. John Q proceeds to commit dozens of felony counts ranging from ADW to kidnapping, plus endangering numerous other patients' lives by shutting down a major hospital ER. From this point on, about the best he can hope for is 20 years in prison (I'd vote for life if I was on the jury), and you can bet that any promises made under duress would be revoked as soon as the police get the cuffs on. He might as well shoot his son and himself and save time.I only gave this 3 of 10 because I enjoyed it until the gun came out. Ten minutes later we switched off. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dignified but dull rendering of an original concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Major spoilers*Though John Q was stillborn at the box office, having been drowned in critical vitriol, the concept is an engaging one that ought to have the makings of a decent movie. To begin with, the film hits all the right notes: the poor-but-loving-family are well drawn, and the tension is cranked up as Denzel's son collapses at a baseball game and is discovered to have a terminal heart defect. We feel for Archibald and his wife as they look desperately for ways to secure the life-saving transplant the boy needs. In the first of many sensible developments that make the story more credible, the couple are well served by friends and the local community, who do everything in their power to help. It would have been easy for the filmmakers to pitch the protaganists into an "us against the world" scenario, where they are utterly alone. But in fact they enjoy the dedicated support of their friends and neighbours: it is officialdom alone that lets the Archibalds down, and this makes their plight all the more frustrating.The audience are firmly on-side as Denzel's final, desperate plea to surgeon James Woods falls on deaf ears, and we understand why he believes the only option now open to him is to hijack the emergency room at Chicago Hope. However, the scenes in which Archibald takes over the hospital fall short of the drama the audience has been wound-up to expect. In some respects, this makes the development more realistic: Denzel doesn't suddenly become Bruce Willis and launch into a mass shoot 'em up....he is an ordinary, decent man, and his hijack is clumsy and somewhat botched: John Q is clearly out of his depth. The problem is that director Nick Cassavettes allows the film's momentum to dip irrecoverably during these scenes. There are some confusing moments while we wait for the authorities to work out what's going on and respond accordingly. When, for example, do the eight-or-nine-people held prisoner in casualty find out about John's agenda? We never see how: within minutes, they just know, and we expect them to be shortly polarised as either potential baddies who only care about getting out, or goodies with a sneaking sympathy for John and his cause.The writer, however, has other plans: there are no goodies and baddies in this movie, only human beings. Throughout the remaining scenes, where John is held up in the hospital, the film fails to retain our interest because the story is played out too realistically. All the protaganists behave as you would really expect them to in such a scenario. The only fantastical note is struck when the media are able to tap into police footage of John inside the hospital, talking to his son on the phone.Inside the emergency room, Shawn Hatosi's arrogant young wife-beater is the closest thing to a baddie, but he is quickly dealt with and later comes back on side, sharing the camaraderie of the other hostages and Archibald.Hospital administrator Anne Heche does a 180 after seeing the footage of John talking to his child, and police chief Ray Liotta is quick to admit his sledgehammer approach has failed and go crawling to Robert Duvall's veteran hostage negotiator. John Q isn't sure if it wants to be a thriller, or a melodrama with incisive social commentary, and doesn't really succeed at either. I'd actually have preferred it to lapse into the kind of dramatic cliches that at least sustain audience interest. Archibald and Robert Duvall could have enjoyed the statutory conversation where John asks the other man "do YOU have kids?", allowing the pair to engage in a spot of bonding. Duvall might have replied that hasn't seen his daughter in years, and that his wife is about to ditch him because he puts the force first. And in any other film, Duvall would have been in his last day on the job, putting his neck on the line for one final time! As it is, there is no real sense of consequence about the proceedings. We know, for a fact, that John is too nice a guy to actually hurt anyone, so none of the hostages are at risk. Cross refer this with a film like The Negotiator, where we are allowed to believe for a substantial part of the film that Samuel Jackson's good guy has killed a captured police officer. Once he has done this, we reason, all bets are off: he has nothing to lose, and anything could happen. This movie isn't like that: you know John isn't going to harm anybody, and moreover, you know his son is going to get a new heart. Worse still, you know, long before the climax of the film, how this is going to be achieved. For, although we've had time to forget about the opening sequence in which a young woman is involved in a car wreck, the same footage is repeated halfway through the story, leaving us in no doubt as to the identity of our donor. As such, John's desperate threat to take his own life and thereby give his boy a heart is, from the point of view of the audience, empty. This IS the kind of film where a father might make the ultimate sacrifice for his son...however, it very definitely isn't the kind of film that would wave a get-out clause under our noses (a third-part donor), then perversely fail to use it. Is John, unaware of the existence of the other heart even as it is rushed to hospital, and already saved from one suicide attempt when he leaves the safety catch on his gun, actually going to succeed in what we know to be a completely wasted, pointless gesture that would make a mockery of all his efforts? What do you think? In it closing moments, John Q keeps its dignity, sending Archibald to jail for a token sentence, thereby resisting the temptation to pull a "Time to Kill" and free him as a conquering hero (memo to Michael Crichton: Samuel Jackson would have been right back in the slammer as soon as the prosecution appealed). This note sums the film up neatly: it never hits the dramatic high points we might have hoped for, nor does it tug convincingly on our heart strings. But it is at least a coherent and original movie, albeit one you're likely to forget as soon as you drop it back at the video store.Two and a half stars out of five </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the pitch? A blue collar family in rural U.S.A. The son has an accident and the parents find out he has a rare heart disorder and will have need a heart transplant or he will die. The tough business minded hospital administration has to tell the parents that they need to come up with $250,000 just to get on a donor list. Dad (John Q, Washington) tries his hardest to keep up with the hospital bills, but the insurance company has left them high and dry. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Fed up with falling behind in life John Q decides to take over the hospital by force. With gun in hand he takes several people hostage. Police are brought in but there is even corruption within the police force. The media gets wind of the problem and create even more trouble. How will it play out?? watch and see.Hollywood Producers: HP 1: Wow, sounds great. Get some hot new director? HP 2: How about Nick Cassavetes? HP 1: Isn't that John's son? HP 2:Yup, he just did "She's so lovely." HP 1: Perfect? good buzz. HP 2:Next, we'll get some Academy award winners to sign on. Denzel, Duvall. HP 1: What about a supporting cast? HP 2: Ray Liotta, James Woods? HP 1:This sounds like a sure fire hit. Let's green light it. Six months later? Exterior movie theatre / Night: Two movie goers: MG 1: What a ridiculous movie. That plot did not work at all. I mean, taking an emergency room over with a handgun, only one security guard?? MG 2: And what was with every sub plot being 100% in a fantasy world? The battered wife finally getting the courage to fight back, under these circumstances? and the whole room laughing as she sprays mace in to his face. MG 1: Ooo? Now how about the soccer "fan-esque" crowd that shows up outside, and "Boo'" the police. MG 2: Speaking of terrible extras, you think they could find people that have actually held a gun before. MG 1: But the worst thing has got to be the rare blood type, only one person on the donor list that matches crap. MG 2: Hooray? The deus ex. I mean heart flies in and saves the day. MG 1: How and why in the heck did all these people sign up for this piece of garbage? MG 2: It must have looked good on paper.This movie should be put in the "John Doe" files. No one should have to ever see this film. The only saving grace is a great performance by Denzel Washington? but it's not worth seeing this film for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerily reminiscent of Platoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was troubled when I saw this movie. Deeply troubled. It is clear that the director did the exact same thing Oliver Stone did when the latter directed Platoon: dished out a load of propaganda thinly disguised as 'entertainment' in order to manipulate the public. Whereas Platoon was pro-communist, anti-American, anti-Western propaganda, John Q. was socialist propaganda, pure and simple. Everyone has a right to his opinion, but if a director wants to get his point across, he should say so right up front, rather than be sneaky about it and show it under the guise of 'entertainment.' Like Platoon, this film was very subtly but dangerously subversive, and thus completely horrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is a review of John Q</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 out of 10This is a review of `John Q.' I said, this is a review of `John Q.' It is very important that you understand that this is a review of `John Q.' If I keep telling you that this is a review of `John Q' I think eventually you will realize that this is a review of `John Q.'I'm sorry if I'm being a tad, say, didactic, but I have just spent the last two hours of my life, two hours I can never get back, watching `John Q,' the movie I am now going to review.Don't get me wrong. It's not that the premise or the message of the film are flawed-that of a father taking a hospital hostage in order to get his son on the list to receive a heart transplant-but the delivery is about as subtle as an open heart surgery, as deliberate as an entrepreneur at the Olympics, and as believable as an Oscar nomination.Consider a scene in which the surgeon-who could have been played by anybody but is played by James Woods because this is a movie-tells Denzel Washington's character that `the only way to save his son is to get a heart transplant,' and his evil-yet-eventually-has-a-change-of-heart-so-the-movie-can-have-a-happy-end ing assistant-who also could have been played by anyone, but is played by Anne Heche because otherwise she would have taken the life of one of the hostages inside her mind every hour-responds roughly, `you do have one more option-you can let your son DIE!!!'Washington's performance is pretty much the only saving grace of the film, though at times I can't help but wonder if the emotions he shows are from the pain of seeing his character's son nearly die, or from being trapped in such a piece of schlock as is this film, or from seeing his character's son nearly die in such a piece of schlock as is this film.There is a good movie in here somewhere, and it was called `The Negotiator.' Not that that film had the market cornered on hostage negotiation or even that `John Q' is all that similar to `The Negotiator;' it's just that my boss Jason at work told me to say that and we're up for raises soon and . ..But seriously, all I ask of a film is that it take an interesting premise and explore the possibilities that come from it. `John Q' does not concern itself with this, because its primary purpose is to preach from Hollywood to the supposed `movie-going' branch of the government as to the necessity of free health care for all. Washington's character doesn't actually take the hospital hostage; he merely locks the doors to the emergency room so the people there, naturally representing all walks of life, can have discussions about HMOs and how greedy doctors are. Outside the evil media and government are represented by a parade of extras dressed as policemen pointing guns at the fake wall to the hospital while Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall spout rehashed cop banter at each other against a backdrop of cheering patrons. Say, isn't it convenient when the film's focal point is a mass media event?Of course the people are cheering on John Q. Archibald, who is meant to represent John Q. Public. Get it? John Q? Everyman? Yeah that's pretty clever . . . Mr. President. And we the lower classes are oppressed. Boo hoo. Why doesn't somebody make a movie about how I can't find a damn parking spot anywhere?It's probable that John Q. Nondiscerning Moviegoer will see `John Q' and think it's a good film with a powerful message, and will feel oppressed by me, John Q. Bitter Movie Critic Who Pans All the Films You Like Just to Get Revenge on All the Girls That Rejected Him in High School, but inasmuch as these people won't be smart enough to make any sort of a difference on even a grassroots level, the film fails yet again.If there truly is a problem with the health care system in this country as it is, I certainly didn't gather as much from this film. The filmmakers would have been wise to model `John Q' more after `Traffic,' a film that showed all the sides of a problem without demonizing any of its characters, after `The Negotiator,' a film I have mentioned twice already in this review, or after `Mission: Impossible II,' a film that features Tom Cruise dangling from the side of a cliff. But this is not a review of those movies. This is a review of `John Q.' You can stop reading it now. The review's over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Hackneyed, Really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After playing so brilliantly against-type in 2001's "Training Day," Denzel Washington returns to familiar everyman-on-a-mission territory again with this "uplifting" thriller. "John Q" strives to be a three-hanky film, and it dutifully includes all the major ingredients, one by one. Washington plays John Q. Archibald (because "Public" might have been a bit too obvious), bread-winner of a small lower-middle class family. But when his son is diagnosed with a heart problem that he lacks the money to operate on, John takes matters into his own hands.If this were just an "uplifting" movie, John would stay by his son's side and have several intense emotional struggles. But since this is also a "thriller," he does what any caring father would do, and holds up the hospital with a gun. He threatens because he cares, you might say.So by the numbers is the script that at times it seems like a conglomeration of every movie to fall within the lines of its two genres. The traditional "thriller" stuff (snipers coming through the roof, etc) is equally mixed with the traditional "uplifting" stuff. (John offers himself as a sacrifice for his son.) Trust me, you'll see the ending coming miles away, possibly before the film even starts.With a plot so transperant that you can actually see the wall behind the theater screen, the burden falls on the shoulders of the actors to get the point across. Denzel Washington turns in a routinely good performance, as usual. The second best job in the movie is comedian Eddie Griffin's turn as a wisecracking hostage. Sure, his character is just another cliche, but Griffin manages to turn it into quite an entertaining one. The worst character is that of the female medical board leader. Going from incomprehensibly evil to warm-hearted, then suddenly back again, the audience is given no bearing on her thoughts or motivations.So, is John Q. worth seeing? In a word, maybe. It's a mixed bag no matter how you slice it. For example, is it right and ethical to go to the extremes John does, if you're doing it for a greater moral good? If not, should we be rooting for the opposing side instead? John Q. never addresses these questions. The good guys are straight down the line good, and the bad guys are just plain evil. So, if you can turn off your brain for two hours, you may enjoy this movie. I did, but I would have preferred a bit more substance.(**1/2/****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just ridiculous. The premise is good, and the acting is too, and it starts out interestingly enough, but that's about it. Denzel's character is seen as a hero in his actions, but he was self-centered and ignorant, to say the least. He didn't take into account all the other people he was hurting (including his own son) by taking people hostage and offering to give up his heart for his son. Because he can't deal with the grief of losing a son, he'd rather let his son deal with the grief of losing a father.It's ludicrous how the hostages respond to the situation. "He's so brave! What a hero!" seems to be the general consensus. It's so melodramatic and predictable. You can tell when a "crying scene" is coming up and you end up just rolling your eyes at the crap that comes out of John's mouth. The end is so "feel-good" that I thought, "The whole gang's here! Gee golly!" when the hostages join John at the trial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I was thoroughly disappointed with John Q. I figured with Denzel, Liotta, Duvall, and Woods this should at least be a decent film. I will never again underestimate the ability of a bad script to ruin a movie. This David (i.e. John) vs Goliath (i.e. the big evil HMO) story is so ham-handed in it's attempt to make the viewer revile the HMO and feel sorry for the poor suffering family that it is almost laughable.There is one scene that sums up how ridiculous this movie is. At one point in the movie, John gets into a scuffle with an abusive husband who is one of the hostages. John loses his gun and it sits on the floor while he fist-fights the abuser. Does one of the other hostages pick up the gun in an attempt to free themselves? No... they watch the fight and cheer as John kicks the tar out of the guy, then picks up his gun. I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a movie, but this willing hostage thing is too much.  John Q is the sort of boring, predictable junk that Hollywood continues to commit to celluloid. You seriously can see every twist and turn before it happens. If you've ever wondered what it's like to be psychic, rent John Q.</fullReview>

To the meeting with the cardiologist and the hospital administrator. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I read somewhere that Densel studied factory workers for some time prior to the movie, in order to establish credibility. He was obviously the only person associated with this movie that put any effort into establishing credibility.The hospital in this movie, does not exist. Ability to pay isn't even a consideration in determining the recipient of an organ. Our healthcare system is far from perfect, but it has no similarities to the one featured is this movie. No hospital in this country would treat anyone in need of care this way. I find it difficult to believe that artist of this caliper, would associate themselves with such a movie.That's all I have to say about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very long political commercial based on questionable assumptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is essentially a long political commercial for national health care. If you are looking for a good entertaining movie without a lot of political baggage, then you should be warned. The situation depicted is that of a man who can not afford a heart transplant for his son. In desperation he holds the hospital staff hostage until they agree to do the operation. Much is made, in the film, of the need for a national health care plan to avoid such situations. To my knowledge this situation has never occurred. There are several reasons why. The first is that doctors, in the main, are life savers and it is against their nature to refuse to save a life. One doctor might, but many others would step in to take his place. The second is that there is a Hippocratic oath which all doctors take. It commits them to saving lives. The oath does not have legal force, but it does have moral force and most doctors take it seriously. The third is that hospitals, like any other support institution, need to have a good community reputation in order to continue to function. A situation would give a hospital a very bad name in the community, causing all kinds of problems with funding, attracting staff and patients. In the unlikely event that this situation would happen in a hospital, another hospital would quickly offer to do the service.That aside, there are reasons to like this movie. Denzel Washington, as always, gives a great performance. Other cast members also do a stellar job. If you like to have your heart strings tugged, this film does it in spades. But emotion is often used to push a political message, without having to resort to actual fact or reason. It is a type of manipulation that we see far too often, today, in Hollywood. Viewers should be warned that this is that type of film.So if you decide to see it, enjoy the emotion and acting, but when it comes to the political question, as always, don't decide on an emotional appeal. Don't blindly follow the ideas of anyone. Do your own research and make up your own mind after examining the facts from both sides. The political slant got too much in the way of the other good qualities of the film for me, but it may not bother you. Without the politics I would have given it a 7.</fullReview>

Not only did this movie fail to reach me, I found myself laughing through the most dramatic scenes.

		<fullReview>If you liked this movie, or God forbid, you actually consider it good, I question your sanity. John Q makes Pearl Harbor seem subtle in it's emotional manipulation.Even though Denzel is one of my favorite actors, I took the critics word for it and avoided this film until curiosity (and my girlfriend --Hi Robbie!) got the best of me. Horrible. Contrived. Manipulative. Improbable. Impausible. Impossible. Ridiculous. Stupid. Silly. Overblown. And on and on. Any of these words and many more would aptly describe this production. What was Denzel thinking? Even he could not transcend this material.I loved the sterotypical cast of hostages. Always a colorful lot, they are. Think Speed or The Negotiator. Ethan Suplee as the fat security guard and Shawn Hatosy as the wife beater will not be forgotten come award season. Then, there was the wacky black supporting character (Eddie Griffin). I loved the sterotypical child who is always infinitely more intellegent and mature than someone of that age really is. I loved the stereotypical wife who just cries and can't seem to think rationally. And then, there was the hardened veteran negotiator (Duvall) who thinks HE'S the one who has the approach to handling the criminal (he's a true friend). Then, there's the comical police chief (Ray Liotta) who has to make the negotiator's job twice as hard because he is unable to just let him do his job (taken straight from the Negotiator). And James Woods as the cardiologist acts like he hasn't performed an operation in twenty years. But at such a small hospital with such a limited staff, who does perform operations, I wonder? Oh yeah, it's Saturday. I forgot.Then, at the film's core, is the utter ridiculousness of a kindly lone gunman being able to take over (and secure) an entire hospital wing. It's not going to happen.SPOILERSI liked how the film showed the woman's accident at the beginning. Showing the accident at the time it was needed or not even showing it and just bringing in the heart out of the blue would have been too obvious. However, the small bit of intelligence that went into that bit of script seemed out of place with the rest of the film.Of course, John Q saves the day and the kid lives. What did you expect, reality? And, of course, the film makes the sterotypical attempt at the end (A Few Good Men) to not let the hero/criminal get off scott free. What was Robert Duvall, the negotiator, doing escorting Q to and from court, anyway? I doubt that's part of his job description.There is a lot more to dissect and tear up about this film, but there's only so much time in the day. Check it out if you feel like groaning for two hours."D-"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only write comments when a movie is really bad, much like John Q. I was staring in disbelief at how cliche the dialogue, lines, acting, and pretty much everything else in the movie was. Considering the ammount of talent in the movie, I was surprised by how predicatable and awkward the whole thing felt.If you watch the DVD, watch the documentary on the health care system that is on there- it's about 100 times more interesting and compelling than the film.1 out of 10, no doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dog Day Afternoon in a hospital</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has you from beginning to end, well acted by everything, little or big a role. If one film has really taken a bad rap, it would be this one, where to be honest, I found myself questioning why in an enigmatic way like if by the big Q in the film's title. It has everything going for it, and an all too real situation, I guess many people in hardship, will painfully relate to. It's the story of a good man, John Q (Washington) forced to take it upon himself, to go outside the law, to save his son, by any means possible. Washington, in a real human and believable performance, who doesn't overact, can't come up with the mooloh, to get his son on the waiting list for a new donor, where time is very short. When coming up again many brick walls, where to me, this reality was frightening, he ends up taking over the hospital, forcing the doctors to perform an operation, otherwise he'll start taking casualties. I must admit, I really love this film, the different setting on a hostage scenario, I liked very much. Ann Heche, an actress who can really surprise you, is quite a standout here as the hospital's money grabbing governor who's not willing to take John's word, that he'll reimburse her with the money. Let's face it, if everyone did that, there's no guarantee everybody would pay. It was just Heche's lack of compassion to her character at the start, which I must admit, I really didn't like. Woods as a top surgeon siding with Heche, kind of had the same affect, and my opinion of his character, finely played by the great actor, didn't really improve, except for up near the end, with John making one crazy decision, to end one life to save another. I hadn't seen a film, I enjoyed so much as this for a while, where it was richly entertaining, with even a believable ending, though the script wasn't the best, and a little ordinary at times, but this is one of those films you must see, and rule out the bad hype beforehand. The race against time climax was quite gripping for those few minutes, and the last father and son chat, an endearing, moving, and unforgettable scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has two purposes, to entertain and to enlighten. It does both.When I started this movie up I felt bad for the title character, John, because money problems are something that are easy to relate to and this is exactly what happened with me. This movie was filled with love, hate, greed, politics, money and other high profile topics that are often the center of true events and molds them together to create a truly passionate and beautiful film.This film enlightens the viewers to the true misfortune of most of Americas residents, health isn't a right for most in the country that don't have the cash for care, it points out the flaws and shows the true extent people in real life could go to for a dying family member or close loved one.This film is a great movie and one that I rate very highly, completely excellent.</fullReview>

If it were completely accurate, I'm pretty sure everyone would be drooling from napping because the movie would be so boring. This has the perfect amount of drama, excitement, comedy, and everything in between! I think people just need to sit down and relax while watching this movie, because if you're going to pick at every detail you are not going to have a good time watching it.

		<fullReview>John Q - Started off just like one of your average Denzel films, but to be fair, I'm a huge fan so this wasn't a problem.He plays an out of luck father who's son suddenly develops a terminal condition and he only has months to watch him die.Himself and his family and the community go through hell and back to try and save his life. This fighting takes a turn for the worse, or better depending on your view on the situation. He takes matters into his own hands and accidentally gets the whole city behind him. If you haven't seen it, I can't tell you the whole picture or it'll spoil it.To recap, it's one of the best movies I've seen and even had me stopping the tears at one point.

		<fullReview>This is a movie that draws out the phrase, "desperate times call for desperate measures." Washington plays a guy whose son collapses during a little game of a heart condition and needs a serious operation and, when his insurance won't cover it, takes everyone in the emergency room hostage till he can work something out. Robert Duvall plays the hostage negotiator. They work beautifully together. The kid was good in it too. I think this was a good movie, and Washington was terrific, as always. My favorite line:when asked if anyone is hurt, Washington says, "It's an emergency room. They're all hurt." The cast works well together, and it builds up steam &amp; suspense well.

The way Denzel Washington acts (Especially the "last talk" with his son) is incredible, the best performance I have ever seen! The movie to me shows how strong a band between a father and a son should be. A father who is willing to do anything for his son! Simply amazing. The way how everyone turns to support him, even the hostages, makes the faith in humanity restored (altough it is a movie)I can't understand why this movie only has a 6.8 in the ratings. in my opinion this is the most underrated movie ever!My favorite quote in the movie was "I AM NOT GOING TO BURRY MY SON, MY SON IS GOING TO BURRY ME!!!".

		<fullReview>I Have to admit i really enjoyed this movie.I haven't seen a movie with a good story line like this come around in a while. John Q is a father who was at his sons baseball game when his son collapsed on the base path. When taking him to the hospital they find that there son has a heart that is three times the size of a normal nine year old heart. His son needs a heart transplant. When checking up John finds that his insurance does not cover his sons operation. He doesn't have a high paying job so he can not afford the operation and he cant raise enough money in the time given. He decides he needs to do something. He grabs his gun and he holds everyone hostage in the emergency room while barring off the doors and turning off the power to the elevator. He tells the women in charge of the hospital his son needs a heart and she will get him one or he will start killing people in the room. This goes on for awhile. You witness a car crash and learn that the women who died in the car crash had the perfect heart for John's son. His son will eventually get that heart.Infrequent language.Only Gore is when John is shot,his sons operation,and a mans hand in the waiting room is very bloody.As the movie is based on the premise of a man holding up an emergency room in a desperate attempt to save his son, the movie is intense and has intense thematic elements.Would not recommend for younger viewers.</fullReview>

Denzel's son needs a heart transplant and has lost his heath insurance, so takes the law into his own hands to save his son. One of the highlights of this movie is the always enjoyable Eddie Griffen as one of the hostages. Griifen is not his usual slapstick self in this movie, but just funny enough that the movie stays serious without being depressing. Very much worth the time, but very emotional.

HELLO!!!!!!! PEOPLE ARE SICK THEY NEED HELP, NOT INSURANCE COVERAGE WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT!!!. But the movie could've been overall better than what it is.

		<fullReview>John Q is a great movie that has many strong dramatic performances, led by Denzel Washington. Though this is not the only powerful movie he has made, this indeed is one of his best. The movie begins with a scare, as John's (Washington's) son needs a hard transplant, and his insurance doesn't cover it. Although he tries to save enough money to pay for the transplant, the cost is too much. So John decides to take matters into his own hands by shutting down a part of the hospital and holding the people there at gunpoint, demanding his son have the transplant. A bit of a stupid move, but as the movie progresses, we see it wasn't such a bad move at all. Overall this movie gets an 8, a solid film for Denzel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's the health care system, stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, whoever judges this movie by standard criteria misses the point entirely. John Q was made to open people's eyes to the misery that is the US Health Care System, a shame on any industrial nation, and possibly the most urgent tragedy of the U.S. . Here in Chile, 17 years of neo-liberal dictatorship left a similar system that leaves 80 percent of the population with no decent health care and money as the main factor of your health options. While the US is spending billions of dollars on getting distant countries to submit, millions of US-citizens are excluded from basic health services. On the other hand, countries such as Sweden show that the "SICK - HELP" solidarity principle propagated by John Q is a workable option.Although the movie suffers from many cliches and the story is only so-so, the message it sends makes it far too important and relevant to be ignored.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controversial...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although 'John Q' is quite frequently shown as a thriller or suspense movie on digital cable genre channels, it is really a political flick for all intents and purposes. The criticism expressed towards this movie on the part of some is missing the entire point however, and that is the fundamental weakness of the so-called U.S. health care system. A system that sees more than 40 million people without health insurance, and a great deal many more with insufficient coverage for such procedures as heart transplants. We don't hear of people going out and hijacking emergency rooms every day of course, but we do hear stories of families forced to sell practically everything they own in order to cover hospital costs for unforseen catastrophic events. A system driven purely by profit without regard for human compassion is a system badly in need of reform and this movie does a good job of bringing the spotlight on one of the most controversial issues facing the American public and politicians today.**** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not all that often that I see a movie that takes such an overt socio-political stance on a topic and then uses much of itself to preach to the audience. But, John Q does just that. It takes a clear position on the U.S. healthcare system, and then it openly preaches against it. In fact, it comes complete with news clips from real-life political activists weaved into the end of the movie. So, this movie does not try to pretend. It is as much of a commentary as it is a movie.I won't comment on the political aspects of the film, but the movie itself was fairly average. It was melodramatic, sappy at times and fairly predictable. It was definitely not any of these actors best performances, but this was not a movie about performances. It was primarily meant to deliver a message not to entertain. Since I normally go to see films to be entertained this movie was disappointing. So, I would only recommend this film if you want to get insight into the issues that poor people face with healthcare, although CNN, MSNBC and Dateline might be better options. 6/10 stars.-- DP.</fullReview>

I don't feel the need to recap the ENTIRE storyline as somereviewers do, I just want to give everyone my OPINION. So... As a teenage girl, I admit that I may have been slightly moresentimental about some of the issues presented in this film. Butthe issues are important nonetheless. John Q shows the viewerinstitutions(i.e. hospitals, schools) that are supposed to providehelp to whomever needs it, but don't. This may be for a number ofreasons: bureaucratic hang-ups, money, lack of resources,money, and money. John Q attempts to tell the average Americanmovie-goer (who typically spends from $8 to $10 dollars on aticket, btw) that something terrible COULD happen to them. Sowhat are you going to do about it if you don't have the money? Because, in America, that's what it's all about, right? It makes us think. So what if the plotline isn't "realistic" enough? So what if the dialogue doesn't have the perception and wit ofDickens or Austen? Normal people don't talk like that. So what ifthe movie didn't portray medical procedures perfectly? (If I want toknow exactly how a transplant is done, I'll visit a cardiologist at thehospital. That's not the movie's goal.) This movie is about thepeople: their feelings, their struggles against the money-guzzlingHMO's, etc(Think I'm biased?) Just watch John Q, cry a little, and think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Minor spoilers ahead)Denzel Washington is a fine actor. Although it often seems he's playing himself, he's fortunate that he's a sufficiently interesting human being with enough dimension that even when he does that, he's fascinating.This movie has much to recommend it. Although the build-up to the blow-up takes a bit longer than seemed necessary, once the crisis point is reached, the pace is brilliantly done. The predicament in which he finds himself is all too believable in an era of corporate greed run rampant, and his rage is clearly and cleanly focused. The emotional roller-coaster that follows his rash decision to hold the hospital hostage is powerful and compelling.The emotional scenes as the movie nears its denouement are achingly good. When he makes the ultimate decision, then fails to execute it on the first try, any viewer not on the edge of his or her seat is probably already dead.About the only criticisms I have of this movie are the implausibility of one man holding a hospital hostage as he does and the acting of Kimberley Elise as John Q's wife. The supporting cast as a whole is above average and Robert Duvall is just short of brilliant in what could have been a pretty mediocre role.A definitely good flick that will make you think a *little* but mostly just provide intriguing action as a diversion.</fullReview>

At every turn it contradicts itself including theironic plea made by one doctor not to take the child to the countyhospital (ie. government run hospital) because a heart transplantwould be considered elective surgery there. At the end of the moviethere is a media montage with Hillary Clinton promoting herprogram which would essentially make all hospitals governmentrun hospitals....

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert! As John sat in the stands of his son's baseball game, he thought that it was going to be a typical game day. As Michael walked to the plate, the crowd cheered for him. He struggles with the first few pitches, but finally gets a hit. Michael takes off with good speed rounding first base. As he heads toward second, something terrible happens. He collapses and falls to the ground. John, Michael's father, quickly rushes him to the hospital. After intense examination, John is told that his son has a rare type of heart failure and will not survive without a transplant. John Q is a film about how a desperate father must take the law into his own hands to save his son's life.John, played by Denzel Washington, is informed that his insurance will not cover an operation of that magnitude. John and his wife Denise must pay for this operation out of their own pocket. The operation could cost up to $250,000. John does everything that seems possible to raise the money. He goes to the church, sells his belongings, and even starts working two jobs. John and Denise go to the hospital with what little money they have raised and beg the doctors to do the transplant. However, the HMO people still refuse to let the doctors perform the transplant. While all of this is going on, Michael is closer and closer to death. When it seems that Michael has only a few hours left, John makes a command decision. John screams, `I am not going to bury my son,' as he takes the ER hostage. He refuses to release anyone and will even start to kill hostages until the doctors agree to do Michael's transplant.Nick Cassavetes, the director, sends out a very strong message through this film. He shows how people must do the wrong thing in order to have the right outcome. Cassavetes shows how people must take the law into their own hands when it seems like there is no other option left. Cassavetes wanted his audience to see that institutions do not always put the patient's best interest at hand. Therefore, people like John have to take the law into their own hands when it seems like there is no other option left.The film had a number of things that I enjoyed about it and a few things that I did not. I liked how it depicted the inside of the hospital. The hospital always seemed very dark and dreary, which set the right mood and added more drama to the scene. I liked the costumes that they picked for John Q and his family. The costume designer did an excellent job displaying that they were just normal people. However, I did not like the music. I thought the music was a little dramatic and added too much drama to parts of the film that did not need it. John Q is an excellent film which touches many people on an emotional level. The film is a perfect example of modern day problems and what people must do to overcome their problems. John Q is a film that is easy for most people to relate to and leaves the viewer asking themselves if they would do the same thing John Quincy did. I know I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a great demonstration about how the health care system inthis country sucks and people have to fight for it! Denzel Washington does what he does best as John Q. Archibald, only this time his fight is not with racism. John is poor but he is happily married to Denise(Kimberly Elise) and has raised a good son, Mike(very well played by ten-year-old Daniel E. Smith). But when it turns out Mike needs a hearttransplant within a few days or else he will die, John holds several hostages captive and says that he'll let them go when hospital director Rebecca Payne(Anne Heche), puts Mike on the list for a transplant. While also he must face Police Lieutenant Frank Grimes(Robert Duvall).I think James Woods gives the Best performance in the film, as cardiologist, Raymond Turner, who is one of John's hostages. Some people might not be so moved by it because the love between a father and a son that is shown in the film is a very common thing. But what is extremely moving about the film is John's courage. At one point John almost sacrafices his life.See this film. 10/10</fullReview>

I was glad I ended up watching this, I really felt what this film was trying to get across about the health insurance system and about value of human life here. When I watched the Denzel interview about this, the question "what if it were your son that had to go through this, what would you do?" is what this film is trying to get across. Indeed it is a very depressing film too, A church-going family that goes from having their car impounded, to the father having to search for 2 jobs to get the car back and finally, his son needs a heart transplant and finds out his insurance can't cover heart surgery. His son is in ICU with a failing heart and it gets more and more depressing hearing that f*#king machine beep as that indicates dropping of blood pressure, John turns to everywhere for help even trying to raise the money for the heart surgery but when he finds out that the hospital is releasing his son from ICU, he realizes he has no choice but to take matters in to his own hands. Well, Denzel pulls this off well as the father role and Kimberly Elise becomes depressing to look at(which is good) gladly in the midst of all the sad stuff, there is comic relief in this specifically from Eddie Griffin and one particular scene that stands out involving Shawn Hatosy's character, Mitch and Heather Wahlquist's character, Julie - this part was absolutely hilarious!-Not bad, this was pretty good...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of your times. He just assumes the characters he plays to the point where you could care less if the movie sucks or not. This movie was great though, don't get me wrong. Just complimenting the guy. John Q is about a man who's left with no choice when his son's life is in danger and in need of a new heart. With no help from the hospital to try and pay for the surgery and not enough on his own, he takes matters into his own hands and holds up the emergency room. The film made you wonder what you would do in that same situation. I discussed the film in a psych class one year and the philosophy of helping your fellow man or allowing the strong to survive. There are 3 men starving and you have 3 potatoes. Easy enough to give each one, but what if one needs it more? Do you cut down the others to help him survive? It was a comment on American society to me saying that it may not always be the best thing to have individualist beliefs and shun your neighbor. A wonderful movie about doing what you feel is right to help your child survive no matter what it may cost for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You people are absolutely nuts. I am totally convinced that you are never happy with any of the films that anyone turns out. The only way to get new characters in these movies is to get a alien from out of space to speak the lines in a movie and then maybe you would be happy with the NEW CREATED CHARACTER.This movie was great. Everyone know's what the HMO's have done to this country. This guy just snapped. After selling all of his belongings and his transportation to get anywhere, raising money here and there and borrowing - and then to pay the hospital $22,000 - they were going to discharge his son - out on the street - with a bad heart. That just bites the big one. It takes balls of nerve to through out a sick and dying human being.The ending - was a little upsetting. I didn't think he should of went to jail for kidnapping.</fullReview>

It was a very good movie that brought out alot of different feelings in a person watching it.

		<fullReview>An outstanding cast delivering outstanding performances. Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall, James Woods, Anne Heche and, child actor, Daniel E. Smith provide a formidable base for a cast that has no weak links. The lesser roles filled by people like Ray Liotta and Shawn Hatosy are right on the mark.Even the educational dialogue on the shortcomings of our health care system worked (for the most part). The only place it faltered was the occasional slip across the thin line between emotionalism and sappiness. There was also a somewhat muddled message about the morality of John Q's actions. He was motivated by a good cause and he and his family have been severely wronged . . . but his actions put others at risk; that was wrong and leads to consequences that must be faced. That doesn't mean that he had any other choice or that the end result wasn't positive. Washington is truly one of the great actors working today and movies like this and 'Training Day' are providing vehicles for him to prove it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, a fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can't help feeling that a lot of the negative reviews of this movie have been sponsored by the HMOs or others with a vested interest in the current healthcare system. One can pick small holes in the movie -- for example, Liotta's play-it-for-the-cameras police chief is hamfistedly stereotyped -- but overall this is a story that had to be told and is told well. The performances by Washington, Elise, Woods and Duvall are astonishing -- full of subtleties (that may be _too_ subtle for some viewers to catch) yet, in the case of Washington and one's tempted to say particularly in the case of Elise, also full of power. If you honestly think the healthcare system in this country is perfect you'll hate this movie, because it'll rattle your convictions. Anyone else will be given much food for thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A credible premise, invalidated by many preposterous moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mentioned in a review of "Training Day" that Denzel Washington's appearance in a film can almost make a bad film better than what it really is. "John Q" is a great example of that. Despite Washington and a very strong supporting cast, they can't save this disappointing, overly manipulative drama about an under-insured father whose son desperately needs a heart transplant. Out of desperation, he finds it necessary to hold the hospital, it's emergency room and the people in the ER area hostage. I suspect that the screenplay (by James Kearns) has been revised to the point where the actions of the main and supporting characters are very suspect. I also believe the denouement was compromised for the sake of feeling oh-so-sorry for the main character and the situation he put himself in. Those decisions dumbed down the drama and I found it to be insulting. There were more scenes that rang false which ultimately sunk "John Q".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an entertaining action-thriller. It's done in very rough archetypes, thin cardboard characters and painfully obvious manipulations, all exposed plainly for us to enjoy ...I believe the starting point must have been: terrorism is not popular in USA right now. But let's make up a situation where they will have all sympathy with a person that takes hostages and threatens to kill them. What do we have to dig up from the *american values* to get away with that?And the movie delivers, all the way from that starting point and on to the sentimental end. People do love the terrorist.For all of us non-us people, this movie is a great and horrible lesson. It's a journey into a truly alien mindset. It must surely have been produced with a grim ironic smile. The moral is that there is a point where terrorism is ok. It's when the plain guy only has two options left: be a political animal or use the gun.</fullReview>

Denzel Washington stars as John Quincy Archibald, an uninsured man with a wife and one son. When his son collapses during a baseball game, John and his wife learn that their only child Mike will need a heart transplant. Without enough health insurance or money to pay for the operation, it seems that they are out of options. The rest of the movie will keep you at the edge of your seat, when John takes an ER hostage in a race against time to save his son's life.Starring Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall, James Woods, Kimberly Elise, Anne Heche, Eddie Griffin, Shawn Hatosy, David Thorton, Kevin Connolly, Paul Johansson, Daniel E. Smith, and Ray Liotta as Chief Monroe. 3 out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching this movie on Showtime, I checked the rating. It was decent at 6.4. I then read the reviews, and I was shocked to hear so many bad comments, but in the end I watched it because theirs very few better than Denzel Washington. So I watched it, and BY GOD I don't regret it.I don't know about you, but I think too many people here on IMDb are too picky, and too strict when it comes to reviews. But that's just my opinion. This movie has a great script, great actors (Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, etc) and I thought it was directed very well. The movie really brought out the sensitive side in me. Tears of sadness and happiness. I really connected to this movie as I live in a poor family, and we struggle for things, and much like John Q, I feel like this Country is so messed up, I just wan't to really take things into my own hands. So, ok .. this movie is superb, I highly suggest it, as it receives a very solid 9/10 from myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining despite its flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was caught up in this movie from the very beginning, and it didn't let go. I can't say I was disappointed in the least, despite a few problems.One of this movies faults is the long list of stereotypical characters: Robert Duvall as the over-the-hill cop who knows how to do his job so well he ends up going head-to-head with the stereotypical politics-are-everything police chief played by Ray Liotta, for example. Many of the minor characters suffer from the stereotype bug, as well--but the kicker is, while I was watching the film, the only one that really stood out was the plastic news reporter. The guy was way overdone--typed to death, as it were. It took me several hours to realize that so many other cookie-cutter characters were involved in the story, because the story gripped me that tightly.There are plot holes, but most of them are easily explained away, if you want to take the time. What matters most about this film are its good points: 1) Denzel Washington is brilliant. Purely brilliant. He consistently makes me believe that his character exists, and John Q. is no exception.2) The "Everyman-left-in-a-lurch-by-a-system-that-doesn't-care" situation is terribly formulaic, but it's also a formula that WORKS. Even if Denzel Washington wasn't superb, it would be easy to sympathize with his character just because he's getting screwed and choking to death on red tape. 3) The way tension is built is incredibly well done--there are some moments when you're wondering not what's going to happen (formula is formula, after all) but how the story is going to get past the current obstacle and get us to where we know it's going. The SWAT sniper sequence is one such example of the director knowing his craft and knowing just how much to give us--it's drawn out, but not for too long, before the situation breaks and we get our relief. I can't say John Q. is flawless. It has moments that seem a bit contrived, and at times might leave some viewers wondering "how did that happen" (one example, which I've seen pointed out here, is the hostages' "turning". To some it seemed sudden and unexplained, but the scenes where the hostages were watching the situation on live TV explained it all to me).What I can say about "John Q." is this: if you want to see Denzel Washington doing what he does best, and if you've ever felt that the system gave you a raw deal, this picture is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel is superb ..... but that's about it ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched John Q last night and to be honest I didn't expect too much from it. All the reviews of it were bad when it was released in the cinema but I always like to judge a film on my own merits as opposed to listening to overweight / overrated / overpaid film critics. John Q is about a man's wish to protect and provide for his family. His son gets very sick and is in dire need of a heart transplant which he cannot afford as his insurance company has reneged on him and left him with the expense of coming up with 250000 dollars to pay for the operation.Denzel Washington is a fine actor and I have admired him for many years and once again he does a tremendous job here. The scenes in which he shows emotion and cries over the plight of himself and his dying son are inspirational and a credit to his acting ability.Some of the plot twists are a tad unusual to say the least - it just doesn't make sense for him to create a lockdown situation in an emergency unit of a hospital / The coldness of the hospital administrator when delivering the news that they could leave their only son to die does not ring true either / and the corny police chief and old-man hostage negogiator and wooden-good-looking newscaster with his obligitory computer genius on tow.The only saving grace in this film in Washington himself. Every time he is on screen - he gets the audience to believe in what he is saying and doing. the sheer lunacy of the crowded streets cheering on the hostage taker and inside footage been beamed across the world is scary in such a news driven society as we have today but nonetheless expected.Denzel on top form (again) and John Q is a very enjoyable movie whereby you don't have to think too hard but just sit back and enjoy the story and will it to its (inevitable) happy ending. It's not a spoiler to say that as you will twig from the very first scene what will happen later on in the movie.Go rent it .... I know I've spent money on a lot of worse movies than this one.</fullReview>

I dont think you can get a bad movie with actors like Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall, James Woods, Anne Heche and Ray Liotta.The story isnt too complex a boy needs a major heart transplant to live. The parents cant pay and the insurance wont cover the $250, 000 cost, what is a father to do, I know hold up the hospital. As its tagline goes 'Give a father no options and you leave him no choice'Overall this movie will make you laugh, cry and sit on the edge of your seat.

Writing was really creative, with natural, believable dialog. Theologically, really profound -&gt; "Does God kill someone to save another? Why?" "Is it okay to supplement faith with action - illegal action - for a noble cause?" "Does not hurting anyone or intending to hurt anyone make breaking the law okay - sometimes the better option?" Not that these questions are answered conclusively, but the movie really makes the audience think about some moral and eternal issues. Provocative, well-made film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film which intends to alert us all of the evils of healthcare by HMO, and the title "John Q." is a metaphor for all of us, as in "john q. public." The lead character, played by Denzel, is John Q. Ampersand. He, his wife, their 9-year-old son have a home, a car, and live a fairly normal life. Until young son collapses while running from first to second in a Little League game. Enlarged heart, needs a transplant or die, medical insurance just won't begin to cover it, and the hospital needs to make money, after all.SPOILERS - Encountering a brick wall at every turn, and not wanting his son to die ("He's a good kid, funny, you'd like him, Doc."), John Q. goes to the hospital with a gun and takes them hostage until they promise to put his son on the transplant list. (Police Chief, on the phone to John Q., "Is anyone hurt? Yes, everyone is hurt, this is an emergency room.") Finally, a woman killed in an automobile/truck accident which begins the film is a tissue match and the boy gets her heart. Right before John Q. was going to kill himself to give the boy his heart.While I didn't exactly dislike this film, it never seemed to have the correct "tone", is the best way I can put it. Sometimes it went for humor, sometimes drama, tried to tug at the heartstrings, spent a lot of time denouncing the medical insurance systems, especially HMOs which, they say "pay doctors extra for NOT running tests on patients." But it never did seem authentic. It plays like an hour-long episode of a TV show, stretched to almost 2 hours by having Denzel talk slowly to his son, and stretch his pauses.In two successive nights I have watched films about a black man, scraping out a living, and trying to keep his wife and sons "whole." The other one, "Changing Lanes" with Sam Jackson, is a much better film. Sam Jackson is a much better actor than Denzel Washington. But Denzel is a pretty face, so he gets most of the attention. While he is good, he is no match for Jackson.For those who identify with the healthcare and health insurance crisis, the DVD has a very thorough "extra" with experts in the field discussing the topic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Here we go...": Washington drives an entertaining political movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score (cumulative average of various cinematic qualities):8.5 (out of 10)"John Q" is first and foremost a Hollywood political movie. So you'd expect to get a few scenes that feel like their out of a junior high school government video where the action stops so the characters can sit around and debate a current event issue. What I didn't expect was just how slick and entertaining this movie was (far more entertaining than...say, the drug war essay "Traffic"). The debate scenes and the entire set up are purely for the purposes of making a political statement about the state of HMOs, insurance monopolies and healthcare on blue-collar working stiff families. And what better way to raise these issues than in a mainstream forum like the local30 screen Cineplex? Maybe not, but maybe so. Even thought the movie is occasionally unbelievable, I think the writers can call it a victory if the film, in the least, promotes discussion. Seems a little preachy at times, but sometimes you have to beat people over the head with things like this. One of the best scenes in the movie is also one of the most contrived and absurd- watching Kevin Connolly from "Unhappily Ever After" debating James Woods over HMO scams.So Denzel Washington's cute little kid needs a transplant to save his life. Not a lung, or a kidney, but a heart- that means before it's all over somebody has to die so he can live. Poor Denzel's company has switched medical coverage to an HMO and he runs around town trying to raise the money. When the hospital refuses to help, he whips out a gun and turns his ball cap around and takes the ER hostage. Naturally, the place is lined with the type of colorful characters you might find in an ER- the gangbanger, the heartless surgeon, the pregnant wife and nervous husband, the girl-beater and his bimbo. Surprisingly, these characters don't come off as clichés. The action that's going on inside the ER is far more interesting than the standard hostage negotiation scenes outside. In these Robert Duvall clashes with gung-ho if-I-get-a-clean-shot-I'm-taking-it police chief Ray Liotta. There's a sneak attack scene in here very kin to "The Negotiator". Then there's Anne Heche- even though she's nuts, she's still one of my favorite underrated actresses.It's a standard story told well, slickly photographed, intelligently written and acted to tug at the heart strings. It is occasionally corny, but not often. Cassavettes mixes suspense into the drama very well- the third act is a nail-bitter. Finally, my biggest problem with the film: we really need to declare a moratorium on clips from Jay Leno monologues showing up in movies. Every time a movie like this does a media montage, there's Leno telling some lame joke about it.</fullReview>

For example, at the end when John Q is being driven to jail and the son is "posing" for him. Come on!The worst scene, in my opinion, is when John Q tries to shoot himself and the gun just clicks because the safety is on. Give me a break.Also, the whole scene where the heart arrives in the nick of time could be seen coming a mile away.All in all, this movie is OK, but it is not an oscar caliber movie, or performance, by any stretch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington will definitely win the Oscar again with this role. He captures the average man without flaw. And this is the average man. This film does not candy coat reality at all. Anyone with a heart will be moved to tears with this film. It is one of those films that doesn't hold back any punches, so be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions.Kimberly Elise also gives an Oscar worthy performance, so look for her name on the ballot as well. I am so glad that I hadn't heard any spoilers , and I will not give any here. If you see a commercial for it on TV or if you hear people talking about it, just dont listen. You really need to experience this film without knowing what will happen next. This film does one of the best jobs in making the viewer bite nails and shuffle in your seat. You really dont know what's about to happen. So don't listen to the spoilers. Anne Heches role will make you very angry. James Woods could be best supporting material here as well. And everybody loves to hate Ray Liotta. This film will make you question your morals and ethics and it will show you desperation in it's realest form. Everyone can relate to this film and everyone would agree with the actions taken. That is the scary part. This film will not only pull at your strings while you are watching it , but it will make you sad and angry far after the credits have rolled. So keep the tissues and Xanax handy for this film. This is far more than just a movie, it is a political statement. This is one of the best films that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i rented john q late one saturday night when i was bored. it turned out to be an ok kinda movie. washington was great as ussual. i mean really people, the guy is great. the movie has a lot of holes in it though. reality is well, reality and john q was fiction and hollywood at its best. a couple of scenes reminded me of dog day afternoon and the messege of this movie is already well know in our community's . if your poor, your dead. right at this moment as i write down here in louisiana the gov. has opted to cut healthcare just to save face by keeping a pro football team. what comes first, the ball or the heart........now thats the age old question people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS: This is an easy film to watch and become involved in, especially given the plot: an individual life in jeopardy at the risk of the insensitive medical insurance conglomerate. However, Denzel Washington's performance is enjoyable, as usual (thank God). But some of the supporting cast give us moments that don't seem quite to fit in. Kimberley Elise is somewhat uneven, for example. Her telephone demand of her husband to do something at one point in the film came unprepared, I thought. I didn't see the desperation that would have dictated that moment mounting in her. And the casting of Anne Heche was somewhat surprising. She comes across early in the film as the mean corporate machine and then suddenly relents. Why she relents is not altogether clear. James Woods is somehow strange in the beginning of the movie when he is confronted with telling a husband a wife that their child will surely die. But then later he puts in a top notch performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too heavy handed, but sometimes engaging. D.W. should've pulled the trigger. - 4 of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dan Smith (the son) was good, Denzel Washington was fine, but Kimberly Elise overacted terribly in this film. Robert Duvall seemed tired and I think Ray Liotta has much more talent than what he showed us here. I'm still not certain what to think of Anne Heche in this. I was fine in thinking that they were demonizing her as the heartless hospital administrator (though it was fairly awful) but she really fizzled in this one. The supporting cast in the emergency room was far better than the leads. That's just the acting. The story was way too heavy handed. I got the point very early on. Okay, so the film is a crusade piece. Fine. I'm alright with that, but then there is so much more that I just couldn't swallow with the story. Many of the scenes are engaging, but I found myself asking Denzel to pull the trigger on himself. I feel it would've been a better tragedy than crusade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie! It was very entertaining, moving and anyone can relate to the character of John Q and his wife in this movie. I loved how true to life so much of it was...eg. the 'red tape' it seems we all have to go through when we need immediate action on a serious problem, the runaround they were getting when trying to find out answers on insurance. This movie was great because I was sitting there thinking 'this could happen to anyone'. It takes you on a journey of this man and his desperation to fight for his son's life because no-one else who can help him (insurance companies, hospital) seems to care. Another thing great about this movie is they didn't leave any loose ends...everything that happened was believable. Usually I leave a movie thinking 'what about this' or 'why would that happen because of this'....but in John Q, they covered all their bases and everything was explained. I like to watch a movie for entertainment value...and this has tons of it. This movie was action packed and kept me interested from beginning to end.</fullReview>

Over 40 million Americans have no health insurance because either 1) they make too much money to qualify for medicaid and cant afford it on their own, or 2) their job doesn't provide it and they cant afford it on their own. If only Congress would address this problem by creating a National Health Insurance Program or requiring HMO's to pay for all medically necessary care, people wouldnt end up in John's situation.I don't blame John for what he did. He did what he had to do to save his son. Hopefully now the public will realize that we need to make sure everyone has adequate medical care, whether they can afford it or not.</fullReview>

Suppose you aren't rich enough and another man enter in the hospital after your kid and he is operated and saved only because he can "buy" it. The best of "John Q" are the questions the movie ask to us. Are the offer &amp; demand laws sacred laws? What kind of society does we want? Can be called democracy a political end economic system where the right to life is not the same one for riches and poors? The movie is an excuse for asking these questions. After it, you can ask if it is possible that a despairing father (Denzel Washington) can take over part of an hospital alone, if it is believable that all the hostages would help him, and what posibilities are of getting a "happy end". Happy end that, in Hollywood movies, is as sacred as capitalist market laws.Héctor. Buenos Aires. Argentina.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always approach a movie from the point of view of entertainment... not art. There is a great deal in this movie that is both inaccurate and unbelievable... but nonetheless I did find it entertaining. I must admit that without Denzel, it would have only been endurable. Approach the film from the point of view of what a man would do when he's placed in a position he does not want to be in and does not know how to control. Add to that that he's primarily there out of pressure from his wife who frequently looks at him as a failure, and you end up with an interesting role for Denzel. How he interacts with others is more of a story than why he is there. Don't get hung up on the message of the movie, which is presented with incredible bias, but rather tuck it in the back of your mind for future thought, letters to congressmen and a reminder to check your health insurance policy.</fullReview>

After the doctors observe his son it is discovered he has an irregular heart condition. Which requires a special surgery that is not covered by his company's insurance plan. So he must find a way to get his son the surgery. All and all it wasn't wonderful but it was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this movie will not make the American Film Institute Top 100 list, but it is damn fine entertainment. Even though any human being with an IQ over 20 will be able to figure out the ending to this flick, getting there is a thoroughly enjoyable journey. (In fact, I saw the trailer for John Q in a movie theater and the entire plot was revealed there. Someone really needs to tell the Hollywood marketing people that they are absolutely ruining the movie viewing experience for people by showing clips from all of the important scenes in the previews of coming attractions.) And while the movie is very entertaining, it also says a lot about the dismal state of the U.S. healthcare system which fails miserably to meet the needs of the poor and working poor. John Q is all about Denzel.... what more is there to say? In a familiar, comfortable role for him, he delivers the type of performance that keeps us paying to his films. Rounded out by solid performances from Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall, John Q is a great Saturday night rental.Claudia's Bottom Line: Fire up the Jiffy-Pop, pop open a can of Coke, pop in the video and enjoy a nice evening at home</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this delivers a good message to the world about health insurances and how much people need it. there should be more medical insurances in business so there are more chances to rely on help rather than have to struggle for your life when a fatal strike suddenly hits you, like john Q's son. It's also disturbing to hear howe much the transplant costs in the film and actually scares people to think about that in real life wiht no coverage at all. this was overall a good movie that i think should actually deliver a message to the world to bring more responsible coverage and the states to be more supportive if necessary. I was actually breathless and shaking when they told the archibalds the down payment of 75,000, now hardly anyone can ever get that type of money easily at all, unless they were rich and only 20% of the people around this world i say are rich, about 60% moderate, and 20% poor. I wanna say i liked the movie although cold in dealing wiht the situation and makes me think and wishing for more responsible insurance</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A morality tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an archetypal morality tale. The bad guys and the good guys are two-dimensional. The plot devolves from a young child urgently requiring a new heart, while the hospital and insurance authorities are heartless. Hospital administrator Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) gives a Cruela DeVil-lanous performance. The heart surgeon (James Woods) must have ice sludging through his veins.Denzel Washington (John Q. Archibald) is, good, so good it is hard to believe he could really snap to such a degree. Conversely, could those mavens of Mammon truly have such--pardon the expression--change of heart at story's end?The Archibalds are slowly losing their shirts, but even so, their lifestyle would look good to most Third World denizens. Indeed, however, events belie the apparent apple-pie order of their universe. In this Garden of Eden, there is a serpent called the HMO, and the hero has been poisoned by its fangs. The contrast between the gleaming hospital and its shabby, profit-oriented medical ethos is glaring.There is even a Greek chorus: onlookers outside the hospital cheer and boo as events dictate. But suspense remains high, and although we know we have been manipulated, it is in such a good cause that by movie's end we feel vindicated. We even feel like applauding. If only real life could be like that. Therein lies the value of the tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald, a man who earns $18,000 a year, whose son has to undergo a surgery which will cost $2,50,000. The movie is on very unstable ground because the story of John Q overcoming the hospital and insurance system to save his son is rather unconvincing. Directed by Nick Cassavettes, it would seem that this is a individual's attempt to influence public opinion, a bad one at that.Casting Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, Eddie Griffin isn't going to strengthen a movie without foundation. Eddie Griffin doesnt have any role to play in the movie and is totally wasted. Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall and James Woods turn in good performances but not good enough to turn the movie around.The movie is full of flaws. In fact, every movie has flaws and people do notice the flaws. But a good movie contains moments, scenes which take you away from the flaws and make you the see the beauty. This movie had no beauty, consequentially, the flaws were obvious.The movie states that over 7000 people die of diseases requiring major surgery for which they dont money and that over 45 million Americans are under insured. The movie also brings in footage of Hillary Clinton, Bill Maher pushing for better health care measures. The movie's attempt to convince you that if these needs are not taken care of every man will become a hero by taking a gun and holding people hostage in order to save his kith and kin is meek.Somewhere close the end John Q gets asked what he's waiting for, `I'm waiting on a miracle, waiting on an act of God.' Well the makers of John Q sure need a miracle if this one is going be make it big. It happened to John Q in the movie, I doubt it will happen to the movie itself.Oh and by the way, the movie isn't intended to be a comedy.</fullReview>

You didn't care about these people at all. Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall. They could have put more into their performances. And finally, it did get a tad preachy at times.

		<fullReview>This was a very solid film. It brought me to the verge of tears at many moments. Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald. His 9 year old son is diagnosed with heart failure, and unfortunately, John Q's insurance does not cover the operation. After failing to raise the money, John decides to try and take the law into his own hands. A very scary and emotional movie. I do not know what I would do if my son was diagnosed with heart failure, and needed a heart transplant. I would probably do the same thing if I lived in the United States. Thank God I live here in Canada where this type of operation would be covered by our medicare. This film shows exactly how corrupt the system is. Luckily, I do not, and hopefully will never, know exactly how the system down in the States works, but if this is basically true, I will stick with my Canadian citizenship.Overall, a very solid movie. Not really Oscar material for Denzel. However, James Woods does an excellent job (as usual) as John Q's sons doctor. He always plays a great prick in the movies.Very good film, I would highly recommend to anyone. It shows you just what true love for your children is, and how far someone would go to make sure they would live and not die. Too bad there are not more people in the world like John Q.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could i tell you about this movie (i'm a realy poor writer, so i'll do my best); i think it's one of the best movies of Denzel Washinton and one of top 10 movies i ever seen. The story is about a father and the decisions he has to make to save he's son's life. He takes hostage the emergency room of a state hospital and threatens with dead all the people in there. It's a werry emotive movie, fool of feelings that raise questions upon the morality and the justice of the laws and upon the justice of the world in general and if this movie didn't touch you'r heart you can just go (like all the loosers who gaved to this movie a pathetic vote). The way that Denzel acts is amazing, even better than the one in Trainig Day. It's pretty sure that John Q. will win at least one Oscar, for the leading role if not for something else too.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed John Q, but saw it at a "dollar theatre." I do not think I would have enjoyed it as much had I payed full price. The story is nice, touching, and there is some good acting, but the movie suffers from poor dialogue and bad music choices. I also was not impressed with the rather heavy-handed political message delivered at the end. Yes, we need to provide health care for the poor, but to show Hillary Clinton and lament the fact that we turned down her atrocious health care plan is too much. That weakens the end of the film and weakens what could have been a pure an emotional story. The movie flirts with making its characters one-dimensional, but avoids that at the end. Catch it on video, see it on TV, just know it is not the best film that any of these actors has appeared in.</fullReview>

But you can accept that Mr. Casavettes tries to accuse the treatment of the people in hospital to persons without money, homeless, etc. and going back to the screen D. W. plays his part of father beautifully in order to take the confidence of the audience. The rest of the cast is OK but the mother (K.E.) and the young boy surprises. The music and score are good and the rest of the technical part is OK too. But it can't reach to a good rating.

But you can accept that Mr. Casavettes tries to accuse the treatment of the people in hospital to persons without money, homeless, etc. and going back to the screen D. W. plays his part of father beautifully in order to take the confidence of the audience. The rest of the cast is OK but the mother (K.E.) and the young boy surprises. The music and score are good and the rest of the technical part is OK too. But it can't reach to a good rating. I can't understand the target and that's what the director, in his future films, should improve. My rating 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploring moral dilemmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I teach an undergraduate course in Child Development. During the course we look at children's moral development and particularly focus on the work of Kohlberg and his 'Heinz' dilemma. The dilemma concerns a man whose wife is ill and needs a particular drug to survive. The chemist who makes the drug is asking a price that Heinz cannot afford and so he breaks into the chemist's shop and steals the drug. Kohlberg determined children's level of moral development from the kind of answers they give to the question, "Was Heinz wrong to steal the drug." The youngest children usually say yes he was wrong - stealing is always wrong. As they get older they bring more factors into the equation and will often say that he was not wrong because human life is more important.At the heart of the movie 'John Q' is a very similar moral dilemma presented in a thoughtful and sympathetic way. I give this move 8/10 for its treatment of an issue that is well worth thinking about.BTW, on a 'Health and Community Psychology' course I also teach, most students see the US American health system as too deeply flawed to be a model other countries should adopt. The reasons why are also well set out in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is nice entertainment although it deals with a rather serious subject. It's not a very good movie, but I enjoyed it. I think the idea of a kidnapping with the target to get a heart for your son is not so realistic and a bit overdone. The story is very predictable, especialy during the part about the search for a heart. What a coincendence that just someone had a car accident with the same blood group as the son of John Q.......I like the acting of Robert Duvall and Denzel Washington but both played in much better movies!</fullReview>

But, after having had the "pleasure" of meeting the health care industry as a patient, I do understand this move all too well. I am lucky, I have the most excellent coverage available, so it didn't cost me much. Every American should see this movie and act. Is this really how you want the society to be?

While John Q is not as well put together, Denzel Washington stopped playing his soul brother routine and portrayed a man who felt lost in a world of red tape and greed. The everyday person will take this film for what it is, an epitet to the greedy and malicious HMO's which are supposedly the best alternative to full medical coverage. While the film sometimes comes off as a typical thriller, at least John Q experienced the consequences of real life as opposed to getting off scott free.</fullReview>

John is an ordinary man who works a full time job at a factory to support his family. His wife Denise and his son Michael mean the world to him he would give his own life before he lets someone take theirs.The problem all starts when they are at Michael?s ball game, he runs harder and harder trying to make a home run when he just drops to the ground in an instant. They rush him to a hospital, where they tell them that Michael has an over sized heart. They tell him his son needs heart a transplant. Michael?s mother and father are devastated, when they find out that their insurance policy has changed. Which no longer will cover things like a heart transplant.John q desperately tries to find money knowing that his son is going to die. They sell their truck, TV, fridge, etc. when he finally finds enough money it is too late and his son has been dismissed from the hospital. John takes another hospital hostage and his whole life beams down to this one little emergency room. {You will have to watch the movie for the rest}</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Duvall, you are indeed "overqualified" for this particular job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Duvall, you are indeed "overqualified" for this particular jobThings just aren't going well for mister John Q. Archibald. His wife's car has been repo'd, work is scarce, and his son may soon die from heart problems. John is even turned down for a second job and told he's "overqualified" for it.Well, the same thing could've been said to Robert Duvall, whose talents and strengths go far beyond those necessary for the watered-down, barely noticeable role that mainly provides a whipping boy for Ray Liotta's police chief. A flat and insignificant role, the type that can't possibly let any actor give a "great" performance in it. It's mind-boggling that several big names like Duvall were convinced to sign up for such a clumsy agitprop project. The guy has been doing films for decades and receiving all sorts of awards and acclaim. Shouldn't he be far away from trash pictures at this point?Also showing up to do very little are Anne Heche (check the cast list for her character's oh-so-subtle name), Liotta (resembling an angry Donnie Osmond who wishes to recreate the stupid captain from "Die Hard") and James Woods (a surgeon who, along with Heche, seems thrilled to tell the Archibalds that their son will die). Washington is mostly better than this material. At least his role of heroic John Q. Public --- excuse me, John Q. Archibald, is central enough to let him do something with it, whereas the script simply leaves Duvall stranded on the fringe. John's slack-jawed mannerisms can be trying, though, and his character's usual cutesy conventions of the noble pauper are tiresome (he goes to church with co-workers, cheers on his son at the ball game, plays wordgames with his family in the car, etc. And dig that picture of JFK hanging in his back hall!!!).Based on my own knowledge and experience, I am sympathetic to the filmmakers' political cause. It is partly because of this that I'm disappointed with what they have to offer to the issue.((spoilers ahead))There's no question that the film is melodramatic. It's the lifeblood of the movie. I fully expected the film to be at least somewhat melodramatic when I went to see it (a dying kid, his desperate parents, the hospital setting, and so forth)?but I didn't think so much of its very fabric would be composed of it. The camera-work and the performances in the film are so over-the-top and contrived that any Airplane-esque or SNL parody is redundant; the film has already done the work for them.Making room for the melodrama, I also expected the film to put forth at least some intelligent, considerate suggestions on what to do to improve US healthcare. But again, I found that I had been expecting too much. Though the film wishes to present a "serious" look at medical and political ethics, I don't think it took the situation far enough. Instead of pulling the conventional crowd-pleaser strings, the filmmakers could've done something really provocative. By the film's end, they could be seen as having copped-out. Their answers seem to be limited to some trite soundbites and clips of Hillary Clinton and Bill Maher demanding change, but the issues raised by these figures are never examined or debated in the in-depth manner needed for a film, book, or play to have a significant voice towards the issue. Nor is there anything witty and clever to be found here. I've already alluded to the name of Heche's character. And John's son Mikey represents another would-be artsy move. You see, Mikey is obsessed with bodybuilding, and decorates the walls of his room with old pictures of various strongmen. "Why would a kid have such a bizarre hobby?" you might ask. It's my theory that this was supposed to be a symbol; while Mikey wants to "build" his body, the mean IL' doctors are letting his body die and decompose.The solution to the central problem is a deus ex machina, literally. The only resolution offered in a prominent way is "Let go, and let God," as Eddie Griffin's character says --- the opposite of a call for true activism and political reform. The John Q character begins to reject this philosophy, but the film encourages it anyway with the lifesaving situation that magically evolves to save the cute child actor's life. Part of this "miracle" involves the car crash death of a woman, but since she's impatient and drives a BMW, she's not as worthwhile or "likable" as Mikey, is she? Just like the other rich twit who gets his transplant without a hitch --- a slick dandy straight from the country club. Chance (read divine intervention) also saves John from getting his head blown off at the end, though, frankly, I don't know how to go about describing this situation in this comment. It's that wacky. If you've seen the film, just think of the "We're going to need some towels" line, and you'll remember how sick that whole setup was. Couldn't they have at least put him to sleep or something?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey we already know that there are two classes of health care on the planet, one for the rich and one for the poor.Hey we already know that the fine print on insurance policies often takes advantage of the unwary and the less powerful.Hey we already know that justice depends as much as anything on how much money and power you wield. We don't need to be preached to in feature movies on such matters. We can take it as a given. John Q even has the characters stopping mid scene to deplore the unfairness of health care in the U.S.. Why not just make a documentary and be done with it! John Q has the feel of a made for T.V. mini series.John Q tells the story of a working poor family in the U.S. whose young son suddenly collapses during a little league baseball game. The boy is diagnosed as having a lousy heart, which needs to be replaced by means of a heart transplant. The boy will die within a few days, weeks or months without the transplant.Dad (Denzel Washington) and Mum (Kimberly Elise) agree to the operation but are then asked for their insurance details. Because Dad, also known as John Q., hasn't had much work lately his insurance cover has been demoted and they won't cover.The hospital, represented by Ms Payne (Anne Heche) won't offer any help and suggest that the boy be offered conditions to keep him as comfortable as possible until he dies.John Q. in desperation chains off the Emergency Room of the hospital and takes hostages, demanding that his son be put on the list for heart transplants.The police and the media become involved, There are some rather heavy handed attempts at satire involving a preening T.V. personality and believe it or not a police sniper. It's all rather heavy handed and awkward. Stay home and watch Oprah instead.One Hearty Fly Out Of Five</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes we spend too much time looking for analysing probabilities and possibilities. It bothers me a lot when I view the 70's Bond movies. If not for Moore, I would never watch them. Not that I don't want to have fun and laughter, but I was cursed with the knowledge of Ian Fleming novels and have devoured Connery's films. I am getting sidetracked here. I am talking about John Q, which was trashed by just about every critic in town.All I ask is lighten up and enjoy the show. It starts realistically enough, with a kid dying of heart problem and the parents trying to scramble enough money to pay for his transplant. Could be a TV movie with burnt out ex-soap drama actresses playing the dedicated mom. This is a feature film and it wants audience to pay for the ticket and get entertainment. That's where the gun comes in.OR else, how do you explain the presence of some of the great names in Hollywood, like Washington, Woods, Duvall and Liotta? The latter two gets to lock on power struggle, a cliché in any other 'hostage' movie, but they make it interesting and funny.Okay, the movie got a lot of tear-jerking scenes and it might get to you if you are not open minded. Put that aside, and move with the character. With Denzel's sympathetic character, you have the hospital people and some jerk-patient as bad guys to deal with. Hell, you can even relate to the expensive medical bulls*** and insurance policies that never come up to expectation. The healthcare issue has big impact on American audience, and I am sure just about every other middle class citizen around the world can relate to it too, me included.There is enough suspense and humour in this movie to keep you hooked. The performances alone worth the ticket. Good stuff, if you overlook the impossibilities and improbabilities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows how it is really wonderful to live in a capitalist country mainly if you have a serious illness. If this is not true the fault is the director's not mine because this movie proves it thoroughly. But the movie has a positive side because it shows also that mankind is not so bad after all. As a matter of fact we can witness a solidarity chain formed among the friends, neighbors and fellow-workers to help the father of the child who needs an urgent heart transplant and we can also witness the sympathy felt in the end by hostages held by him in a desperate attempt to overcome obstacles to that transplant that arise from the fact that he is a black worker who has no money to pay for it and the insurance company refuses to cover the necessary cost. This seems to confirm the statement according to which men are good and it's society which makes them bad. The story is told with very efficient images and plans and the atmosphere of tension reaches some unbearable stages sometimes. There r no untrue moments in it and everything is very realistic. It's one of the best movies of the year undoubtedly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every critic I have heard of have said terrible things about this movie.Well screw them. This movie is my 2nd favorite movie, it is Denzel's best movie. I have not seen many, except for Glory and Training Day.Glory was a very good movie and he definitely deserved the Oscar. Training Day was good, and he was good in it. However, It was not an oscar winning performance. I have heard people complain that he deserved it for the Hurricane, but did not get it. He was the wrong choice for a black actor. Will Smith definitely deserved it, for Ali which was the greatest movie in the world. But the academy did not even think about giving him the award because they suck.I think Denzel should be nominated at the 2003 awards and win a real oscar. For John Q, this was an award winning role, i know some people dont think so, but they did not see what I saw. I saw a great actor, playing an ordinary father who loved his son very much. He was willing to sacrifice himself to save his son. He broke all the rules to save him. That is an oscar winning role.</fullReview>

But let's get back to the movie and its errors.How is it possible that a professional sniperist misses a clear shot.This is the biggest mistake of this movie.They should erase that scene from the movie.Than the subject is pretty dangerous.Imagine how many people suffer from that and have no money for the surgery.So try to imagine what will happen if they all kidnap doctors and use them as hostages for they personal interests. What I'm really trying to say is that Hollywood should be careful about the movies they release.Once there was a guy who jumped from the 13-th floor trying to copy SUPERMAN.

		<fullReview>Well, it's not as bad as what I read before seeing it.Denzel gives a great performance, but he could make the role of Ted in "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure" into Oscar worthy work.The movie is too likeable to hate. The characters are fun, even the ones made out to be not so nice (favorite line "You from the slap-a-ho tribe." Or something like that). Some of the scenes had people screaming and yelling (in joy or in cheering). A couple people at the movie even stood up to voice their support of John Q.Problems come in the form of the director. He decided that the audience isn't smart enough to figure out the point of the movie so he bashes us over the head with it several times. Plus taking over the ER? I think would be harder than just locking a couple doors. The characters we fall in love with aren't realistic, sorry, but if someone is holding me, against my will, with a gun, I'm not going to like that person regardless of the reason he doing it. Because the end doesn't justify the means.The one big thing I like about this movie is the ending in the court room, unlike "A Time To Kill" this movie doesn't say the end does justify the means.Fun movie, good performances all around (although Annie H never really grabbed me) but semi-poor screenplay and over dramatic plot keep this movie from being really good. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The health care crisis in America is an ongoing one with no imminent solution. Those who can afford health care have it and aren't concerned about it. Those that don't have health care are too busy working to feed themselves and their families to fight the issue.John Q. brings this issue to the forefront, not by preaching to the masses, but telling the masses in an entertaining manner. When I finished watching John Q, all I felt was sadness because the movie, though not a true story, depicted the health care crisis very well but didn't offer a viable solution at all.The movie was very good but I do feel like there must have been a gap because I don't feel like I got the complete story. I do realize that movies are limited in time, but the movie depicted all the medical professions in a negative light (except for one doctor who told John Q. "don't give up"). The character played by Anne Hyche was one of the more despicable characters I have ever seen in a movie and her bitterness was not really explained other than the fact that John Q and his family did not have adequate health insurance.The best part of the movie is the fact that John Q's hostages supported him and his decision to hold them hostage. The worst part of the movie is the time spent showing the newsman and his sleaziness in trying to get an exclusive story for the news.At the end of the movie, there were trailers of picket signs, but I think the better ending would have been John Q going to jail and, while in jail, he writes Congress about the health care crisis, he testifies before Congress, and finally Congress passes a law that makes it mandatory for hospitals to provide life SAVING procedures on uninsured or underinsured individuals. An ending such as this one, would have left the viewers hopeful. The ending depicted in the movie left the viewers feeling that the issue of being uninsured or uninsured is a hopeLESS issue.</fullReview>

But, the insurance won't cover, and the doctors will refuse to operate for free. So, John Q. decides to hi-jack the emergancy room. A whole bunch of cool stuff happens, and they decide to operate.

		<shortDescription>Without question, a well-made movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington follows his powerful and gripping role in "Training Day" with a strong, powerful and intense performance in "John Q." Immense star power, outstanding performances, a powerful message and a poignant story; these are the qualities, which make "John Q" one of the most powerful movies of the year.With raw intensity, extreme authenticity and powerful intrigue Washington leads an all-star cast that includes Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, James Woods and Anne Heche. With tremendous support from Kimberly Elise, Daniel E. Smith and Eddie Griffin, "John Q." is a solid film that delivers on the promise to satisfy.The best thing about watching "John Q." is the conviction, integrity, brutal honesty and intense emotion each actor brings to their character. Also, the stars are not afraid to tackle the truth surrounding the health care system and the way the system treats society. Washington, Heche, Duvall and Liotta create electricity with each scene they are in."John Q." surrounds a father who has been pushed over the edge as he attempts to save the life of his son, Mike, after it is found that his heart has a defect. Though he has insurance that covers the surgery to give his son a new heart, John Q. takes the hospital hostage until the hospital administrator puts Mike's name on the list for a heart transplant.It always puts a smile on my face to watch a movie, which has the courage to tackle the truth. The writers deserve most of the credit for bringing to light one of the most important issues facing America; the health care system. Through creating intense moments and powerful scenes, the writers were able to successfully capture my attention and make me feel as if I were in the movie. Writing is the first thing I look at when I make my decision to give it a thumbs up or down, so when "John Q." passed this test, I knew it was only a matter of time before the rest would fall into place.There is not much one can say about Duvall other than he is a phenomenal talent who along with Washington brings credibility. Each film Duvall takes part in seems to turn into magic because he brings so much to each role. He may not have been the best actor in "John Q." but he was certainly the best suited for the role he had as the hostage negotiator.Heche is an added bonus to "John Q." as her role as the hospital administrator is performed with integrity, brutal honesty and fire that makes her role incredibly satisfying. Another actor who made a tremendous impact in "John Q." is James Woods Woods whose best quality is his ability to play villainous role so well it makes everyone forget that he is only playing a part. I relish the opportunity to watch his next film. Ray Liotta's role as the police chief is far and beyond his best performance to date. It's fun to watch everyone come together to turn in a great ensemble performance."The Hurricane," "Courage Under Fire," and "Philadelphia" are only three films, which has cemented Washington as one of the top notch actors in Hollywood. With his role in "John Q.," Washington brings authenticity, screen presence and ability to draw the viewers in with his unique charm. These are qualities he has been able to utilize in previous films.With the integrity of his performance and intensity of his presence, Washington was able to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. A smile comes to my face with every Denzel Washington film because I know I will get a quality performance from him. It is a pleasure to watch a fine actor continue to deliver on demand."John Q." is a blockbuster with intense dialogue, powerful scenes and a poignant story that will satisfy everyone from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching Yet Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't the best movie of the year, but it was good none the less. The drama was excellent in this movie. I mean I actually started to hate Anne Heche's character at some points through the movie. I did like it how it showed that not everyone in America can pay for insurance or surgery or the likings. It was interesting to see Denzel Washington play a character who was in the lower class. You don't usually see such famous and rich people playing these types of characters, and I believe this was a good thing to see. The reason I said this movie was kind of disturbing is that John goes into the hospital and literally takes over by force of a gun. As I watched this movie I kept thinking that people will take this idea and use it. Copycats occur all the time when watching movies, and I thought this wouldn't be different, yet I haven't heard of any copycat incidents yet and it's been out for a while. Well, this movie was touching, and out of 4 stars I give it 2 1/2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood usually releases two or three of these movies every year: the action chick flick that ends up ripping everyone off with melodrama. JOHN Q is the 2002 movie of that genre. Starring Denzel Washington, the movie, you slowly realize while getting into it, is just another heart-tugger, except this one has no bite to it and is tortuously drawn out. How predictable can one movie get when the first five minutes ruin the entire two hours?Low-income family man takes matters into his own hands when paper work won't save his dying son.Denzel does his best to keep the pace strong, even when the movie leaves him for dead. After the dramatic irony, a good portion of time is unnecessarily spent watching Washington's acting buckling from the cheesiness. Some acting in JOHN Q is mandatory, typecast nonsense for this genre (the wife-beater, the rookie thrust into the heat, list goes forever ...). What makes it worse is 90% of this support acting is ho hum at best. Would you die to save your son? Kudos to Washington and Woods for surviving this disaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie embodies everything that is wrong with America today.They have a dying kid that goes into the emergency room. And can't can't get the help he needs because the health care in the US sucks !! His fathers insurance company is a bunch of con's and so is his workplace. Then he decides that he is fed up with the hospital because they say they can't help him out. (maybe if you had some good health care) So like in the schools and post offices the father decides to take over the emergency room with a gun and take people hostage. And for some reason we are all supposed to just give this man what he wants. How about all the other kids that are dying and have no coverage to pay for the hospital bills. What makes this kid so special. Yes it shows how much a father loves his kid and would do anything for him, and yes this kid is special but so is every other kid in the world. The we have Ray Liota the police chief, the type of guy who would do anything just to save his own ass caise it is an election year. He doesn't care about his fellow employees or even the kid dying in the hospital all he cares about is his paycheck and rep. Then Anne Heche everyone is supposed to hate her because she can't help the family out with there son's problem. Well you know she is only doing her job. Bill meyer said it best in the movie (not an exact qoute but close to it) " the only people americans have to blame for bad health care is themselves." I am Canadian and yes the Taxes do suck sometimes. But you know i am happy to know that if i need a heart transplant i am going to get it. i am not going to have to worry about my insurance company turing me down and saying you can't die. May be the USA should take an example from other countries and install some better health care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladies and Gentleman welcome to the Emergency Room. John Q. Archibald (Denzel Washington) is the trauma room director. He controls all who enter and even those that may leave, not the doctors. This comes about after his son falls ill and needs a heart transplant. After trying to get care for him and being rejected for lack of funds there aren't any options left. Pushed to the limits we see just how far a father is willing to go to save his son.Having Denzel in the movie you already know what he's going to do. The question is what are the other characters going to do around him. Throughout the course of the movie, John Q drives the action. However, he has a wonderful supporting cast consisting of: Robert Duvall (Grimes), Kimberly Elise (Denise Archibald) and Daniel E. Smith as Mike Archibald. These supporting characters along with many others are what make the movie enjoyable. Some of the most intense scenes were also the most comedic. Therefore, this movie does a great job of keeping your attention and withdrawing your emotions. The set is as interesting as you can make an Emergency Room. There isn't any fancy lighting or spectacle thrown in to keep you in the movie. You are drawn into the movie by human nature and that alone. I don't see how you could watch the movie and not feel for the Archibald family and those all over America that are suffering in the same way. This is a great film in that it doesn't try to paint a false picture of what is going on. You see what takes place in ER's all across the US on a daily basis. It is this choice that helps create the impact that the film desires. This movie is meant to educate America on how important it is to be insured and to donate organs. I went on this emotional journey and felt for John Q. all through the movie. To think that all a person works for can be gone the next day. That is actually a pretty scary situation to think about. There is one other question that is even tougher to answer. How would you deal with it? I couldn't even begin to explain. James Kearns, shows us just how one man in this predicament handles it. It is with this strong screenplay and the wonderful directing of Nick Cassavetes that we are able to sit bedside with the Archibald's and follow their plight. Ultimately showing us that if you give a father no options, you leave him no choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"John Q" makes an impact with its message and passionate performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Nick Cassavetes, "John Q," at first glance, looks like nothing more than a two-hour political critique regarding America's health-care crisis. The simple plot of a father taking hostages in an emergency room in his attempt to save his son serves as a cover for the true intent of broadcasting a proclamation concerning the state of health care in this country.But from beneath the tidal wave of propaganda emerges a sobering yet entertaining blue-collar film about an ordinary man who, out of nowhere, is suddenly mired in an extraordinary predicament.Judging by the actors that were assembled, it's obvious the casting directors did their homework. Their solid performances give life to otherwise everyday characters. Denzel Washington is simply amazing as John Quincy Archibald, an average Joe and family man beset by an onslaught of financial trouble. His hours as a factory worker have been slashed to the bone, and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) has had her car repossessed. And, to make matters extremely worse, his son Mike (impressively portrayed by newcomer Daniel E. Smith) suddenly collapses from heart failure during a Little League game.The hospital administrator, Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche), informs John and Denise that Mike is in dire need of a heart transplant, a procedure which will cost a mere $250,000. 75 grand alone will have Mike's name put on a waiting list.John's insurance won't cover the bills, and his bank account is in tatters. What follows is a gloomy series of edits showing him standing in long insurance and employment agency lines only to be told at the end what he doesn't want to hear. With assistance from his friend Jimmy (David Thornton), a redneck with a heart of gold, he attempts to raise the money himself.When it's learned that Mike is going to be released from the hospital, a frantic Denise implores John to "do something." And he does in a big way: he takes chief cardiologist Dr. Turner (James Woods) hostage, along with over a dozen others, in the emergency room.Enter Robert Duvall as Grimes, an aging hostage negotiator whose style conflicts with egotistical, camera-hungry Police Chief Monroe, who is played by Ray Liotta. (Obba Babatunde is underused in a brief role as a police sergeant.) Grimes wants to peacefully talk John out of the building, while Monroe would rather go in with guns blazing, kill him and get it over with. All the while, muckraking consumer reporter Tuck Lampley (Paul Johansson) takes advantage of every opportunity to boost his ratings, even if it means broadcasting an emotional phone call between John and his ailing son on national television.Among the rogues' gallery of prisoners are an obese security guard (Ethan Suplee), a burly man (Troy Winbush) and his pregnant wife, a street-smart wisecracker (Eddie Griffin), plus a (supposedly) blond bombshell and her greasy boyfriend (Heather Wahlquist and Shawn Latosy). Early on, Griffin is the groan-inducing attempt at comic relief, but he undergoes a surprising change as the climax nears.Though the plot is captivating, by no means is the script Oscar material. There are plenty of cliches abound, such as the inevitable good cop/bad cop conflict between Grimes and Monroe, and the inevitable hostage bonding (which brought back memories of "Speed"). Meanwhile, Heche listlessly phones in her part. She disrupts the flow of nearly every film she appears in, even the powerful "Donnie Brasco," in which she was simply unwatchable, and "John Q" is no exception.However, the scenes of John's interactions with Mike pack such an emotional punch that you would swear Smith really was Washington's son. With the right guidance, he could become a major star. While John is not a hero in the least, no matter how hard the film tries to portray him as such, Washington pulls viewers into his world throughout his trials and tribulations that it's hard not to sympathize with his situation. Together with Elise, they exhibit great chemistry as the struggling family.Despite the PG-13 rating, there are some very disturbing scenes of a family grieving over a loved one who lies dead in a hospital bed, plus several graphic surgical images.There's even a scene in which the hostages and doctors engage in a "McLaughlin Group"-style bull session about health plans and "bloodsucking" HMOs. At the apex of the surprising ending, a montage of talk show snippets are shown, ranging from "Larry King Live" to Bill Maher's "Politically Incorrect." Before the closing credits roll, an on-screen proclamation reads, "There are 48,000,000 Americans currently living without health insurance, and 7,000 Americans in 2002 alone will undergo medical procedures that they cannot afford." It's food for thought that will leave a sour taste in your mouth.(In a tragic note of irony, one of the guests seen on Maher's program was Ted Demme, who died of heart failure just weeks before the film's release. Even more shocking was the fact that he had collapsed while participating in a sporting event, just like John's son in the picture.)Whether or not "John Q" succeeds at getting its message across to audiences nationwide, it does succeed at presenting a though-provoking albeit mildly flawed story, which will shock as much as it will entertain without becoming supercilious or heavy-handed. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel is one of my favorite actors and I had high expectations for this film. Fortunately, he did not let me down. I also enjoyed Duvalls and Woods performances. I have yet to see a movie where Anne Heche has played a convincing role and I wasn't surprised at her inept attempt in this movie. The story was good and the couple of twists that were in the movie were very well down.However the movie was ruined for me by all the liberal propaganda that made its way into the film. As someone else here said, it was very preachy. As you watching it, you can see were the producers are with comments about national health care and with scenes that show Denzel rolling his eyes at comments by President Bush. I can take a lot of that kind of reference (it is a movie from Hollywood, afterall), but what really pushed it over the top was the media snippetts at the end. They show Hilary Rodham Clinton, Jesse Jackson, Larry King and other liberal light weights talking about how America needs National Healthcare and barbaric it is that there are people without insurance. The producers show a lot of nerve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this film, Denzel Washington is a working class everyman whose son neads a heart transplant (!!!) but the dastardly hospital administrator (played by ice queen Anne Heche) won't give it to him cause he doesnt have insurance!!! Thus, Denzel takes the whole emergency room hostage with a handgun in order to force the doc (James Woods of all people) to operate on his kid.. while Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta are the cops trying to talk him down.. or take him out... Another preposterous premise that exists primarily to take pot shots at HMOs.. an easy target in todays world... the film still manages to work because of the brilliance of Washington, who can make his characters always interesting and sympathetic even in silly storylines.. Duvall is likewise believable in the hostage negotiator role, while Liotta as the chief of police is somewhat of a characature.. predictible stuff but works cause of the fine acting.

		<shortDescription>Mildly entertaining, but falls short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, the premise of this movie is great. John Q Archibald, a loving father, has his love for his son tested when he cannot get a heart transplant. Just how far will he go to save his son?This is the question that John Q asks. This situation is really heartbreaking, and it could have been a truly great movie. Sadly, the film never managed to even take itself seriously, so how can the audience be expected to?(possible spoilers) The filmmakers go to great lenghts to make sure we like John Q: he is portrayed as a hardworking family man. A scene of him in church immediately followed by a Little League game closes the deal; look how average he is! When his son has a heart attack, he is rushed to the hospital and told that his son needs a heart transplant. At this stage of the story a whole new lineup of characters is introduced, each a cardboard cutout from a host of other movies: the heartless hospital staff, the richboy doctor, etc.Despite the filmmaker's desperate attempts to get the audience to sympathize with John Q's plight, it just didn't work for me. No situation was original or true; they all seemed to refer to other movies. As I was watching, I kept thinking: "Haven't we seen this before?"These early weaknesses become blatant as the movie moves into its last act. John Q, desperate to save his son, takes the hospital hostage to negotiate for a new heart. The Hollywood formula for hostage situations is carefully followed: good cop, bad cop, meddling reporter, list of hostages from every walk of life. We've seen all this before in other movies, and it was always handled much better. Consider the scene in which one of the hostages tells another his plan for escape. Not only is this exchange completely unrealistic, it is completely unneeded. A better movie would have shown him pocketing the weapons and leaving us to figure it out, but the filmmakers didn't give us credit for any intelligence whatsoever.Another problem is the endless preaching. Hostages sit around with John and discuss HMOs and health care as if they were highly educated on the topic. People, not only is this completely sickening, it just doesn't happen. Consider the following dialogue:"There are over 50 million people in the United States without health insurance. If you've got a problem with it, call your congressman."As if we didn't hear enough politics in our last presidential election! My friends dragged me to this movie on opening night, and all I could do was shake my head at how they praised it shamelessly. People, we know better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ludicrous One-sided Worship of a Terrorist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Denzel and have seen most of his movies but this flick ranks as a one-note exercise on our current state of healthcare in the USA.I can't believe that the studios were worried about releasing COLLATERAL DAMAGE with its terrorist plot but hadn't the slightest concern about JOHN Q whose main character is a terrorist portrayed in a sympathetic light. The main character locks himself inside an Emergency Room in a hospital with the usual slice-of-life one-dimensional characters and then proceeds to threaten a surgeon with a gun to add his son's name to a heart donor recipient list.What leads up to the hostage plot is nothing short of a simplistic one-sided view of the US healthcare/insurance system in the United States. Nowhere in the Constitution does the Federal Government guarantee everyone the right to free healthcare. 15 years ago, HMO's were seen as a white knight to save people money on healthcare. The old system which required most people to pay 20 percent of the cost and their insurance picking up the rest worked fine but people fell in love with their $10.00 co-pay to see a doctor and HMO's became the standard. People failed to realize that HMOs significantly cut down on major medical procedures to cut costs.John Q, played by Denzel, is a father whose every setback on his quest for a new heart for his son, is met with a sound effect that sounds like a dump truck being dropped from the roof of a tall building. The heavy handed direction and manipulative script really try a movie-goers patience. Yes, we feel sorry that his son is sick but the fact is that, in light of September 11th, the main character who we are supposed to feel empathy for, is nothing more than a terrorist.James Woods does a great job of lampooning an uncaring heart surgeon, Anne Heche is a cartoon character big bad hospital administrator, Ray Liotta is a publicity seeking police chief and some guy with hair portrays a stereo typical news reporter.The exceptions to this cast are Robert Duvall who is a tough but caring hostage negoiator and John Q's wife whose name I didn't see. Also, the comedian named Eddie got off some funny one-liners.The plot is riddled with ludicrous holes from the heartless bureaucracy to the women going into labor. Early on in the hostage scenes, I wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen when the hostages could have easily overpowered John Q and when the police officers being ridiculed by the crowd and cheering the terrorist instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"John Q"PG-13 for violence, language, and intense thematic elementsStarring: Denzel Washington, Kimberly Elise, Daniel E. Smith, Anne Heche, and James WoodsPlot: When a 9 year old boy (Daniel E. Smith) needs a heart transplant to live that his parents can't afford, his father (Denzel Washington) takes an ER hostage."John Q" is a very brilliant film. I can't wait for the DVD. Though it is pretty much an insured hit, it sure earned the money it is making right now. Denzel Washington is brilliant as the father, it is almost an alter-ego to Alonzo Harris, the character he played in "Training Day". While Harris likes to corrupt the system, John Q. Archibald tries to make the system better. This movie is almost a message to health care providers, a plead for better health care for the millions of Americans who have poor or no health care.The other actors do brilliant jobs. Kimberly Elise is brilliant as the worried mother, and Daniel E. Smith was very brilliant in his first role as the son, the wonderfully innocent Mikey Archibald. Anne Heche is a cold being in this movie, playing the head of the hospital, who denies an operation until the Archibalds can get them the money needed. James Woods is another cold being as a doctor. The hostages are brilliant in their roles. Eddie Griffin is a stereotypical black man from the urban streets. Sean Hatosy is a wife beating trailer trash punk, and Heather Wahlquist is hisgirlfriend. There are more hostages, all playing a brilliant and important role in this sentimental film.John Q is portrayed as a hero in this film, a father who will go to any lengths to save his son. He is portrayed as a nice guy, an innocent father, while the hospital and insurance agency are portrayed as the bad guys, so you can see from what viewpoint this film was made from. This does not matter though. My grandmother cried during the film, and the whole audience in the theater enjoyed it.Overall I would like to reccomend this brilliantly composed film. Though the maturity level might limit this film to teenagers and older, it is still a brilliant film that I reccomend to everyone.Grade: A- or 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel is believable as usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Denzel Washington accepts a role, there's an unspoken guarantee of excellence. This is definitely the case with his role as John Quincy Archibald in New Line Cinema's release of `John Q'.I was pleased to see Denzel in his usual true to life character. A plant worker trying to support his family in difficult times, working 20 hour weeks. The story is one the world is familiar with: Our failing healthcare system. Controlled medicine. What this Father is willing to do for the love of his son is what makes John Q another smash hit for Denzel and New Line Cinema.Kimberly Elise, best known from Set if Off and Beloved was very convincing as a strong Black woman fearful not only of losing her child, but willing to stand by her man at any cost. Her scenes in the movie are worthy. Having worked in the Healthcare industry and understanding both sides of the dilemma, Anne Heche was the epitome of the heartless Hospital Administrator who can only think in terms of dollars and no sense. Other notable characters are James Woods as the Cardiologist in charge of the case and Daniel E. Smith, a young actor who I predict we'll be seeing on the big screen for many years to come.John Q will make you laugh, and make you cry. I would hope that people walk away from this movie feeling more informed about the greed in medical practices in this country. The problem with HMO's is not new. Until and unless we start making waves, the problem will persist. I'm anticipating the DVD release. This is one you must definitely have in your Denzel Washington collection. Bravo to Director Nick Cassavetes. But how hard could it be to direct Denzel Washington?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary in the way that _possibly_ if you take hostages you will wind up getting your sick child the heart they need. Look for this in an ER near you.Now, as a father (and most fathers I'm sure would agree), I would do ANYTHING to help my child. And I think that HMO's are a worse plague than cancer, but come on...Anne Heche's character points out a very valid fact that in the movie is made to appear very callous: "sick people die every day". They do. Could be me, could be you. Could be one of our loved ones. Fortunately I have never been placed in the situation of the "John Q" character. But I think it's unrealistic to think that taking a ER hostage will hasten a sick loved one's recovery.The lesson of this movie should not be a "pro national healthcare" message. That's a misguided, misunderstood notion. The "public servants" pushing this idiotic idea, ALL HAVE INSURANCE, and are not concerned about quality or cost of healthcare. Anyone who believes that "National healthcare" is a better idea than HMOs, better do more research.The lesson should be, _know what your insurance covers_, ALWAYS! So many people have their priorities out of line-they will buy that X Box, but decide to take minimum coverage on their health insurance.While the problem of un- or under-insured people is real, the fact in this movie is that "John" wasn't un-insured, he didn't know the coverage limits, and how his less than full-time job affected his benefits. For those of us with insurance, it's a wake up call to check on these things. For the the unfortunate folks who are unable for whatever reason to have insurance, it's up to the medical community and legislators to come up with an equitable solution, without the idea of a "National HMO" (read "healthcare") system. Ask yourself if Canadians who come to the US for various types of necessary surgery do so because they like it better here, or because they are either denied or put on waiting lists where they will die before receiving treatment.As a final note, if you aren't an organ donor, please be one. The life you lose may save another!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who cares about Oscars and Golden Globes. "John Q" has a message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever been shafted by an insurance company or shuttled to the side by an uncaring doctor or nurse? Then see this movie. "John Q" has a message and the message is our health system is broken.Denzel Washington plays the title character, a man who has been pushed to the edge when his son can't get the treatment he needs to save his life. So John takes matters into his own hands, commandeering the hospital emergency room and it's occupants and offering to trade his hostages for getting his son's name on the heart transplant list.Without giving too much away this movie should be mandatory viewing for all health care professionals, hospital administrators and insurance company personnel."John Q" says more in two hours than any senator, congressman or presidential candidate ever has about how insensitive our health system is. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it extremely amusing that this movie has received scathing reviews from everyone but the audience, yet one more example that critics live in a vaccuum and should generally be ignored. Yes, John Q is filled with cliches, has a certain made-for-TV feel to it, and isn't going to win any Oscars. So what? It's enjoyable, entertaining, and walks the fine line between delivering a message and being preachy with grace and balance. Quite frankly, that's what I paid $7 for in the first place, not to be impressed by how well a film caters to a critic's narrow view of what the rest of the world should be watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Doesn't Get Much Better Than This... 10/10... And That Is Coming From An Amateur Film Critic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this movie is three things. First it is one of the best movies let alone thrillers to come out ever. Second it is a message to all of the people in the country. And third it is an amazing ensemble of extremely talented actors, many of whom are overlooked and underrated. Let me start out by saying that Denzel's performance, as always, is incredible. In fact the entire casts' performances are incredible, and that is why I choose to include many people in the list of whose starring in this movie. That is also why I feel this is an amazing ensemble of talented actors. Each one of the characters in this movie created their own part in the complicated story of John Q. Some were good, some were bad, and some were funny. But without all of them, there would be one less thing about John Q that made it such a good film. Without certain characters, some of the plot line would be non-existent. When I say this movie is a message to society, I say that because it talks about so many, and bashes so many things that our country is having problems with today. HMO and insurance problems (this was an obvious factor of the movie), problems with the stupidity and eagerness of the media (Tuck Lampley the TV reporter called the fact that he got video footage of John Q his `white bronco' and he didn't even care what was going on.typical of today's media), problems with people being mean and beating up their girlfriends (Mitch), problems within the police department (Monroe the police chief talking about elections, and wanting this to get over with so just kill him. He didn't care about John Q or his son.) In my opinion it took a lot of guts for Nick Cassavetes, and James Kearns (writer) to make a movie about these horrible, horrible things that happen. This movie tells people that these problems happen, and basically asks, what should we do about it?Lastly, in my opinion this is one of the best movies let alone thrillers to come out ever. The cast and crew of this movie took many problems that are going on now, took amazing actors, and made this into a tense, sometimes funny, and extremely important movie. At some times I was scared to death, and at some times I couldn't stop laughing. This truly was a great, great movie. Ok, so maybe not everybody will like this movie. Maybe they will say it's too much of a message, and not enough of a movie. But it being a message and still being an incredible movie, in my opinion, is one of the greatest cinematic feats of all time. Kudos to the entire cast and crew of John Q!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only for the idiots out there...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Let's face the simple truth: you will be hard pressed to find someone who likes the insurance industry. It's a double-edged sword, however. We couldn't live without them, no matter how much we may hate it. Shelling out premiums from every single paycheck, only to still be required to come up with money to cover medical procedures. It's a pain in the ass and we all hate it. So it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came out with a film to capitalize on that hatred and resentment. And here it is in the form of "John Q".Unfortunately, "John Q" is not only a bad film, it's a misguided film. Taking a firm stance against HMOs, "John Q" demands that America come up with a better solution. My own suggestion would be to take the money used to fund this film and send it out to all those who will need mental insurance coverage for watching it. After viewing this movie, I came out conflicted: I hate HMOs as much as the next person, but I hated this movie even more. It presents the material in such a one-sided and manipulative way, I almost feel my brain has split a personality. One part wants me to laud the film with praise for attacking an evil industry; the other, more rational part wants me to shred the film for taking the easy way out."John Q" begins with a BMW swerving and passing cars on a lonely highway. Needless to say, this car crashes, killing its driver. If you've seen the trailers, you know exactly why this scene is here (John Q's son needs a heart, a woman just died with a fine heart, you do the math). We are then introduced to John Q. Archibald (Denzel Washington), your average blue collar worker. His supportive wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) and their only son Mike (Daniel E. Smith) play silly games on the way to school--see how normal these people are? The only thing missing is a good church scene. Oh, nevermind, they included that too. This, of course, all leads to tragedy during a little league game. Mike, stealing second base, clutches his chest and drops motionless to the ground.Turns out Mike's heart is three sizes too large (someone call Dr. Seuss, stat!). Without a transplant, he will die. We are told this by the hospital administrator Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) and the cardiologist Dr. Turner (James Woods). It's at this point you realize the callousness of the filmmakers. Portraying the administrator and physician as villains, they sit coldly emotionless as John and Denise cry over the predicament. There is no insurance, and the procedure will cost $250,000. These two "villains" are never afforded the thought that perhaps they see this same scene played out so often, they are beyond emotion. Of course, without them, we wouldn't have the satisfying emotional arc for when they both instantly become human again.John, trying desperately to raise the money to no avail, must take drastic measures, taking the emergency room of the hospital hostage. With a strangely colorful assortment of characters, John soon starts a debate with Dr. Turner. The police surround the ER, lead by Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall), chief hostage negotiator. John doesn't take well to Grimes' attitude, and soon threatens the lives of his hostages. Either his son gets a new heart, or he starts killing hostages (the logic of that still doesn't make much sense)."John Q" tries so hard to make you weep, cueing the orchestra at just the right moments. Sadly, when the music swelled, so did the bile in my stomach. First-time screenwriter James Kearns is primarily to blame for this travesty. The plot alone plods along at an insipid pace, you may find yourself hoping the sniper shoots him just so it ends. As if that weren't enough, Kearns' dialogue is some of the absolute worst I've ever heard in a major motion picture. Stilted, corny, and stupid, even the talented Washington can't help it. Just thinking about the screenplay makes me so angry I find myself having trouble coming up with descriptions. How a piece of garbage like this could get made is beyond me.Nick Cassavetes doesn't help the matter either. With his rancid directing (his last film was the equally awful "She's So Lovely"), the film plays out artificially. You never really believe for a moment Mike will succumb to his heart condition, despite that his systolic blood pressure drops below 80 (this device almost served as a heart-induced countdown--thankfully, it is forgotten quickly). Portraying a completely one-sided issue, we are forced into cheering for John. This sort of manipulative filmmaking is quick to turn me off. You hear the arguments for why the medical industry is evil, and yet it's a direct result of America. It's based around capitalism. During the final few minutes, small news reports sum up the events. One commentator makes the only valid and rational argument in the film, stating it is our fault the medical industry is the way it is. We want better coverage, but we don't want to pay for it. Sad this moment came so late in the film.Poor Denzel. After getting an Oscar nomination for his (vastly overrated) turn in "Training Day", he gets sapped with this God-awful role. Of course, we shouldn't feel too sorry for him, since he did choose it. Even the strongest of actors couldn't get this material to work. The only real moments of acting come from Kimberly Elise as his wife. Ray Liotta is handed the annoying task of being the harsh, uncaring police chief. In any other hostage film, he'd be the hero, and we'd be cheering him on to take out the hostage taker. But here, not a chance. He's the villain. Robert Duvall seems to be sleep-walking his way through his role, while Anne Heche tries desperately to bring humanity to her inhumane character. Even the usually reliable Woods can't wade through the crap he's given.The film ends on a cheap note, with the police arresting the wrong man (I almost bolted for the exits, but figured it was almost over anyway). This doesn't come as a surprise, and it shouldn't be treated as one. I am not spoiling anything, because the filmmakers are so bad at setting up this "false" ending, it's really quite pointless. We get to witness a very graphic operating scene (how this film managed a PG-13 rating is beyond me), and not only that, the doctor actually taps the heart to make it start beating. It's one of those ludicrous moments that, if happened in real life, you might punch out the doctor. Ah, but Cassavetes isn't finished. He even includes a short glimpse of recently deceased Ted Demme, the director of much better movies than this one. Why the clip is in the film is beyond me, as it serves no purpose whatsoever, but it did remind me of how crappy Nick Cassavetes is as a filmmaker."John Q" is rated PG-13 for violence, language and intense thematic elements. To put it simply, and taking a cue from Roger Ebert, I hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. I hated every single moment of it. It was a false, manipulative sapfest that wants to get its audience riled up over a subject people already are riled up over. The music is bad (including some weird vocalizations that can not be explained), the direction is worse, and the script is bottom-of-the-barrel garbage. Talented screenwriters lurk on the outskirts of Hollywood, desperate for a chance to get a film produced. Instead, we get this. The state of HMOs concerns me, but for now, that Hollywood actually let this film be made, the state of Hollywood is just as bad. Shame on you.</fullReview>

They are portrayed CORRECTLY in this movie, insurance companies are not only mean &amp; cruel, half of the time they don't think of what it's like to be us, the ones who need it the most, like the cute little boy in the movie, disabled people, the old &amp; the sick, etc. Another character portrayed well is that self-centered news reporter. He reminds me so much like some of these famous news reporters today, specially Bob Costas &amp; Stone Phillips. If you are easy going, love a good movie &amp; don't criticize a movie just because of some flaws, and truly see a movie for what it's worth, go see this movie! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Q (played by Denzel Washington) is a hard working man that goes that extra mile to help his son. As I was watching this movie I had to remind myself that it was just that, a movie. Director Nick Cassavetes does a wonderfull job of keeping the audience connected with the protaganist Jon Q. As he goes against all odds to save his dying child we are kept right on the edge of our seats wondering, what will he do next? I found myself gasping with the rest of the crowd as Jon makes his next move, snearing at the police for trying to stop him and crying, "no" when he steps into a snipers crosshairs.Although Denzel did a fine job in Training Day, I wasn't sure if this was his year to be nominated. It didn't seem right to me, but now I see how talented Denzel really is. One might contradict and say that this movie was a little too sappy and was overplayed a bit, but I think that the movie as a whole was done very nicely. Jon Q will keep you entertained and is a great movie for anyone who enjoys an incredible emotional journey made by your everyday man.</fullReview>

Woods, Heche and Elise all perform well. Hostage movies are always difficult to keep entertaining as the location doesn't change but Washington keeps the scenes live by his deft acting and emotion. Some may say this isn't an Oscar performance but I beg to differ. I watched John Q and A Beautiful Mind on successive days and both movies have those ingredients that great movies must have. Suspense, great performances and great scripts. See it...you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People complain about this movie being too preachy, which it is, but it is in a good way. It's unfortunate people have misunderstood the reason for this movie's theme being over-the-top, we need it. People need this problem spelled out to them to compel people to action. This is not a movie directed towards winning oscars or accolade, but to motivate people to do something about the health-care situation. The film definitely achieves it desired effect, as it had many people in the theater clapping, crying and praising it. The movie is also careful not to overdose on it's political message by adding comedic scenes. I've also heard a lot about it being cliche and predictable. Now someone please alert me if I am incorrect, but I don't think there has ever been a big budget movie devoted to the cause of nation-wide health-care, and for that matter how many film are devoted to a cause other than money. I disagree with the statement that this is a typical hostage movie. The closest thing I've seen to this was Mad City, but the ending are opposites. I will, however say, that I would have enjoyed the film more and would have been more impressed if the last minute message was too late. It would have been more inventive and ironic.</fullReview>

I also love Robert Duvall,Eddie Griffin, and James Woods, and even Anne Heche did a great job as the cold-hearted hospital administrator. Everything worked so well, and I have no idea why most of the critics can't see that this film is just another great one brought from Denzel Washington!

I thought this was a really good movie, and it was done very well. There isn't really much I can say other than it's a good movie.There is one problem I did have with the movie though. I'm really not one to notice the music in a film (unless I own the music, then I recognize it). Most of the time I just watch the movie and pay little attention to the music, but I thought the music was kind of misplaced and odd at times in this film. There were a number of scenes where I thought the music didn't make sense in that particular scene. Strangely enough, one of the friends of mine that I saw it with, felt the same way as I did, and he even pin-pointed the scene I was thinking of without me saying anything about what scene I was talking about. So, I know I'm not the only one that feels this way.Anyhow, other than the music issue, it was a great film, and you should definitely see it if you can. Thanks for reading.-Chris</fullReview>

I had the pleasure of cooking for Denzel while the movie was on location in Toronto, and can only imagine how tough this role was to play being such a devoted father. He is outstanding in the role and portrays the role with just the right amount of emotion.

		<shortDescription>Too Much Melodrama (some vague spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has some good high points, which only makes most of the rest of the movie so awfully melodramatic. For instance, there is genuine drama building up as too whether John will sacrifice himself towards the end. The audience I was in was genuinely enthralled here, even if the predictable were to follow. Unfortunetly, the movie rushes so many other points. All the "tension" that's builds up in John in the beginning of the movie as he tries to secure surgery for his son is not dealt properly with, and the sentencing at court scene at the end has as much tension as flipping a coin in determining a sentence. Granted, to lengthen the film in the bookends would make this unbearably long. I felt it should of ended after the collage of media clips, ala Traffic.Also, there is a part in the film where John's best friend gives a moving and intelligent speech about the Health care industry. Problem is, the speech isn't becoming of his character. Not that he should be some stereotypical blue-collar worker, but he suddenly develops: 1. great speaking skills and 2. a much deeper understanding of Health Care Industry then I thought he reasonably had.Duvall here is adequate, which is very disappointing. Maybe the remnants of "Falling Down" are controlling my opinion.The worst part of the movie, with out a doubt though, is the music. Melodrama music to begin with is just bad, but this stuff is truly terrible. I'm going to investigate who's responsible for that, and see if I've ever heard any of their work before, just to see if it was just an isolated incident. I mean, you don't notice the music that often when you see a movie for the first time, unless it's extraordinary in some way. Unfortunately, it's extraordinarily bad here.I also thought the name Frank Grimmes (Duvall) was especially funny, being it of a one-show character from the Simpsons (the guy who worked his way from nothing, only to meet his down fall in Homer's path of idoicy towards bliss). If you want to see a classic hostage movie, see "Dog Day Afternoon".6 out 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"John Q." was an exceptional movie. I have read exactly two comments from this site that states that this movie does not deserve an Oscar. I just would like to say that I completely disagree. This movie deserves as many Oscars as there is possible to be given. One of the reasons given was because it was stated that John Q's actions were not a solution to his problem, however, if one looks at the movie carefully, one would see that he tried several options, and did everything that was told of him to do. He tried. Yes this movie is emotional, is'nt that what all movies try to do? Get the viewers drawn into the mind of the writer? This movie mastered that skill...and that's why it deserves an Oscar, because the writer and the actors accomplished, exceptionally well the art of helping the viewer to feel what the characters feel. To open the door of intellegence, where the TRUTH must be accepted. John Q's actions "may" not have been the solution, but when one thinks about it, was it a solution in "American Beauty" for character of Kevin Spacey to behave the way he did in front of young teenagers just because he was having marriage problems,or for his wife to do what she did? Does it mean that that movie doesn't deserve a Oscar? Did "American Beauty" not absorb the audience? Or was it a solution for the character of Tom Cruiz in "Rain Man" to do what he did in order to get what he wanted...were any of these solutions? Did not "Rain Man" deserve an Oscar? Tell me, do you really, and honestly think that "John Q" does not "deserve" an Oscar. Denzel is a wonderful actor. If he wasn't do you think he could possibly charge as much, or be payed as much money as he has for just one movie? Do you think he could possibly bring in as large a crowd to the Cinemas, no matter what the movie is if he wasn't? Denzel deserves this Oscar, no question about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps if Stephen(the first reviewer) would have paid a little closer attention he might have enjoyed this movie more.John Q. ARCHIBALD (Denzel) is an everyday hard-working, family loving man. His son, Mike (played by newcomer Daniel E. Smith) is an amazing little boy who is struck down by a heart disease and needs a transplant in order to live. John quickly finds out that his company insurance has switched to an HMO without saying anything and because his son's surgery is considered an 'elective' surgery...he is pretty much stuck with the bill. John exhausts every means possible to raise the money, but in the end is backed into a corner and his only logical course of action is to take over the hospital with hostages and demand care for his son. Denzel gives an amazing performance, as always, as well as Daniel E. Smith as his son. The speech given from father to son in the hospital is very heart warming and had many people in the theater in tears. I felt even though this movie was not anything new, they manner in which the story is told and the subject matter of this nations health care system is(was) something that needed to be told. 4 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Q is predictable but on purpose. The plot comes together quite well because of it's predictiveness. Denzil gives a stunning performance as a father who is both an obedient husband, down on his luck and as a loving, caring father. While I'm not sure if this movie was based on a true story or not, I found "John Q" guilty of the usual Hollywood antics like a news anchorman who happens to have the ultimate communications geek in his employ, enabling the national viewing of a police blunder, LIVE on TV. I have yet to see antics like this in real life. Kimberly Elise gives a believable performance as the desperate mom who demands that her husband "do something" after all hope has been yanked away by hospital bureaucrats. After seeing this movie, Denzil should win the Oscar this year for "Training Day". If that sounds like an oxymoron, blame it on the academy. James Wood, Anne Heche , Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall are worthy as die-hard, by-the-book, servants of the people who can't take YES for an answer. I stayed on the edge of my seat and clapped twice before the movie was over. A good thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will love this film but be prepared for the many melodramatic moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 out of 4`How's it going to end John?'`I don't know.'This exchange more than sums up what could be called the most emotional film of 2002. John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a dedicated father and blue-collar factory man who can't make ends meet. Following his 9-year-old son's collapse at a baseball game it becomes clear that he will die without a heart transplant. Unfortunately, John's insurance isn't adequate enough and the hospital is sending his son home to die. For John this situation is unacceptable, forcing him to take the hospital's Emergency Room, including his son's cardiac surgeon (James Woods), hostage until his son is placed at the top of the waiting list for new hearts.From the very beginning, the film is an up-and-down ride of emotions. An honest and hard working family is faced with more heartache than anyone could ever imagine yet I believed every scene. The filmmaker succeeds with his intention even though it involves perfectly placed, poignant moments meant to resurrect themselves during the final scenes of the film. Those final scenes will leave you bathed in tears but are sappy and at times a little contrived. The overall feel of the film, the message it delivers and the cast delivering it far outweigh its small downfalls.With its ever changing moods `John Q.' places you in the hospital with a wide variety of characters, all coming together to either support John Q. or to fight against the decisions he has made and outside the hospital, where the police and the media battle each other's goals, reminiscent of `Dog Day Afternoon', in their own attempts to end a tragedy that's been set in motion with only the death of a boy, his father or a hostage to stop it.Washington's performance in this film only reinforces the reason he's been nominated five times for an Academy Award. There is never any doubt that John Q. is willing to risk everything, including his own life, to make sure his son is given a heart transplant. The question that always surfaces when films of this nature are made becomes easy to answer as John Q. explains why it has to happen his way.It may be a given that a film involving bureaucratic HMOs and a hypocritical government system lends itself to preaching and "John Q." does become preachy. But if you're willing to let the message of the film slide off of you, temporarily, what remains is a heartfelt plea from a father to save the one thing that means the most to him, his son's life.</fullReview>

Even the boy that played John Q's son was great. The film was almost a tear jerker for me, I had to hold them back.Despite the liberal lean to the movie it was still great. The movie seems to be pushing too hard for a national health care system. I saw two versions of this film, and the first version had a lot of liberal mumbo jumbo at the end talking about how many Americans don't have insurance and how many can't afford it and how we need a national health care system. But the final version they removed all that. I guess they didn't want to make all republicans mad about that.But don't worry about the political messages in the film. Go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid movie but not Oscar material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I attended an advance screening of "John Q", the new movie starring Denzel Washington. The movie, directed by Nick Cassavetes, is about a blue collar worker whose son needs a heart transplant, and whose insurance will not pay for it.Washington gives a solid performance as the boy's father, John Q. Fitzgerald. The movie is about how an ordinary citizen deals with extraordinary circumstances. Washington went to great lengths to prepare for this role. He spent three months with factory workers learning their job, even though only a few brief scenes take place at his place of work. The preparation shows, as he manages to "stay in character" and capture the mind-set of the American factory worker. Anne Heche (Ms. Payne), the hospital administrator. Ray Liotta (the Chief of Police) and Robert Duvall (Police negotiator) give capable performances in supporting roles.The movie highlights the plight of Americans in need of reliable insurance. Nearly 50 million Americans have no health insurance coverage at all. Also, several million "working poor" have inadequate coverage. 7000 Americans died last year while waiting for organ transplants. Hopefully, the movie will bring increased public attention to these issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cloying, but very effective tearjerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to get into a free screening of this film expecting the worse in Hollywood sentimentality. Instead we got some of the best of Hollywood sentimentality care of the only major star that could pull this off: Denzel Washington. The initial portion of the story was cloying, as it beat you over the head with how downtrodden the family was, but they were careful to point out that cliches are called cliches for a reason; they happen.Once he takes the hospital, you realize that you have your typical motley band of characters inside the hospital, and the usual suspects outside the hospital. You are aware that this is the usual Hollywood setup, but the pacing is so good, the writing is competent and the casting was done so well, that you are still massively entertained as John Q pleads his case. Eddie Griffin really stands out as a good example of this. It's obvious that he's there for comic relief, but it's heavily implied that he's probably the most sagacious one in the room. And he's written for SO well, that everything he said lit up the crowd.For the first half of this movie, I couldn't believe that Anne Heche would take a role like this, in the current state of her career and public opinion, but as her character progressed (easily the most annoying stock character), it made a little more sense. I did like the usual glory-seeking police chief (Liotta) and wise old negotiator (Duvall) situation. It starts off with the usual and ties up in a little better than the usual way. It was also weird to see Ted Demme on Politically Correct in a commentary on health care in a movie about a kid with a bad heart, right after he passed on due to a heart attack with cocaine in his system. (Call Alanis Morissette)But despite deep casting of talent, this movie is about one thing: DENZEL WASHINGTON. I have always liked him. But in this movie, he is amazing. I realize it's hammy material, and maybe that's easier to get emotionally up for it, but he does it in such a human way, that I just can't imagine anyone else playing the role. Period.The political point of this movie (inadequate health care in this country) was pounded home at the end, but along the way you are really pounded on with emotional moments (not all of them manipulative). I tear up at movies a lot, especially when it comes to father-son moments, but not only did I tear up at least a dozen times in this movie, but I actually found myself wracked with sobs twice. By the time we got to the manipulative crying scene in the hospital, I was out of tears. (I managed to find some for the final scene however [my second wracked moment]). I consider myself a manly man, but I couldn't pretend that "I had something in my eye" for the ENTIRE length of the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a beautiful picture about a man who is fighting for his sick son. His son has a heart larger then normal and no one realized this until he went into cardiac arrest. John Q, played by the wonderful Denzel Washington, finds out, to his disbelief, that his insurance wont cover the operation to replace his sons heart, which means he must pay 30% of the fee upfront. He tries to raise the money only to find out they are releasing his son. This is where the Thriller part of the movie comes into play. After hearing this he takes the hospitals ER hostage and threatens to kill everyone unless his sons name is added to the heart donars list immediately. To make a long story short this movie is DEFINATELY worth the $10 USD to see it..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful message without any bloody violence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS... BEWARE!A hostage-drama perhaps, but this film definitely has a message, perfect for one of the conventional societal flaws and grievances. Let us not pretend that HMOs are a solution to a community's medical needs; let us not pretend that the HMOs plans, offered by most corporations, don't have abundance of regulations attached. And we can't disagree that HMO subscribers are usually those who can hardly put out three hearty daily meals on their dining table!In this movie, our everyday low wage earner is John Q, a family man who can't even find full employment. That John Q doesn't even realize that his medical insurance has changed does sound credible to me. Just think of those volumes of Employee Medical Benefits' manuals and brochures given out by Corporations, and which need to be read annually. Remember, this John Q does not belong to Ivy League class? just an average, responsible and hardworking guy, facing rough times. An adoring father with high hopes for his young son! Yep, it's credible to see John Q so deeply torn to find out that his son must die due to society's unethical medical practices toward the working poor. I'm not for John Q taking anybody hostage to fulfill his demands, but I'm overwrought with empathy and compassion for this guy.Nick Cassavetes has done a superb job, presenting John Q character as a good man who has tried everything possible to get his son a much-need surgery. And Denzel Washington's performance is impressively tops, giving the viewers an understanding that his titular hero character is indeed crushed so harshly against the wall to warrant insane acts? this is a father willing to make crucial sacrifices to keep his son alive! Is his criminal act justifiable? Of course not! But could anyone say that his desperate character is evil? Absolutely not! He uses a weapon that definitely won't work; he does show compassion toward his hostages. Washington's acting talent provides plenty throughout the film to support his character's moods and actions. I was mesmerized with his character, emotionally! The roles, played by an overall recognizable cast of actors are lame, compared to Washington's. However, I feel that they are necessary to keep the scenes moving.Is it necessary for the film to turn the media and the public watchers into a circus of mad-hatters applauding John Q's distasteful act? That, I think is rather cheesy! And is it fair for the story to imply that those, responsible for violating the honor of the Hippocratic Oaths, are the doctors and the hospital's senior administration? I would have loved to see James Kearn's script include the unethical tactics of lawyers and insurance companies, as well as the performance of unqualified hospital employees, as a foundation for the degrading health system. Yet, overall, the plot does inevitably support the idea that there are definite cracks to the system. The momentary comedic scenes in the film are truly welcoming to prevent boredom to seep into the film.The last quarter of the film does bring some surprises to the eventful scenes. The intensity of the story may have reduced, but I still couldn't stop the flow of my tears! Definitely a good tear-jerking movie to recommend! And watching Denzel Washington's performances is truly worth the price of a tix!</fullReview>

The first hour or so of the movie is just so boring, and the acting by Woods and the other doctor is just bad. This is more of a bad TV movie not a 30 million dollar budget movie lol. Seriously, the part where DW rips his gun out on the Doctor to take everyone hostage is completely out of nowhere, the buildup by DW's character until that point, does NOT warrant his actions. He could've done a way better job at making his character more believable but maybe that's asking too much of him considering he usually plays the same type of roles in every movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington, who has won 2 Academy Awards and has been nominated an additional three times, gives an incredible performance in this memorable movie. Practically unheard-of to most people, John Q is not just an average movie in that it succeeds its goal of drawing emotions. A comedy intends to bring out happiness. A horror intends to bring out fear, and a drama intends to bring out suspense and often sadness. John Q is able to bring out every emotion it intended. Viewers will be on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what happens next with an unlikely hero and the most important moments of his life. Viewers will love this movie.Although the story line seems somewhat disreputable (making the bad guy out to be a hero), you can't help but side with John Q and cheer him on because you realize what he stands for. He stands for justice and equality, he stands for life and honor, and he stands for mankind. The message of the movie is simple. Everyone deserves life.I hope that anyone who can agree with the above statement watches this movie. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without reservation, I can recommend that any Denzel Washington film is worth your time, and that most will be memorable experiences. OK, maybe not License to Kill.This film is certainly topical with Michael Moore's Sicko opening this weekend. It is about a father, with insurance, trying to get treatment for his son and the uncaring health care industry. This film is trying to get the same message across by using tense drama to make it's point.James Woods (Ghosts of Mississippi, Salvador) is incredible as the surgeon that is obsessed with money. Anne Heche (Six Days Seven Nights, Girls in Prison) is also great as the seemingly uncaring hospital administrator. Ray Liotta (Copland, Goodfellas) and Robert Duvall (The Godfather) also put in good performances. Those who checked out Nancy Drew will recognize Laura Harring, and those who saw The Notebook will recognize David Thornton. They play a couple that definitely provide some interesting entertainment during the siege of the ER. There are cameos from a lot of real people like Jay Leno and Bill Maher.If you ever had trouble with your health insurance company, you will like John Q. If you like Denzel, you will love John Q. His performance her is comparable to Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. Just see it, and then go see Sicko.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Washington Delivers An Amazing Perfromance In An Average Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this in theaters and found it to be quiet good. Denzel Washington finally gets a good role and is able to work with it to his liking.John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a down-on-his-luck worker. He's about to be evicted from his home, he doesn't earn enough money, and is soon driven to the point of breaking. While at his sons (Mike) baseball game, the boy is overcome with convulsions. He is rushed to a hospital but his insurance coverage does not cover a heart transplant. He tries everything he can but can't get the money. He soon takes drastic measures as he takes twenty or so people hostage and takes over the ER at the hospital to get the transplant. Among the people is Dr. Raymond Turner (James Wood), a man who wishes John luck but can't give his son the transplant. Soon the situation turns into a police stand-off under the command of Lt. Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Chief Gus Munroe (Ray Liotta). As the film progresses, impossible situations pop up from the hostages supporting him to John offering to kill himself so his son can have his heart. The film is a crusade against the American health system and though he portrays its message well, some scenes are just to impossible to believe. Washington delivers his best performance since Glory (1989). He is powerful in some scenes and emotionally affected in others. The acting in all is good, a good supporting cast and some well filmed scenes. This is a fine thriller, nothing to special just good.John Q. Starring: Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, Anne Heche, James Wood, and Kimberly Elise.3 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington did an amazing job at times during this movie. His best moments came when he talked to his hospitalized son on the phone, when he visited his son in person, and when he showed compassion to the people in the emergency room--despite what he was doing to them.The premise of the movie was a little strange, but like Michael Douglas in 'Falling Down', John Q was merely a character getting to do what many of us might have fantasized about. This movie didn't recommend that we take actions such as John Q did--there were consequences.Where the movie really got off track was in the press coverage ('How's my hair?') and in the actions the police wanted to take (there were elections coming up, after all).Anne Heche was so cold and unfeeling as the hospital administrator who could have given more help to John Q. James Woods did fine as the doctor who would have operated, and Robert Duvall was good as the cop who tried to be in charge.If anything, the movie pointed out the difficulties people have with inadequate insurance coverage, or companies that deny coverage when they shouldn't. And it is made clear John Q made every effort to get things done the normal way--his problems were simply made worse by (I am hoping) people who were less compassionate than those real people would likely have met in such a situation.</fullReview>

This typical three-act Hollywood play draws out with nary a hint of divergence from the formula that has been drawn up and mixed for countless other similar hostage flicks. Funny the comparisons brought out between Denzel and Sam Jackson in down-on-their-luck black men movies. Remember "The Negotiator" with Kevin Spacey where Jackson takes a roomful of hostages? That movie--in addition to Jackson himself--was much better and it contained a far more believable scenario than "John Q." Still, taken on its own rather limited terms, "John Q" is an enjoyable film. Denzel seems substantially to be slumming in this role and half the time seems to be cracking jokes for the camera--but maybe that's a testament to his acting strengths. This movie makes numerous assumptions about how stupid its audience is and how willing it is to endure fanciful generalizations about the seriously broken healthcare system we have in this country. The fact that healthcare costs are increasing ANNUALLY at several times inflation is an indication that the crisis in this nation is far deeper than this movie could ever hope to analyze. Instead, it goes for rah-rah moments and a really, really obvious ending. Somehow, still, at the end I found myself enjoying the movie. Perhaps that's a testament to how little I am expecting of formula Hollywood movies with formula Hollywood actors. Or perhaps that I'm dumb enough not to want much more than the happy ending. Basically I think it's a worthy popcorn and rental movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bombastic and predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not for Denzel Washington's charismatic performance John Q wouldn't even cut it as a TV movie of the week. Bombastic, predictable and utterly unbelievable, the story of a man who takes a hospital hostage to get his son's name on a heart transplant list, has its priorities skewed. The hospital officials, the doctors and the police are the bad guys, while the guy who waves around a gun, kidnaps an emergency room full of people and generally makes a nuisance of himself is hailed as a hero. He does it for the love of his son, so I guess that is supposed to make everything OK. James Woods and Robert Duvall do some grade `A' scenery chewing and seem to be having a good time despite the lousy dialogue. Ray Liotta, on a bit of a career comeback these days overacts his way through his scenes, while Anne Heche seems to be almost completely without any emotion whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film NEEDS a doctor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the recipient of a kidney transplant, I was not really surprised to see that almost nothing about this film was accurate. The whole phony plot line that a hospital wouldn't perform a heart transplant on Washington's son until he raised thousands of dollars should tip most people off. If a patient can't afford an organ transplant, Medicare will pay for it. Likewise the idea that a perfect donor match would become available within 24 hours is almost too laughable to contemplate. Most transplant patients wait a minimum of two to three years for their donor organ. You don't receive an organ because your dad is holding the ER hostage; you receive it after you've been on the UNOS list long enough to accumulate a certain amount of points. You also have to wait until a suitable tissue match is available. Organ transplantation is an extremely complicated process and this film could have done a lot to educate people as to the lack of donor organs in this country. Instead, it was a ridiculous play for a national health care program. If you like the Postal Service, you'll love nationalized health care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, John Q goes for the easy cliche almost every time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I delayed watching this movie from the simple fact that the previews gave me the impression that this was a "squashed squirrel." There are two ways to elicit emotion: 1) provide a cliche device, such as a squashed squirrel (who won't go "awwww" when seeing a small animal hurt?), or 2) earn your audience emotions by providing them with honest writing and believable situations. Unfortunately, John Q goes for the easy cliche almost every time.Denzel Washington is an excellent actor and try as he might, he simply can't escape from the script. At every turn he's handed another maudlin easy out. And that's really a shame because the topic addresses some fairly tough questions. There was real opportunity to provide a rich story filled with interesting dialog regarding the U.S healthcare system. Instead we're presented with stereotypes of the "rich doctor," the "mean hospital administrator" and the "gung ho cop." Been there, done that and I didn't care to see it the first time.Major talent is wasted as well. Robert Duvall's character, Lt. Frank Grimes, doesn't have enough material to even be effective as cast member. At the end of the movie, I was left wondering why we even needed his character - he had no arc and provided no real insight to the drama. Duvall is a fantastic character actor and he's given nothing to work with.The rest of the cast is mostly a mixed bag of good and bad. All Kimberly Elise can do is play anger as Denise Archibald, John's wife. Her performance was disappointing since her character had the most to work with. James Woods and Anne Heche can likewise do little in their roles than play the stereotypes that they've been given. However Eddie Griffin did standout as one of the more honest characters as Lester Matthews, one of the hostages. Granted, his role didn't require much of a stretch, but it was a breath of fresh air and one of the few redeeming elements of the movie.The bottom line is that James Kearns, the writer and co-producer, simply provided nothing but a sow's ear to the cast and no amount of magic was going to turn it into a silk purse. Kearns' work may have been appropriate for "Jake and the Fatman", or "Highway to Heaven", (he wrote for both TV series), but it simply wasn't up to snuff for the cadre of talent on the playbill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"John Q" stars Denzel Washington in the title role as a desperate father who takes a hospital emergency room hostage when he discovers that he can't pay for his son's heart transplant. You see John's situation is a lot more complicated than that. First off, the creditors have re-possessed one of his cars, he himself is unable to make ends meet with his family, and to make matters worse, the insurance company refuses to pay for the transplant. So what is John Q. going to do? Anything he can, even if it means putting his own life on the line.This is a truly memorable film that is definitely Oscar-worthy. Denzel Washington gives another performance worthy of an Oscar. The supporting cast which includes Robert Duvall, James Woods, Anne Heche, Kimberly Elise, and Ray Liotta, is good as well. I really like the villain here, which is not Denzel's character nor James' character, but our own health care system, which says that if you don't have any money, then we can't help you. Where does it say in our constitution that a price could ever be put on a human life? The answer: no where in it, as far as I can see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When John Q came out in theaters I wanted to see it. I had seen a trailer in LOTR for it, and when it came out it got some good reviews. I ended up waiting for it on DVD, and last night I finally saw it. It lived up to everything I thought. Although the film itself might not be Oscar material, Denzel Washington could've been nominated for an oscar for THIS role, instead of Training Day(which I haven't seen yet, but heard he actually wasn't as good in that film as John Q). His emotions play out on the screen, as do the tension between Robert Duvall's character Grimes, a hostage negotiator, and Ray Liota's character, the chief of police. When it all comes down to it, John Q delievers, and with some comedy relief a few times by Eddie Griffin, whom is a hostage, and John Q's friend who's always saying "'friggin," it also has some "relief points" in the film from the constant drama. Though some critics and moviegoers might think it's unrealistic how the hostages pretty much talk freely, they all know that John Q isn't going to kill them, because as the movie shouts at people, everyone who meets him realizes John Q wouldn't hurt a fly. This movie's worth the rental. Pick it up, you won't be let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll probably come across as heartless in writing this review, and that's not what I'm going for. My wife began laughing at this movie about five minutes in and I got mad at her for not giving the movie a chance. Well, I soon joined her. I guess this movie just didn't sink in with me.It's not that the premise of the movie is that bad. The idea of someone making a movie about health care reform doesn't bother me at all. The thing that bothers me about this movie is that it uses cliche after cliche ad nauseam. Why did the director need to make it a Mack truck in the first scene? Why did the director make the "bad" doctor unsympathetic to the world until he was forced to change? Why did Ray Liotta need to be so over-the-top glory hungry? Why was the broadcast journalist the way he was? And the best question of them all, why did Denzel and Robert Duvall waste their time by being in this movie?This movie was just poorly directed, that's what I've decided. You can obviously tell there are some good actors to work with, but much like what George Lucas does with his actors in his films, this director somehow managed to mess things up a little. I felt at times that I was watching an intervention program instead of a movie. I felt bad sitting in the movie with many people who actually enjoyed it. I really tried to give it a chance, and I guess I can understand how this movie could be enjoyable to others, but it certainly didn't work with me. Pretty brutal movie if you ask me.</fullReview>

Anne Heche doesn't look like an administrator of a hospital that grosses hundreds of millions every year, and her wardrobe? Yuck! Denzel does a super job as usual, and some of the supporting cast is good, but most roles are shallow. I was most disappointed with Robert Duvall's role.

		<fullReview>John Archibald is a normal working man with a young son, a wife working as a waitress and a job in an industry that has seen a downturn and reduced him to 20 hours a week. With money problems already weighing heavily on their minds, John and Denise have even more to worry about when they learn that their young son has an enlarged heart and will die within months unless he has a surgery. Knowing his insurance covers him, John gives the go ahead, only to learn that his policy has changed and no longer covers this type of work ? meaning the hospital want to open a cash account for $250,000, an amount that might as well be $25million to the Archibalds. Appeals for funding, selling of every asset they have and appeals to the hospital still leave him short by tens of thousands of dollars. With his son about to be discharged to slowly die at home, John goes to the hospital with a gun and chains and takes control of the emergency room, holding hostages until his son is added to the transplant list and operated on.With 40 million people in the biggest country in the world unable to get national health care and the 2004 US electorate rejecting a man who offered to make it available to all in favour of a man who wasn't going to do that, health care in the US is a big issue and, for a citizen of the UK, a bewildering one. While the NHS is hardly brilliant, at least those 'have-nots' can still get good care even if the 'haves' can get it better and quicker ? so how the US can continue with its current system is beyond me, probably the fact that nobody wants to pay taxes for it and is happy to hope that it will never be them in that situation, maybe, I don't know. Anyway, as far as I know this is the first 'big' film that has really tackled the subject and in doing so it is worth seeing because, although it is very much exaggerated to support its own case, it still makes a strong argument and highlights the failing of the system to the people. However because it is making a stand it cannot help playing it to the hilt and really overdoing it. Still hard to really not share its view if you meet it on its own terms but this heavy preaching does rather detract from the rest of the film.Trying to do a Dog Day Afternoon with the issues, the plot cannot manage to keep the tension going and doesn't have the material to really do as well as it should have done. At times it is gripping, engaging and convincing but then at other times it is cringe-worthy, soapy, embarrassing and melodramatic. It is this way too often and it never gets close to being of the same quality as Dog Day Afternoon and at times it totally fails to hit the right notes and comes across as silly and hard to get into as a result. It still just about works but it asks a lot of the audience and at times I felt it was asking too much of me. A big reason that the film managed to keep me on board was that Washington tries as hard as he possible can to make the material work. Of course with the material he had his performance was never going to be perfect but what parts of it are solely down to him he does well. He convinces in his part and he almost manages to make the silly stuff in thee material work thanks to his earnest performance. Likewise Duvall and Liotta are pretty good but they exist on the 'thriller' side of the film and are not well served because this film never manages to be The Negotiator! They, like Woods and Heche all try hard but it is the overly preachy material that lets them down and drags the film down. Griffin adds a bit of comic relief but with everything else going on you have to wonder whether or not he was needed. Overall this was an interesting film that has a worthy point to hammer home ? shouldn't the richest country in the world be able to provide health care to its populace without letting them sort it out themselves? However it really pushes this point in extremes to the detriment of everything else. Trying to be a thriller is not the same as being a thriller and, despite having good moments, generally it gets slowed down by the melodramatic moments that don't work and some really poor dialogue in the script. A worthy message but an average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tounge In Cheek Movies About Health Care.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie John Q public fails to expose or shed any light onto the real issues that faces America's health insurance system. The film is full of hyperbole and misconceptions. Yes the United States does not have a universal health care system for all its citizens like Canada or the UK. However, in those countries taxes are very high, and elective surgery is not even heard of. Even minor critical surgery takes anywhere from 3-6 months even before you get to see a doctor for a consult. This film only uses buzz words, sound bites, and MTV images of popular shows like "Late Night Show with Leno, and Politically Incorrect" to strengthen a slippery of a slope argument that many Americans and film watcher have not researched. The concept of reality is missing with this film. What about the millions of dollars the government subsidizes for research for new medication, and health services. Let's forget about the government and privately funded free clinics that are in rural and inner-city areas. In my opinion this film is weak in a premise, and fails to address anything remotely concerning modern day health care. Thank you, Denzel for bad film trying to address present day issues. As if there were not enough of them out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing but a fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers!!!!! JOHN Q. is a great fantasy film for any angry person who has dealt with the harsh reality of the healthcare industry in this nation. I am a nurse who deals with angry, bewildered, disbelieving people every day whose doctors run tests, offer false hope, and eventually give the worst case scenario to crying, grieving, angry family members. So I see this film as a "What if???" fantasy that people can watch and cheer, but it's not reality. I hope everyone realizes that. It's only a story, conjured up by someone who wanted to make a hero movie.John Archibald is a husband and father whose car has been repo'd and whose job has been downgraded from full to part time, due to corporate budget cuts. This is reality. His son, a seemingly healthy nine year old, suddenly collapses while playing baseball and they find out he has congestive heart failure. Nobody goes into why or how this condition surfaced. It could be that it is acute and idiopathic (cause unknown). John and his wife meet with the cardiac surgeon (James Woods) and the administrator of the hospital (Anne Heche) and are almost immediately talked out of the very expensive and RISKY procedure of heart transplantation. The reason??? Money. John's job has insurance but the coverage is through an HMO, and transplantation, which runs to about 250 grand, is not included in the coverage. John has no real money of his own in stocks, bonds, trusts, etc. so he and his wife are basically handed down a death sentence. Your son is going to die without a new heart...new hearts are expensive...you don't have the money required...your son is going to die...say goodbye to him now and make his last days count...The reality ends here. We are immediately TOLD to point a finger of indignation, blame, hate, contempt and general rancor at the hospital administrator. She is brought across as greedy, unfeeling, smug, and only thinking of the bottom line. The filmmakers fail to say that the real deal was that she has a boss too and that she has to follow rules or she loses her job. The cardiac surgeon is depicted as a money monger who would rather be out golfing, who only loves his patients if they have plenty of money, who is so shallow and material that he worries about his new designer suit more than saving a patient's life. Without being given a freedom of choice, we are only given the negatives in some characters, while John Q. is presented without a single flaw. He's a loving devoted father who would do anything for his child...even break the law. I'm sorry, to threaten the lives of other people, whether they are good or bad, because you're angry at the system for not helping your child, is wrong. Is John Q's child more valuable than the lives of those he held hostage...no...and to tell the audience that he is is wrong. And instead of presenting the administrator and the surgeon as villains, this movie could have been presenting an insurance administrator heading the HMO as a cold unfeeling villain...that at least would have been a bit more realistic. Why pin the scarlet letter onto people who are only doing their job??? Why not trash and bash the HMOs???We are introduced to several disgusting one dimensional characters...a punk who beats on his girl, a stupid, arrogant police chief, and a wanna be gangsta dork who says stupid things like, "It's called a hippocratic oath...or more like hippocritical oath, right Doc???" Leave the doctor alone!!! He is TOLD how to do his job by the HMOs and if he donated all his time to charity cases, he would have no money, he'd be out on the street, and then NOBODY would get health care. Let's face reality people.At the end, the hospital decides to pay for the entire transplant because John Q. got himself on TV, the media jumped on it like a pack of hyenas, and the police made asses of themselves trying to off him and save the day, while thousands of nose picking spectators jeered and booed that baddies and cheered good ol' John and hailed him as a hero. What a crock. Mean Ol' Administrator turns into a sweet caring lady with tears rolling down. Surgeon agrees to do the transplant out of generosity and good faith because John Q. believes the hospital has enough money coming in as it is. How precious indeed. Everyone turns into sweet precious good-doers and Little Mikey is saved.Naturally we are never told that even with transplantation, Mikey is not out of the woods. His body could suddenly reject that heart and put him right back into the hospital, right back into the same predicament. Also his brain and liver might have been severely damaged and then he might have to have a brain or liver transplant!!!Let's hope that hospital didn't go broke on this charity case, especially if Mike did reject the heart!!!In reality, John Q. is either shot, arrested and imprisoned for WAY MORE THAN TWO OR THREE YEARS, and his son dies. And the HMOs go on their merry way, doing what they do best, making big bucks.Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. His performance was very good of course. Robert Duvall is a great actor. Anne Heche and James Woods are terrific. Kimberly Elise is impressive. Even the little boy is a good actor. But the material is enormously infantile, unrealistic, annoying and insults any rational person's intelligents. It's just a good fantasy to watch if you're an angry patient or family member that the health care system let down hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must surely rank as one of Denzel Washington's weakest movies ever. Pretty much everything else he's done I have enjoyed immensely and so I rented this expecting something of high calibre. What I got instead was a silly movie with silly performances and a silly storyline that didn't really make much sense.Washington is John Q. Archibald, a down on his luck factory worker whose son desperately needs a heart transplant that the hospital refuses to give him because of insufficient medical coverage. Frantic to get his son the attention he needs, Archibald takes the emergency room hostage, demanding that his son be "put on the list."Let me say first that I agree with the political viewpoint of the movie. Having said that, if I wanted a debate on the merits of public vs. private health care I'd listen to politicians debate the issue. I don't watch a movie to hear a campaign speech, and yet this movie sounds like one long campaign speech (Sen. Hilary Clinton even appears speaking to the issue.) It really did get to be too much. At one point the hostages in the emergency room start to debate the issue! One would think that they might have had other things on their minds - like whether they'd ever see their families again! Performances ranged from barely acceptable (Washington) to silly (Paul Johansson as a truly irritating TV news reporter, Robert Duvall as the police negotiator who seems to be having a great time during this whole thing and Ray Liotta as the basically weak and incompetent police chief) to just downright bad casting (Ann Heche as the tough as nails heartless hospital administrator?!) And the story? Well, one of the police officers explained the basic problem best. John Q is holding the hostages until his son is "put on the list." Well - why not just tell him his son is on the list? Seems to me it would have solved a lot of the problems. I guess that's why I'm not a screen writer. I think scripts should make at least some sense.Honestly - it's just a bad movie. The first bad movie I think I've ever seen Denzel Washington in. Well, even Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak came to an end.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie of the year (so far, that is)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSFooled you ... I could give spoilers like James Woods is greedy, Anne Heche is cold, James Thornton is a hick, and Denzel, well, he's unplausably likeable. Many people have mentioned Dog Day Afternoon is a better film already, so I guess you don't need me to tell you that. What you do need to know is that since it's a happy movie, you will guess the plot in 2 minutes. But then again, if you in were in suspense during this film, you probably didn't notice that it's just logistically impossible to do a heart transplant within 1 hour in an emergency trauma room (where they stock bandages, not gallons of spare blood), that hearts don't get shipped straight to hospitals, and that the heart isn't the only organ in the chest cavity (was that kid's chest just the worst prop you've ever seen?). Thankfully, the only casualty suffered in this film was your intellect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even Denzel can save this misguided, at-the-end-of-one's-rope drama that gets progressively sillier and sillier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the introductory scene of a pretty young female motorist weaving capriciously in and about menacing semis accompanied by a strange, lush score, one smells trouble early on. But, you say, a movie with Denzel Washington at the acting helm will automatically right itself and avoid the obvious curves and potholes that could lead to disaster, right? Nope. Both the lady and the film are D.O.A.Direction, writing and performances are so wretched, I found myself unintentionally laughing at its most serious of intentions.Washington plays a struggling, low-to-middle class income factory worker with a working wife (supermarket checker) and son. At the beginning of the movie we see one of the family cars getting repossessed and dad scouting out a second job due to cut-backs at work. Things get so bad the cute youngster even offers dad his $46 dollar allowance savings. I guess the family that pays together, stays together.Anyway, all seens endurable until the young Little League whippersnapper suffers thumper problems while running from first to second base (or was it second to third?) after hitting a line drive. Rushed to the hospital, the parents find out their son has an enlarged heart and needs a transplant very soon in order to survive. Trouble is, Denzel's insurance (remember, he's part time now) won't cover the $200,000 plus, and he and the Mrs. are destitute.And the treacly dramatics that were tolerable up to this point now go haywire. What we really end up with is a movie that pushes for health insurance reform. To HMO or not to HMO: that is the question. Well, gosh, if that's all, why not just a "20/20" featurette?After the big bad hospital tells Denzel his son has to to be released due to it's strict "no-money, no-heart" policy, our hero goes ballistic and holds the entire emergency room at gunpoint until his son is put on a donor's list. In a series of bad moves, the movie dissolves into a massive, gooey mess that strains reality with every heart beat. Hostages rooting for Denzel, the swarming public rooting for Denzel, the wife rooting for Denzel, the bad, bad administration now rooting for Denzel. Everyone's rooting for Denzel...except the script.The always charismatic Washington looks so focused here, he doesn't realize he's in such a stinker. But Robert Duvall, as a hostage negotiator, sure does, and he looks mighty uncomfortable. And for good reason. His at-odds scenes with an over-the-top Ray Liotta, as a press-hungry Chief of Police, are ridiculous and superficial. Kimberly Elise as Denzel's wife may have a couple of true moments as Denzel's emotive wife but hardly enough. Anne Heche too is given short shrift as a "heartless" hospital administrator. Amazingly, this is a top-notch roster of stars and each and everyone comes off like a rank amateur.The most laughable moments are saved for the hospital emergency room where Denzel holds hostage a motley crew of staff, security, patients, and (apparently) bad actors, including the usually terrific James Woods -- not-so-terrific as the hospital cardiologist. These are among the worst group crisis scenes I have encountered since "The Poseidon Adventure" thirty years ago.A major crash and burn for the usually reliable Denzel. He offers his heart (literally!) to this picture and the tears seem real enough, but the deck is stacked. A poor choice of roles right after his award-winning "Training Day." And director Nick Cassavetes shows none of the genius expected as the son of legendary director John."John Q" should not be foisted on the public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>destroyed by cheap melodramatics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`John Q' deals with the issue of what happens to people in this country who - when serious life threatening illnesses hit them or their loved ones - suddenly discover that their insurance will not pay for their medical care. This is certainly a serious and important issue, one which deserves to be addressed in a cinematic forum that honors that seriousness. `John Q' does not, unfortunately, provide such a forum. It does, in fact, insult both its subject matter and its audience by resorting to cheap and tawdry melodramatics to get its point across.Watching `John Q' is like being hit in the face with a two-by-four. The movie starts off with the death of a woman in a car accident. Then it introduces us to the Archibald family, consisting of John Q. (Denzel Washington) - a blue collar factory worker whose work load has been so sparse lately that even his wife's car has been repossessed - his devoutly religious spouse, Denise, and their bright-eyed boy, Michael, who it turns out, has a seriously damaged heart that requires immediate replacement if the boy is to survive longer than a few months. Overwhelmed with despair, the couple discovers that the hospital refuses to foot the bill for the transplant operation when it is discovered that John's insurance is not quite as `comprehensive' as he was led to believe. Faced with the grim possibility of his only son's death, John decides to take matters into his own hands and masterminds a violent takeover of the hospital's emergency room, a scenario that comes replete with all the hostages, hostage negotiators and media hoopla that are so familiar to us from the seemingly hundreds of other films we have seen working in this formula.Despite a plotline that, by its very nature, exudes sanctimoniousness, `John Q' might have been a tolerable film had it been able to stay true to its theme and explored, in a serious, believable way, the problem it is trying to address. But once John forces his way into the emergency room, the film loses all credibility and we have nowhere to go but into the realm of cheap Hollywood fantasy. It's as if the filmmakers felt that the only way such a human drama could hold our attention is if they turned it into a clichéd exploitation film full of the kind of ridiculous interpersonal squabbling and last-minute reprieves that only serve to remind us that what we are watching is not real life but a hopelessly contrived fictional scenario. An impressive cast (Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Anne Heche, Ray Liotta, Kimberley Elise) is set adrift on a sea of narrative implausibilities, frequently unmotivated actions and phony sentimental uplift. Heche plays the chief hospital administrator so coldhearted and unsympathetic that she makes Cruella Deville look like Mary Poppins in comparison - a fact that makes her complete emotional turnabout utterly inexplicable in the context of her character. Duvall, as the seasoned hostage negotiator, and Liotta, as the chief-of-police concerned only with the next election, engage in a conventional power-play scrimmage over strategy that is as boring as it is predictable. Woods plays his umpteenth version of the heartless cad, here as the surgeon who can't bring himself to see what all the fuss is about. And, of course, all of John's captives by the end have sworn their loyalties and allegiances to John's cause - as has the crowd of common folk watching the drama unfold both from behind the barricades set up on the street in front of the hospital and at their sets at home.`John Q' never misses an opportunity to level a cheap shot at people it doesn't like. For instance, as counterpoint to what is happening to John and his family, the film shows us a man who HAS been able to secure a heart transplant. He is, of course, not merely white and apparently rich, but he also has a giddy, bimbo wife, both of whom seem blithely unaware of anyone else's fortunes but their own. Somehow, we just KNOW that this man did not deserve the transplant he received, and we are given every indication that he will never make the best of it in the way little Michael would if he were just given the opportunity. The film also takes the usual easy swipes at the media - although in a way the media turns out to be John Q's salvation - by portraying the consumer action reporter on the scene as an effete, vain, self-centered opportunist who sees this story as his `own white bronco.' The film always seems to want to have it both ways and, as a result, it ends up being true to nothing.The pain that John and his family are going through is certainly palpable and it is one that is undoubtedly shared by many other people the world over - and the issue of inadequate healthcare is one that needs to be seriously addressed, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, merely trying to transfer `Dog Day Afternoon' to an emergency room setting is not the best dramatic means for getting that noble point across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Script - Good Acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERS - I saw "John Q." Thurs. night (Feb 7th) in Washington D.C. and I had never seen the trailer and saw the poster on the way in, so I didn't know much going in.We are introduced to John Q. Archibald (Denzel Washington) who plays a factory worker that just got his hours cut to part time status because of work being slow. Denise Archibald (Kimberly Elise) works as a grocery store clerk (although we never see her working) and is worried because the bills are falling behind and John's vehicle had just been towed because of not making the monthly payments. As John puts it, it was between not paying the vehicle or not paying the house payment. Mike Archibald (Daniel E. Smith) plays their son who plays little league baseball.Mike is up to bat and hits what appears to be a single. Mike is called safe at 1st base, and while the 1st baseman is arguing with the ump - Mike decides to run for 2nd. In the process, he collapses. Instead of waiting for an ambulance, John and Denise take Mike to the local hospital. It turns out Mike needs a heart transplant because his heart is 3 times larger than it should be. John's insurance won't cover this, and Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) and Dr. Turner (James Woods) gives Denise and John their options. The heart transplant will cost $250,000, $75,000 of that up front. So, Denise and John start to sell everything - and even get a collection going at church. When Denise finds out Mike will be released because of money not being given to the hospital, John decides to take the hospital hostage. There are many patients inside, everything from a woman having a baby to Lester (Eddie Griffen) having what appears to be broken fingers.So - the standoff begins. John wants one thing - to get his son on the top of the donor list.I thought the script was poorly written but the actors that are used in this do a good job with it. There were some things in this movie that were far fetched and this kind of movie has been done before. It will make money for two reasons, one because it is PG-13 (and rightfully so, very little language, some violence) and Denzel is a big draw. The audience clapped at least 5 times. It is 111 minutes long, and moves at a good pace, but some things simply didn't fit. I give it a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

I don't care if there's supposed to be a 'greater good' in all this because the ends do not justify the means.Of course, if it doesn't fall within their own political point of view, then they'd probably abhor those actions done by individuals and groups who don't share their social agenda. In other words it's more of the same; "my 'freedom fighter' is better than your 'terrorist'" garbage.How pathetic and sad it is that some viewers of this film have political blinders on and support criminal actions in order to make a point.Grade: F</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's More Surprising?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's more surprising about this movie, the fact that it was so awful, or that so many great actors got roped into this Hollywood babble?The movie is about a father, John Archibald (Denzel Washington) who goes to extreme measures after his young son has a heart failure. After being rejected by their insurance company and the hospital, Archibald decides to hold the hospital hostage so that his son can be saved.I felt like I was being preached to and being force-fed immature stereotypes, that doctors are soulless puppets for insurance companies, that insurance companies are evils, that health care should be universal, that cops are incapable and stupid, blah blah blah. The problem is that instead of showing us the moral of the story through a mature combination of cinematography, acting, set design and dialog, screenwriter James Kearns forces the garbage down our throats as the characters in the room babble their views for two hours. Not even the tremendous acting of Denzel Washington could save this movie.The most thrilling aspect was that so many great actors (Washington, Liotta, Woods, Duvall) were in this movie. The film desperately tries to show the duality of life and tries to answer the question how one life is worth compared to another, but its done so immaturely that it's baffling. The movie proves that even with an all-star cast, a poor script and poor directing can ruin the whole thing. Waste of time.2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, but soured by Big Brother politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason Denzel Washinton didn't get Best Actor for this film is because he won for his role in Training Day. The story was also excellent, however the heavy-handed helping of Big Brother politics, largely at the end, leaves the viewer with the sense that they were duped into watching a propaganda film. The movie comes down hard on HMOs and its solution to the problem? A government run HMO where membership is mandatory! (I wonder if membership includes a uniform?) This movie makes you think, but not in the intended direction: If health care is a right and not just a need, isn't Denzel denying thousands their right to health care by taking a huge multimillion dollar salary and spending it all on himself? Did New Line Cinema donate all of the profits on this movie to medical charity or did those involved walk away with hefty salaries and BMWs? "Rights" mean people are guaranteed legal protection to engage in a certain activity, so in a society where welfare is somehow considered a "right", others must actively supply goods and services to fulfill that "right". Therefore, since "40 million people" don't have health care coverage people who spend any money on themselves on luxury items are denying another their right to health care! Unfortunately for New Line and Denzel, this is not the kind of thoughts they wanted people to leave the movie with, but when your film makes hundreds of millions in revenue, who care if your intent goes through?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Emotive Story About Saving Someones Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started to watch this movie with no big expectations and minimal knowledge about the plot. I was surprised about how this movie was good and emotional overall. Denzel Washington is very convincing in his role of father who is fighting for his son's life. And may others stars appears here, which is second best by Robert Duvall in role of the mature cop. I didn't liked Ray Liotta very much because he doesn't fit somehow. James Woods was sympathetic in role of non emotional doctor.I wondering in the half of the movie, what the opening scene have with the rest of the movie and the plot. And then I realized suddenly. Woman who had an accident in opening scene will donate the heart to the young boy. I think that this is very intelligent detail of the movie.I also noticed that this movie has a lots of similarities with the old classic movie Dog Day Afternoon with Al Pacino in main role. Both movies are about negotiating about some service with the cops in the closed building. In Dog Day Afternoon it was bank, in John Q it was hospital. In one there was money in case, in other there was free heart for surgery. This movie among the lots of emotions also contains a lot of high tension scenes, like a sniper shot from ventilation or when John attempted to kill self and many others. It is typical end of this movie and I'm really satisfied about the end of the movie. I'm found to be very glad because it is not sad like I was expect it will be.Many dislike this movies because it is critic about 'American Health Insurance'. I'm not American, I'm from Europe and I know that this movie is base on real health status in America. Familiar Michael Moore create a documentary about it and it's for sure that in America over 50 000 millions of people don't have the health insurance.OK, that was a little bit off topic. I can recommend this movie to all, especially if you are not American, because you will be more intrigued by the story.</fullReview>

The excellent acting of my favorite actor (Denzel Washington) makes you cry even if you don't use to cry at movies. John Quincy Archibald is a role-model of a human being with the same inner strength like Rubin "The Hurricane" Carter (also a personage in another movie of Denzel). This movie will make everyone of you to be a better man with stronger moral principles and more kind. After this movie you will HATE bureaucracy and everything that has to do with it, and you will LOVE kindness between people with no interest for money or something else.</fullReview>

Everyone kind of just moaned at the thought of another movie until we were reassured it wasn't something related to Jesus. In that class we watch the weirdest stuff. Anyways, When we all found out we were going to be watching John Q we kinda got excited, and we were worried about crying for our next class.Denzel Washington playing the character John "Q" totally stole away my breath. He was so remarkable. His 9 year old son fell during a baseball game. During the x-rays it should to be somewhat of an enlarged heart. 3 times larger than the average 9 year olds' heart. Johns insurance will not cover the heart transplant because he is on HMO and they won't cover transplant surgeries.John sells everything he has to save money for this 250,000 dollar surgery. He takes the hospital on hostage until the doctor agrees to give his son the surgery because they were going to release his son when he paid the hospital 6,000 dollars the day before. He then finds out HMO pays the doctors a bonus check at the end of the year if they find something wrong but the doctors didn't tell the family.I was wondering if he was getting treated like this because he was a black male. Who hadn't had any previous knowledge of medical procedures like this. Since before he took the hospital hostage there was a white family the doctor was joking with and the husband just had the surgery. The whole time I was watching this movie I would wonder if I would do that for my family or how far I would go if my child needed a surgery like that or if my own family would do it for me.I recommend this to everyone and anyone.</fullReview>

But there is not none of it. The director of the film has chosen really good actors. Especially the performer of John Qincy Archibald perfectly plays his part.

		<fullReview>What I think about this movie is quiet good?Why? Well the problem in this family is their son is dying so they are trying to save him but that wouldn't be possible without money. So John did everything to save his son but the problem is that the money is everything which even goes beyond the basic humanities morale and that is very bad. So its better to have a family with a ill son who was later on cured and the father going to be freed from jail soon than to have a family with problems. And I think that this movie can teach us many things about morale so I recommends this movie to watched by all age to put a better morale in to the families society nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Q, Drama how it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to congratulate Denzel Washington in the role of John Archibald, his role as a desperate father fighting for his sons life is outstanding. The other actors also did a great job, creating an authentic atmosphere. I especially like the simplicity of the sets, when you come to think about it most of the movie plays in the waiting room of the hospital. Even more than that I was amazed of the complex characters and the way they develop as the story goes on and the way they interact with each other. So in the conversations not only the issue of an unfair health care system is discussed, but also racism, the ethical views of doctors in situations that are everything else than ethical as well as the propagandistic influence of the media on public opinion. I mean when John Q enters the hospital and is taking randomly hostages to force a new heart for his son through he is clearly a criminal, but as the reporters hit the scene, they shape the public view on this desperate gunman. So in the end he leaves the crime scene as a hero. Of course you may argue about the moral integrity of this certainly extreme measure. Can a single man take personal liberties away from innocent civilians to save a child's life? That is a question everyone has to answer for himself. I also don't want to discuss the main theme of the movie. I think the information given by the story is impulse enough to make up your own mind about the health care issue regarding poor citizens in the United States of America. The politics are one side of this movie. But more interesting, in my opinion, are the single hostages in the waiting room and how they develop relationships, to each other and to their hostage-taker. The way these individuals grow in this rather exceptional situation is remarking, a huge accomplishment of the actors and their astounding performance. So at last I can say that I would really recommend this movie to people who like good drama with convincing acting. You are going to have a few good laughs, a lot of sad moments(goose bumps guaranteed) and last but not least a critical view on the American health care system. Even though, I recommend you not to give too much thought to the discussion expressed in the film while watching it and save it up till after viewing it. That will give you the advantage of keeping the focus on the story and developments that take place at the moment.So enjoy the flick and I hope this review was helpful to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a musician called Charles Schuldiner. In December 2001 he died, suffering from a brain stern cancer. His story is comparable to John's son Mike. Because he didn't have any insurance company behind him, he was sentenced to pay all the medical stuff and surgeries by himself. There was only one surgery missing, perhaps a few medicals, too, as his money went out. That's how it works in the United States of America. Most people aren't able to pay the insurance and it might be a question of time when they would reach the point where the government divorces poor from rich people. I think "John Q." is a movie that's told to open people's eyes. Untypical for him, Denzel Washington plays the role of a father who only has the competition to make his family survive, to give them a home, something to eat and everything a family needs. As his son Mike gets a heart attack during a baseball match, the whole family seems to break down. Full of desperation, because Mike needs a new heart immediately, John tries to bring up the money to get him on a donor list, in a legal way. But nothing seems to work as he believed. Desiring that his "champ" would survive, he conquers a hospital and takes the workers - and some patients - as hostages. Unexpected, the whole city is on his side, everyone wishes him the best for his plan and, surely, for his boy. He even is ready to give up his own life to make Mike survive. A few seconds before he pulls the trigger of his gun, after ordering the doctor to put his heart into Mike, his wife hurries in, bringing the news that they found a heart for the boy. In the end John gets imprisoned for taking the hostages in the emergency room. In a fictional way "John Q." tells the stories of thousands and thousands of people, living or dying in the USA. These are the ones who might be worthless for all the great great people in the country. Their worth is addicted to the money they own and if they didn't have any, they are dead. Maybe today, maybe tomorrow or years later. But they are DEAD. Living corpses who are waiting for the illness they won't be able to pay. Where is the dream of the endless possibilities? It's hidden under a government of capitalism and war. It's buried under the earth of a state, where gas is cheaper than water, the only "modern" state although celebrating the death penalty. Perhaps America's leaders should think about their priorities. At least "John Q." gives a hint to them. I wish that every politician of the US recognizes the movie as an emergency call. It's your people, your nation and everyone of them has the right to take part of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Evidently, the script writer, possibly the director and cast too, has a big gripe with HMOs - canvassing an aspect that has been done to death: inadequacy of coverage. But in case you didn't know, this is nothing unique to HMOs. Virtually all private health insurance companies around the world offer policies where certain procedures or specialist consultations are excluded or the cost of coverage is capped in certain instances. In the rest of the world, all the important stipulations of the policy, such as this, are explained before the policy is taken out and is also provided to you in writing. By contrast, it seems that in the US, people never realise how much and what type of coverage they have with their HMO until a problem arises and they make a claim -which actually happens in this film. We see that Denzel "amazed" and "infuriated" when he finds out that he doesn't have enough coverage for a $250,000 operation. The old advice: "Keep yourself informed of your own affairs" undermines the point that these scene was trying to make, but oh well!! However, I'm not that cold hearted. I see that the film overall is trying to make a reasonably good point: when it comes to saving a child's life, why should our insurers/HMOs be quibbling over costs? And the best way to drill home this point is to show that it could (AND DOES) happen to anyone: perhaps a low level corporate employee on $45,000 - someone we would expect the HMOs to cover fully in such a situation. That would be a real "wake-up" call to everyone.But I felt that the lefties who bashed up this script couldn't help themselves and had to throw in all the old clichés and class warfare elements: Denzel's financially battling, we see his car get repossessed and his hours at work have been cut back to part time...and his health cover has been downgraded... blah blah blah. But he's a purely loving and caring father. In other words, the set up of Denzel's character is all a bit too-leftist-perfect for me to stomach. Further, all these clichés didn't really augment the major point of the film. In point of fact, it gave us an early glimpse of the political persuasion of the writers and as a result, you know how every supposed "twist" and "turn" will resolve itself! It's "predictable by political extension." Worse still, the film fails to deliver anyway and gets sillier and sillier. When John Q takes the ER hostage, you can see that the doctor, the hospital administrators, the policemen and the hostages were always going to wind up sympathising with John Q and in a loud Hollywood voice pronounce that "ENOUGH IS ENOUGH when it comes to these nasty mean HMOs." It's simply overcooked and the ending is more or less predictable. I suppose that holding up an ER and forcing it to shut down and turn away emergency patients is a very poignant and responsible way of getting things done. Of course, the film attempts to reel it's moral diversion back into line by acknowledging that Denzel will go to jail for this, but when you see his son smiling and thanking him at the end of the film, you sense that the writers don't really disapprove of his actions whatsoever. That is a bit troubling!Interestingly, though, there seems to be a major problem with the argument that they are trying to run throughout the film: there is a complete absence of any substantial criticism of the doctors, who refuse to even consider operating on the terminally ill child if his parents can't come up with $250,000 for a six hour procedure. For all that is said about lawyers, many (even good ones) will work pro bono or on contingent arrangements when a rare case arises. But when it comes to doctors, no sir-eee. It seems that they will refuse to lift a finger without being paid ridiculous fees in advance, even if an "innocent child's" life is on the line. Furthermore, this is one of those 1 in a 1000 operations, so you expect doctors to be "warm-hearted" enough to make some sort of exception or arrangement in the circumstances. But as this film shows, the doctors refuse and and they nonetheless escape a good deal of criticism. Instead, the writers heap it all on the HMOs and hospital admin; and even the hospital admin (led by Anne Heche) seems to come out of this mess smelling like a rose. Doctors are gods i suppose.As for the acting, Denzel did a reasonable job, but most other characters in the film were relatively wooden. I had no idea what the purpose of Ray Liotta's character was to this film, nor the tensions between him and Robert Duvall. It seemed to be very out of place or downright unnecessary. Heche and Woods were wooden. The hostages in the ER were the stereotypical gaggle of hostages and were rather unamuzing, uninteresting and ultimately unnecessary. And by the way, I understand the metaphor about the heart. ie... the HMOs and hospital admin are heartless, Denzel and his charitable community are warm-hearted and.... his son need a "heart" transplant. Any chance of being a bit more subtle with the use of symbolism and metaphor or are the writers so inherently patronising that they need to treat the audience like idiots and literally spell it out for them? Towards the end of the film, Denzel holds a gun to his head and is about to kill himself so that the doctors can take out his heart and put it in his son. By this stage, I wished that Denzel simply shot all the pathetic supporting cast, the director, the screenplay writer and anyone else remotely connected with this film before putting himself and this dismal film out of its misery.</fullReview>

Living a normal life till his son fell unconscious and was rushed to the hospital.They find out his heart grew too big in his rib cage or something and it would cost a fortune to do a surgery. And there aren't any available donors for a heart transfusion.If not then the kid doesn't have much time left to live.John Q is determine to save his son's life. Even if he has to something illegal.The film is rather dry and OK for a Drama movie. The second half of the movie got too far-fetched. And Diezel Washington did a better job in Remenbering the Titans than this sorry excuse for a movie.Not sure if it's a must see for all you Diezel Washington Fans.

		<shortDescription>Weak screenplay reduces a noble film into an insulting gallery of emotional and dramatic simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"John Q" takes on an issue that is as serious as necessary: the lack of a national health insurance in the American health system, where the health of citizens is left on the hands of the insurance companies that treat people who need medical attention like a business. Despite the great possibilities this issue offers for a film, the screenplay does not know how to convey it and instead makes "John Q" what it is: an overwritten and over dramatized film. A gallery of forced and artificial situations. A film that is insultingly simplistic in the way it conveys its themes and ultimately, a collection of the most pathetic Hollywood clichés. All this under a cinematography that is dramatically mundane.Once Denzel Washington's character has taken a hospital's emergency room hostage we have the hostages supporting his cause and later on, a crowd standing outside the hospital cheering at John Q's cause whilst the police are treated like the bad guys. Can a drama be more unrealistic than this? Contrieved and artificial to me. I am aware that in real life it is possible to have people who supported Jon Q's acts but the way the film shows it only serves to hero worship his persona and take away the realism. In a lot of movies the characters are easy to describe. Take for example Washington's character Alonzo Harris in "Training Day". He is a stereotype, the embodiment of a corrupt police officer who does things by his own methods. But the difference between a character like Alonzo Harris and the ones in this film is that whilst Harris is a stereotype, he does not seem like one whereas in "John Q" everybody is portrayed as a stereotype due to the screenplay's insulting simplicity in its dialogue. John Q the good father forced to take justice on his own hands, Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) the medical director with no heart, Robert Duvall the detective who sympathises with John Q's plight and on the other side Gus Monroe (Ray Liotta), the police officer with no sympathy who feels Q should be eliminated without further negotiation and on and on... Consider dialogue like "I'm not going to bury my son! my son is going to bury me!" Sure it sounds good but it also deems the film as totally contrived and again, far too simplistic with little regard for the audiences intelligence. The screenplay should have done the more challenging and better thing of allowing us to judge John Q on our own rather than telling us what to think of him and giving little argument from the opposition's voice (those that are not capable of seeing a lack of a national health insurance as an injustice). The film also tries to deal with the sensationalism in the media when tragic events occurs but it's focus is too thin and lacks conviction.As a thriller it is a poor and predictable one where when a scene is just getting interesting, the screenplay adds a situation, a dialogue or a character that is pathetic. Denzel Washington does a wonderful job but I was kind of uneasy when I asked myself: how could he accept to lend his enormous talent to such a weak screenplay? The performances can not be criticised but the characters all seem to be what they are: supporting actors supporting Washington. In the end "John Q" is a noble attempt to denounce a social injustice. It just lacks the skill to do this correctly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort of fun, good acting, story is a little ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic idea here--that a man could take hostages at gunpoint in a hospital and not be subsequently absolutely flayed alive in court--is silly, to say the least. At least the writers/producers didn't have the temerity to get him completely off! The movie set up other tough challenges, and you have to decide whether the final product meets them; I felt some of them were left dangling. For instance, we're supposed to believe that each/every one of a number of notable adversarial characters (high-level admin woman, the "chest man," the negotiator, the preening TV hyena) are all thoroughly won over by a guy who's shut down a hospital with a gun. Is that really possible? I'm not saying this is necessarily a Bad Thing; I sometimes dig an "urban fairy tale." But wouldn't this particular storyline have been better served by a little grit?The mob scene outside is otherworldly, and, in a way, a little dastardly. Is John Q a surrogate, a mythic substitute for our real solution; getting our butts in gear and making the power monkeys who are ostensibly answerable to us retool the system to distribute risk adequately and provide health care for working people? Do we watch a movie like John Q and walk out of the theater saying, "Geez! Whatta guy! If I were John Q, I would do something to make sure everyone who genuinely needs it gets the medical care they need." Then we go back to our two "service economy" jobs and thank god we're not homeless.This is the perfect Republican movie, cleverly disguised as a left-liberal soap box: The solution to everything--even getting screwed out of health coverage by your employer--is a gun, the duct tape of the new millennium, and a kind of unwitting comeuppance for the NRA, come to think of it. Maybe that's why John Q gets off so easy at the end; don't want to slap someone *too* hard for, after all, just being a good American. Even Washington's amazing abilities can't get around this weirdness in the storyline. In fact, they need people like Washington and Woods (and an amazingly clear and resonant David Thornton) to draw attention away from the seams in a propaganda piece like this.All that said, I'm not saying this is a *bad* movie. I'm just saying that any claim to emotional veracity is, for me, qualified by the aforementioned quirks in the conceptualization and storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one good film. Denzel Washington puts in a wonderful performance and should have been nominated for this one coming right off of his Oscar for Training Day. He truly showed the frustration that a lot of people have with the health care system in this country. This is where this film worked for me. As someone who was pretty much a victim of the health care system, I could understand where John was coming from (though I only had to worry about gallstones and not a bad heart). The other thing that made the film work for me was the fact that it showed how far John would go to help his son. Especially, when he almost made the ultimate sacrifice for him. Also, Anne Heche puts in a great performance as the hospital administrator. She played that role so well that you almost wanted to reach up and slap her for being so cold and uncaring. She should have at least gotten a sniff for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. All in all this was a great film that truly acted on two levels, one being a great social commentary and the other being a great story of a man's love for his son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening sequence of the car wreck, till the end, I knew exactly what was going to happen. And that is the big problem with this movie, along with all the stereotypical characters. I mean, going into the film, you knew John Q's kid needed a new heart. And he takes over an ER. And you could easily figure out he was willing to do anything, but at the last second a donor would be found.Sure Denzel does a good acting job here, but the whole plot of this movie is to make you feel sad for this family and to hate the evil HMO's and doctors. I felt like I was watching some type of political show about the state of health care. It was like Denzel took this job to show the audience, "look at me, I can cry on camera, Aren't I a great actor?" To bad the script was old and stale.FINAL VERDICT: Very predictable, no suspense. Only for those who like sappy, overdramatic films.</fullReview>

A desperate man(Denzel Washington)takes a hospital ER hostage when his HMO refuses to cover the bill for his son's heart-transplant. A very good cast and a time relevant story. Washington this time is the flip side of the coin compared to his role in TRAINING DAY(2001). Washington as John Q. is a sensitive family man ready to give his life for his son's. James Woods is the ER doc among the hostages. Anne Heche plays a bitch of a business controller standing in the way of the life saving operation...but then changes attitude. Also in the cast are Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta as law officials with different opinions of the stand off situation. The little boy with the bad heart is played fervently by Daniel F. Smith. JOHN Q. is a don't miss that is straight on passion.</fullReview>

A father bumbles out of control into a situation wherein he is over his head technically, but makes decisions that seem to prove to us that he is about as pure as he can be, willing even to sacrifice himself rather than actually hurt anyone.Another movie where there really are no bad guys (hmmm, didn't Denzel also lead in Crimson Tide where a tight situation reveals that there really are no bad buys?), just people who approach a situation based on their own backgrounds and insights into what factors may or may not be most important.There are some really redeeming lines though - in all the foolishness, there are some real gems that made me want to say "hey, for all its shortcomings, those lines are right on the money."At the end of the day, I enjoyed it, especially Denzel's acting. Although cast into stereotypical rather dimensionless roles, I'll always love Robert Duval and James Woods, and Ray Liotta even spoke his cheesy cop-with-political-issues-clouding-his-judgment lines seethed them only as he could. Hechte spewed her lines so that you really didn't want to understand her "predicament."Too bad this film seems so clearly a political vehicle, had it been free to truly explore an issue, it might have been better done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel as Healthcare Terrorist in John Q</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the on-cue cheering from the crowd, John Q is a piece of irresponsible agitprop (especially for a movie released in 2002, one year after 9/11) that sanctions vengeance, mob rule and anarchy. How many patient and law-abiding parents did John Q leap-frog in order to get immediate care for HIS offspring? (Talk about the 'selfish gene'!) Of course, writer James Kearns makes it all work out for the best -- to the point that the hospital actually seems to run better when it's being lorded over by a hothead with a gun. But then Kearns had improbably staffed the hospital with a fiendish administrator who was a cross between Eva Braun and Anne Robinson of the Weakest Link -- for which the script writer, incidentally, owes an apology to the vast majority of hospital administrators who (agitprop notwithstanding) actually have a heart -- and are forced to work within restraints that are for the overall benefit of everybody and shouldn't be subject to veto by any angry parent with a firearm.I could tolerate this film if John Q had shown any repentance at all, ever -- but far from it, he rides off into the sunset (to an incredibly short stint in the pokey) with a self-satisfied smirk on his face -- apparently totally uninterested in the fate of the sniper whom he gratuitously sucker punched so hard as to likely cause internal bleeding that could easily lead to death in real life -- possibly depriving that sniper's son of a father. But then John Q has made it clear all along that he's not interested in "sons" in the abstract: he just cares about his own son, thank you very much.If I could have rewritten the movie, I would have ended it with the grown Mike (now enrolled in college) chastising his father as follows:Mike: "Dad, I'm grateful for you saving my life, but..." Dad: "But what, son?" Mike: "Well, it's just that I've been reading Immanuel Kant in philosophy class and...." Dad: "You've been reading WHAT?" Mike: "And I fail to see how your actions square with the Categorical Imperative." Dad: "Look, you got a new heart, son: be happy." Mike: (after a moment of frustrated silence) "Dad, have you ever even HEARD of the word 'ignoble'???"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Q is laughable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed there was very strong imagery and propaganda presented in this film. However, I believe that John Q's efforts are completely futile as an overall solution to the greater societal health-care problem. He caused many people to suffer needlessly because of his unfortunate disposition. Any rational person would agree that it is not legal to force any person (e.g. Medical Specialist) to work without compensation. This is known as involuntary servitude and it is unconstitutional. I'm sure John Q wants to get a paycheck when he does his job. Medical Specialists command respect and are deserved of a competitive salary which reflects their relative skill. One may question whether or not they are overpaid for their work? Well I guess that depends on how much we value our lives. Can we make the same argument for professional athletes? No we can not. At best we can say that they are skilled, and they make a disproportionately large salary. John Q is completely misguided. Why? The HMO system is a move toward socialized medicine, because they base their fee schedules on the Medicare fee schedules. This means that the HMO's pay the medical specialists no more than the Medicare fee schedule will pay as compensation. Thus, HMO's are in lock step with a universal health-care system, and as John Q found out the hard way, the system sucks.</fullReview>

First off John Q has a plot worthy of being made into a film, (a couple can't afford for their son to have a heart transplant so the father takes the hospital hostage). Not a problem there. But c'mon people...how many cliches do you want to cram into a film?Let's start with the characters. We've seen them all before: the cold hearted doctor, the arrogant and obnoxious commissioner, the hyper-full-of-myself T.V. reporter...the list goes on. But what's worse is that there is not a single ounce of substance to them.The scenes outside the hospital are also hilarious. Okay, okay fair enough we want to support the father on his mission but it is poorly executed.What is a serious issue soon becomes a bore, not because of a lack of twists but the absolute reverse. There are just too many and they are very far-fetched yet simple at the same time! (Confused? I am!!) There is no originality, no depth and the film feels like it is an extremely tacky, simple, plain, rushed job with no attention to detail. Denzel Washington does his best to try and carry the film but quite frankly his filmography has seen much, much better days.Making a film about saving someone's life should not mean wasting the viewer's life!

Then James Wood jumps up and explains how easy it is to get guns...all for good measure. As if a gun sitting by itself is going to cause much problemWell it did get the desired effect from moviegoers though. The masses filed out of the theatre amid discussions of those damnable HMO's.I did not hear mention of the lengthy regulations imposed by the US government on the Medical industry in the film, nor did I hear mention of the very broad interpretation of malpractice defined by US government, prompting doctors to form corporations just to cover the insurance premiums.Given the US governments botch job of student visas after the September 11th acts of war (as well as other botch jobs), should anyone honestly believe that same government would make better the health system?Yeah the healthcare system is a mess but it is much better than having some administrator in Washington DC dictate the health needs of Portland Oregon. And it is allot better than hearing people complain about the 70% in taxes they will more than likely be paying if such a snowjob was introduced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why someone would ever hold an entire emergency room hostage, but I could never condone or accept it. This movie shows a completely amoral solution to a very difficult situation. I absolutely believe that there could have been another solution.If people think that I don't have a lot of sympathy for Denzel's character, then I agree. I don't. I'll tell you why. My friend and I were kidnapped at gunpoint when we pulled into the parking lot of a popular bar. Three assailants pulled guns on us and forced us back into the back seat of my friend's car. Two of the kidnappers bound our hands and put tape over our eyes. The kidnappers then drove us to a house. They took our wallets and demanded our PINs to our ATM and Credit Cards. We were beaten for more than 30 minutes while at least one robber went to withdraw money from our accounts. The robbers were threatening to kill us if they did not get any money, but I had already made the maximum withdrawal from my bank account. I guess I was SOL. I might have died for only 400 dollars. My friend has a wife and 3 kids. I have my own family. In my own opinion, I wasn't really hurt. But does it make it okay that my friend and I were kidnapped? Think about it, what if you were kidnapped? Or your mother, father, son, daughter, sister or brother? This film is extremely irresponsible. I can't stand films that try to put a positive spin on kidnapping. The Negotiator with Samuel L. Jackson is another one of these films. A rapist is rapist, a murderer is a murderer and a kidnapper is a kidnapper, no matter what. Here are some people that were kidnapped and or held hostage: Daniel Pearl, the Lindburgh baby, Polly Klass, the people on the tragic flights of 9/11. What did the kidnappers want in these other situations? You should already know what happened to these people. Were the kidnappers justified in what they did? Are you ready to applaud theses kidnappers, and pat them on the back? Give them a high five or a big hug and a kiss on the cheek? Some of the kidnappers got what they wanted. Anyone that thinks that John Q. is justified in what he does is clearly mislead and deluded or in need of some mental evaluation.Watch The Clearing, The Pledge, or The Vanishing(Spoorloos 1988) and you will understand what a despicable crime that kidnapping is. Anyone that applauds John Q's actions DOES NOT COMPREHEND HOW UTTERLY EVIL KIDNAPPING AND HOSTAGE TAKING IS. I do understand that John Q is only a movie and is entertainment, but I don't care. I don't like it. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 is because ZERO is not a choice. It is a shame that Denzel did this movie, because I truly enjoy his other movies. It is a shame that someone who was in Training Day, Glory, and A Soldier's Story was in this horrid piece of garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Local Terrorism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have the events of the past 4 years taught us nothing? The act of taking unlawful control of a situation with the use of hostages in order to have certain individual demands met is terrorism. Is the left so radical these days that this sort of behavior is acceptable? Is an individuals feelings on national healthcare reason enough to take hostages? This film teaches us that if we don't agree with something then we should take hostages and make demands. Of course to hide the real truth of the man's actions the lead is black, which of course makes him 'oppressed' and he is saving his young child which is 'honorable.' This joke of a film falls into the same ultra liberal category as "The Life of David Gale" another film that supports unacceptable radical actions. This type of film is counter productive for the liberal movement. There is other ways to communicate and solve problems, terrorism is not an option, and if it is, then it is not an option I would honor. Besides my political opinion the film is illogical, horribly acted, cliché ridden, and trite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great movie for the sub 50 IQ range</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only imagine that Denzel winces when he thinks of this movie. The cast is packed with some of Hollywood's most gifted so the laughable result can only be attributed to atrocious direction and the worst screenplay so far this century. The plot has so many transparent devices and clumsily delivered dialog that it is impossible to take any of it seriously. There are no surprises throughout the whole story and only somebody that had never seen a movie before would miss the ham fisted tie ins. If you HAVE to watch this movie see it with some genuine movie loving friends and form your own Mystery Science Theater. You'll have fun spotting the "actors they didn't get" look alikes and mocking the hollywood plot by numbers format. If you wanna see Denzel perform at his best catch Malcom-X or Training Day and help D. let this embarrassment fade away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Long Letter-to-the-Editor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"John Q" was probably the worst career move Denzel Washington could ever make. Good thing he got it over with. This "film" is about a man so desperate for health insurance to pay for his son's operation that he takes the emergency room hostage until his demands are met. Though this is how far many of us would go, this film is nothing but a long letter-to-the-editor, in which the writer (James Kearns) just wants to get his opinion out there. It is obvious that "John Q" was fuelled by the writer's beef with the healthcare system, so he threw together a feverish movie so he could trick people into agreeing with him. Definitely a bring-down purpose of any movie. If you want people to hear your opinion, write your congressman, don't waste a fine cast or use up your screenwriting talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Hollywood Liberal Propaganda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't a movie, it was a political commercial. The movie tries to beat our brains to death with the idea that the US should have a national healthcare system. It's irresponsible to make a movie like this that only tells one side of the issue, and doesn't even get its facts right. It doesn't mention that in Canada (a country with national healthcare system), cancer treatment is so backwards and out of step that many cancer patients come to the US for treatment. It doesn't mention how Canada and Great Britain often make patients wait for months before they get an essential surgery. Also, in Great Britain, the survival rate for cancer patients is much worse. Government waste, embezzlement, and red tape is crippling the health care systems of these countries.John Q doesn't bother to mention any of this however. The movie is basically a 2 hour long commercial for socialist democrats. Anne Heche gets to play the role of the greedy corporate villain, who basically is the representative republican in this movie, though it isn't mentioned.There's also some tripe about hostages, guns, and more, but that was all done in a far superior film, "A Dog Day Afternoon" and I suggest you watch that.If you want to get brainwashed by the Hollywood liberal machine, then John Q is a good choice. Or you could just watch a few campaign commercials for the democratic candidates this fall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>terrible premise ,unrealistic, It encourages violence and fear as an answer to get whatever you want, and expects to be applaused like a hero for it..Not.... Thats just what is preceived from the commercial and the scene from the commercial where Denzel announces free health care for that day at the hospital to the people is just disturbing. its a good movie if your the type of person who likes to feel sorry for yourself and blame everybody for your problems.The film makers put a face to this type of personality and his name is Denzel. Its hard to take in a movie with such selfish values in its main character. its like the writers are so high on themselves and their own self preservation its scary, This Film just stinks of selfish morals, and tries to make a hero out of a felon. Dont go to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hillary Clinton's Government Health Care Video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie used cheap Hollywood antics to pull at your heart strings, so that the liberals who made this piece of trash could advance their agenda of nationalized health care. The movie plot is very weak and unrealistic. I will admit the acting in the movie is top notch, however it cannot save the movie at all. I was suprised by the number of people who were fooled by this piece of propaganda on IMDB. Those of you who think the government should run our health care system, look at the tax rates of the countries who do. Australia 60% of your salary goes to taxes, England $4 a gallon gas, most of that is taxes. Ok, I'll get off my soap box and back to the movie, it stinks, don't go and see it. Total waste of money. 1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a horrible unrealistic comment on healthcare in the united states. The public jumps to support a madman who holds up an emergency room, risking the lives of others by not letting patients who urgently need care get treatment. even the more minor characters in this movie are horrible, not because actors such as james woods lost cant act, but because of horrible writing. the 'evil' people in the hospital cant deciede if they want to let the young boy have a heart or not, each changing their mind several times, and because their characters are not developed at all they seem to do it for absolutely no reason.this movie sucked, despite all the good actors in it.</fullReview>

The production plays like a TV movie and the whole thing is totally predictable. The producers try to make it realistic but instead it comes off contrived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so horrible and biased it almost made HMOs seem sympathetic.Among the dumbest moments: not showing the downside to shutting down a city emergency room for the day, and an outrageously callous hospital administrator who then breaks down and cries over one dying child (so the rest of the ICU patients had all been faking?).But the worst failure was reinforcing the real problem of people just mindlessly complaining about not having open-ended access to health care without any consideration of how to pay for it. The only constructive action was the heart surgeon who waived his fee at the outset but he still got portrayed as a villain apparently for wearing a nice suit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed melodrama that is moving in the wrong ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very unfair that so many great actors and dialogue are all stuck in a movie so overwrought and one sided that it seems like it is preaching to the audience instead of entertaining them.I wont go into the plot in detail here but I will say its about a working class man(Denzel Washington) who takes a hospital emergency room hostage to get his son's name on a organ donors list. While this plot looks great on paper it comes off very melodramatic on film. The movie plods along relying on one plot device after another with performances so over the top it almost seems funny (Except for Denzel Washington and Kimberly Elise). The villains of the movie (ie: Anne Heche, Ray Liotta, and Robert Duvall) change motivations spontaneously and almost seem cartoonish. The hostages are cardboard cutouts of characters who complain about health care and don't even bother to even dislike the man who is threatening to kill them.Basically this movie says to the audience if you are in John Q's position take a hospital hostage and everything will turn out alright. By the end of the film the plot is so farfetched and manipulative that the movie almost seems like it is no longer taking place on Earth.The ending itself is a cheat and relies on what is probably the biggest plot device I have ever seen on film. Had the ending of the film been different the movie might not have come off so preachy and manipulative but since the ending is the way it is it seems like terrorism is an okay thing as long as your son is in danger.I would give this movie 1 star. If I want to be lectured, I can go back to school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Health coverage in the US is really sick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the pioneer and precursor of Michael More's documentary Sicko recently released, but this one is based on a fictional situation. What is a father ready to do to enable his son to get a heart transplant? And what is the system able to do to prevent him from getting it because he does not have enough insurance coverage? The second question is easy to answer: nothing and the system will let the child die. No insurance coverage, no treatment. The first question is a lot more difficult to answer; the film goes very far in the fiction and yet it is absolutely believable. Yes a father is able to kidnap innocent people and medical personnel to impose a positive solution. Then the rest is pure luck, haphazard chance, good effective media, a lot of human feeling, a mistake done by the shoot-first-ask-questions-second chief of police in his four star uniform, and of course a lot of sympathy from the public which is perfectly understandable when you know 46 millions Americans have no health coverage at all and probably twenty more millions have a partial coverage, i.e. not full coverage or full coverage not all the time. The film is of course very effective emotionally, and it uses some short sequences from the news programs of the 1990s when Hillary Clinton was trying in the name of her husband to convince Congress to pass legislation on the subject and failed. I think even to kill yourself to provide your own son with a heart is an option that could be considered by some fathers. Of course the film did not emphasize the real negative sides of the problem, the greediness of some doctors, the total indifference of most administrative personnel, the brutality of the police in such cases who would consider a forceful solution before a peaceful one. But there must be some dream even when dealing with such a subject.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>
