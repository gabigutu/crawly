		<fullReview>I've never seen anything so painfully familiar. Every move of Justine, her every word echoes with the heartache of a melancholiac. And the inability of the others to understand this pain, their inability to feel it and understand - it only makes it more familiar to the ones drowning in this mute slow-motion everyday despair. After watching this movie I went home without saying a word, I sat down on my chair and sat there silently for about an hour. I like Lars von Trier, I liked his movies before, but this one was a headshot. In this one film Lars von Trier succeeded to show all the ultimate emptiness of the everyday rituals, the endless longing of a melancholiac and the unbearable helplessness of this condition - like a bulletproof glass cocoon around you, muting the sounds and making the colors dim. I vote "excellent", 'cause this film is closer to my heart than any other I've seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and meaningful if you've been there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a serious polarity in the reviews for this film,and I'm not surprised. If you've ever suffered depression this bleak movie will hit hard, and you'll pick up on all of the subtle messages it sends out. It's done so well it can't be anything other than achingly familiar. The despondency, and the frustration the sufferer feels at their own despondency, in particular, is well conveyed. Unfortunately I think a large chunk of the people who've seen this film (and there aren't many who have, sadly) went to it expecting a slightly arty apocalypse movie. It's not a smarter Deep Impact. The (blue) planet Melancholia is just a metaphor for depression. Unrelenting and irresistible, Melancholia has the main character in its thrall.For those who don't "get" this movie, no it's not a pretentious, pseudo intellectual flick. Rather it's a well crafted take on the fine detail of a subject matter that you have been fortunate enough to not have had to understand. Long may that be the case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday I had the chance to see Melancholia. I was a bit anxious given the mixed reception here (either euphoric or very negative).It seems the media are talking more about the disaster-press-conference-from-hell Lars gave in Cannes. Which is a shame.Like always, Lars von Trier does not want to appeal to the general public, but in stead wants to present the viewer something unique and honest.It was influenced by his own "melancholia", of which he suffered when working on this project.I, for one saw solid acting and great directing from a person who carefully observes and understands human interaction. For me it works.This movie is by no means perfect but it was thought provoking, and heart touching and that's exactly what a decent movie should try to achieve. Thank you for reading my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lars von Trier's Wagnerian opera of 2011 - the Ragnarok of western capitalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is LVT's Wagnerian opera. Justine is a mythological creation. She is the white goddess, Diana bathing, la Belle Dame Sans Merci, Cassandra tormented by futurity. It ends in Gottedammerung, the destruction of the world. The Cannes jury was right to honour it. In 2, 10 or 100 years this will be manifestly THE film of 2011, capturing as it does this precise historical moment, on the cusp of epochs. More than just an economic crisis, or even the end of Western capitalism, or the American Century, or of Europe - though it is all that - it is the consummation in fire of all we have ever known. Leaders and experts sit mesmerised and powerless, making reassuring noises, or setting aside puny provisions; taking shelter in denial or custom. While Melancholia and Earth act out their dance of death; gravity, the most ineluctable force in the universe, does its work. Justine, being incapable of happiness, is therefore incapable of illusion. She has always known. Herself untouched by affect, by human assimilation or persuasion, she writes the killer tag lines which manipulate others. Having a damaged soul, she suffers from a disorder of perception - she sees things as they actually are. She knows precisely how many beans are in the jar -like those who called the top of the Dow Jones index, at 12807 exactly. On one level, she represents the spirit of financialisation, the final, hottest white dwarf phase of capitalism, quantifying, inhumane, ultra-competitive (seen also in Skaarsgard's brutal ad boss, and in the brother-in-law who paid for the wedding - "an arm and a leg, for most people" -he means it literally I think - chilling!) And, like the Sybil, Justine wants to die. She wills the destruction of herself and everything else. 'The Earth is evil.'LVT is the holy idiot of European cinema. Much as Justine destroys her stellar career, then hours later, in the garden, consciously and irrevocably obliterates her marriage and future happiness, so LVT - in the most perfect example of parallel process - in his acceptance speech at Cannes compulsively befouls himself, his credibility, future opportunities, his film and all associated with it. (Poor Dunst, beside him. Did she always know? I wonder.) Which brings me to Kirsten Dunst.Once the all-American teenage sweetie in some of my favourite films.(The US invented the teenager, much as the English Victorians invented childhood, and its richest and most creative seam of film and TV deal with this stage of life. In a way, America is the world's teenager; and all teenagers are Americans by proxy.) In fact, Dunst is German-American, with all the ancestral baggage that implies. (Read Sylvia Plath's 'Daddy' if you don't know what I mean). Beneath the apple-pie sunny exterior of her teen roles, there was always something remote and uncanny about her beauty. And now, with teen / young adult roles behind her, this strangeness, this well, German-ness, is exposed. In the riveting opening shots of 'Melancholia' she looks like Marlene Dietrich - unheimlich, fascinating. Like la Belle Dame Sans Merci, she takes possession of a man through his unconscious: like the groom in the film, he will follow her, exchanging all that is dear - home, family and hope of happiness - for bitterness and despair. In the scene in the limo, the earliest, lightest part of the story, she seems American, in accent, face, body, She becomes less American , more northern European, and ultimately less like a human being at all, as her story unwinds. Those who criticise the inconsistency in her accent are missing the point. The change is about the character, not her nationality, which is purposely vague. (In fact, in what country does the film take place? Would you ask that question of 'the Ring'?) I get the impression that just as Lars is working through some issues around his German-ness ? hence the Wagnerianism -, so is Dunst, which must have made his Cannes performance doubly excruciating. (I hear she wants to be called 'Keersten' now, pronounced the German way.) For the girl who has been being other people superbly well from her childhood, it seems to me that Dunst the adult truly exposes something painfully real of herself in this film. ('Exposing' is the right word in every way.) And she pulls it off. The film is stunning. She is stunning, and thoroughly deserves Best Actress. Bravo, Lars von Trier!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review MAY contains spoilers, yes. The movie itself DOES contain spoilers.The first four minutes or so are awesome. You can do yourself a favor and leave the theater after that for dinner and coffee. You can come back for the last two minutes save the titles. They bookend the beginning. The rest is torture. If you are a depressive masochist, you might find the middle part enjoyable though. I gave it 2 stars for those few minutes."It looks like sh.t. I'm shaken." These are not my words. It's from Lars Von Triers director's statement about this film. When Lars Von Trier appeared with Kirsten Dunst at Cannes promoting his latest effort in tormenting audiences he claimed to understand Hitler. Maybe because this rather endless, self indulging narcissistic art-house piece about the annihilation of rural upper class Denmark had brainwashed him to the point of calling himself a Nazi and Isreal a "pain in the ass". Who knows. Maybe he meant to promote the film. It did not reach me.His promotional efforts got Trier banned from Cannes. He is banned from my play list too after I have been bored to tears one more time with outdated art-house tricks that have ceased to impress me in the last millennium. Kiefer Sutherland, Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg (they don't look like sisters) and others are working loyally with their tormentor. It's sad watching them waisting their talent though on this pointless journey. Udo Kier has a short cameo and is funny, as always, even in pointless surroundings.The editing is bad enough to use it as an example for film students on how to make wrong choices.Yes, jerking a camera endlessly and pointlessly can be done, even 15 years after "Breaking the Waves". Back then shaking cameras without meaning was some kind of art-house fashion statement. Now it looks like someone wearing the wrong trousers to the wrong party.The implausible arrival of another planet, being observed through an obscure piece of wire until it finally smashes an idyllic pasture was great for two things: it ends both the endless camera jerking and the movie.Even if this review will be stowed away deep in the bulk of this distributor's guest reviews, I'd like to warn you. The film leaves you in pointless depression. If you think that's a good way to invest your time end money, I can highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At times, absolutely brilliant, mostly just boring and annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia was a movie I went to see expecting it to blow me away. I thought: now here's a movie that doesn't have the mass-friendliness of the average Hollywood movie, but at the same time actually has a nice budget, and some good actors. Now don't get me wrong, I often find low- budget films with fresh talent amazing, but with Melancholia I was hoping for something that successfully molds together the Hollywood and indie movie scenes. Here's what I thought of the movie:As it opens there's a quite long, slow moving apocalyptic scene that I won't even try to explain. But, to be honest, I found it to be quite nicely done. With the occasional space imagery to me it looked like if Ingmar Bergman had made a 2001: A Space Odyssey -based short film. Wagner's music really made it an extraordinary experience.Part I: The Wedding (no I'm not calling it Justine, live with it): At first it seemed like a pretty nice, slow starting, atmosphere building part of the movie (note that at this point I still really wanted to enjoy this movie), but as time went on I found myself hating most of the badly written, annoying, and shallow cast, and I was hoping for bad things to happen to them all, especially Justine, Kirsten Dunst's character. By the way, why does everyone consider her performance so great? Sure, she was good at playing an angsty character whose motives remain a mystery to everyone, but honestly, being either expressionless or having an intentionally painful fake smile on shouldn't be that hard. When the wedding scene was over, I thought, finally, now can we get to the part where this gets good?Part II: The Generic Ranch: So, after being bored with the first half of the movie I was hoping for something a bit better. Well, I never got what I was hoping for. Justine just got a lot more annoying, we found out she has paranormal abilities, and people were taking a planet sucking out some of earth's atmosphere, probably taking it off it's course and killing everyone on it regardless of weather it collided or not really goddamn well. Not even Kiefer Sutherland's great performance could make me have any motivation for watching on. For the first time in my life I was actually contemplating walking out of the theater I was so bored and annoyed. Long story short, Justine was a total douche, her sister paniced and the world came to an end, and the movie ended. Oh yeah and there was that kid who did an even worse performance than Jake Lloyd on Star Wars ep. 1. Yes it was really that bad.Okay, the very end was pretty epic, with Wagner's music almost blowing my eardrums out and a huge blue planet smashing into the earth. I have to admit though, when the movie ended, I accidentally let out a giggle, much to the dismay of most people sitting near me. Seriously, as well made as it was, it was a pretty silly way to end the movie in my opinion. Alright, pros and cons:Pros: We saw Kirsted Dunst naked a couple of times, and although I really disliked the jumpy, amateuristic camera-work, the movie was at times visually amazing, and not really ever over the top. Also, the idea for the movie was pretty cool, and I really enjoyed Kiefer Sutherland's acting. The very beginning and very end should have been made into separate short films because they were really worth watching.Cons: Exceptionally shallow characters whose ridiculously small backstories were just thrown on to the viewers, mostly just average, sometimes painfully weak acting, and plentiful filler scenes that had no purpose whatsoever and that could have been cut down without the movie losing anything, while some scenes were just cut off completely (for example the impromptu sex scene with Justine and her husband, which, if correctly made, could have told us most everything about their relationship, and many more scenes that were just cut way too short).Conclusion: I'd like to give the movie more points just for it's beginning and end, and the story that had great potential for a sci-fi - sporting drama, but I just can't. For the first time in a while I seriously had trouble getting through this movie without walking out in the middle. Sorry to all the people who think it's a great movie, but personally I think I'd seriously rather do the dishes and mow the lawn than watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruel torture by boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie shines visually at certain points. To be specific it shines first five minutes and then the last say 20 seconds.The rest of the movie is just cruel, sadistic and never ending torture by boredom. First and foremost, the lead character is not "melancholic". She is seriously depressed, I mean chemotherapy to electro-convulsive therapy class depressed. It is seriously not fun to watch her being depressed. It made me feel very depressed as well and this was just the beginning.The family seems to be broken, but in a very boring way. Nothing much happens here except for people running away (I wish I did the same thing after opening scene, but I was hoping for at least some pretty pictures later on). Then nothing happens, then nothing happens, then nothing happens, then the sister suddenly understands the World is going to end, so she freaks a little, runs around a little, then all three remaining heroes decide to sit at their asses and to wait for collision.Yes, there are some pretty pictures of the castle where the boring people live, but seriously I would rather watch another Miss Marple murder case. These movies are silly but at least something happens! Seriously I never expected to see another Armageddon or something like that but this bottle is completely empty. There are not even questions, it just frustrating wait for the end of the World so the movie may end as well.I'm so so disappointed. If you were attracted by the trailer, you may go home now. There is nothing more interesting to see here. The trailer is misleading, it is pretty poster consisting of all the action in the movie. The rest is just cold, empty, freezing hell of boredom disguised as a art. Even the worst Lynch movies are at least an order of magnitude better than this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trier takes us for a ride. It's a slow ride, taking in the beauty of the cinematography. It is at once a beautiful movie, while at the same time focusing on the absence of real love between the characters - and in the world. The movie hints at a correlation between the lack of love, and the threat of impending doom that's present throughout.I speculate that every viewer will take something slightly different away from the picture, because the movie is designed to make you think about us humans and our behaviors toward each other, as well as enjoy the work of wonder that the movie is. What you end up with is dependent of what you take to the movie in the first place. Trier's movies are usually adept at making you feel. In this movie you are left to your own devices. There is no inherently good person to root or feel for. There is only the state of the world. And the future of the human kind. Can you be bothered to feel for us?Truly Trier-esque (10/10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Melancholia'' - Lars von Trier's best work to date. The movie is about the nature of depression and how 2 sisters go through it. Kirsten Dunst (Justine) accepts her melancholia by the time a planet that was hiding behind the sun threatens to collide the Earth, while other sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg - Clair) is afraid to face the reality and her own personal emotions. If you have any little doubt whether you want to watch this movie or not, you better don't, because this is not for everyone, and if you still want to see this then prepare yourself for what you're going to face. The movie is all about how Lars Von Trier sees the world, the people and the dearness between them. It's beautiful, it's real, it's disgusting, it's terrifying - it all depends on how you want to perceive this film. The opening and the ending scenes are mesmerizing! The music used in the film is taken from Wagner's ''Tristan and Isolde'' opera which fits the movie perfectly. Cinematography - amazes. Special effects, not for 3D, but are very realistic and breathtaking. Kirsten Dunst gives us her best performance to date, forget the girl in Spider-man, this is a new level for her. She finally proves us how good she can be with the right movie choice. An Oscar nomination is on its way... I'm not a fan of Lars and his movies, but this one had me at the edge of my seat to the last minute. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really slow, terrible camera shaking the whole way, ultimately pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the camera shaking, it is of course a style of sorts, but it doesn't add anything when its every shot all the time (save perhaps 3 mins of long shots). I do personally have a problem where this kind of shaking actually affects my inner ear and makes me motion sick. So for me the film is actually unwatch-able without a motion sickness pill. Even after taking one though it wasn't watch- able with the amount of constant shaking for me at least. I did persevere until about an hour and a quarter into it before deciding it was junk and really not worth it.You could watch this film on double speed without loosing much at all. It is tediously slow moving. But what's worse is that its ultimately pointless.The whole film feels just like a meaningless indulgence of the film makers fantasies for the sake of it.On a positive note the acting is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I was on vacation for a few days and I had the opportunity to load up a few films onto my iPad that I had been meaning to watch. I am going to try and review them all over the next few days. First up is Lars Von Triers Melancholia. I saw Von Trier's last film Antichrist and truthfully I didn't think much of it. I didn't have very high hopes for this film either but I have been hearing really good things and decided to give it a chance.I pretty much hated everything about this over-rated self-indulgent tripe. The story is really broken into two parts. First, there is a long marriage scene where Kirsten Dunst flits around giving everyone the stink eye. She refuses to have sex with her new husband, bangs some dude on a golf course instead and then tells her boss she hates her job and that she quits. Then she gets all depressed, which takes us to part 2. Kirsten Dunst acts all depressed and walks around giving everyone the stink eye while she stays with her overbearing, overly emotional sister played by an always annoying Charlotte Gainsbourg. As a side note, we find out that a planet named Melancholia has been hiding behind the sun (you sneaky planet you) and now may or not be on a collision course with earth. So Kirsten Dunst takes all her clothes off and lays down on the ground so she can give Melancholia the stink eye.This movie sucked in ways I was not aware a movie could suck. It's artsy and weird just for the sake of being artsy and weird. It's and emotionless mess that leaves you feeling absolutely nothing at all. They assembled a pretty interesting cast and then did nothing with it. Kirsten Dunst is just plain annoying and Charlotte Gainsbourg does her best to take that title from Dunst. Kiefer Sutherland spends the movie acting like a simp with a poop eating grin on his face. This is the last time I waste any more of my life on that nazi loving corncob Lars Von Trier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unrealistic on every single level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Art: Cheesy slow motion. Camera shake. Camera constantly focused on the main actress' boobs. College grade cinematography tricks.Plot/characters/acting: Characters only speak in meaningless one- liners. Every character is a psychopath, either smiling or scowling at each other; blank stares in-between. Nothing about this movie actually represents how people act or might act in a doom scenario (or any scenario, other than a mental institution). Since there's no depth to any of the characters or to any family dynamics the director resorts to emotional extortion in the form of suicide, yelling, boob shots, and a "surprise" sex scene. I'm surprised the director didn't throw in more emotional triggers (like a rape scene, or a dead baby). These meaningless human interactions occupy most of the movie with no relevance to the plot, and no character depth. 2 hours... If you start this movie expecting the plot to converge - NOPE, just 2 hours of blank stares, psychotic smiling and occasional crying.Sound: I had serious problem with sound. Music is SO LOUD. It's a beautiful Wagner piece, but I was watching this movie with my thumb on the volume knob, because the audio engineer probably hated the movie SO MUCH that he decided to drown it out by prioritizing the music over all other sound-tracks.GC: Although the planet-on-planet GC shots were kind of cool, there's nothing amazing there. This is probably where the 7 million budget went (2 minutes of mediocre planet crashing).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regardless of strange flaws It totally worked for me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let there be no doubt Melancholia is an amazing movie, a one of a kind experience. But it's also a strange movie. Strange because some parts are just so much better than others. From divine touch of genius to actually really rather bad. There are parts that are so strikingly beautiful that you can not help being mesmerized, there's superb directing resulting in amazing, almost screen transcending acting (and this is from the girl from "Bring it on" mind you), and there are parts were sound and imagery merge with such impact that you get blown away. But then there are parts that feels just the opposite, some characters are portrayed surprisingly flat and their dialog and behavior seems contrived at best, almost like they never got beyond a crude first draft in the writing. The mother and the boss especially could have been watered down and integrated with more finesse IMO. It sounds like no biggie but it's such a stark contrast to the brilliance you find in other parts of the movie e.g. the subtle and tender portrayal of the groom and his love and affection for his troubled wife. Regardless and in spite of these rather prominent shortcomings I was sucked in from the mind blowing opening and my emotions were once again stripped bare and exposed at the signature killing blow finale. As before with Trier's films, I stumbled out of the theater, all numb and profoundly touched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, jerky, but certainly melancholic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with a series of visually interesting shots of the main characters. Some are amusing, some are striking, and some are of one planet hitting another. This provides an enticing (but perhaps too long) introduction to the film, and we might expect to be treated to an unravelling of these intricate scenes through some similarly extravagant cinematography. Unfortunately, this is not the case.The planet Melancholia is expected to pass by the Earth. There is a wedding party for the newlywed Julia and her husband. The wedding is tense and ends with the groom leaving early without the bride. The film then follows Julia, her sister, and a few others as we learn that Melancholia will, in fact, collide with Earth and destroy it.The plot is fairly basic, which, in itself, does not make it a bad film. However, a film short of plot needs something else to interest an audience for two hours, and, sadly, there isn't much more to take away from it. The characters are not believable and we cannot sympathise with any of them; the acting is poor, despite a star cast; the camera-work is jerky and messy, as if shot completely by "the guy with the camcorder" at a party. However, the film is well-lit and contains a handful of spectacular shots.Just as the Earth collided with Melancholia, so did I - shortly followed by boredom, frustration, and nausea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Load of Fatuous Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is the worst piece of sadistic, fatuous crap that I have ever seen. Von Trier is clearly seeing how completely he can pull the wool over art-house viewers. It is also an abuse of Wagner's magnificent music. In addition to the ridiculous science-fiction framework (it is conceivable that if a planet 10 times the mass of the earth was heading right at us, it might at least make the evening news, but nobody even seems to be aware of it). Also, an abject that massive would create a horrendous gravitational effect which would dramatically alter the Earth's (and the Moon's) orbits, create massive earthquakes and huge tides that would overwhelm all coastal cities, etc. I couldn't stop laughing in the last scene when the planet nearly fills the whole sky and the sea in front of the mansion is not even disturbed a bit. Oh please. And the cheap CGI rendering of nebulae etc. are not worthy of a B movie (see The Tree of Life for breathtaking handling of such images, created by a master filmmaker). The absurdly long wedding scene, with every art-house black-tie trope imaginable, was just insufferable. What a piece of garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes and yes, not once, but twice had the movie uttered the above phrase in some sort of a self-aware meta-cinematic ejaculation. I honestly couldn't describe it better myself. I only put a flag on the spoiler box due to the fear of being prosecuted. Trust me, even if you haven't seen this "film" it really can't be spoilt: the movie basically spoils itself in the first couple of minutes.Part I is essentially pointless as it establishes Justine to be a melancholic (see what both I and larsie-the-oh-so-awesome-director did there?) bitch. Yeah, her privileged upper class ass is having so much suffering, those poor starving kids in Africa couldn't even begin to approach the levels of agony that dumb bimbo is going through.Justine is the quintessence of what I hate about western civilization. She's ignorant, yet claims to "know things" by being able to accurately predict the amount of beans in a jar (in retrospect of course). She's somewhat evil herself (politely cock-blocking her fiancée-going-for-husband on her wedding night, having monkey sex with some douche afterwards), yet calls all living things evil (probably making her the only good thing on this planet, even though she doesn't explicitly state it). And above all she's just so full of herself, that whiny little bitch.Scratch that though, it's that idiot lars von trier (lower-case letters is the only thing he gets from me) making a statement: all living things are evil, plus Earth is the only planet with life on it. How that guy managed to sodomize philosophy on the side of ethics, physics on the side of cosmology and biology in one lucky strike is beyond me. The directing cretin behind this piece of trash trying to be a film makes the boldest of assumptions without any justification, analysis or evidence. It's this way, because I said it so, munch it up you morons or go home. And don't even get me started on the pseudo-scientific aspect of this manure. An undiscovered planet "hiding behind the sun" (like an inter-planetary boogeyman for billions of years) on a collision course with us carrying the name of this "movie"... Are you for real?This garbage commits the worst of offenses: it takes its audience for a bunch of brainless twats and to add insult to injury it rubs it in our faces afterwards. The only redeeming thing about this atrocity is the surprisingly good performance by Kiefer "Jack Bauer" Sutherland. Apparently that guy can act, he just doesn't show it unless he's in a really crappy movie such as this one. Dunst is bland as always though and John Hurt is a blast as usual (but no points for you good sir, we expected you to be good).If you want an artsy flick, go watch "Drive" instead. At least that one is harmless. Cinematography in "Melancholia", despite trying to be artsy is crap, especially the cuts. This disaster fails on every level, even on the points it tries to be sold on. Such an ultimate mess is truly a gem, if it was made out of droppings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie 1 star because of the styled wedding scenes at the start of the movie. Other than that, I much rather go to the dentist than see another Lars Von Trier movie. The movie is basically about the depression (deep rooted psychological disturbances) of a young woman (Dunst). Mental illness deserves empathy, but this movie did nothing to evoke that emotion. Instead, I found it as an indulgent, superficial look from Von Trier on mental illness. He tried to show how it affects those around the sufferer, but it was portrayed in such a cold and insignificant light, I felt more for Cruella De Ville and her plight to only want a warm winter coat made from dogs than for the Dunst character. (At least 101 Dalmatians HAD a plot.) Speaking of plot, this movie had none. I am smart enough to know that a planet cannot "hide behind the Sun" and that the planet crashing "plot" was simply thrown in so those with a brain wouldn't storm out of the movie. (That didn't stop me from falling asleep for 25 mins in the middle of the movie, though!)Please learn from my mistake...Go to the dentist if you want two hours of torture!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with moderate expectations, as the cinema I was watching it at usually shows decent art and foreign films. The opening of this movie was epic, you can't take that away from it. However, the remaining 90 minutes or so were just incredibly painful to sit through.Imagine someone who is bordering on catatonic depression and whose outlook on life is purely inficete and apathetic. Now take that personality, halve it and then halve it again and then make them a movie director. The product is lars von trier, and this movie was probably his way of expressing this. I have seen some shocking movies in my time, but this surely takes the cake. The novelty of shaking cameras, slow motion scenes and tinted lenses wears off faster than a henna tattoo.The film was boring. I think the only thing keeping me awake was my flatulence after eating a bowl of chips prior to the film. The positive reviews of this film come from the unctuous and obsequious art house critics, who are incapable of forming an opinion which differs from their equally narrow minded friends, for the fear of being ostracised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A self-indulgent mess that is barely watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it seems that finally Lars Von Trier jumped the shark. I had bad feelings about his future movies, especially after seeing how mediocre and forgettable the overrated "Antichrist" film was, but this is in many ways much, much worse than that movie.After the incredible opening sequence, everything on this movie goes downhill. The whole deal about the world ending is just merely an excuse for the director to introduce here the most pretentious ramblings about how life on earth is worthless and how everyone is an idiot except the annoying main character (Which to me wasn't much better than the typical pretentious ramblings from an emo teen) As if those awful attempts to introduce "nihilistic" philosophy wasn't bad enough, the atrocious visual style (With lots of annoying and shaky camera movements; personally I don't think that kind of direction made this movie more "realistic" or something like that, it only makes it look amateurish and poorly made) is enough to turn the experience of watching this movie into something that is not only boring and dumb, but also ugly and irritating as well to the point of being insufferable. The plot (Or lack of it thereof) is idiotic: Most of the scenes from this movie seem shoehorned and have zero relevance to the main story (If there is one) and just serve to show the main character acting all sad and depressed, and as if this were some "Twilight" movie, her behavior is shown as something "positive" while the actions of every other character are shown under a negative light, as if not being sad all the time and claiming every single moment that every human action is futile were something "bad" or "stupid"."Melancholia" is not sad at all. It is just pathetic.This movie is so dumb, slow, pretentious and self indulgent that it almost make "The Tree of Life" (Another overrated artsy -fartsy snore-fest released in the year 2011) look good in comparison. Avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to his world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's latest film MELANCHOLIA got the media attention it needed when Von Trier, in Cannes doing a press conference, stated that he sympathized with Hitler. Now sure, one can look at this as a smart way of marketing one's own film, or one can start wondering what kind of guy Von Trier has become. As a filmmaker he's certainly interesting, and certainly self-indulging, and as a child of the late Bergman, he loves dwelling upon women in a somewhat sad state of mind. MELANCHOLIA is a dark film that doesn't have the explicitness of his controversial ANTICHRIST, but brings in just the same dark undercurrents of human beings who's lost their touch with love, compassion, faith and hope, and so we find them in the land of Trier where things will become increasingly intense and frightful. The story is told in two parts; in the first we find the deeply depressed Kirsten Dunst on her wedding day, which shot and felt much like Vinterberg's Dogme-film 'Festen', and part two interests Dunst's sister Charlotte Gainsbourg more into the story along with her husband and son, as staying at a beautiful mansion in the countryside sees the enormous planet Melancholia headed for Earth, fearing for all of humanity to end. One can certainly see this film with two different kind of goggles; Melancholia IS a planet that's headed for Earth, and it's doomsday - or, one can see the heavy symbolism of Melancholia as a state of mind, swallowing the family with its meaninglessness. Director Von Trier keeps most questions open, and by using some absolutely mesmerizing camera-work the film beholds a interesting quality and sensibility. Few if any other popular directors anno 2011 creates stuff the way Von Trier does, and the immense climax accompanied by Wagner music is sole alone worth the watch. I guess Von Trier makes personal films, and he claims himself to be the best living director in the world, and he wants a green card into everyone's lives and with MELANCHOLIA he again sows some disturbing and heavy-handed seeds - and if anything, he makes your mind wobble. Must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can review this self-indulgent, pretentious bit of inanity using artistic criteria; but suffice it to say, as a work of art, this movie is a self-indulgent, pretentious piece of inanity. That's the accurate summary of what the movie really is.So now I'm going to focus on the obvious science gaffes. (And there are many. Why does it appear red in the sky when it's heading toward Earth? This is a violation of the Doppler Effect.) By the way, I am a scientist and I could chronicle a myriad of scientific impossibilities in this movie. But I'll limit myself to the most glaring one. Melancholia is a planet that was hiding behind the Sun, has gone past Mercury and Venus and is now headed toward Earth. OK. I'm sorry, but this puts Melancholia between the Sun and the Earth. Knowing all of this, how is it they are able to see Melancholia at night? Think about it. Lars didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utter waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** The movie is visually interesting at times, but I frankly cannot fathom why it is so highly rated here on IMDb. Personally, I have a long list of problems with it.The movie opens with Justine, a psychologically unstable, selfish woman who is later revealed to have psychic powers getting married. We are introduced to the gallery of deeply despicable characters; ranging from her boss (a power-hungry social misfit), her dad (a broken man who has given up on life), her mother (a cynical bitch who wants to make her daughter's decisions), her husband (a naive loser) and various others. The wedding has no relevance to the story, and nor do the characters, with the exception of one not completely awful man - an astronomy enthusiast.Everything in this story is told as if in an attempt to test your patience. There is hardly any progress at all until near the ending, when a planet looms large on the horizon and we are supposed to marvel at the emotional impact of doomsday on a couple of unsympathetic characters. The premise is so silly that anyone with the most basic knowledge of astronomy will immediately recognize it as such; a planet several times larger than Earth has been "hiding behind the sun" but is now about to smash into us. (In case you didn't know, the earth orbits the sun in one year. In order for another planet to have remained hidden behind the sun for as long as we've had not just telescopes but really good astronomical data, it'd have to be moving around the sun exactly opposite to us with almost exactly the same period. How it could then suddenly be about to collide with us is of thankfully never addressed, as it would no doubt only have made matters even worse.) Some interesting visuals towards the end, and a lot of nice symphony-style music (cellos), but unfortunately nothing that could make up for the painfully slow and for me uninvolving story. A rock-solid rock-bottom rating of 1 from this reviewer then.</fullReview>

I only recommend it to those who literally have nothing to live for and in dire need for that extra push.I fell asleep more than 20 times throughout the movie, waking up to check if anything interesting had happened so that I can replay it if necessary , but nothing!If the director's purpose is to torture everyone for 2 hours of their lives, he certainly has achieved it. I'm actually glad that I have suffered through it so that I can enjoy all these emotional reviews. Thanks but no thanks. I rather have have a root canal without anesthetic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying if I could give this moving a negative number of stars, it'd be -10.I tried, I really really tried to find SOMETHING worth watching but after I wasted over an hour of my life I had to take a break and do something else. I fought with myself internally and the good in me won, thinking, "well it can't get worse and it's half over already, just see if something cool happens". If I couldn't hurt myself doing it, I'd beat the crap out of the part of me.I've seen reviews that the beginning and end are "good" well compared to the rest of the movie, yes, those are the best parts. To be honest though, watching the first 10 minutes of the movie I was honestly like, WTH is this!?!?!? there was no logic to the flow of the first 10 minutes, while the visuals were totally awesome and the graphics amazing my brain was already hurt from the assault of no significant meaning.This movie could honestly have been used at Guantanamo Bay as a torture tactic, lock the detainees in a room and play this movie and they would tell us ALL their secrets.As for the people that really really love this movie I'm very happy/scared for you. You either have to be super depressed or very very artsy (sp?) to appreciate it and if you are that depressed I'm so sorry.The entire wedding short story is so incredibly full of insanity and disorganization. The movie makes you HATE Justine (unless you're twisted), I mean, her new husband is doing everything to please her/kiss her butt and then she goes out and screws the teenager on the golf course!?!?!? Comon man! If I was ever forced to watch this movie again I'd gouge my eyes out and rip my ears off, it's that bad. Don't waste 2 hours of your life, I BEG YOU!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ummm...Yeah...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I understand an occasional impulse to make an "artsy-fartsy, made for Cannes" film, but even there should limits be imposed. My wife and I watched this film together, first in anticipation, then in bewilderment and confusion, and finally in morbid fascination akin to witnessing a train wreck first hand. Does anyone find watching the daily meanderings of a manic depressive personality entertainment? Our overall reaction was, "Why would anyone bother to make this film"? To be fair, the premise of another planet colliding with our own was compelling enough to make us want to see it happen on film. THAT part of the film was done well enough, but it was overshadowed by the boring, tedious horror that made up the rest of it. Usually, these types of films prompt my wife and I into a frenzy of fun-making at the film makers expense. With this film, we couldn't muster even that much enthusiasm. My closing comments are simply this: They wasted a lot of time and money MAKING this piece of crap, don't waste yours by watching it.</fullReview>

I wish I had some of the medicine that Keefer took to kill himself about 15 minutes into the movie. Please lets get married so I can cheat on my new husband 20 minutes later and then watch him get in a vehicle and drive off. And the ever classic lets leave my wedding reception, get in a golf cart and pee in the middle of a field while looking at the approaching planet.

		<fullReview>Saw the movie. Kept thinking I was missing "it". No, I wasn't. It was crap; rubbish. The poor actors really didn't have much to work with. The wedding took up half the movie. Ba-bow ! is my comment. Maybe Lars should stick to the happy endings, perhaps he does a better job with those. Long and boring; people walked out. Sorry, I wanted it to be good too; in fact I just thought it would be. Disappointing. I don't know about the two women having "issues", all of the characters had issues; unrelated boring ones. And poor Keifer had to be a pathetic stuffed shirt, then a gutless bastard when he disappeared to kill himself and leave his Mrs to (literally) cover up for him. Then she tries to run off herself but didn't make it so when she came back, told her sister how she wanted to be with her at the end (Liar) Hey, maybe I did get the movie after all. No, it was crap. Oh, and there were some really clunky bits in the filming.... Example: the moon and planet glare (like sun glare in photos) in the yard with the trees (2 blue dots in the grassy/tree area) an obvious oversight by everyone from the camera guy to the editor...... And the "wobbly" filming style just made it look amateurish and annoying. It was a B grade chick flick. God, I really didn't think much of this film did I. Again, sorry. Deborah</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good that it makes me forgive LvT about Antichrist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First part: IntroI'm French and movies are usually released later in my country than in the USA (or other countries), that's why most of the time I can have an idea (based on reviews of the US/foreign users) on new movies months before they can be seen in French theaters . But for some reason, Melancholia was released earlier in France than in the US, so here is my review, has a repayment to US users (and more generally to all users who still can't see this movie). One more thing before starting this review, we French people are bad in English, actually I'm quite good for a French (really I'm not lying) but still I don't use advanced vocabulary so my review may seem basic (you might even think it was written by a 12 years old -_-'), it may also contain a few mistakes, sorry about that, I hope you will enjoy it though.Second part: Review First, Melancholia is a slow movie, and lasts more than 2 hours, but I didn't get bored at all. I found it very fascinating, for me Melancholia is kind of similar to Lynch movies that are slow too but catch your attention very deeply so that you forget about the whole world, about time, and just focus on the movie. The cast is brilliant, especially Dunst and Gainsbourg, they really act perfectly in this, K.Sutherland is good too and so is the rest of the cast. I don't want to make a "spoil review" so I can't say a lot of things but basically this film will captivate you more and more and the closer it comes to its end, the more intense you will find it (I like to call that a "crescendo" movie, just like Black Swan or Memento for example), and eventually you will find it really deep and beautiful, and you will want it to last forever (or at least for hours). Let's talk about the final scene, this is of course the peak of this "crescendo" (even if many others scenes are really good too, I tell you that cause some might say this is the only good scene of this movie, well it's not), and seriously I can't remember a scene being so moving in any other movie I've seen, that is to say 6, but I plan to see a 7th soon (just a joke :O). Actually, the audience was so captivated during this final scene that no one in the Theater could move during several minutes when Melancholia ended (OK maybe for some people it's due to the fact that they had fallen asleep at some point),.That being said, you will find, as for any other movie, reviews with this kind of summary "0/10 what was that really? In one word: BORING". I must say I understand these reviews cause Melancholia is one of these movies you are likely to find either a work of art, either a piece of sh** (like I already said it looks a little like a Lynch movie). So I really hope Melancholia will captivate you, and if it does you will really love it but if it doesn't, well you have been warned here and now, haven't you?PS: BOOM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was another example of the trailer being way better than the film.Opening up on a wedding that takes up half the runtime, Melancholia can not seem to move itself past the chronically depressed Dunst to get to any real story telling. I have to applaud Dunst's performance, she totally infects the viewer with the depression her character suffers from. This would be fine should it not be served with a helping of utter boredom and lack of character development. I don't think we ever get any back story for her or anyone else. Just that she is getting married, and she is chronically depressed, and acts like a child who desperately needs a nap.My advice? Recored it on DVR and fast forward to the cgi scenes and Miss Dunsts laying on the rocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is a 2011 film written and directed by the controversial Lars Von Trier and follows two sisters as the end of the world draws near. The film is actually more about the current lives of the two sisters than it is the end of the world; yet the impending doom does heavily influence a series of events. Presently, the film has received mostly positive reviews and was praised for the imagery used throughout the film.To truly appreciate all that Melancholia has to offer the film must be analyzed by taking a look at its two separate acts. The feel of the first act is much different than the feel and plot of the second act. The first act is titled "Justine", as it focuses on the character Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her severe depression on her wedding day. The first act doesn't have much to do with the fact that all life on Earth is going to be wiped out. In fact, it doesn't really focus on the impending planet collision at all; it is simply about Justine as a character and all those around her at the time of the wedding. It is clear the Justine suffers from some type of mental illness but it is not made clear exactly what is wrong with her. She does very odd things throughout her entire wedding day including cheating on her husband. She spends a majority of the time away from her party, hiding out either on the golf course located outside or with her nephew, which seems to be the only things she derives joy from. Justine can be a very annoying character to watch as she seems to want to do nothing but ruin her own party, yet the camera shots of her off on her own either on the golf course or in the backyard are some of the best in the film. The second act of the film titled "Claire" focuses mainly on Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and the impending impact of the planets. The first act can be slightly more interesting because as a viewer it is not really explained why Justine is doing all of the things she does, a lot of mystery surrounds her character. The second act picks up slightly after the events of the first, but follows Claire this time. She is worried about the collision yet her husband assures her it will miss Earth and they will be able to gaze upon it with their telescope. Throughout the second act Claire must deal with her Justine's depression as well as her own husband and child, all while constantly worrying about the collision. The second half of the film is much more intense than the first, and the editing reflects that, especially towards the climax. The use of shaky shots gives the viewer a sense of uneasiness and uncertainty as to how it will end.Perhaps Melancholia's greatest achievement is its cinematography and beautiful sequence of unique shots, most notably in the opening sequence. The first opening sequence takes place entirely in slow- motion, showing many of the main characters, and is one of the highlights of the entire film. The camera work and settings used in this film are really something to talk about. The setting of a mansion is both isolating and elegant, and these two things are reflected within the carefully planned camera work.My biggest gripe with the film would definitely be its pacing. It will be really engaging one minute and then slow down to a dead halt the next. However, when the film does have its shining moments, they are extremely memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes-- I guess the acting was "good." The problem was that NOBODY in the film acted at all like any human being would in the situations in the movie. Nobody would react to Dunst's character's weirdness at the wedding the way they did in this film.And nobody would react to the impending doom of planet earth like the people in the movie. For one thing they'd all be watching CNN--not isolated and confused about the facts way out at some lavish retro-estate somewhere. And the Keifer Sutherland character--why on earth would he OD and miss the big event?The actors all seem to be moving through a haze. Only the horses SEEM to act naturally. And given the plot, I'm not even so sure about that!So maybe the people weren't supposed to be real--maybe it's all supposed to be some kind of a metaphorical "philosophical treatise"--so what?If I'd remembered it was a Lars Von Trier film I probably would not have watched it.For BETTER movies on this topic and these themes: see ANYTHING by Bergman--i.e.WINTER LIGHT if depression is your thing. Also Woody Allen's wonderful and insightful MELINDA AND MELINDA.For a non-Hollywood film about a large planetoid striking earth and killing everyone, I HIGHLY recommend a Canadian Indie film of a few years back:"LAST NIGHT." It is great, and is everything that Melancholia is NOT. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!In terms of Cosmic cutaways within a film--check out Terence Malik's TREE OF LIFE. A movie worth watching, and again, much better.Von Trier's so-called "Dogme" manifesto strikes me as so much B.S. --His films hardly even live up to his own espoused principles. Like--in not having improbable or unnatural plot devices or acting. Watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Triers' 'Melancholia', aspires to Ingmar Bergman-like heights, but ends up as pretentious, pseudo art house fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Melancholia' is not only the name of the condition that afflicts Danish Director Lars Von Triers' protagonist, Justine, but it's also the name of the planet that has just come out from hiding behind the sun, and is on a collision course with earth. If you're anticipating watching another sci-fi thriller, this is not the film to go and see. Like this year's other entry in the indie pseudo sci-fi category, 'Another Earth', the focus is not on that annoying other planet up in the sky, but on the conflicts between the afflicted parties down on earth.Von Triers divides 'Melancholia' into two parts that focus on two very different sisters, Justine and Claire. In Part I, Justine is a mid-level advertising copywriter, who arrives two hours late to her wedding with groom Michael, at brother-in-law John's estate. Just about everyone is speaking American English, so I assume the setting is supposed to be somewhere in the US, but it's not really clear. Justine is suffering from severe depression for unknown reasons and there are some suggestions that she may have psychic powers.One explanation for Justine's blues is that she comes from a highly unpleasant family. Don't ask for any back story, you'll just have to be content to accept the fact that Von Triers' characters are inherently dysfunctional. There's a method to Von Triers' madness and I will attempt to shed some light on it by the end of this review. Suffice it to say at this juncture that in Von Triers' weltanschauung, all the so-called 'normal' people, are uncaring, and in some cases, plain 'evil', and the 'abnormal', those suffering from so-called mental illnesses, are actually quite sane.Justine's relatives, friends and business associates are designed to offend our sensibilities as they all come across as self-centered and misanthropic. The worst offender is probably Justine's sarcastic, divorced mother, who tactlessly condemns the institution of marriage in a wedding toast, and expectorates numerous insults in front of the assembled guests, including the bride and groom. The father isn't much better, a card-carrying alcoholic who promises Justine, in the midst of her worst moment of decompensation, that he'll stay the night, but later leaves a note to his daughter, apologizing for leaving, due to a change of mind. There's also Justine's creepy boss, who attempts to humiliate one of his new employees in front of her, only to provoke an enraged Justine to send the boss to an early exit from the festivities. How does the new employee respond to Justine sticking up for him? He promptly has sex with her on the golf course. Passive schlub husband Michael, decides to leave Justine, with nary a protest. Lest I forget, brother-in-law John has no tolerance for the mother's bi-polar-like outbursts and at one point gathers up her luggage and dumps it outside the front entrance of the estate, until passive-aggressively reversing himself, and bringing the luggage back up to her room.The second half of 'Melanchalia', Part 2, focuses on Justine's sister, Claire, who lives with John and their young son, Leo, at the estate. Claire is seemingly the most 'rational' and 'normal' of anyone who we've met so far, so when Von Triers transforms her into an abject coward, then we began to see what's going on here. It's no secret that Von Triers created 'Melancholia' as a result of his treatment for depression. When his therapist suggested that depressed people are more 'calm' in moments of crisis, that gave Von Triers license to affirm what he knew all along?that he, otherwise known as one of the "depressed oppressed", are better than all those nasties, he's been pitted against during his entire life. Of course one must accept Von Triers' supposition that all the antagonists we meet in 'Melancholia', are not caricatures, but multi-dimensional portraits, of living, breathing, human beings.Evidence of Justine's 'triumph', can be found in Claire's reaction to her impending doom. As 'Melancholia' (the planet that is), is about to take the lives of everyone on earth, past nut-job Justine calmly pulls herself together and miraculously becomes the 'strong one'. When she finds John after he commits suicide, she calmly covers him with hay in the barn and doesn't freak out. She then builds a protective 'magic cave' for Leo, so he won't be afraid at all when earth completely implodes. Meanwhile, once 'normal' Claire, is frantically driving the family golf cart (the cars don't work because of earth's new found, screwed up, gravitational pull) with Leo into town, so she can get "help" (of course the implication is that she's 'lost it' because of course, how can you get 'help', when the earth is about to collide with another planet?).One can view 'Melancholia' as a poor man's, reverse 'Persona', the classic 1966 film by Ingmar Bergman. Von Triers echoes Bergman's preoccupation with the differences between two women from different classes, different walks of life. In Persona, a lower class nurse, cares for an upper class, well known actress who suffers from mental illness. The 'simpler' nurse turns out to be more 'real' than the actress, who feigns mental illness to cover for her narcissism. Here, the seemingly afflicted Justine, proves to be much stronger than her sister, the wife of a millionaire, who, when faced with the fact that earth is about to be destroyed, is unable to muster the courage to face death, bravely.If there's any saving grace in 'Melancholia', it's the iconic series of magisterial images in slow motion, mainly seen at the beginning of the film. Otherwise, the actors are hemmed in by the pretentious screenplay, which make them all seem like laughable caricatures. Von Triers' use of a bombastic Wagner score only adds to his reputation as a director with adolescent sensibilities, who doesn't even come close to approaching the sensibilities of the world's master filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie at a sneak preview so i didn't know what to expect. I've seen the trailer but it looked boring. And surprise, it was. Nothing happens in this movie. The first 5 minutes we see some random slow motion shots of Kirsten Dunst surrounded by falling birds and some other weird stuff. Then the movie finally begins but it is shot like Boston legal 2.0 So too much zooming and shaky camera work. It is almost like being sea sick. This wouldn't be such a big problem if the movie actually had a proper story. But it hasn't. It's about the end of the world. But actually it's about nothing at all. Really i don't understand why did this movie got made. The characters, the camera work, the story. It's all horrible, you never come to care about any of the characters. Kirsten looks like she's on drugs and you want her to die because she does nothing in this movie. And i really don't know why Kieffer Sutherland committed suicide at the end of the movie when the earth would end in a couple of hours. Why? It was actually a relieve when Kirsten tells the planet earth is the only place where such boring life is present. So i waited to see the end of the world. And it just wasn't enough. But when the earth finally ended I smiled, and people laughed in the audience. Because it was finally over! The only good thing in the movie is the music. That's well done. So i give this movie 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.....to those who made this film, this was the most exquisitely beautiful, stunningly photographed waste of time I have ever seen. It makes one wonder if beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. I lost interest just as Claire was helping Justine into the bath because by that point I felt no empathy at all for any character - save for the event planners.Understand that I am diagnosed with clinical depression and have been treating it with therapy and medication since 1991. I also know that I am a profoundly selfish individual. I deal with it by exercising generosity towards others when I want to reward myself. Funny that I should feel that way tonight. I want to hurl applause at the film for the opening stanza, for it was reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I want to credit the actors for their fine performances. I want to hail the imagination behind the obvious themes. The sets, costumes, music....it's all so wonderful.But the movie moved along like a newly-crafted Egyptian obelisk on it's way from the quarry to it's resting place. Which is a shame really. I was detecting metaphors throughout the story and then it hit me - the moral of the story is if you live in a vacuum of doom, then begotten will be doom. The characters repulsed me for they reminded me of the kind of person I once was and could still be. But unlike them, I have better things to do than to feel sorry for myself. These persona's are mirror-images of what makes the world today seem so desolate. They are myopic, self-indulgent and shallow. The very things that make anyone miserable.I know the artsy types will cringe at my review, even accuse me of being a myopic troglodyte for my misinterpretation of a masterpiece. They're entitled to feel that way if they choose, but I'm an open-minded motion picture enthusiast and I felt like I was watching semi-frozen molasses make it's way toward a drain. I shut it off slightly more than halfway through because there was nothing captivating beyond the artistic effort put into the production.I'm gonna try to forget this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this this wasn't one of the worst artsy farsty movies ever made, please tell me the names of the ones which are worse...I'll avoid them like the plague. First we had to sit through an hour of wondering why we were supposed to care about some rich girl's wedding, depression and rejection of her husband... I don't read reviews in advance so I didn't know the world was coming to an end. Then we have to suffer through more bad acting until we are finally told the whole point... kaboom. Of yes there was that telling planet hitting the earth in the opening moments, but I foolishly thought that was metaphorical like when peoples' worlds collide, not reality like "When Worlds Collide." Of course, there was nothing scientific about this movie. And as if all else weren't truly ridiculous, the sound track from hell, Tristan and Isolde was utterly ludicrous. Poor Wagner, to be so abused. I rank this as one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen in my life... mostly because it was incredibly pretentious with no reason to be... there wasn't one aspect of it that was anything but tripe!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a piece of shite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is a moron. At least he is with this film. And he was in Cannes, too, when he said he was a Nazi. That's what I like about impromptu interviews or press conferences: You really get to see what someone is like. You get to see who someone really is, to some extent. With that press conference, we got to see that Von Trier is an idiot, and at least partially an anti-Semite -- if not a complete one.Okay, so he wanted to make a movie about depression. Got it. Then write a f**king plot, idiot. What we get, is a camera that purposely shakes hard for 132 minutes (yes, this bad movie is THAT long), we get annoyingly continuous jump-cuts throughout, and NO plot. I think someone needs to tell this aging director, that this style of filmmaking is no longer in vogue. Some shaking of the camera, sure, but not excessively for EVERY SINGLE SECOND.Of course, I knew this film was going to be horrible when the first 8 minutes -- yes, 8 minutes -- was a montage of slow-motion sequences that are meaningless. That really was a clue to delete the movie from my DVR right then and there. Guess I'm an idiot too, thinking "It can't be this bad throughout, can it??" (Yes, it can and was.)The science is also non-existent, in this "real" story. A planet from outer space approaching Earth (or any body approaching Earth) is NOT going to be visible in the sky 24/7. Impossible. Yet Melancholia is visible at night, and during the day, from the estate where this all takes place. What is the Earth doing, standing still??? (Of course not.) Way to go on the science, Von Trier! Bravo. You are a *brilliant* director!! (Not.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get Melancholia... But Who Did?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, the movie doesn't have to make any sense to me since I'm just a tiny spec in the universe and therefore my opinion can matter less to Lars von Trier, the director and author of Melancholia starring Kirsten Dunst as a bride to be who happens to be manic depressive and is about to do a very bad, bad thing on her wedding night. SPOILER ALERT: Also, a cosmic catastrophe is bound to happen: a planet named Melancholia is to cross paths with Earth's and the question throughout the movie is whether it may or may not collide and destroy life as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it...And I feel fine!!! And I get it that there's some artistic value in the opening scenes when we see Kirsten Dunst in her wedding dress in different scenes: falling in a pond, walking on the grass while being held back by roots, or electricity emanating from her fingertips. It's beautiful to see these images as if they were moving paintings, moving pieces of art. One thing I must admit is that I loved the opening of Melancholia: the premise, the unusual silence, the beautiful music from Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde's opera that elevates the film from your regular science fiction movie to another status. Look, I get all that.What I don't get is that Melancholia has been praised as the movie to watch for in the Oscar race, especially Kirsten Dunst's role as a distressed bride who is not ready for commitment and is clearly uncomfortable throughout her wedding reception but later on rejoices in the thought that the world is coming to an end and there's nothing we can do about it. I just don't get it. And I'm not the only one that doesn't get it, either. I typically like this sort of movies that are thought provoking and ponder more questions than answers: what would you do if you had a few days to live? What would you do? Where would you rather be? Why does this movie that starts off with a wedding reception that lasts for what seems forever end up being a science fiction flick? I have no idea whatsoever, please someone explain it to me as if I were a five year old.READ MY FULL REVIEW AT ITALO'S CORNER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where is the Zero Star option?This is my first review. This movie was soooo bad I felt compelled to see what others thought. I am pleased to read many agree.Sad, depressing, pointless, empty, disappointing. My wife warned me ahead of time so my expectations were low. It did not even meet my lowest expectations. As I write this review trying to rethink all the sad, depressing, empty and pointless moments, I realize it is not worth even the smallest effort. The whole entire movie was sad, pointless and depressing. Equally disappointing was the huge was of such a talented casts abilities. They all portrayed their sad, depressing, and pointless roles the best possible way they could be played. It is too bad this great cast could not been put to better purpose in a better movie.For those who love this movie because they connect with it...I am very, very sorry.IMHO, movies are supposed to be entertaining. I do not feel that being sad and depressing is entertaining.If you like sad, depressed, and want to connect with an empty and pointless movie then I guess you will enjoy it - maybe.The movie had no plot, there were no great events, there was no drama, there was no laughing. There was sadness, depression, people wallowing in their misery acting sad and pathetic. We got to see her topless - probably the highlight of the movie - but it was when she was being sad and depressed so it's a wash.Save your time, save your emotions, find something else to do...We see the end of the movie in the first few minutes. The rest is sad and depressing and then the world ends as predicted in the beginning, but it ends with no great excitement. We see the end of the movie in the beginning - the world ends. But the entire movie is about something else. We are sad and depressed but it has nothing to do with the world ending. And then the world ends. What was the point of being sad and depressed? It had nothing to do with either the beginning or the ending of the movie.pointless - waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I had high hopes for this movie and really wanted to like it, but we barely made it past the absurd, brutal, slow-motion opening that gave away the whole story and then had to struggle to make it through to the end of the movie. (You can save yourself a lot of time and aggravation by just watching the opening; it tells you all you really need to know.) It was fairly excruciating, and I caught myself nodding off several times. The acting was okay, but the writing and direction were awful. This was one of the worst movies we've ever seen, and it was shocking to see so many good actors in such a bad movie. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Right now, I can only think of one or two movies that I have disliked more. We're intelligent, well-educated movie watchers, but this one just didn't do it for us at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to 'Another Earth'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2011 two films arrived on the scene in which a second earth/earth like planet appears in the sky. One of these was Mike Cahill's 'Another Earth', with the second one being lars von trier's 'Melanchola'. Unfortunately the Cahill film was almost totally overlooked as he is a little known director, and his film had few 'named' stars in it (Brit Marling being the lead - a case of "who she"?!), whilst the lars von trier's film was packed to the rafters with big names and faces - Keifer Sutherland, Charlotte Rampling, and of course Kirsten Dunst. It was trier's film that got all the praise and awards, but my question is why? This is a rambling, self indulgent shambles of a film in which actors mumble their lines making it almost impossible to follow what they are saying, the camera jerks all over the place in style that became outdated after the final episode of 'NYPD Blue', and what narrative there is appears to centre around some of the most annoying, horrid white middle class moaning minnies you could ever wish to met! I wish I could find something positive to say about this film - I really do (and I assure you I am no stranger to obscure, frustrating films as a loyal member of my local film club where such films are bread and butter to us!) but, beyond the fact that Dunst, as always, looks beautiful, there really is nothing I can find. This obscurity for the sake of obscurity - a form of film making beloved by certain critics who live in the bubble of film festivals and press screening but who rarely have to rub shoulders, and experience the views of, the great unwashed - just the characters in this film.No, if you want to see a film in which a second earth has affects upon the people on this earth then avoid this like the plague, and do yourself a favour and go watch 'Another Earth' instead, a vastly superior film in every way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is the kind of movie my wife gets angry at me for watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to give it a chance, with mixed reviews and all, but with a HIGH 7,4 rating on IMDb I have procrastinated watching Melancholia, until nowThis was a complete waste of a perfect evening with the misses, having her pass out on the couch, and objectively agonizing myself through to the end of the movie...Anyone who knows a melancholic person of this magnitude, knows they probably would not successfully make it to the point as getting married having a successful job etc. as introduction to our main character suggests, and then take a turn for the worst on this most important night. As for the story's sake, let's accept her condition and where she's ended up on this evening and in life. The sci-fi part of the story is supposed to give some sort of understanding as to why we should find empathy for her and the movies other characters. I didn't find it. Don't think we were supposed to like anyone in this movie. All of them being well eccentric. Almost as we all know and dislike someone quite like at least a couple of them. Funny thing is, I actually dislike Kirsten Dunst somewhat less as an actress after seeing Melancholia. Strange that one...I just have to say, if you watch the movie, and dislike it, you deserved wasting your time. You have been warned.If you watch the movie, and can relate to our main, enjoy it, or in any way feel the need to quietly go to bed and process your thoughts, you have it to good... people are starving+'s music editing and artistically well balanced dislike Kirsten Dunst a little less after watching. -'s The storyline is crap CGI is low budget but not the main factor Realism is totally off as of gravity, water, atmospheric alteration not happening, so not sci-fi worthy categorized. There is just no point in liking this movie. It's almost like I feel provoked at all the people giving it good reviews, and high ratings.Melancholia went down as a -1 in my book...This is the only movie that made me feel the need to make an account on IMDb and put in my 2 cents.Until the next waste of time movie, I'm out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Reviewers didn't seem to understand the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch a movie, I can put up with mediocre cinematography and other shortcomings but I cannot get past characters that do not say and do things that real people are likely to say and do in the circumstances where the characters find themselves in the movie.In this respect, Melancholia is perfection, while other aspects, from dialog to staging, are merely ingenious. The script brilliantly reveals the main character Justine step by step, played by Kirsten Dunst. At first she comes off as a one-dimensional neurotic, prone to inexplicable fits of depression and whimsy. At times she is so depressed she cannot get herself into a bath. As the story progresses, her actions exhibit a breadth of aberration beyond sadness and pathos, from the anti-social -- as in showing up two hours late for her extravagant wedding reception -- to outright hostile -- such as by having impromptu outdoor sex with her boss's nephew during that reception. The audience is prepared to interpret these acts as part of an old pattern of behavior, given her whacked-out family, her flighty father and her mouthy, mean spirited mother. At this point no one is liking Justine's character. Is this an artsy movie about a crazy rich woman? Boring. Then the script introduces us to the apocalyptic event that is behind Justine's behavior but without connecting the two yet. We see a giant blue planet menacing the evening sky. We are told that the consensus of scientists is that the planet presents no danger, that it will pass by harmlessly. But we are cued to wonder what the real story is, such as by Justine's sister turning up contradictory assessments in a web search. The only character that doesn't discuss the looming planet is Justine. Why? As we learn later, for Justine there's nothing to talk about. In fact, for her purposes it's best to keep her knowledge to herself. Is there a connection between Justine's mad behavior and this threat? If so, why isn't everyone else acting out as well? Maybe Justine is just being Justine, prone to erratic feelings and hysteric acts, and the possible danger posed by the planet is turning up the volume.But then the script reveals Justine is an advertising executive who functions at a too high a level to be a career depressive neurotic. She is the go-to gal that thinks up the tag lines for a major agency's top ad campaigns. Her boss surprises the family by giving her a promotion at the reception. Justine is sensitive, a creative who feels the world around her deeply, and a seer. The director relies heavily on Dunst's marvelous facial expressiveness to convey an inner world that she struggles to keep inside and away from those around her.This leads us to the aspect of Justine's character that is the motivation for her behavior. Justine knows that the big blue planet will destroy the earth. She's worked it out the way an autistic knows the number of beans in a jar without counting them, the way she can miraculously come up with the perfect tag line. To the people around her this ability is like magic. This time she decides to use it for her own benefit, to exploit others rather than to be exploited as she has been, such as by her despicable boss whom she later tells off. In contrast to her family who will only realize their fate hours before the event, Justine has had days, weeks, months -- who knows how long -- to feel sadness, terror, anger -- the full range of emotional reactions to certain death, and to plan her final days. The rest of her family is variously numbly unaware, or in denial, or confused to the end. Justine is perfectly clear: Everyone and everything is going to die. Justine doesn't waste time trying to explain the truth that she sees. Perhaps she doesn't feel that these people in her life deserve to know the truth, or they won't believe her anyway. She decides to use her special knowledge to her own benefit. She works down her bucket list. She gets married. She gets her brother-in-law to throw her an expensive wedding reception. She gets her sister to comfort her in her moments of crippling despair, but without revealing the cause to her sister. Instead she lies to her: "If you really think I'm afraid of a planet, you're stupid." But her sister suspects there's something her sister isn't telling her, later accusing her: "You're lying to all of us." And she is. She prepares only her beloved nephew, keeping his innocence safe to the end. To help us to relate to the depth of her feelings the movie is filmed in the beautiful natural scenery of a wealthy family's estate. Had Justine been poor and the family filmed in a two family house in South Boston, Justine's cynical defense against her feelings of sadness and rage for her and the world's demise would not have the same sting: "The Earth is evil. There's no need to grieve for it." Melancholia is about human nature and family brought into sharp focus by the ultimate time-out. It is about the relationship between the creative and the exploiters of the creative. Like all great movies, it drifts between the real and dream state of consciousness. Justine's visions at the start of the movie are so drawn out you worry that the whole movie will go on that way. After that you are with Justine and her family in the final days of her life that she lives out on her own terms, and it really feels like the end of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have never wished for a collision with another planet, until I watched this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think about the end of the world, we usually think about the things we have always wanted to do, but never got the chance to. In whatever way it is that we wish to live our last hours on earth, whether it be by going out with close friends and relatives, or doing the things you never thought you'd do, the feelings of impending doom are the driving force behind our decisions. There have been many films lately that seek a comedic twist to something of this level (which isn't a bad thing), but what Lars Von Trier does with Melancholia is give us a beautifully orchestrated vision about the beauty that comes with the destruction of our planet as well as very realistic and often somber interactions between the characters in this film. One can't help but be mesmerized and terrified by the magnitude of Melancholia and the attention to detail, the science (dear lord!) was easy to understand and though it wasn't the focal point of the film, it was enough to offer the audience an idea as to how something like that was possible. (I would be lying if I said it didn't make me weep.) The film is separated by chapters that focus on the two sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg and their lives before and after they found out about Melancholia. I believe that by taking the time to show us how the sisters were before the end of the world even became a possibility, we understand why they react the way they do to the news. Accepting what is to come instead of fearing it is what separates the sisters and the conversations/arguments that transpire speak a lot about the human condition and forces us to ask ourselves: What will I do with the time I have left? I watched this film about a month ago and I still think about it. It's captivating and absolutely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Trier's nicest movie, the world ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One important thing about "Melancholia" is that we're already told that the world WILL end in it. Lars von Trier has said it, and if you don't believe a trickster like him, then we have it in the epilogue of the film. The epilogue shows really visually stunning scenes from through out the movie we are about to watch (or rather, more artistic versions of what is going to happen). This is very reminiscent of "Antichrist" with the occasional artistic slow-motion shots we got in it, except everything is packed in the start of the movie here.After this we're presented with two acts. The first act is "Justine", which is about her and her wedding. Justine (Kirsten Dunst) is a seemingly happy newlywed, and at first we're really feeling the connection between her and Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) as they laugh, hug, kiss and celebrate their wedding day. As Justine notices a weird star in the sky, she also starts acting strange and dozy, and eventually do some things that mess up the party. Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) are the hosts of the party and paid for the whole thing, so needless to say they're not happy with how Justine is screwing up her own party. The second act is "Claire", and it starts at the aftermath of the wedding party. Justine is staying with Claire, John and their son and is really weak. So much that she can't even take a bath without help. Mean while Claire is worried about the planet that is suppose to be flying by Earth, but her husband assures her that scientists have said it will miss.It's hard to know how much to write about the story when everyone already knows that Earth will end. The fact that we know this makes it very interesting because even though the audience knows it (as I said, we even see it in the epilogue) we still get some weird hopes that it won't be true after all. Sometimes we even forget the planet all together because the first half of the movie focuses much more on the wedding and Justine. It's in the second act that everything really starts going as the planet Melancholia gets close enough to be spotted. The two sisters are really interesting to study, with Justine getting a pessimistic view at life and almost feels an attraction to the planet. And Claire is the much more humane part, with all the worry and panic that you can imagine getting in a situation like this.The movie is shot, as usual with Lars, with hand-held. Most of the film is pretty classic Lars in that sense, and most of it is also less visually striking than "Antichrist". But when the movie really does focus on beauty, it beats "Antichrist" hands down. And that's saying a lot because to me that "Antichrist" is one of most visually stunning films I've seen. Even though the style is directly influenced by Andrei Tarkovsky, I think Lars made it his own. "Melancholia" shares some of that visual style but as the planet becomes part of the visuals and not just the story, it's really amazing. The effects of the planet looks really good. Lars clearly knows how much and how little to put in his films to make it feel more than it looks. This movie is the least disaster-like disaster movie that I have ever seen, as the psychological aspect remains the goal and the planet is the backdrop. And of course it ends with the best shot of the movie, it's really beautiful and I'm happy I got to see it on the big screen.Our two main leads, Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg are both great in their roles. Kirsten won Best Actress at the Cannes festival and she actually did a great job with her dozy, off-beat performance. I'm not sure I've seen her act as well as she did in this one. And then we have Charlotte... Her performance in "Antichrist" is absolutely harrowing and must've been a tough act to follow, but luckily she was given such a different part as the good, humane sister. Yet again she did a brilliant job and quickly make you forget her as the crazy bitch in "Antichrist". I wouldn't know who to give the Best Actress Award to if I were to pick between Kirsten and Charlotte.Even though "Melancholia" probably is Lars von Trier's nicest movie to date, it's not without playing on your feelings. There are funny moments, very sad moments and extremely intense moments. It feels strange to say that it's his nicest when the world ends, but it is. It's one of his most innocent, calm and atmospheric films. It doesn't leave you happy nor sad, you just feel hollow and empty. Ignore the scientific factual errors, you've got what you came for - Lars von Trier's film about the end of the world. Yet you're not sure if you got what you wanted when it finally ended. It ends in such a bang, but it's a peaceful bang. Too peaceful? Not at all, it goes hand-in-hand with the rest of the movie. Would I say it's his best movie? No, I still think "Riget" (I&amp;II), "Breaking The Waves" and "Antichrist" are above this movie. This might be tied with some of his films, but I'm just clarifying where I stand on it. I think "Melancholia" is a fantastic movie, and I want to watch it again when I get a chance.For more reviews: FilmBizarro.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a polarizing movie. Not traditional at all, it examines a great fear that is hidden way in the back of the minds of some of us, what would the end of our world be like if our tiny Earth were to be hit by a larger planet? The first 8 minutes are filled with fantastic images, many in super slow motion, culminating with a depiction of a larger planet, maybe 6 to 8 times the diameter of Earth, colliding. In essence this depicts what is to come over the next two hours, showing how it affects the various members of a family.Kirsten Dunst is the central character, Justine, who suffers from depression. But as she mentions more than once "she knows things." This is demonstrated in a simple way at her wedding when she matter-of-factly states that there are 678 beans in the jar for the guess the number of beans contest. And there really were 678. This just establishes her talent for a more meaningful statement as the movie approaches its climax.She should be very happy as this is her wedding day, an expensive affair on a large estate with an 18-hole golf course by the sea (in Sweden), thrown by her wealthy sister's husband. Plus she is married to Alexander Skarsg?rd (Stellen's son) as Michael. But her behavior is bizarre and perhaps it is a feeling of what is to come.Kiefer Sutherland is her brother-in-law John, somewhat knowledgeable and partially obsessed with astronomy. He says the planet, which approached from an angle hidden by the sun, will miss them surely and it will be the most beautiful sight they will ever see. But privately he is stocking emergency food and batteries. He is worried.SPOILERS: John sees that the planet will pass the Earth, swing around, and then collide. He can't stand the stress and kills himself. As Justine, her sister, and nephew await the quickly approaching planet Meloncholia, they huddle in an open field under a tepee-like frame of long branches and she tells them this is the end of humanity. We are the only human-like life in the universe, she "knows" this. Justine has become the strong one, comforting her sister. Then we see the large planet crashing into Earth and soon the screen goes black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame that planet X missed....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Lars Von Trier; however this is an exception to the rule, sorry this review is so short, I just can't think of anything else to say...other than a planet hitting the earth, which I'm sure, in reality would not turn the earth into slow-mo (too many more technical faults to mention) what was this about? I like Kirsten Dunst, but from the offset, wanted to bury the annoying brat...I'm conceited enough to think I usually find the 'hidden' message; in this case, I have no idea what possible message was being transmitted, either by Lars, the inhabitants of planet 'X' or the abysmal acting; such a shame that John Hurt feels he needed to add himself to the cast list, which I honestly believe is the only way this made it into the theatres?My View: Stay at home,spend the ticket money on a Disney blurb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie too slow, and requires a lot of patience to sit through the climax and watch one hour of a wedding ceremony, too clichéd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as direction is concerned, I would rate it not more than 3 on a scale of 10, as most of the brilliance goes to cinematography. Kirsten Dunst is no doubt a great actress but there is a lot in her to mature, even though she gave what was demanded for the role. No matter how well she acted and even moments where the body language had to be melancholic, weak and confused, as an actor myself, I would say it is a tough job to maintain the graph even throughout those moments in different shots.I certainly wouldn't rate this movie eligible enough for a nomination, and even if Kirsten deserved it at the Cannes, this character wasn't challenging enough compared with the roles played by Nicole Kidman in Cold Mountain, Meryll Streep in 'Bridges of Madison County'. Kirsten Dunst is the showstopper, but a great actress ran out of choice as the script was weak.There is no point sitting through the entire film as the story lacks emotion, depth, feeling and fails to captivate the senses as that is what the audience waits for - to forget the world around them for a while and take a ride into fantasy! The movie lacks all of it. Kirsten seemed to be facing a complex with her own style of acting and somewhere the lenses captured the feeling or aim of wanting to level with the likes of Kate Winslet, and Meryll Streep as she tried to draw inspirations. She needn't have. As the beginning reveals the ending, do you really need to see the complete movie? It's an utter waste of time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get it, a movie is supposed to have some kind of message. This movie definitely has one, but the way that message is being transferred is very dull besides the beautiful imagery shown only for about 3 minutes of the movie. Why does the viewer have to be bored to receive a message? Aren't movies supposed to also entertain while saying something? Something this movie isn't doing..It is also very hard to relate with this movie if you've never been through depression. So its not a very enjoyable movie to sit through.But to be fair, the ending was a "blast". So if you want an idea of what this movie is about, I suggest reading the plot and then watching the end. Hope you enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier's Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Nothing to be done.'Samuel Beckett 'Waiting for Godot'Frankly, in artistic terms this latest von Trier's work cannot probably be given top marks - especially as far as its writing is concerned. The structure is plain, metaphors are far from being subtle, most characters are flat, the dialogue is sometimes overtly weak. Overall, its simplicity may seem to be bordering on the lack of inventiveness. But examining purely cinematic aspects of this work, separated from everything else, is the same thing as trying to find rightly shaped glasses to arrange the end of life on Earth in a "nice" way. So let's talk about the film's meaning.Von Trier has been brooding over our prospects as a civilization for a decade. He started with "Dogville" where he reflected upon the inevitably upcoming and inevitably ignominious end for the first time. In "Manderlay" he elaborated on his message and provided a sort of rebuttal to M. Moore's irresponsible populism through stating that it's not that the masses were like that because the elites were what they were, but it's rather vice versa. He quite justly pointed out that the root of evil was in human nature itself. Which he studied with his "Antichrist". And it looks like over this same decade we have been engaged in one thing only - diligently tried to justify his most morbid expectations. The scandal in Cannes, where "Melancholia" premiered, is a perfect "illustration" of how pathologically hypocritical our "civilized" society is, how close we are to an inexorable disaster and how justified the director's stance in this movie may be. The bunch of duplicitous buffoons bans von Trier - a provocateur with a big mouth and not immaculate taste, but certainly a humanist - from the festival for his quasi-pro-Nazi muttering, but simultaneously conveniently overlooks the unfolding of another truly fascist neo-colonial massacre, officially initiated by their own country in Libya and "based" on another pack of insane lies. If the Antichrist actually came into existence he'd surely have every reason to get melancholic. Because he would simply have nothing to do - we do all his job ourselves. Those who are inclined to believe von Trier's portrait of humankind to be a grotesque and his assessment of our future improbably gloomy just need to have a good look in the mirror. No, we do not normally kill our own children. We do not even often indulge in killing anybody else's ones. That is - with our own hands. It wouldn't be "nice". We have others to do that. While we look the other way. And when after six months of some such "humanitarian" butchery and fifteen thousand of strike sorties some psychopathic criminal appears on our TV screen and asserts that not a single kid was harmed in the course of the proceedings we say: "Oh, how nice." And go to sleep. With a clear conscience. And we are seriously intending to get away with it. When you come to think about it, von Trier's movies may actually be mitigations. I do not think that "Melancholia" is too straightforward either. "The Matrix" some time ago was quite unambiguous in its message - we have chosen to live an illusion. Everybody saw it, many liked it, and then - just proceeded with turning our very existence into a fake. We, Westerners, caused more civilian deaths in Iraq than US and UK military and civilian causalities in WW2 combined. Then we all liked "Avatar". And then went on to kill those civilians in other places. So it looks like one simply cannot be too straightforward nowadays. But it does not seem to work anyway.Going back to the movie in question, it's spot-on that the only sane person in it (all other characters are roaming with their eyes wide shut - the apotheosis being Udo Kier's one), Justine, is considered demented by everyone else. In this world of today, where reality is constantly distorted to its opposite, War is sold for Piece, and Ignorance made Strength - not through activities of the Ministry of Love (though this time may be nearing), but - more in line with Bradbury's "Fahrenheit" - because people simply choose to see only what they want to see and themselves apply immense amounts of exertion to avoid anything else, it's the only possible attitude to someone who is capable of seeing the truth and accepting it as it is. But terrible is wisdom if it brings no profit to the wise. If we regard a civilization as a social entity then individual salvation is impossible. And the open eyes cannot discern the way out in this case. They can only stare into the same abyss. As does von Trier himself. He knows that it's impossible to lie indefinitely. Neither to every one around nor to oneself. Objective reality does exist. It is dazzling and merciless - like Grace returning to Dogville, like Melancholia immitigably drawing to Earth. The collision with it is inevitable. But nothing has been learnt or proved helpful to remedy the present state of things. So von Trier does not try to dissect any more. He does not seek hope any more because he knows now there is none. He does not even get desperate any more. He just melancholically watching us die. Nothing to be done. If what is perishing is evil this can even be beautiful.And it should be said that there is one more justification for "Melancholia" to have depicted the ultimate cataclysm - humankind coming to its end - in such a beautiful way. Von Trier's world ends with a "bang" after all. Given the destination we are obviously heading for in reality, we can indeed easily wind up justifying the writings of another expert in "hollow men". And end with a "whimper".</fullReview>

Be careful because if you actually pay attention you might get motion sickness from the out of focus and jumpy camera. The beginning started out real well, but went downhill from there. I thought with the cast they had, it would have been much better. Also the story line sounded truly interesting. Sisters that look nothing alike and have totally different accents. Seriously, at least try to make the characters a little more believable. It was like a daytime soap, I could have walked away for several minutes and not missed a thing. Probably should have walked away all together. If you have to pay to watch this movie, save your money. This one will be on the clearance rack at Wal-Mart soon enough. I could probably rant on, but my head still hurts from forcing myself to sit through this monstrosity.</fullReview>

It follows the death of a world and the death of a girl who, in my frank opinion, should have been brutally killed by any number of the other characters in the first half of the movie for how badly she treats them. This movie somehow managed to make a very interesting subject extremely boring. I found myself talking during the movie just to keep myself from falling asleep. Kirsten Dunst plays a girl with no humanity whatsoever. People say she "accepts what will happen", but she instead decides to make everyone else;s last moments on earth a living hell. Awful. I have never rated a movie a 1. Not until I watched Melancholia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is is a bird? Is it a plane? Is it the superman? No, it's the super shaky Yellow Melancholia!Cinema is, more than anything else, image. On that, oh God, what an atrocious, dreadful, abominable, shockingly bad,execrable, heinous camera-work in "Melancholia".I did try but I couldn't watch the whole film. I am no stranger to von Triers films and I liked some of his films, like "Dogville, for example. But, despite of my interest in the film, I just couldn't get past the heinous camera-work. I am not an expert but I read that they filmed "Melancholia" with one of those small cameras that are also used to film weddings and birthday parties. They are completely automatic and any 15 years old teenager experienced with a mobile phone could have filmed "Melancholia".Of course, you can do a good film with that kind of wedding video camera and the excellent "Kreuzer Sonata" is an example of that. You can also be able to follow a story where the camera makes sharp, fast movements and the seminal NYPD Blue is an example of that. But the camera-work of "Melancholia" is just lousy, nothing else.What I saw in "Melancholia" were jerky, wobbly, shaky camera movements. Many times images were blurred, out of focus and many times you see images of people's backs or the like because the camera is constantly going from point A to B for no good reason but the sake of movement. To add insult to injury, the images are yellow! It is not that they treated the images to look like that. They are yellow when it is bright and brown when it is dark, what makes easy to see that they didn't use special effects to make the image to look that yellow. It was just lousy, lazy camera-work.I fast forwarded most of the film, thinking that maybe things would change but the jerky, shaky, wobbly camera work was always there. The images were yellow or brown...Imagine that the director is an unknown person, someone whose ordinary life doesn't make headlines of tabloids . Would people really take so much notice and be so enthusiastic about "Melancholia"?Lars von Triers has become a brand, like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. They can do no wrong, no matter what utter rubbish they do. If any of them spits on the floor there will be critics surrounding the area and taking pictures of the genial idea of spitting on the floor and its multiple layered meanings, its intensity and depth that so contribute to modern art and world peace.Many people who are "in" will look down to the ones who "didn't get the film". It is pathetic because they criticise mass audiences but behave no different from a herd of cattle and can't see the farce of "Melancholia" because they are blinded by Lars von Triers shining name. On the other hand, it makes sense that many people will be sincerely enthusiasticabout "Melancholia" because they are part of the dumbing down culture of youtube videos and mediocre singers like Madonna, who was praised by Lars von Triers in an interview...I wasn't expecting a linear story or a completely static camera. I watched many good films that had none of that. But the cinematography of "Melancholia" with its yellow images, shaky movements and out of focus images is so shabby that it ruins the film.I think that there are two main reasons for the acceptance of the lousy cinematography of "Melancholia": 1. Most people have a mobile phone with video camera. The abundance of bad images on youtube is probably making people more and more comfortable with bad images, as they are all "filmmakers" doing really bad images that they think are wonderful. 2.Internet and other new technologies (such as video games) are making many people, especially young people, to suffer from short span of attention.One third and minor reason would be that most enthusiastic reviewers watched this film in the cinema, instead of watching it on bluray disc as I did. A cinema screen is far more forgivable than a TV screen and it is possible that the shabby camera-work of "Melancholia" didn't look so unbearably shaky on the big cinema screen. Besides, when people watch a film in the cinema they experiment a "magic" that just doesn't exist when they watch the film at home.The farce of this film starts with the prelude to Tristan and Isolde. Just about any images in slow motion will seem to be fantastic whilst you are listening to the sheer beauty of Wagner's music. Actually, the only genuine and modern art in this film is Wagner's music. Music that premiered about 150 years ago, before internet, mobile phones and Lars von Triers.PS I browsed through some of the five stars reviews and the word "stunning" was used more than once to describe the cinematography. I think there are two ways to explain why reviewers considered visually stunning a film where the camera movements are so wholly, where so many images are out of focus and where the images are either yellow or brown: 1. They watched the film in the cinema, where the super shaky camera is not so distracting and the images were, I guess, not yellow. 2. They did watch the film on disc or the images are also yellow in the cinema. In this case, they probably found this film visually stunning because they are so used to the visual garbage they watch in youtube that they really lost, if they ever had, any reference of what a really stunning cinematography is.</fullReview>

I like films that provoke the mind - this didn't. The fact that at the end the audience were giggling in a way that suggested they couldn't believe it was that bad, that they must have somehow missed the point, said it all to me.Plot that made "Transformers" look like it was at the level of 2001 (Transformers being my previous "worst movie ever made" - but at least I knew I was getting crud in advance there).

		<fullReview>I saw this during the weekend and it is seriously very overrated. With the exception perhaps of the opening and closing scenes it failed to stir any emotion in me or provide any grounds for discussion/arguments.I am really amazed with the excited reviews here. It's evident that people are looking for things to like about it (beyond the opening and closing which everyone more or less agrees were great). I have watched many movies that were puzzling, confusing, surrealistic and the reviews here often gave me some additional insight or things to think about. In this case everyone is discussing technicalities due to the lack of substance. We are reduced to marvel at the visuals, the superior acting (which I also failed to see) or try to defend it by saying it was not meant for the general public. One reviewer even goes on to say that it was "Truly Trier-esque" ? really?So what is the movie about you may ask. Before going to see it I thought it would be about the reactions and feelings of people to their impeding doom, but if it was about that I failed to see how. First of all the risk to earth does not appear until half-way into the movie and it remains just a risk (not a certainty) for most of it. I also doubt that the movie was about the two sisters and their relationship with each other. Mind you that these are the only two characters that are explored - even the husband and son are little more than extras. So at the end of the movie we know that Claire is an ordinary woman that cares for her family (sister, husband and child) and is afraid of the planet that is closing in on earth. No more no less, probably the definition of ordinary. For Justine we know that she is moody then depressed then psychic and finally calm(?). They don't interact much, in fact I would say that we know more about how Claire's husband feels about Justine than about how Justine feels about her sister.The way I see it, the movie is probably about the melancholia of LvT. I guess he feels that people and their relationships are messed up, that the world is being destroyed or should be at least and that no one should miss it. Perhaps his therapist told him to express his feelings and he went and made a movie about it. It would also explain why he felt better when making it. In general I am a nice guy, but I don't see why I should care about any of it.This review may sound harsh, but this movie really annoyed me mainly because the way I see it, it was and is a huge missed opportunity.</fullReview>

I have never experienced a larger deficit between reviews and the actual experience of a movie. It was similar to observing art critics enthuse about a painting of a red square on a black background. Perhaps I'm a philistine but the film left me feeling cheated and empty. It was so dreadful. I kept waiting for it to hook, enchant, mesmerize or move me. It just bored me to tears.

The pride has unexplained mood changes and actions. The groom has no role. The boss, the parents, the guests.. all seems to be unaware of the story or the reason they're there!Then the story goes to childish view of how would people react if they knew doomsday is on the horizon(pun intended).You come out of the film thinking it wasn't rocket science they were explaining in the movie that no one understood. And it wasn't a complex piece of art that that might need a second or a third look to appreciate it more. None of that, it was the imagination of a dull and boring storyteller(i.e director).Art critics have agendas, this much have been proved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We begin at the end of the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the basic premise of Lars von Trier's epic Melancholia, we start with the destruction of the planet and then work our way back into a character study of two sisters and their unique minds and approaches. The film is split up into two parts, one focusing on Kirsten Dunst's Justine and her wedding day and the other focusing on Charlotte Gainsbourg's Claire and the days approaching the collision of the titular planet with our own. In studying these two women, von Trier explores the fragile states of mind that can come with people suffering from depression and anxiety disorders, something that he is well known to be quite familiar with. The end of the world collision seems to be a distinct metaphor for the kind of cataclysmic affect that these kind of mental diseases can have on the human mind. Melancholia works tremendously in this way, but it also stuck out to me as a phenomenal study of these two women, even without that apocalyptic backdrop.A woman on her wedding day is always displayed as the example of perfect bliss, the blushing bride who is nothing but smiles and happy tears. The moment we meet Justine it seems that something is a little off and as her day continues we discover that she has an apparent history with depression and it's coming to the forefront of her mind, breaking down what is supposed to be the best day of her life. Everyone around her tries to help her in some way (be it an approach of tenderness, anger or enabling), but Justine is unable to shake this powerful sensation. As someone who has suffered with depression, I found Dunst and von Trier's portrayal of it here shockingly accurate. The way that it can just eat away at you, no matter how hard you try to squash it or how wonderful other people can be around you. For some reason it just takes over and refuses to let go. Justine's unraveling was quite an emotional experience for me, made even more so by the state we see her in when it switches to part two.The second part brings us back to the end, starting five days before the collision occurs. Justine is now staying with Claire and husband John (Kiefer Sutherland), as they try to help her deal with her current frame of mind. John is fascinating with the approaching Melancholia, while we soon discover that Claire suffers from a serious anxiety disorder and a planet with the potential to destroy our entire existence is the worst case scenario for someone in her state. As was done with Justine's depression, Gainsbourg and von Trier portray this kind of anxiety to a shockingly accurate detail. The way that your emotions can change on a dime, just with someone saying a simple word, how one moment someone trying to comfort you can be the most beautiful bit of relief and the next it could drive you absolutely mad. The way the film shifts the positions of these two sisters from power to vulnerability is startling from the first half to the second, keeping us interested and keeping the actors on their toes.It is certainly no doubt that the film belongs to these two women. Gainsbourg proved two years ago in Antichrist that she is a force to be reckoned with on the acting front and von Trier once again gives her material to shine. She seems so resilient and tender in the opening part, the kind of sister who would always be there for you and you would always want, and then she is torn apart in the second. Starting off strong, she slowly unravels in the anxieties of her mind and it's stunning to watch how she breaks down in some of the final scenes of the film. Gainsbourg keeps you feeling for her so strongly the entire time, I really felt a deep connection with her character and she was able to establish that so well. Dunst is an actress who has never managed to impress me for more than about half of her performance, but here she is on a level I had no idea she was even capable of. As I said earlier, her portrayal of this level of depression is staggeringly accurate to an almost jaw-dropping level. She is so unraveled in the opening part and in a character that could have been this horrible, detestable woman she somehow makes you feel for her so deeply. She does things that are absolutely despicable but I still managed to feel so much sympathy for her, and I can accredit that entirely to Dunst's magnificent work here. In the second part she slowly starts to become this vapid, cerebral figure on the outside of Claire's looming destruction. In this, Dunst is able to reign in the more theatrical aspects of the character and become more subtle and internal, something that most actresses may have not been able to achieve. The most impressive part of the two women's portrayals is how well they complement one another, one taking the spotlight while the other supports and then shifting gears and changing sides. It's incredible to watch and even more incredible to look back on afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that goes nowhere very slowly. It is very artsy and has hidden meanings that nobody can uncover. There really is no true plot. Rather, you can interpret its many isolated scenes to mean whatever you want. The first hour seems so unconnected to the rest of the movie. The last half is even more frustrating because it just doesn't go anywhere. There really isn't much character development. Everything you need to know about the characters could have been summed up within a 5 minute scene. No depth. No explanations.Basically, its a confusing movie that nobody seems to want to say they had no idea what was going on after watching it so they just say, "That was a nice movie," so that they don't look stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 3 worst movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin.. As anyone that's reading the comments probably knows, this is a movie about a planet, Melancholia, about twice the diameter of Earth, that has been hiding behind the sun (?) and is now on a collision course with Earth. How that is possible is beyond me, as the movie is set in present time I wonder how the Hubble space telescope managed to miss that. OK, all this could easily be forgiven if the movie was good. Sadly it isn't.The biggest problem with this movie is that it's just so unbelievably boring. After a long and slow series of extreme slow motion shots of Kirsten Dunst looking half dead with birds falling out of the sky and a horse dropping to it's knees, along with a shot of the planets actually colliding, we get to a scene where Dunst and her fiancé (Alexander Skarsg?rd) arrive at their wedding. From there we get to witness the wedding for a full hour (!).After an hour of watching a wedding of people we care or know nothing about, we get to part II. Now I can't recall exactly how part II begins (as I was probably half asleep), but we quickly (in relative terms) get to the next day, where Dunst is beginning to act sick and weird. We never learn why exactly but it appears she has some phsychic abilities. It isn't until about 90 minutes or so into the movie that Melancholia starts playing some role. I won't spoil anything from here on although there really isn't anything to spoil anyways.The only compliment I can give this film is that the cinematography is at times very beautiful, but this doesn't matter much when everything else is bad.I can only recommend this movie to people that like watching paint dry, rest should stay clear! 1/10.</fullReview>

It was so bad... I never thought I would see something like that... The rest of the story is not interesting enough or believable to make up for the horror of very basic scientific mistakes. So basic ones! Unbelievable! First graders can see the mistakes! Another thing that displeased me on the movie, but that is a matter of taste, is the shaking camera, which made me sick of my stomach to the extent of having to close my eyes during some periods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad... boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier is an interesting filmmaker.. but I still have great trouble with his movies. Dancer in the Dark was pretty good, Dogville was crap (not due to the nice stage setting but due to the narrator having to be the one to add any emotion to the film) and I kinda enjoyed The Kingdom.So here's Melancholia, getting great reviews. So what the heck, let's see it, Dunst is a great actress, Gainsborough, Hurt, Sutherland, Rampling... all great actors.So what starts with a visual treat in the fits minutes, turns into a Festen-like wedding but one where nothing really happens... And then more doesn't happen and more... The shaking camera seems to be shaking for the sake of shaking a lot, but then that is the Dogma style, which is getting rather stale by now.To make sure, I am also not a teenager into TF (in fact TF2 must be the most stupid movie ever made). And I like slow movies if they take me along. Kurosawa made slow movies, but with a great climax that made it all worthwhile... I love Terence Malick's films and especially enjoyed the director's cut of The New World (which is a low slower than the theatrical) but these movies take you into a world, and atmosphere... they make you part of the world of the main characters. But in Melancholia, there's just slowness... it doesn't go anywhere, nobody does anything and that weird planet keeps changing colour from green to blue. All Von Trier tells us is what it's like to be depressed... well, we got that. But that was all... and that kinda depressed me.It has a few stunning shots, but the movie left no impression at all. And honestly. I don't understand why people love it so, except maybe for the sake that is different from average Hollywood films. But still, especially in this case, form does not win over substance.Too bad... on to the next one.</fullReview>

The landed gentry, and the servant-staff that carries their bags and wipes their noses, will all whimper when the world ends just as e.e. cummings foretold. A lot of talent turned out for nothing. Well, maybe nothing is the wrong term, for I'm sure they were all well paid for their efforts, but the end-result comes pretty close to nothing.

		<shortDescription>Did what it was supposed to...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start off by saying that this movie had it's cool moments. I mean, the actual 'Melancholia' stuff was rather interesting. That and some pretty, in my opinion, accurate portrayals of how society on a more personal level would react to this sort of event made this movie worth sitting through. Once. Ever.Other than that, this movie was so depressing it was painful. If I didn't know that there was something on a grander scale going on I would not sit through this whole thing. I saw in another review here how you might pick up on the details and appreciate this movie if you yourself have been depressed. I guess you could say I have been depressed at times, but that did not make this movie any better. It didn't use depression here to deal with anyones emotion and as a result, your own emotions suffered too. I literally felt physically ill watching this movie because it dragged up so much depression without offering any emotional development or progress. Everything was just depressing, all the time.Well, when I think about it, there was some emotional development. People got more depressed over the course of the movie. It went from sad to mind blowingly dull in a short time.I felt though that this movie conveyed the feeling that Lars von Trier wanted it to. I think it was successful in keeping with his idea. I only think it wasn't a good idea from the beginning. No amount of cool Melancholia stuff could salvage this movie after all that misery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The feeling isn't Melancholia: it's Nostalgia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not mean Nostalgia as a reference to the surreal Andrei Tarkovsky, though given von Trier's most recent exercise, you'd be forgiven for expecting to see any of that here. I mean nostalgia for the days when von Trier embraced his gift as a prankster, and his films had bite. His various cinematic exercises - the vow of chastity in Dogma 95, the hyper-elaborate stylization of Europa, the abstractness of Dogville - all had a self-consciousness the filmmaker complemented with an acerbic wit. You were either confounded or in on the joke, even when at its core lay a powerful, sometimes lyrical emotional core (Dancer in the Dark comes to mind, as does Breaking the Waves). Antichrist drew parallels to Tarkovsky by its visuals, yet with none of its humanism. It was hopelessly dark, far more than Melancholia, though ironically the latter is about the impending apocalypse. Much-publicized stories of the filmmaker's impending depression should have been a warning.In comes Melancholia, and here things begin to fall apart. The humor is gone, except for a few odd moments during the first act wedding ceremony (John Hurt gives the film its fleeting heart, conveying in a glance more honest emotion than Dunst does throughout the film). The hopelessness is there but without intent, without fear or suspense, without empathy for the characters, we can not feel for anything that happens on screen.And so, we are left with this frustrating experience, our heart rising at moments of fleeting perfection whenever John Hurt or Stellan Skarsgard are on screen, our hopes sinking at every tried stylistic tic: the pointless slow-mo, the nth repetition of Wagner's overture, and the bad effects.In a nutshell: you can find something better to do with these 2+ hours of your life. If you're in for an arty portrayal of family strife on a cosmic background, try the far superior Tree of Life, release the same year and premiered at the same edition of the Cannes Festival. The only interesting question Melancholia poses is what Von trier will do next. Will he bounce back in new exciting directions, or is this just one more stage of an inescapable downward spiral?</fullReview>

Contrasting human drama against impending doom where the doom is not stealing the show is genius.Folks who don't see or expect cinema to be art won't care for this film. I keep reading reviews and comments where folks are arguing about the meaning of the film. A different type of person prefers to discuss the effect of the film, the journey and impact it has on us, the audience.Battling over opinions based on meaning nowhere near as rewarding as comparing notes on different feelings and viewpoints we felt based on diversity of opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1 star rating is the most overused rating on IMDb. Most people who use it just "dislike" the film, and only want to lower its score and gain exposure.This is not one of those reviews. I legitimately hate Melancholia. Even writing this review, memories of the trauma boils in my veins. Melancholia is the anti-film, a failure on every level. Its poorly shot, more lifeless than the Dead Sea, p-r-e-t-e-n-t-i-o-u-s, and absolutely miserable for nothing.The film can't hold in its pandering to the art school crowd. Lars "I'm a Nazi" Von Trier immediately ejaculates onto the film the most "Mad Libs"-esq symbolism I've ever seen. The scene has no dialog nor relevance to the film. But, of course, film students are brought to tears by birds falling from the sky, vines entangling a dress, and electricity flowing from Justine's finger tips. Its essentially meaningless - it could have been replaced by any weird crap if it was shot well. But, in the end, the fans of this film are infinitely more entertained by flashy lights than even the most meatheaded of Michael Bay fans.But that's only the beginning of the biggest waste of time in history. Justine, a newly-wed, is feeling kinda down. Probably because of a chemical imbalance. Though apparently, we are back in the 50s, and nobody understands she has this problem. Thus, Justine becomes more and more obnoxious as the night goes on, even cheating on her husband for the lulz. The party - and the marriage - end when she throws a hissy fit at her boss. Finally realizing her actions actually have consequences, she falls into a deep lull...but gradually gets better, once learning that the Earth is doomed. She just knows things, because depressed people have a more realistic view of the world, which includes freaking prophecy. She precedes to act like a snobbish @#$%, convinced all life is evil because people didn't take her crap. After insulting her sister in her most vulnerable moment, she makes a giant tee-pee, and the Earth is destroyed.That paragraph is more action-packed and better written than the movie. This film takes its time, for no good reason. Its slow, its characters are boring and disposable, and the dialog is worthless.Justine is the worst lead in history. She's boring, disgusting, and has not a single good trait to her name. She's even worse than Alex Delarge, who at least has some personality. Yet we are supposed to sympathize with her? Are we? People say they relate to Justine - how? Just because she's depressed? I didn't know merely having depression is deep, and a positive trait.There is no reason to care about the main character's struggles. She's pathetic at the beginning, and just becomes a complete asshole. Everyone else is equally dead or rude. I didn't care about a single thing on screen. It created a feeling of depression...yet accomplished absolutely nothing, saying nothing about humanity. It was the longest 2 hours of my life, and I hope I never come across another film this awful again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot begin to tell how excited I was for this movie. It looked pretty promising from the trailers and I was excited for Kirsten dunst in this movie but my excitement stopped there. After many long shots and boring speeches I realized that this was a wedding party. The festivities stop there. All of a sudden everyone is crying and nothing good is happening. These miserable freaks are so sad for a pretty good reason; another planet is about to crash onto earth. The movie doesn't really delve into that much, instead what it does do is highlight two basic human feelings, Misery and Boredom, both of which are felt mostly by the viewer of the film. For most of the movie Kiersten Dunst is rolling around naked either in the water or some beaucholic field. She provides no plot and kind of wallows in her own depression at the sudden ending of the world. Everyone else in the movie either argues over something utterly unimportant or cries about their impending doom. I think the movie might have fared better if Lars had turned it into some sort of movie where people had to overcome the problem of the world ending and maybe just ride a horse instead. I just want everyone to know that I was so happy when the ending of the film came because all of these horrible people and their mundane problems were ended. When the other planet eventually crashes into earth I think I audibly shouted "THANK GOD" because this was the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of watching. If the maker of the film had just had these characters be happy and ride horses the whole time maybe this movie would have been much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film goers fall into two classes: those who like artsey dartsy movies and those who hate them. If you are in the first category, you will really love Melancholia. If you are in the second, you will really hate it. I was totally bewildered by it. This is not your usual bumper-car planet collision but something so unexciting that I dozed off a couple of times. The story, if there is one,is incomprehensible. Two people have a posh wedding at which they arrive late while Armageddon unfolds outside the gloomy wedding mansion in the form of the onrushing planet Melancholia. Oh yes, everybody at the wedding hates everybody else except the bride and her sister who may have an incestuous lesbian relationship!. And although the impending catastrophe of colliding worlds would have been forecast and known for at least a couple of years and certainly would already have triggered immense tidal waves and storms, nobody talks about it. What the movie does accomplish is the creation of a dark and tense two hour mood without much of a story to go with it. The surreal quality of the shots and the ethereal lighting absorb you although it's impossible to understand the reason for the obviously deliberate jerky camera work which both detracts and distracts. The opening scenes of two planets approaching each other plays out against the magnificent music of Wagner's Tristan Und Isolde. Somehow that powerful theme, which comes back several times during the film, is perfect for the message of the film even if I have no idea what that message is. (Well, it is that kind of film!)As mentioned, if you like the artsey dartsey and enjoy heated discussions about what the director intended, it's a ten. I gave it a four only because of the splendid performance of Tristan Und Isolde and the hauntingly effective surrealism of the images. Certainly an interesting and unique production. But almost anything else would have been more fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hopeless. Depressing. Beautiful. Melancholy (see what I did there?). These are the things that came to mind when I watched Lars von Trier's latest venture, Melancholia. The name of the film suits it oh so well, as it tells the story of the end of all life in the universe. Justine, a newlywed attends her wedding reception and puts on the act like she is happy. In reality she couldn't be more unfeeling towards the situation. She disappears for long intervals, throwing the nights schedule off track, disappointing her friends and family. Right before her and her husband consummate their new marriage, she says she needs a minute. She goes out, pursued by her Boss' nephew, who she throws on the ground and screws while wearing her wedding dress. That essentially shows you the moral values in this film. The cast is wonderful and littered with familiar faces, all of whom do a great job. we have Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg, John Hurt, Alexander Skarsgard, Stellan Skarsgard, Kiefer Sutherland, and more. Every one of them, very very human with their dual sided personalities. Caring but weak, Giving but pretentious, Charismatic but thoughtless, and so on. The movie is layered with different ideas but the one that stood out to me the most was hopelessness. There is a scene where Kirsten Dunst tells her sister that there is only life on earth and not for long. This movie ends with not just the destruction of earth, but the destruction of all living things and hope of life in the universe. The movie showcases the emptiness of every day life, using Justine as the outlet for this mindset.There is no escaping the doom of the giant planet, which is at least twenty times the size of earth, crashing into our planet. The whole thing is terrifying, heart wrenching, and beautiful all at the same time. If I could sum up the film in a sentence, that last one would be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thought-Provoking Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is one of those films that are hell-bent in making your brain work overtime. I had no idea how to rate this film because at times I was plainly annoyed and at others, I was deeply in awe. But then I understood the themes behind the film, mainly depression. This is not the apocalypse film people think it is, but it is more of a metaphor for depression, or we shall say the planet itself is a metaphor. When Melancholia ends life on Earth as we know it, it is the same thing on how depression is an easy infliction amongst our inhabitants. I liked how the film is there to make you think. It took me awhile to figure that out though.Lars Von Trier's film is situated in two parts. The first part involves a lavish wedding between Justine and Michael that was created by Justine's rich sister and brother-in-law and how Justine wants to be happy, but she is not truly happy. The second part is more about the relationship between the sisters as Melancholia is slowly, but surely on a path to collide with Earth.The acting is okay, depending on how you look at the film. Kirsten Dunst was not bad, especially as the depressed bride. Charlotte Gainsbourg does a good job as the sister. We have some cameos by Kiefer Sutherland, Alexander Skarsgard, Stellan Skarsgaard, and John Hurt. They all do a solid job in their limited screen time.Overall, Melancholia is a very interesting experimental film, or the typical Lars Von Trier film. He makes films not for the general audiences, but more for those who are in search of deeper meanings. It can be confusing because I can join both audiences so they conflicted over the mere thought of this film, but my deeper side won out in the end. The visuals are astounding and are a consequential part of the film. I also thought the use of Wagner's music was interesting, especially since he was associated with the Nazis. This is one thought-provoking film that may be worth a second look. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Worlds Collide for the No Exit Crowd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Melancholia" opens with a montage of paintings (by, e.g., Bruegel the Younger)set to the Act III vorspiel of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. After its PBS cum Art History 101 warmup the film takes us to a wedding reception at a golf course. The partygoers are the snooty friends and family of a rich, wretched couple. The camera twitches its way through the evening, snagging here and there shots of the celebrated actors in the Altmanesque cast as they wing whatever script there is, saying and doing ghastly things to each other.One scene is probably a motion picture milestone. I have watched movies for many years, but "Melancholia" may have recorded for the first time on film a simulated act of copulation performed in a sandtrap.This boiled-shirt crowd begs for the Three Stooges' full "Hoi Polloi" (1935) treatment. Unfortunately, instead of pies and bops on the head to repay all the privileged sniping, snarking, and tantrums, there looms a large rogue planet.So much for part one. The second part looks at two worried, unrelated-looking sisters as they and their families contemplate the approach of the orb. The leads improvise their way through another succession of somber, clumsily presented scenes, now in a domestic setting. And still more sniping, snarking, and tantrums. Meanwhile, the camera never stops fidgeting.It is hard to justify all this maladroitly handled gloom as metaphor or correlative for the film's titular affliction when the simple cause of the trouble is so obvious: being cooped up with creeps. Existential crisis from any other source is not needed once "Melancholia"'s people enter your life. With several characters seeming to recreate with minor variation the villainous John Hoyt persona in the mass market precursor "When Worlds Collide" (1951), I found myself rooting for that planet.Von Trier is at his core a sentimentalist, albeit in inverted form. He falsifies emotion just as surely as the most vulgar Hollywood schmaltzmeister. He cannot claim any greater worth for his art simply by counterfeiting only the very darkest, most repellent emotions. At least mass market treacle is something to escape to. "Melancholia", malady and movie, are things to escape from.A strange, appalling motion picture. Strange because the movie's graduate-degreed target audience and wealthy wine-bibbing backers apparently fail to notice (or care) that the film represents their class as so thoroughly rotten that it deserves ? or perhaps in some weird way brings about ? a planetary deviation. Appalling because "Melancholia"'s mindless nihilism seems to reflect a trend in how people create and assess art generally.A session with Nicholas Ray's "We Can't Go Home Again" (1976), the product of another disintegrating cinematic mind, may be the best preparation for "Melancholia". Von Trier's fans would be better and less expensively served by reading a copy of No Exit or Ship of Fools. For viewers with a more specific interest in things that loom there is always "On the Beach"(1960),"L'Eclisse"(1962), or even "Short Cuts" (1993). Those simply craving a stiff dose of depraved humanity behind the facade can treat themselves to Todd Solondz' "Happiness" (1998), better conceived and executed than von Trier's offering, though even less pleasant to watch."Melancholia" does feature Udo Kier as a wedding planner, a small role that he manages to infuse with the film's fleeting moments of life. I've been a fan since the 1970's ("Flesh for Frankenstein", "Blood for Dracula"). The few microscopic hints of a movie in this fetid botch happen when he is in the frame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean there is some good imagery, some good acting, and other pieces of brilliance in there. But do they combine to make a movie? No, not really.There are two parts of this movie. Each is unrelated to the other in terms of plot line. The movie is marketed as a doomsday scenario pending over a difficult wedding. In fact wedding has nothing to do with doomsday and is over long before.This is not a sci-fi action or thriller movie where I can just put my brain on the side and enjoy action or special effects. But this is not even a human drama where I can identify with the characters and sympathize with them. The scientific plot is unrealistic, the characters behavior is unrealistic, and (as it turns out) my expectations from this movie were unrealistic. I give it full solid four stars.One side note: Even though the movie promotes Kristen Dunst as the leading actor, her character (Justine) really appears to be only supporting Charlotte Gainsbourg (Claire).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tedious and irritating film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of director Lars von Trier's, but I like some of his films; however, other ones left me deeply irritated because of their obvious symbolism, which was combined with such exaggerated artistic pretensions that they end up feeling like accidental jokes. Or are they accidental? I have honestly never been able to determine whether the flamboyance from films such as Antichrist and Dogville, as well as von Trier's pro-Nazi statements and his self-proclamation as "the best director of the world", are due to an out-of-control ego, or to crafty jokes at the expense of the media and the North American cinematographic industry. On the other hand, when von Trier knows what he's doing, he can make films of an unusual emotional and narrative strength (Dancer in the Dark and Idioterne come to mind). But whenever his "internal diva" gets out of control, he ends up making films such as Melancholia.It's quite easy to figure out that Melancholia (the film) is an examination about depression, with Melancholia (the fictitious planet) as an obvious metaphor about the anxiety and apathy which affect the victims suffering of that condition. And the film also offers some images of an impressive beauty. However, it's a pity that those elements were included in such a tedious and irritating movie as Melancholia. The worst part of this film is definitely the horrible scene of the wedding, which lasts for 1 hour, and made me consider taking the DVD off. And what is more, I found the characters from Melancholia totally hateful.The fans of art-house cinema will surely acclaim Melancholia as a ferociously personal film which crowns von Trier's filmography. However, I think Melancholia is a clear example of "the emperor's new clothes", so I will limit myself to say that, by my humble point of view, von Trier is naked, but nobody wants to accept it. I wouldn't consider Melancholia a bad film; however, in my personal experience, it was intolerable, despite some beautiful images and having a few moderately interesting ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of the most pretentious and the most pointless movies i've ever seen. i cannot help wondering if all the other reviewers given such high ratings indeed have watched the same movie as i'm trying to get a grip here.so the world was going to come to an end, and a wedding had panned out due to the late and delay of the new couple riding a long limo that got todrive to the deep countryside to have a grand wedding ceremony and the limo simply couldn't handle the curvy and narrow country road all way to that remote mansion. my god, how cruel you two lousy families that decided to hold a wedding ceremony in such deserted countryside?then the ceremony dragged out into the night, everybody felt tired and still had to hahaha the jokes of the relatives' crap. then, there were some mysterious sadness, loss, emotions that almost ruined the wedding party. then the elder sister(?) also got some personal demons that got to be dealt with during and after the wedding? then just because the rotation of several(?) planets in the solar system that messed up the gravity so the earth was doomed right away after that specific wedding. the sound track artificially gave out the doomed earth, and everybody kept raised their head to watch the son, the moon and the 3rd planet getting closer and closer and lined up....well, what can i say, dude. this movie recruited so many heavy wt. and matured international actors, and they all effortlessly performed well to dance to and with the stupid tune of this stupid screenplay. this movie has forced us to watch their great performances instead of the stupid scenario and the storyline. but at the same time, we also felt their retardiness and awkwardness to carry on and carry through such contrite, ridiculous and hollow plot. i just felt sorry for these actors that they had to maintain their great performance by following a ridiculous, hollow and especially illogic screenplay.am i talking about the same movie with same title? i am still wondering and quite uncertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was utterly disappointed when I bought this movie. It is the kind of movies that survive only because it carries the name Lars von Trier. If it was directed by someone unknown no one would give it a second glimpse. I put aside the fact that it is boring. The introduction is so long as the music (which is wonderful but the credit does not go to von Trier for this). The story is nonexistent. No insight is given into the people's relationships nor their personalities are elucidated at any point. I am not a puritan but I see no sense in watching for two minutes the bride relieving herself on the grass in the yard. Not to mention the technique. The camera moves and shakes all the time. There is a reason why all cameras nowadays have image stabilizers, why do we have to get sick when we are watching people arguing? Indeed there are some excellent pictures once in a while. But these are rare and unconnected. Cutting them out and putting them in an album would be great. Everything in between is just a waste of precious 135 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it was visually impressive but of the 7+ billion people on the planet, why did Lars von Trier choose to follow this particular nutty woman? Surely others could have offered something more insightful, and maybe even meaningful. I found the characters' behavior...unlikely, even given the circumstances that we later come to appreciate. Many, many books and movies (both fictional and not) have covered the topic of people facing impending doom. Personally, I prefer a combination of the Hemingway hero and Kurt Vonnegut's main character in Cat's Cradle: fight with dignity to the end, but then thumb your nose at the world. Like Breaker Morant: "Shoot straight, you bastards! Don't make a mess of it!" OK, the subject deserves a variety of treatments, but I found this one less than compelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every thing we do in our lives is utterly meaningless. Lars has showcased this powerfully by placing an intricate, expensive wedding and all its attendant drama against the background of an impending catastrophe. The take-away lesson is that life can be completely and utterly cruel - and the worst thing is that at times there's just no explanation or justification for it. This apparent fact is terrifying, yet here we all are, dealing with it in our own crazy ways. Justine (Dunst) is perfect in her complete acceptance of this horrifying fact while Claire runs around trying to make things perfect, even though perfection is a useless defense against the implacability of our impending deaths.

		<shortDescription>Unwatchable - at Least for Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outside of the first 10 minutes, which I found painfully slow, although visually interesting, the rest of the film appears to be destroyed by shoddy camera work.Shakycam, as I call it, or perhaps more accurately, "handheld camera with no stabilization" is distracting, obnoxious, and in this case pointless. Shakycam makes sense during a fight sequence, a car chase, something with a lot of action, and only for short segments.This film appears to be filled with long drawn out scenes, no surprise considering the movie length, so why shakycam? I can't focus on the story. Every stumble or random zoom the cameraman does makes me imagine that he is suffering a mild stroke and trying to get through the scene. It also makes me want to slap the director for being so thick. Oh, wait, I'm supposed to be watching this movie, not wondering about the production, right?Shakycam made sense to me in "Dancer in the Dark" staring Björk. Even though that film gave me a headache while watching it, I loved the film itself. I forgave the pain it caused me do to the jerky, wandering camera work. I've called that film my one exception because I believed the director wanted the viewer to see things as the main character did, who suffered eye problems.What I wasn't aware of at the start of this review is that Lars von Trier, who directed "Melancholia", also directed "Dancer in the Dark". This makes me second guess the pass I gave that "Dancer in the Dark". Maybe Lars just hates tripods and dollies and all his work is visually problematic?"Dancer in the Dark" trained me to watch out for shakycam, as I don't enjoy the expense of a throbbing headache for the sake of watching a movie. Any production that can't properly use a camera is in my terms, unwatchable.I love dystopian stories, looked forward to this, but sorry, I can't watch this unless I run it through an image stabilizer.Lars, please buy a tripod.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie the day after surgery so I was on some pretty good drugs, and I was STILL bored to tears with this movie.The first and last five minutes were visually stunning, but the plot was an afterthought. There was no discernible climactic scene; everything between the first and last five minutes was basically just filler. Various sidebar story lines are introduced, but never developed. The dialogue was weak, and the characters were boring and shallow.Justine (the main character) was a nightmare. I understand that her character is supposed to reflect the real-life tribulations of the producer. Only in such a lavish and idle lifestyle can someone become so inexplicably depressed and self-absorbed. People who wallow in this kind of sad, perpetual self-pity are in desperate need of a reality check, perhaps the kind that can be found during a nice six month vacation in a North Korean concentration camp.This movie tries so hard to be deep and artsy, but it ultimately winds up being infuriatingly pretentious, boring, and pointless.I honestly can't fathom how it managed to achieve such a high rating here.

The opening and the finish were the only parts I really got anything from; at the end I was quite glad to see all the characters annihilated. The campy "When Worlds Collide" from many decades ago was much better, in spite of ancient special effects and typical 1950s B-Movie acting abilities.

If you want to get inspired about thinking between scales of perception and blues of human psyche in a calm, different way of representation of reality, go see The Tree of Life or Another Earth. It is not the question whether those latter two are masterpieces or not but at least their creators honestly try to deal with their issues (yes, they have issues -unlike Trier- worthy of being transformed into the form of a movie ) and try to share them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me start out with a question: Are the conversations in the real day-to-day life of director Lars von Trier always boring, unnatural and filled with painful silences? If not, why are the dialogues in Melancholia always boring, strangely unnatural and filled with painful silences??? I am puzzled.Secondly, I must say that the acting in Melancholia is very good. Despite the lack of convincing dialogues. Kirsten Dunst is stunning.The setting and photographie are also outstanding. Despite the lack of a probable story.The music is well chosen.The wobbling of the camera is also unequaled, as is the improbability of the script.Adds all this up to a good movie? Not at all! Melancholia is the kind of art-house movie that agonizes you all the way through it. Despite an original opening scene, and a very original subject, being the vicinity of a blue planet about to hit Earth (why doesn't anybody mention this 'detail' in part 1, the wedding??? (I wreck my brain))In short, it is not the kind of movie you'd watch if you knew the end of the world was coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Utterly Conventional, Unimaginative Film That Falls Far Short of Its Accolades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of both Lars von Trier and science fiction, so I was looking forward to seeing Melancholia after many false starts. Sadly, this film falls far short of what both are capable.I can't understand the number of people who claims this film is "visionary". From an SF perspective, the plot conceits are standard issue and have been done many times before and much better to boot. Some to consider:1. The boundary between sanity and insanity. Who is sane? What is truth and reality? Quality Example: George O. Smith's 1958 book "The Path of Unreason"2. There are some truths too terrible for man to know. Knowing will drive you insane. Conversely, you have to already been insane to apprehend them. Quality Example: Darren Aronofsky's 1998 film "Pi".Incidentally, both of the above are psychological thrillers, a genre that works well with this3. Dualities or mirror images that are apparently different but are actually the same. Example: The Star Trek episode "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"There's nothing new here from an SF perspective. What's more, the plot construction was so transparent that it was obvious well in advance where this was going. Less than five minutes into Claire's chapter, I knew exactly where this was going, both in terms of the events and thematic development. This can work in a tragedy, but this plot and these characters aren't tragic in the way of a MacBeth or Oedipus the King. This rendered the second half of the film ridiculously flat.As for the plot being "Wagnerian", other than using Wagner's music to make the film seem cool, I don't see it. There's nothing mythic about these people or this film. The theme is from Tristan und Isolde, not the Ring Cycle. Those who draw a parallel to Gotterdammerung miss the key point that in Wagner Gotterdammerung is the beginning of the world, not the end of it (Gotterdammerung is Twilight of the Gods - not Humanity! It's the Dawn of Humanity!).Though I suppose nearly anything could be so interpreted, I also didn't take away any scathing critique of capitalism or the modern world as some did, but if there was one, could there be anything more trite? Or ironic, given that capitalism is what made Melancholia possible, and enables Lars von Trier to produce his films.I did love Wagner's music. The acting was great. The visuals I liked. The "artsy" style was good. But strip that away and what's left? Sadly, not a whole lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My own take on this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a very different take on this excellent movie. To begin with, the character Justine, does not suffer merely with acute depression but rather with manic-depression aka bi-polar disorder. No acutely depressed person could have ever entered into a marriage and wedding of such detail and scale. Rather, what we have here at the time of the wedding and wedding feast, is Justine in the last stages of her manic phase. Her bizarre behavior in keeping the guests waiting, her insistence upon visiting her favorite horse, etc. are in keeping with a manic person, not a depressed one. As the movie progresses, her behavior becomes even more baffling and self-destructive. Like all manic-depressives not on suitable medication, she is oblivious of the feelings and needs of others and is particularly cruel and insensitive to those most helpful and generous towards her. I know all this having had a 9 1/2 year relationship with a manic-depressive, and Justine's behavior was a painful reminder of this tragic relationship. For Justine, death, extinction is the ultimate goal and wish. Given that my observations are correct, I posit that the whole story of the wayward planet "Melancholia" is a figment of her crazed, depressed imagination, for, how else, do we account for John's "out-of-character" end, her sister's irresponsible hysteria, her nephew's old-beyond-his years' stoic acceptance of their fate?It is my interpretation that makes me enthusiastic about this movie; otherwise, who would give a damn about just one more apocalyptic movie?Right or wrong, I would be interested to hear the views of others on my take.In summary, this is an excellent movie with a distinguished cast, brilliantly photographed, and well directed.</fullReview>

Space is a vaccuum. Sound does not travel. Life is not like Star Trek. You can't hear the engines when a ship goes past.Oh, yes, there's another reason the sound of the planet's engines bugged me....wait for it.....it's a PLANET! It doesn't HAVE engines! And there's more: Check out the factual errors already listed on this website. This planet shows up, hiding behind the sun while simultaneously blocking out Antares, originally black but then somehow instantly bright, falling into the sun's gravitational well but then somehow not having the momentum to escape it again. To that I would like to add, if a planet came that close to Earth, there will be tides: huge, huge tides. There will also be huge earthquakes and almost certainly volcanoes. Then the Earth will be flung out of its orbit. It may end up closer to the sun or farther or in a wildly elliptical orbit...it would almost certainly mean the end of all life on the planet, certainly the end of civilization. It would not, however, mean that the Earth would be caught up in a "dance of death" with this other planet.Very lame movie...sorry I wasted my time.</fullReview>

This piece of proverbial trash pushed me over my proverbial watershed point and I started suffering proverbial Melancholia my self. Where to start, Von trier gives us the ending of the movie for the opening credits, which is just absurd especially in this context. Apparently 99.5% of the people in this world don't give two #$%@s whether or not the Earth is going to plunge to its doom within days. The banter between the characters is paper thin, but I'm guessing he wrote this movie on toilet paper while he was pushing out the remnants of his previous movie. Apparently Justine is so depressed she cant even marry a handsome rich man and enjoy a lavish ceremony she didn't even pay for, and she loves her husband so much she has sex with some random schmuck on the golf course. If she didn't want it, go to Vegas. Im so sick of movies depicting the horribleness and pain of depression, and doing so by leaving the viewer even more depressed after watching it. Good work!

		<shortDescription>Melancholia...It's A Sad and Disappointing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not recommended.Seeing a Lars van Trier film is like sharing a mix of "awe" and "aah, no!" moments simultaneously. You are satiated with its energy and overstuffed with its message.The director usually follows this format: 1. takes a bleak view of the world and its many injustices 2. showcases a heroine who becomes a victimized tool and will be punished by society 3. runs a half hour too long for its own good.His films oscillate recklessly between reality and absurdity. His vision is cynical and depressing. But his strong use of imagery and progressive ideas somehow propel the moviegoer through the cinematic experience.I am sad to report that Melancholia is again one such film, although now the audience becomes the victimized tool in this case. It is pure van Triers in formula mode, full of anxiety and fury, signifying nothing new. It is yet another one of his films about death, despair, destruction, loneliness, isolation, annihilation, emancipation, anticipation, hopelessness, confusion, madness, sadness, fear, and loathing. Succinctly put, it's the feel-bad movie of the year!On the day of her wedding, Justine has larger issues to deal with other than flower arrangements, bridal parties, and menu choices. ( Besides, her sister will take care of those details. ) It seems that on this blessed day of celebration and spiritual bonding, the world may be coming to an end. A nearby planet ironically named Melancholia is set to collide with Planet Earth. It's hard to put on a happy face when life, as we know it, is about to be obliterated. Naturally, tensions are high and everyone is at their wit's end, but please, let's have some more hors d'oeuvre first.The blushing bride is Justine ( a gutsy and perfectly modulated performance by Kirsten Dunst ) and her handsome groom, Michael ( Alexander Skargard ) are at the reception, along with her sister, Claire, ( Charlotte Gainsbourg ) and brother-in-law, Jack ( Kiefer Sutherland ), who is footing the bill and becoming preoccupied with the impending catastrophe, meaning the upcoming collision, not the recent nuptials.Melancholia is divided into two parts: the first entitled Justine, the second called Claire. The former section deals with the manic-depressive Barbie newlywed and her odd behavior on her wedding day and the latter portion of the film focuses on her caring and overly tolerate caretaker sibling and both of their odd behaviors. Melancholia works up the angle of duality, with each sister's contrasting personalities and their separate reactions to the gloom and doom controlling their every move. But we've seen this role reversal in other film many times before and handled more effectively elsewhere.Let me add that there is a great film in the beginning minutes of Melancholia, when Wagner's prelude to Tristan and Isolde plays over a montage of tableaux and slow motion images. If only the director would have stopped there! That portion is masterly done. But it's the other two hours of interminable angst that one had to wallow through listening to ill-defined characters, stilted dialog, and long SLOW plodding plotting. One begins to wish for the world to end more quickly. Talk about injustice!Where the film totally succeeds is in its stunning and exciting visuals. Melancholia excels in its surreal and macabre imagery that is pervasive throughout the film. Special mention goes to the stunning photography by Manuel Alberto Claro and some of his many memorable images that lodge in one's mind: birds gently falling from the sky, a bride floating downstream in a very Ophelia-like pose, a grieving mother clutching her child as she trudges through an ominous landscape, sudden electric charges emitting from Justine's fingertips and her immediate sense of wonder and calm. Aesthetically the film is well worth seeing, but dramatically, it goes off course, orbiting in an endless void. So, this film may or may not appeal to every moviegoer's taste. For me, Melancholia creates a black cinematic hole. Van Trier zealously thrives within his ultimate darkness, living in his own unique cosmos. He may keep churning out artful films so that critics may become more enraptured with his excessive style. To me, this director is sadly adrift, lost in space.

So to sum up it's utter crap nothing happens and I can't stress this enough. PLEASE PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch This Film If You Cannot Sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first 30 minutes of this film, absolutely nothing happens. They spend minutes showing a limousine trying to park. Admittedly I cannot comment after the first 30 minutes because the movie was so bad I stopped watching it. You do get to see a wedding reception where once again nothing happens. I sometimes wonder how someone gets the money to make a film like this, rich uncle maybe? While there are certainly good actors here, they must have been desperate for a paycheck. Did I mention nothing happens? Doctors should prescribe this film for insomniacs. Maybe the director was so in love with his own work that he couldn't bear to cut the long pointless scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OMG, this was BY FAR the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw it several months ago and it is still haunting me. I was just on IMDb checking out reviews and stumbled across this piece of crap and saw the 7+ rating and just felt I had to create an account just to try and warn people to stay away from it at all costs. Seriously, I HATE going to the dentist but if someone asked me to watch this piece of crap again I'd say no thanks, I think it's about time for a dental check-up and I would make an appointment and go. This 7+ star rating is MIND-BOGGLING to me. It really makes me wonder if there are two different versions of Melancholia out there as I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying this meaningless, dull, boring, pointless and annoying piece of garbage. Unless you have a strange reason to intentionally ruin your day please avoid this mess at all costs. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time I feel the need to make a review. People should be warned by the effects of this movie, and I'm not even talking about depression. This movie should display a big warning at the beginning of it, on the cover of the DVD and in the posters too: THIS MAY CAUSE SERIOUS MOTION SICKNESS. With capital words, bigger than the director's name. For God's sake, I almost literally throw up because of the shaky camera and the dizziness ruined the rest of the day. (I didn't know we need medical kit to watch movies)An unwatchable movie don't even deserve a comment on its artistic merits. It causes melancholia because it's just a waste of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a waste of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the fact that this movie is available free on Amazon just 1 month after its release on DVD tells the tale of its appeal better than any review ever could. Any subsequent reviews stating this was a good work of art were misguided for reasons only a critic under influences that have nothing to do with theatrical reporting would be privy too. No form of encouragement should be offered to von Tier. Incoherence can be portrayed on the screen with fluid intelligence but the director must do it coherently in-order to deal with the subject matter. The best we can do to get good movies is to avoid the poor quality films that are so numerous in today's film industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The difference between a good movie and "art" is that you can watch a good movie and know that it's good but "art" needs to be explained to be understood. With that explanation, the film "Melancholia" qualifies as "art."The first 8 minutes are very beautiful and I had hopes that it would be along the lines of "Tree of Life." But after that, Lars von Trier resorts to his shaky hand-held camera and clunky dialog that goes nowhere slowly. The film is hard to look at without getting motion sick."Melancholia" is very frustrating because it uses such good actors and it looks like it had some good ideas. It is so painful to sit through that I cannot recommend it."Melancholia" is similar to a film called "Another Earth" which is a much better film. Go see that one instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't waste your time watching this movie. WHY? I will tell you why. First of all, the intro of the movie is very very very very long and in vain. I mean you will expect that the movie will do something about this intro in the end but it appeared to be very useless. You will not understand anything out of this intro. The Justine part is very ridiculous, the thing is that you should feel sympathy about her but every time you are close to this feeling she does something bad that makes you hate her. I mean most of her melancholia is about sexual things. That doesn't create sympathy. The movie events are very boring and slow. You sometimes need to shout: "C'mon I got the point move on, change your position, DO SOMETHING" So, I advise you not to watch this one. I was confused whether to watch this or twilight and now I wish I had chosen twilight.</fullReview>

After choking down the first five minutes like undercooked cream of wheat there were far too many hours of sick, mentally unstable people floating around their morbid lives trying to cope.I am sure the whole "it's about depression" thing is supposed to evoke some kind of feeling, but I felt zero compassion for anyone in this movie except maybe the kid.I would give my husband's left foot for those two hours back and the memory of having watched this art school masturbation project wiped from my brain.</fullReview>

The story only revolves around a planet approaching earth, and a family's reaction towards this fact. Everything is woven around it. Kirsten Dunst's character is pathetic.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, well-acted, but ultimately absurd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is equal parts beautiful and silly. If would be worth watching for the wonderful performance and visuals, if only one could get past the ridiculous ideas the story is supposed to represent. Unfortunately, Lars von Trier, as usual, incorrectly assumes he's as adept a philosophizer as he is a filmmaker, and proceeds to bludgeon the viewer over the head with his ideas, making the film almost unwatchable.Apparently, the world is evil, capitalism is evil, and we are all shallow, soulless, empty and materialistic people (except for von Trier himself, of course). That's it. Don't attempt to expand, because then you'll have done more thinking on the subject than von Trier apparently has. These notions are the impetus for von Trier to employ his actual talent as a filmmaker, and he winds up creating a film filled with wonderful visuals and performances - too wonderful in fact, because the characterization creates three-dimensional people, and they remind us of how real people think and behave. This only serves to underline how silly and simplistic von Trier's thinking about these people really is. One could imagine a version of this film filled with bad, one-dimensional acting actually being far more effective.However, in this version we are given actual characters to follow, and it serves to draw us away from the main point of the film. The main character, wonderfully played by Kirsten Dunst, is someone who clearly seems to have a clinical depressive disorder, and she is exposed exactly in that way, but we are supposed to believe she is that way because she is the only one who knows 'the truth'. Again, weaker acting may have actually worked better here, but instead we are given a realistic performance, and we realistically see Dunst's character for what she is: A woman with issues. "The world is evil," this character tells us, but we have not been witness to that. We are supposed to empathize with this character and her view of the world(and by extension, von Trier's view of the world), but we haven't been given any reason to do so. This is a fatal flaw in von Trier's method, and it undermines his whole premise.The characterization also leads to disappointment when one of those characters is forced to do something uncharacteristic because it fits with von Trier's predetermined symbolism. Keifer Southerland's character, for example, plays a man who is shown to be smart, successful, and knowledgeable about science. Of course, von Trier doesn't like financially successful people or science, so this character has to be shown to be a fool at some point. The problem is, Keifer Southerland makes him into a reasonable, kind, and sympathetic human being. Upon discovering something that doesn't fit into his scientific calculations (here von Trier plays the overconfident scientist who claims numbers show him to be correct, but then of course isn't, which is a cliché prejudiced upon many people's mistrust and lack of understanding about math and science), the character commits a cowardly, unexplained act that does not fit his character at all. Again, I'm sure this is the fate the character was 'supposed' to have based upon the symbolic nature of the work and likely also some connection to mythology, but that, I strongly believe, is the choice of the lesser artist. A real storyteller IMO creates characters, and then lets them loose to do what they will, with a minimal amount of deus ex machina to guide them....but of course, Lars von Trier doesn't want to tell you a story. He wants to use those two hours he's got you trapped in the theater to yell his socio-political theories into your ear as loud as he can. In some ways it's amazing that man so limited in one way is able to find another part of himself capable of employing such talent and skill into expressing such a limited view. Perhaps one day von Trier will learn to employ the same muscle he uses for filmmaking for thinking about his purposes for making films in the first place. Then, he might really have something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were 2 reasons why I watched this movie - firstly, I've read good reviews about it, secondly, there was one of my favorite actors starring in it. But I didn't enjoyed it at all. First challenge for my patience was that long slow-motion beginning. In fact, all the movie was slow. The characters were unlovable. They acted in the ways I couldn't understand. Most of the movie I was wandering ''what a f... is going on???''. I know, they were all depressed and melancholic, facing the possibility of the end of the world, but even in that context they sucked badly. For that reason, their suffering didn't move me at all, and, as nothing more was happening in the movie, I found it very boring. As I wasn't engaged in emotional aspects of the movie, I started to analyze the possibility of such a big unknown planet passing by and finally colliding with the Earth - and that didn't make any sense. The very collision was also nothing like I would imagine. I'm surprised that many people have found something familiar in this movie. I'm melancholic and I feel depressed almost all the time, but I couldn't find anything familiar in ''Melancholia''. I found this movie not as depressing as irritating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shiny happy people holding hands...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier is the only director with two films in my all-time top 10 list: "Breaking the Waves" (1996) and "Dogville" (2003). The same way "Dogville" remains the most psychologically disturbing film I've ever seen, Trier's "antichrist" (2009) is easily the most sickening cinematic experience I've ever had. Lars is polarizing even among his most ardent fans. I would never watch antichrist again, for it feels like it was made just for shock value - something I despise.But the first true thing about Lars is this: you will love or hate his films, but you shall never be indifferent to them. And that to me is, in and of itself, an important quality. With his latest effort, "Melancholia", Trier more than redeems himself from "antichrist", making one of his greatest and most unforgettable films."Melancholia" is, like most of von Trier's work, divided into chapters; in this case, just two. The first half is "Justine" (Kirsten Dunst, magnificent), a beautiful but clinically depressed young woman on her wedding day with the sweet, gentle (perhaps, too gentle), and handsome Michael (Alexander Skarsgard). Trying her best to look happy ("I smile, I smile, and I smile"), Justine fails to please most around her, especially her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg, always fascinating) and her prick of a husband, John (Kiefer Sutherland); not to mention Michael himself. Other smaller but essential characters are Claire's son (Cameron Spurr), Justine and Claire's parents (the wonderfully bitter - as always - Charlotte Rampling, and John Hurt), Justine's boss (Stellan Skarsgard), his clueless nephew (Brady Corbet), and Trier's perennial friend and collaborator Udo Kier as the wedding planner (and the closest to a comic relief here).The second half, "Claire", focuses on Gainsbourg's character's unraveling at the idea that Melancholia - "a planet hiding behind the sun" - might collide with Earth. As Claire and John - the shiny happy people we all strive to be - face despair, the morbidly sad Justine becomes more and more... peaceful. Von Trier has publicly declared his struggles with depression in the past, and he builds his film on the fascinating concept that depressives tend to feel more at home at times of intense distress (and possible catastrophe), while the "normal" people have a harder time facing or even considering tragedy. As someone who's been struggling with depression/bipolarity for years, I can personally relate to this.Whether or not you're familiar with depression, "Melancholia" is a hypnotic piece of cinema - from the breathtaking images (by Portuguese cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro), to the formidable performances, and the beautiful soundtrack (pieces from Wagner's opera "Tristan &amp; Isolde" are the main theme). Von Trier's work, in my opinion, speaks for itself. He is, above all, a provocateur. He may fail miserably at his attempts at humor and be socially awkward, but I do not believe he is a bad guy - let alone a Nazi (regardless of his infamous remarks at this year's Cannes). One does not need to be a great man in order to be a great artist (in this case, filmmaker); but I do believe a sense of humanity must be inherent in the work of any great artist, and humanity is something I see dissected, questioned, and exquisitely represented in von Trier's oeuvre. And, if the world is indeed going to end in 2012 (which I don't believe, but you never know): as long as it ends the way von Trier predicts, I'm okay with it. See this film at all costs.</fullReview>

I would go so far as to say this is the most boring film I have ever seen and only continued due to the "stellar" cast. They must have been very highly paid to be part of this. Search words: Dreary, boring, dull, pointless, waste of time, over the top ridiculous music aka 80's love stories, 2-dimensional characters, ridiculous, emotionally incontinent. Right, it's late but I'm going to watch something decent now.

It's difficult to even follow what is going on. The presentation of title cards, Part 1, etc. is a stupid thing to do in a movie.

This is why I was so surprised to be so bored and downright disappointed by this movie. The camera work and acting were all fine enough, as was the dialogue, albeit it came off as a little too typical art-house. What made this movie difficult to watch was the grueling pace. I have no problem with slow movies, but this movie was unnecessarily slow. Throughout the movie, it seems as if nothing is happening. Which, again is alright, but it all seems so irrelevant and there to take up time. I can understand emotion just fine, and I enjoyed all of the emotional acting; it was done quite well. The movie seems full of itself and slow just to be slow. The movie would have been quite impressive if it created enough tension to capture and keep the attention. Grueling display of Dunst causing problems for herself and feeling sorry for herself. All in all, wasted potential, that was difficult to watch.</fullReview>

Aside from a handful of momentarily beautiful cinematographic shots... the shaky, hand held camera work in this film wasn't steady for more than two seconds throughout two hours of this two hour and sixteen minute movie giving one a Dizzying feeling. Haven't we had enough of purposely over exaggerated shaking of hand-held photography in films? What's worse? the camera panned violently from actor to actor in a scene, showing nothing but blur between headshots where edits would ordinarily be. Dialog continued unabated while the camera panned searching for the actor speaking. For a first rate cast with some very notable actors, the end product is shameful. I've never been so glad to see the end of a movie and only wish I had walked out after the first twenty minutes when red flags started waving in my head. Save yourself a painful experience and give this film a wide berth. Russ^</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not to ramble strongly for or against this film, I can see why many people would love it and why many people would hate it. It's very unusual of a movie, has a strong feeling of artisticness, which gives it an advantage.Unfortunately it hardly has any story or plot and barely anything happens in the film, as well as the two main parts are totally incohesive. The first half of the movie is about a depressed sister getting married, which shows a really strong depth to her hopelessness.However, half way through the movie, it switches focus to the other sister, where miraculously, everyone else in the film but the sisters, her son, and her husband, simply leave. The entire second half of the film really has no connection to the first half except that it shares 3 of the same characters. Mid-film, it switches from a drama to a sci-fi, and I'm still at a loss whether to like the idea or abhor it.There really is no cohesiveness to the two parts of the movie, so it almost seems like the writer either couldn't think of a full-length script and put two separate ones together, or thought it would be clever/genius to do so. The second part, given that there are only 3 characters (other than a little boy), is dull. The majority of the dialogue (and there is little) is a back-and-forth paranoid conversation with the husband and wife about whether or not this planet in the sky is going to hit the earth. There is no actual conflict, nothing that can be done about it, and totally makes no sense as a film, except to convey something apparently profound about the human soul or something. I dunno.The constant replaying of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde as the entirety of the film's soundtrack gets quite annoying fairly quickly. Especially when it's the same part played over and over.Two final things leave me with a sense of frustration/disappointment. The film's climax is the collision of this blue planet with earth and the characters do nothing in the film other than pointless dialog and running around. The film ends quite suddenly and while the cinematography seems beautiful, I really wonder what the whole point was. There was no story other than what can be described in a short sentence: Two sisters, a husband and their small boy are at a hotel golf resort to observe a blue planet 'moving past' Earth, mostly with dialog of depression and paranoia, when in fact it ends up colliding. The end.My final gripe is Kiefer Sutherland's character. As an astronomer, he observes this blue projectile planet and is convinced that it will just pass Earth by. Yet when he realizes it doesn't, he ends up committing suicide, leaving his wife and young son behind. I can understand fear and hopelessness and surprise on his part, but what the heck kind of father/husband leaves his wife/child behind when the world is going to end, not doing everything possible to protect/comfort/care for them? It was stupid and didn't add anything to the story other than make me not like it. Not just the character, but the movie as a whole. Why would I want to spend 2 hours of my time watching dullness and nothingness that just is meant to make me feel depressed? It's artistic and beautiful, but sometimes making art into a film just doesn't work for me.</fullReview>

Even though scenes are presented in slow motion, they are aesthetically appealing and very atmospheric. However, once the film proper starts, it deteriorates quickly. We see Justine, the sister getting married, being passive aggressive and in a permanently foul mood. Just why does she act so antagonistically is not explained well. Justine is so unlikable and irritating that I could not get into the film at all.The pace is so painfully slow, especially in the second half. The film just gets more boring as it goes on.

I think that spending 2 and a half hours staring at a blank wall would be a more pleasant experience than watching this film again and it is my genuine belief that in those 2 and a half hours, I could conjure up a more inspiring story in my head. This art house drain of time and money is NOT worth your attention. The storyline is non-sensical and cannot be categorised as a science fiction. The performance of the planet was more awesome than the unlikeable characters than Von Trier has tried so hard to give 'depth' and ''emotion' . The characters are completely hysterical and unpredictable. Thank goodness Von Trier gave us the premonition at the beginning of the the film so that we knew they would die. If this turned out to be false, the experience would have been that little bit more bleak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Movie ... Boring ... No Character Development ... Hardly Even A Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never written a review on here before, but I felt compelled to warn everyone else who reads the good reviews on here ... don't waste your time with this garbage.I read a bunch of reviews on here before seeing this film and wondered why so many people gave ten star reviews while others gave one star reviews. Well ... now I understand. The people who rated this movie as ten stars think it's funny to tell people to watch a piece of crap movie to make themselves feel better after wasting two hours of their own lives.This movie is complete garbage. It opens with a bunch of scenes from space and showing Dunst in her wedding dress with music playing the whole time. None of this makes any sense and I sat there watching it wondering what was going on. Even after I watched the entire movie, I still don't know what the opener was about.When the movie actually starts with some kind of story, you're thrown into a wedding scene with a bunch of characters that you don't know anything about. I just sat there wondering, "Who are these people ... and why is Dunst so boring and depressed." This drags on and on and on. I honestly think the first half of the movie had no point at all. Absolutely ridiculous.Then the second half starts and you finally get to the part about the colliding planets. Not really interesting. This half of the movie deserves one star while the first half deserves less than one star.I don't want to spoil the ending, but I'll just say you will be really disappointed. Do not see this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Camera swinging, what a poor trick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could you tolerate that ridiculous camera movement? I am a TV producer and I sometimes use the camera on hand to give some effect. But in the final cut, my swinging effect doesn't last more than 4 seconds. Here lasts more than two hours! I understand the purpose of instilling anguish in the spectator, but this is a very poor trick. I literally felt sick wanting to endure to the end, unlike other people who have left the cinema in advance. I admit that the script may have some interesting cues, although I found rather banal and obvious certain combinations between astronomy and psychology. The acting is good (thanks, actors!) but everything is ruined. I prefer directors who talk to my brain, not to my guts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We will all die one day, and no one will probably care or notice in the long run. It's the saddest fact of our existence, and the feeling of pointlessness and never being able to feel truly cared for are symptoms of depression, and it's why Justine feels content with the eventual fate of the human race in "Melancholia". She hates it because she feels that no one in it truly cares about her or her problems, and she knows that everyone will fade into obscurity eventually, symbolized by many visual metaphors, one of which being her balloon that has her declaration of love floating out into the sea of stars, as well as constellations that once made her happy disappearing. It's also what makes her so exhausted all of the time, again symbolized by the gray weeds hooked on to her that she can't escape. But the lightning escaping from her fingers as she watches calmly shows her almost content with life that is slowly escaping from her at every moment. The constant helplessness and fear of death are symptoms of anxiety, and it's why Claire is so panicked all of the time. Her struggle to escape an inevitable fate that she knows is coming is shown through her feet sinking into the golf course as she carries her child, trying to run away. There are countless of these visual metaphors, including the planet of melancholia itself representing the way we think we can escape death, as well as the way we perceive anxiety and depression, as just phases that will pass, when the truth is that depression almost always engulfs its victims entirely. The tee-pee of sticks that they hide in in front of the massive looming threat of melancholia shows how we can only make ourselves feel safe against death, when deep down we know it will take us. The rest of the film being shot like a documentary emphasizes the realism of the other parts of the film, as in the depiction of depression and anxiety. The slow pace only increases the feeling of the inevitability of death, and our futile struggle to resist it.I know that this sounds like a very heavy film, and it is, but it is beautifully realized, and it gives us a window into not just the life of someone with depression and anxiety, but how it feels to have either of the two disorders. It allows us to understand people that struggle with these two on a visceral level, and that is what makes this film great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful meaning and great performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great film that captures the magnitude depression weighs on a person. If you're like most people who suffer from this disease, this movie will hit you hard. The premise centers around two sisters and how they cope with the impending doom of Earth as told by IMDb. However, I feel like the true subject is one sister, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) who suffers from acute depression and views the impending state of Earth as meaningless. She also has a weird intuition that enables her to predict the future in a very lifeless, subtle way which warrants the idea that perhaps she's an alien from the planet that soon crashes into Earth or perhaps she's not blinded by the flowers and smiles and sees reality as it is. I'd go for the latter one haha. But who knows?Mixing realism and fantasy, the opening scene (~ first 8 minutes) is really the ending of the movie. It sets you in a dream-like world and gives you a glimpse of the themes portrayed throughout the film. Kirsten Dunst was incredibly chilling in this film. I was completely immerse in her sadness and coldness. I especially felt captivated in Part 1: "Justine" where Justine (Kirsten), on her wedding day - a day that's suppose to fill her with joy and happiness, goes through spirals of highs and lows that'll completely absorb you. Her despondency is contagious and captivating. The film does a great job in reminding you of this melancholic mood by replaying the same track "Wagner: Tristan und Isolde - Prelude" over and over again and effectively haunting you throughout the film. Melancholia isn't for everyone. People who are familiar with depression could relate to it more and see it as more than an apocalyptic film. Melancholia is absolutely brilliant with incredible performances!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, haunting film that stays with you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this on the small screen and deeply regret not seeing it at the cinema when it came out in 2011, as I believe the impact would have been even greater. Having said that, I've read reviews which have slammed the "shaky-cam" method of filmmaking that LVT uses (some even cite nausea), and I suspect the impact of that style of camera-work would have been more severe on the big screen. On my 55" screen however, there were still some parts of the first half of the film where I felt myself distracted by the shaky-cam. For this I should deduct one star. But I can't criticize this film for it is a true masterpiece that you will either love or hate.Don't go into it expecting to enjoy a linear exposition with typical Hollywood entertainment values. It is art, pure and simple (that introduction! Stunning!) and hopefully it will speak to your soul about the essence of true melancholia. Prepared to be deeply moved, but go in with an open heart and no expectations. Leave your scientific analysis of film content at the door, and allow yourself to immerse in the sublime imagery and layers of meaning within the plot. This film will stay with me a long time, and I hope to watch it again as there is just so much visual and emotional appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really know what to say about this film. I found much of it irritating as I really dislike this sort of pretentious arty stuff. You know what I mean, minimal dialogue and mournful expressions which wannabe intellectuals read 'meaning' into. I also found much of it irritatingly difficult to hear, unless I'm going deaf there was an awful lot of mumbling, no doubt to add to the 'atmosphere'. However ... I have to acknowledge that the acting was good. I particularly liked Charlotte Gainsbourg but Kirsten Dunst also delivered a good performance, if a little OTT at times. It's a film that also has some visually beautiful moments, particularly at the beginning and end. In fact I read another review on here that said the first few minutes and last 30 seconds of the film were the only bits worth watching and I'm tempted to agree! Had I paid money to see this at the cinema I would probably have fallen asleep after the first fifteen minutes because it is incredibly slow. Watching it from the comfort of my sofa did involve a 10 minute nap halfway through but I stuck it out to the end just to see what happened. To be honest the ending, which I thought was very well done, earned most of the six stars I've awarded. So on balance I honestly can't recommend it but it did have its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A metaphor for life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first ever review and I had to tick the spoiler box but the first scenes of this beautiful film tell us all we need to know.....That the world is ending. Melancholia is the planet that will collide with earth and it is also the condition which visits Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and gives her sure knowledge of the condition which we all share, namely that of limited life span and certain death.Many reviews concentrate on the plot but my feeling was that the whole film was a metaphor for life and reflections on how different people face fate, with some denying, some embracing it, some amusing themselves by making a game or sport of it and some (in this case Claire played by Charlotte Gainsbourge) living in terror and filling their life with plans trying to convince themselves that they have control, contingency and the ability to protect others. I thought that the film was spectacularly shot, the acting superb throughout (watch out for Charlotte Rampling as she is fantastic as the nihilistic mother), and the subject matter dealt with with an incredible depth of feeling. A truly thought provoking and aesthetic masterpiece of film making. Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic (and fantastical) study in depression.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is definitely no stranger to gut wrenching films after directing the likes of Dancer in the Dark and Antichrist. His 2011 film Melancholia is something altogether different, though. It is slow, painful and often quiet. So quiet in fact that there are parts where the most noise you here is heavy breathing. The film's poster captures a scene that is a call back to the tragic demise of William Shakespeare's Ophelia, being engulfed by the waters of a brook with a calming sense that this is what is to happen. It's fitting as the film is a smooth but aching look at depression and how it affects people during a time of immense crisis.The film's prologue is a series of incredible otherworldly shots, set against Richard Wagner's classical Prelude from Tristan und Isolde, that invoke the feeling of, well, melancholy right from the beginning. These shots move so eerily slow that you at first question whether they are still frames or not. At the same time, they mesmerize and peak interest, more than hinting at the events that are to come throughout the movie. These shots are a perfect, pristine gloomy lull. Once you begin to meet the characters and the chapters of despair begin to unfold, however, the shots become gritty and grainy, hand-held and shaky, making it more real and relatable.As much as the film is a study of the disease, the cast equally portrays related character studies in depth. While one character builds anxiety, the other is calm and collected, readying for the inevitable as gloomy as it may seem. Some suffer silently while others panic and make rash decisions. Moments of the film are so tense with animosity that it's almost awkward to watch. Keifer Sutherland, Charlotte Rampling, John Hurt and Cameron Spurr all bring in great supporting roles rounding out the family and their relationships, but the film is without a doubt made by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg as sisters on almost opposite sides of the spectrum.Dunst is surprisingly effect as Justine, the very essence of melancholy, capable of showing deep emotion through a seemingly careless stone face. She has an aura of foreboding that could seemingly drop birds dead from the sky. In fact, it's probably Dunst's best role since playing the formidable vampire child Claudia in Interview with a Vampire. Gainsbourg seems on the surface to be more level headed as Claire, but has a struggle all her own to keep control when there is absolutely none to have. It is all severely poignant.Von Trier's Melancholia is a masterpiece study of depression. The film is well over 2 hours long and feels all of it. If you find it excruciating to get through and never want to watch it again, then Von Trier has done his job of channeling depression well. It shows the acts, and the lack of acts for that matter, that can stem from depression. It shows where depression itself can stem from. It shows how those around the depressed interact and react, how they understand and how they really don't understand. And, interestingly enough, it showcases a situation in which depression actually is a kind of wanted and even helpful quality. It's a somewhat far-fetched, fantastic scenario, but depression often feels like the end of the world, whether it actually is or isn't. This is indeed trauma, at it's most beautiful and purist state.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has such a deep and beautiful message for depressive people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This beautiful film is a piece of art and it relates to your feeling and some deep part inside the mind. It is not driven by plot or action or CG effects, it is a message that you have to drink in like absorbing something from a painting or an experience. I would rather say that if you don't like art film with shaking camera and very slow pace, if you watch movie for entertaining, don't watch this. But if you are deeply depressed and really want to leave this world, this film is perfect and it would be like a healing balm. I was deeply depressed and suicidal during the time that I rented this movie. And when I watched it, I felt that I wasn't alone. Someone does understand what is like to be so deep in that blue world with an unseen barrier that keep you isolated from others around. Kirsten Dunst was excellent in delivering her performance. Lars Von Trier was excellent to create this film and show to the world what is like to have this planet "Melancholia" inside you. And in my opinion, this is the most beautiful end-of-the world movie that I've ever seen. It's far different than anything you can imagine and the ending was very powerful. (A bit spoiler below) In Part One, you'll see the world that is full of junk, full of illusive materialistic things, full of social masks and how much Justine suffer from it. She really had a hard time coping with life. But in Part Two, closer to the ending, you'll see that Justine is more ready to face death than Claire, her sister, who has so much to cling to the world. No matter what, life as you know it will one day fall apart and you can't do nothing about it. Forget about the things that are unreal and meaningless. Embrace the truth that the world is transient and temporary. I totally love the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director here shows his hand as one being dealt by the ghost of Kubrick. The latter influenced Lars Von Trier a lot, and inspired him in taking on this project. Just like Kubrick, the current director likes to cast actors of the non scenery chewing type. Actresses rather. Remember Dogville? von Trier heralded the decline of Kidman and now Dunst.His films are brave. But stupid. And meaningless. It's ironic that the most low budget way to shoot a disaster, end of the world movie, is to show rich people waiting to die. I wouldn't be surprised if I learned that the location where Justine's(Dunst) wedding party was filmed had subsequently been rented out to bangbros.But watching two hours of melancholia beats watching two hours of porn. Did you see Dunst's nakedness? I have the feeling Dunst will age gracefully and not succumb to the knife or to implants. She was a favorite actress that I enjoyed watching in movies better than Melancholia. But many fans will watch Melancholia because we get to see a lot of her without distracting dialog.I have not a lot to say about this movie but that doesn't mean I typed whatever that came to my head. Indeed, I withheld quite some thoughts, which I would have shared had this movie been any good. The final shot was very well done. Hence the additional star(no puns intended). Unlike Kubrick, von Trier cannot afford to cast cheap unknowns, another amusing paradox. I have been curious about Melancholia ever since it came out. I'm relieved to have seen it. Once and finally. I'm glad if this review has been of any help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So here is the spoiler. This is probably the most direction-less, meaningless, boring, unimaginative and technically challenged movie I have ever seen in my life. This movie has nothing to offer, unless you expect Avant-garde to be a different way of pronouncing stupid. The movie was never intended to have a story or a screenplay. You could hardly hear what actors are trying to say, the camera work is exceptionally average. The film fails to create any sort of muse. The audience will find themselves praying for the current scene to end through out. The beginning 8 minutes of the movie are probably made for special people who cannot consume information at a normal-human-rate and will put regular people to sleep.For a movie based on planets colliding and stuff, basic scientific facts have not been researched and is kinda embarrassing for human race that this was made in 2011. The background score is not original but is at least from one of Wagner's operas, which remains as the only enjoyable part.Unless you are a self-appointed art-connoisseur who will put yourself through meaningless stuff to talk about at the cocktail party, I severely recommend not to bother about this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best things about this movie are the Vertigo-esque music(which is really 'the' best thing about this film), Kirsten Dunst's great performance as someone deeply-neurologically troubled in all sense of the word Melancholy, and lastly but not leastly, Kirsten Dunst has some major Yabbos now, and she gets to show them off in the film, and that was nice to see. Other than that, I felt like I was watching a 2 hour plus Calvin Klein Commercial or that I was watching The Factory with Andy Warhol and the gang acting out a bad soap opera. It seems like Lars is trying to be a Michael Haneke, but he's not as smart or as talented as Michael ergo you get an artistic mess of nothingness. If Lars was a better writer you might have something, but I think Lars tries to hide the fact that he can't write for shnit, therefore he tries to cover up awful writing by making the film look very artsy, with bad choppy shots, in hopes that we will think he's brilliant. I've seen this one and Dancer in the Dark. I was excited to see Nymphomaniac, but I think I'm going to have to pass now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director/writer Lars von Trier gives us a beautifully filmed drama that seems to lumber at some points; although more than not...scenery and special effects are magnificent. If you are already depressed during the terrific slow-motion intro...you may be in a darker mood as the closing credits roll. A straight forward story about opulent people at a sumptuous party celebrating the marriage of Justine(Kirstin Dunst)and Michael(Alexander Skarsgard)at the same time a blue planet called Melancholia is heading directly toward Earth. Justine's sister Claire(Charlotte Gainsbourg)and brother-in-law John(Keifer Sutherland)are paying for the extravagant wedding, and despite Claire's efforts, the whole affair slowly unravels. Tensions mount between the two families and Claire tries to keep everyone in-line, as the bride ignores the timing schedule meticulously planned out. The marriage itself seems to be a sham from the beginning. The guests, including the disappointed bride's groom, have finally left the mansion leaving the two sisters trying to understand the tension in their relationship. John keeps his eyes on Melancholia as it keeps getting closer and closer to Earth. This actually is a beautiful movie, albeit with a dark mood and the fear of impending disaster. Expect graphic nudity and sexual content. Also in the cast: John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling, Deborah Fronko and James Cagnard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My inclination while watching the picture was to give it a 6, then a 5, but afterward I held off rating while I thought about it. The initial scene in which we meet Justine was obviously intended to fill the viewer with an overwhelming feeling of frustration and achieved that goal. OK, I can take frustration and discomfort for a good cause, but nothing about Justine, one of the two main characters who appeared in the scene, was revealed. Then the picture got underway in setting up Justine's background. She has a horrifying mother, a flaky father, an annoying boss, and a new husband who just bought what he claims is their dream property without consulting her. She snaps, destroys her marriage, her career, and sinks into a deep depression. She starts to come out of it when the end of the world approaches and when the end comes she is the only person who behaves sensibly. I include these spoilers for a purpose. With the help of Wikipedia I learned the following. Justine is von Trier. "I think that Justine is very much me. She is based a lot on my person and my experiences with doomsday prophecies and depression."http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/042199.pdfDepression is not just a part of the movie. It is the basis and motivation for it. "The idea for the film emerged while he was in treatment for the depression that has haunted him in recent years. A therapist&nbsp;told him a theory that depressives and melancholics act more calmly in violent situations, while "ordinary, happy" people are&nbsp;more apt to panic. Melancholics are ready for it. They already know everything is going to hell."The link is not allowed here, but is available on the Wikipedia page.Now there is something interesting to think about. If depression is something like an impedance mismatch between a person and the universe then a depressed person is stuck in thinking about how the universe sucks or stuck in thinking about how they suck, or a combination. To Justine (and Trier), the universe sucks as the following quotes from IMDb show.Justine: All I know is, life on earth is evil. Claire: Then maybe life somewhere else. Justine: But there isn't. ? Justine: And when I say we're alone, we're alone. Life is only on earth, and not for long.What von Trier says in this picture is that it is a good thing that the world is ending and he shows the end to be beautiful. The sentiment is: I don't like the world the way it is, so it would be beautiful if it were destroyed. That sentiment may be the basis for the attraction of all apocalyptic stories to those who are attracted to them. I can think of no other. However, von Trier goes beyond the misanthropy of apocalyptic yearnings to wish away all life in the universe, which is a grand delusion. In summary, von Trier is annoying and delusional, but honest and he knows how to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A study in depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Melancholia to be a remarkably honest look at depression: haunting, troubling, difficult to watch, yet impossible to turn away from. The backdrop of a wedding was brilliant because it was a natural way of bringing together different segments of the family--both those who had helped shape the main character Justine (played by Kirsten Dunst) and those who were being affected by her condition, like the sister, Claire, who was trying to care for her. I was captivated by Dunst's portrayal, how at times her depression literally affected her ability to move physically.I also found it to be an interesting yet realistic irony that at the climax of the film where the other characters were beginning to panic, Justine somehow found a place of peace and became a source of strength for the others. Having known people who were clinically depressed, I have seen this type of role reversal before. It seems safe to say that writer/director Lars von Trier has created a very true-to-life depiction of depression, and brought it to light by framing it in an extraordinary set of circumstances. Not to mention that the film is beautifully shot.</fullReview>

I was confused by the opening, but was drawn in once I started getting to know the characters. It seems to me to be a film about connecting to another person. The first sister tries but fails as she tries to wed, to become more successful in her job, to connect with her nephew in "building a cave," to reach out to her mother and her father. As she achieves connection at the end of the movie, having built the aforementioned cave and connected at last with both her sister and nephew, it is at the same time Melancholia physically connects with and destroys Earth. It was this left left me with a sense of a happy and uplifting ending, odd though that may sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melancholia struck me as a very 'artful' film. The opener was achingly exquisite, the score making it almost unbearably so. The light touch of humor at the beginning, undercut sharply by the reactions of the characters, made the following descent more keenly felt. The family dynamics (or lack thereof) were too familiar for comfort so my obviously purely personal score of 8. The trio in the 'magic cave' at the end seemed to me to express three variations of depression/melancholy: escapism (Leo), resignation (Justine), and despair (Claire). It wasn't until the very end that it became evident the approaching planet was other than a metaphor, especially since the science proffered was erroneous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this what they make nowadays...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains SPOILERS.Normally I would not have watched this film. However:- Justine looks up at the sky in the beginning of the movie, asking "which star is that". As if she feels something, an early hunch?- During the wedding reception, Justine tells her mother that she is scared, not about the marriage, she is generally very frightened. "No, it's something else, I.. I'm frightened mom, I have trouble walking, I...". It is proved during the movie that she has no physical problem, and that she does feel the end coming, somehow and gradually.- Justine gradually descends into a "catatonic" state, and moves with her sister and her husband, in a final state where she is the only one that has already accepted the end in her heart. With a bit of relief too: she bathes herself in the light of the new planet, since the planet will destroy everything that destroyed her happiness, and everything else as well. She "knows things", as she says. What she actually knows, is the worst outcome in pretty much everything, and guess what, it happens. What she feels and says is that "life on earth is evil". That is why she puts herself and Claire's child in the "magical cave" she had already created around her heart. Life is not evil in her magical cave.- In the second part, Claire's husband doesn't seem to talk normally anymore, he whispers most of the time, his wealth and masculinity are reduced to the role of the observer trying to make his wife feel more secure. When these roles are not useful anymore, he kills himself. Some scenes are very intense towards the end, lonesome agony, almost all internal. Claire's performance in the last 15 minutes is as intense as the catastrophic scenes in "2012", but without anything collapsing, no special effects, just the look on Claire's face and her agonizing efforts to save her child. Justine mimics the horses at the end - they accepted the end, no agony anymore.I'm a busy person, I have paused many movies before the first 30 minutes. This one, I first rented it, and fast-forwarded through much of the first part. Three days later I rented it again because I really wanted to see some scenes again. A week later I bought it, and I saw the entire movie twice. Yes, at least half of it is "strange" some would say. I would say it could do without at least 15 minutes from the first part, but at the end, it has a strange, secret, esoteric attractiveness. It will initially disappoint all those who expect special effects and action throughout. However, the title is not "Here's another movie in which millions of buildings explode". The title is "Melancholia".Epiloge: We all like movies such as "2012" etc which are quite good, but this movie is not focused on apocalyptic scenes.a) While that other good movie called "Seeking a Friend for the end of the world" is focused on specific people (agonies are symbolic), "Melancholia" focuses on specific agonies (people are symbolic).b) While other end-of-the-world movies are usually about the triumph of life, "Melancholia" is about the inevitability of death, and 3 different approaches to it by 3 different people: Suicide, Agony, Acceptance.</fullReview>

But this one made me do that.The pre-title sequence, particularly the music by Wagner, was probably the best I've ever seen in a movie. Prophetic. Poetic. Riveting.The middle of the movie dragged like a snail's trail, but you could tell it was inevitable - it was going somewhere. Somewhere you wouldn't like. But it moved - tragically.The ending was triumphant. No spoilers. Just bloody magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's not Melancholia it's Lobotomia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so glad i've seen Lobotomia, sorry... Melancholia, on TV a while ago. This gave me the opportunity to iron some trousers that have been hanging in the cupboard for days. Otherwise i guess that watching it in a movie theater and paying the ticket would actually give you a first-hand experience in mental conditions. In this sense Melancholia is a successful movie.If you're not into ironing or experimenting with your mind, there is another good thing: you'd have a chance to see Kirsten Dunst nude, although you might find these screenshots online and not waste any time.Overall, Melancholia confirmed my impressions about Lars von Trier. He is either suffering from melancholia himself, which might even be a good thing, since i've read a study that proved how melancholic people tend to be artistically gifted. Or he likes giving his audience a mental S&amp;M session, where he is the dominant partner.Either way, his movies are trying very hard to convince us how rotten human kind is. I'm only amazed how many people think that Lars von Trier's movies represent some kind of mirror of reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do you even begin with Lars von Trier? Exasperating? Enigmatic? Enthralling? Enraging? Or any other adjective beginning with "e" though having said that economical may not apply. So here we are again. Time to sit down and strap ourselves in.Melancholia open with a sequence of evocative slow-motion dream-scape shots (woman carrying child sinking into a putting green, another woman pondering electricity sparking off her fingers, a bride marching across the screen with ropes attached to her dress - you know the usual stuff). This sequence culminates with the Earth being headbutted by another planet... the titular Melancholia. So, it's the end of the world and it's all downhill from there.We switch to a wedding. A very posh wedding. Where we find Kirsten Dunst's Justine about to marry. However, all is not well. Familial relations are bordering on toxic and the nuptials unravel as Justine is dragged back into the depths of an apparently on-going depression. Her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) stoically tries to keep her sister's head above water. However, facing a vitriolic mother, lovable but loveless father and a (unt of a boss Justine resembles a knackered racehorse being whipped to make it across the finishing line (keep that metaphor stored away for when you watch the film).So what do we have here. Strip aside Von Trier's mixture of art-house and realist technical fireworks and underneath you'll find a surprisingly human and humanist drama. Well drawn and, dare I say it recognisable characters, (believable is bit to much of a stretch for Von Trier) jostle for position and orbit Justine and Claire. It's an existential meditation on depression, the transience of happiness, the inevitability of finality and ultimately a thumping good family drama meets dystopian sci-fi mash-up.Von Trier's never been short on ideas and once again he puts them front and centre. However, this time he reins himself in. There are none of the pyrotechnic shocks which nobbled Anti-Christ or the teeth-pulling irritation of Breaking the Waves. The ideas work because they are whispered not screamed. Subtle not telegraphed. Of course subtle for Von Trier is still well up the scale for other directors, yet it still somehow works. A rather pleasant surprise. Now it's time to gird my loins for Nymphomaniac Vol I &amp; II. I have a feeling that Melancholia may just be a pleasant bump in the road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, though not perfect, explores problems associated with depression rather skillfully. Take the title to heart: it is extremely depressing. Unlike most of the other reviewers, I found the beginning and end sequences the most pretentious and annoying parts of the film. The first several minutes of the film turned me off, and I fast forwarded past them to see the actual movie, they felt so pointless to me. I love artistic cinema, but I found those surreal sequences meaningless and superfluous. Despite the description, this film is not a sci-fi story, and although there is a world-ending disaster in it, that's such a tiny part of what's going on, you should ignore that if you're trying to choose whether to watch it. If you enjoy Lars Von Trier's depictions of twisted, bordering-on-insane relationships, you might like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really only watched this movie the first time because I'm a fan of Kirsten Dunst. As I somewhat expected, my first viewing caused me to make all my usual comments about annoying "shaky-cam filming" and vague, oh-so-pseudo-intellectual dialogue.The things is--I found myself thinking about this film over and over again in the following days. The next time I saw it was airing, I couldn't help myself--I tuned in again! By all rights, I should hate this movie, but I DON'T. I even found myself buying a DVD copy recently. So I had to ask myself "why?" Mulling it over this evening, while watching the movie for the 4th time (a real rarity for me!), I can only conclude that it's partly because this is no "shoot 'em up, hooray for the heroes" typical action-sci-fi film. This one is much more realistic in the sense that no one rides in to save the day, and the characters are left to deal with the gritty reality that is, after all, life.Another reason is, I suppose, my own battles with depression of the kind seizing Dunst's character. Except, for me, it would have been nice to be able to say that a planet called Melancholia was causing it all. Fortunately, that demon of mine has been put away for now. Which, again, makes it intriguing to me that this movie compels me as it does--I don't normally enjoy revisiting such stark reminders of that state of mind.I must add my admiration for Kirsten Dunst's acting ability. If she hasn't personally experienced the feeling of melancholy that comes with clinical major depression, then she must be one of the best actresses of all time. However, for a very insightful peek into why I keep watching Melancholia over and over, see gsmishka's post on the boards entitled "A strange but ultimately rewarding experience." That post says it all much more eloquently.Indeed, you will loathe or love Melancholia. In my mind, that's a good indicator of a great film.</fullReview>

There's nothing you need to wonder for too long about in this movie, no real mystery.However the ending was too short and the satisfaction of having the main characters die was taken too quickly. Of course that's just my sadistic opinion after sitting through a 4 minute long introduction which didn't even bare marginal importance, and the following 2 hours which felt like 7 years.I expect that this movie will appeal to some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but "Melancholia" remains a watch-once film for this viewer, despite the welcome exposure of Kirsten "Spider-Man" Dunst's fulsome charms and spot-on portrayal of her character's titular affliction. Sorry, that was a deliberately arch choice of words, but one has to take a shot at some sort of levity after watching such a dreadfully morose film. Strictly entertainment for emotional masochists, I'm sorry; Lars von Trier has a great deal of talent, beyond perhaps his penchant for palsied camera-work, and I've enjoyed a number of his films, but this wasn't one of them. Oh, I sat through it---praise the advantages of home video and the pause button---but that won't happen again; I think I might rather enjoy watching paint dry. "Melancholia" is truly a case of emperor's new clothes syndrome. That von Trier was able to con so many prime actors into doing this film speaks volumes, but I suspect it was paychecks and ego that led the way, and not any great attachment to the material. I suppose my feelings about the film may well have to do with a lack of sympathy for the characters and their pitiable neuroses. Dear me, poor, poor depressed and melancholic rich folk, boo hoo. Next time, Lars, cut the pretentious artsy-fartsy twaddle and give us characters we actually care about. I don't need your labored cinematic self-medication to induce yawns and sleepiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Justine (Kirsten Dunst), wedding bride from hell, fixated on her own angsts and depressive tendencies, does her utmost best to derail her own wedding party, while her satisfied with life sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) soothingly cajoles her by stating that she did her best. The wacko reception front-lined by her deranged mother and frivolous father is ultimately punctured when Justine gets down and dirty with a co-worker - predictably the humpty-dumpty involved breaks the marriage, which can't be put together again.Thankfully for the bride-to-have-been the world is at an end, as the planet Melancholy jumps out unawares from behind the sun, starts chasing after Mercury and Venus after choosing the preferable cinematic playmate of Earth (don't even start me on the physics of this movie - drop the subject, it's an 'art flick'). Not all are so eager for the ultimate absolution, especially Claire hitched on being a happy mother and wife. A minority opinion, but I can't help but gloss over the amount of laughter invoked by this movie in what were supposed to be meaningful occurrences.Still high from his euphoria of sub-traumatic gibberish that was epitomised by the catch phrase "Chaos reigns" Lars von Trier delves further into oblivion with another unconsciously trivial "Melancholy". Not quite sure what to expect as a 'comeback' from the Danish director I was unable to overcome my wanton suspicion, that von Trier has lost the cinematic drift. If I had any doubts towards the sensibility of "Melancholy" it was resolutely washed away by the opening sequence, reminiscent of the absolutely atrocious black-and-white classical music intro to his ultimate lemon "Antichrist". Images from the prior movie starting flowing in and within a couple of minutes I found myself grabbed by uncontrollable laughter.In general Lars von Trier is constantly somewhere on the verge of spoofing his own "Antichrist" madness. This time he delivers another trademark one-liner supplanting the now infamous "Chaos reigns" with some payback at inanimate objects "Earth is Evil!". Thankfully this time no fox made a cameo to supply us these words of wisdom. Similarly he also indulges into some masturbation under the guise of artistic expression and uses any excuse to get Kirsten Dunst stark naked lying on green grass, tits waving with the wind.Lars von Trier used to have the capability of taking viewers into unwanted places, but it seems that the further away from Dogma he has drifted the less attached he has been to proper storytelling and emotionality. And "Melancholy" is extremely lacking in the latter - the emotional pull of the world coming to its end is close to zero. Were it not for scripting in the character of Justine's son and my raging fatherly instincts I would actually have to say that even the ludicrous "2012" made me care more about the end of all life.Characters are not helped by their forced emotional drivel and poorly scripted actions of secondary characters, especially in regards to Justine's husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) and his untimely (and astonishingly out-of-character) death. The linchpin that is supposed to hold the whole diluted mess of characterisation is so cynically banal, that it begs to question the need for such a forcibly prolonged movie. The message: People who have something to lose will go boinkers, if their become aware of their inevitable death. Those who don't will just go: 'well, whatever'.Really, Sherlock...Not sure the title "Melancholy" fits this movie. I would look more along the line of "Dreary" or "Soulless".2 strikes for von Trier in my book. Not sure I'll give him a chance for a third, because I'm just too fed up with his wack.The movie has some stunning cinematography, especially in the hilarious opening sequence.</fullReview>

This movie triggered something from my deepest nightmares - something no horror movie I have watched ever was able to do.The result of this quality craftsmanship however, was to send me running, a result which I am sure the director would not have wished.A well crafted movie, which IMHO, would be best avoided by some people like me - but not because of any actor, director, or editor failings - simply because it produces some VERY unpleasant negative feelings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kirsten Dunst's realization at Cannes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with an 8-minute pre-credits prologue (drowning in Wagnerian score)an uncanny reminder of the end of "On the beach" (1959). Through a series of stills and extremely slow-motioned beautifully filmed shots, the end of the world is conveyed in no uncertain terms, although at an idyllic, plush seaside venue. After the opening credits, clever link from this surreal prologue is made through the apparently same slow-motions, a crane shot of a 20-feet white wedding limo. But this time the slow motion is not surreal, but real, as the limo manoeuvres extremely slowly through a narrow meandering country road. When the bride and groom finally arrive 2 hours late at the wedding ceremony, the movie truly begins.The first of the two parts, entitled "Justine" (the bride, played by Kirsten Dunst in a Cannes Best Actress performance), reminds me of another exquisite movie "The dead" (1987) a brilliant adaptation of James Joyce's affecting short story. The similarity is in the setting of a happy gathering scene, cutting back and forth between jubilant crowd scenes and intimate exchanges. The layers of Justine's superficially blissful and enviable circumstances are then gradually peeled, through these intimate exchanges with people around her, revealing an agonized soul hopelessly lost in depression. The culmination is, over just a few short hours, the lost of both marriage and career (she is a brilliant copywriter just promoted to artistic director during the wedding party), leaving her to face the end of the world (literally) with only three other people.The second part entitled "Claire" (Justine's pragmatic sister, played by an equally brilliant Charlotte Gainsbourg, who has already won her Cannes Best Actress Award two years ago with "Antichrist", also directed by Lars von Trier), is about the end of the world, actually not just the world but Life with an upper case "L", in accordance with Justine's belief that we are alone, the only life form in the entire universe. The threatening approach of a collision source with the titular celestial object is alluded to only very briefly in the first part, suggesting a general belief by the mass that this is only a "fly over", a shoulder-rubbing encounter that will not have any serious effect. As the party breaks up and everybody (including the groom) leaves, four people are left in this plush golf resort - expansive and expensive, both ? to witness this monumental but harmless event: the sisters, Claire's husband John (Keifer Sutherland) and their pre-teen son Leo. We never get a single glimpse of how the rest of the world react to this ominous turn of events, not even a brief shot of TV coverage (it would be reasonable to assume that there must be mass hysteria). What we observe is in intimate close range, through these four people. The finale shot is quite something, and I suspect there would be a good portion of the audience (this one included) saying inwardly to themselves "Not such a bad way to die"! Maybe even a majority.The performance of the two Cannes award-winning ladies is not something that a user-review can do justice to, so I'll leave it at that rather than do unintentional damage. One thing I do like to mention is that it's such a pleasure to see Dunst's path from the captivating little girl in Jumanji (1995), through a gradually maturing teenager role in "Mona Lisa Smile" (together with my two top favourites Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal), the fame-earning but uninspiring Spider lady, and finally a realization of her talent in "Melancholia".The rest of the cast is also splendid. John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling respectively as the listless father and aggressive mother, aforementioned Sutherland in the key pivoting (often thankless) role, Stellan Skarsgard as the materialistic boss, his son in real life Alexander as the unfortunate groom, Brady Corbet as a manipulative new comer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film again recently hoping to gain a new perspective on what Lars Von Trier was trying to convey. Well, honestly, nothing better was on at the time so I decided to sit through it again. Sadly, I don't feel any different about this movie. In fact, I like it even less. The beginning of the film is a 10 minute build-up to what is to come. Like the rest of this film, it's long and really unnecessary. The only good thing about it is if you watch that and the last 30 seconds you are done! You don't have to sit through this long, relentless and painful film. The story of Justine's descent into deep depression and mental despair (a/k/a Melancholy), is a decent story. LVT should have focused on that. Then he could have explained to us exactly why Justine bears no resemblance to her English parents or English sister whatsoever and she doesn't even have an English accent! Unfortunately, LVT doesn't see it that way. He decides to segue from a human interest story to a confusing pile of science fiction schlock about a strange planet - aptly named "Melancholia" - that is hurtling through space on a collision course with Earth. To all the LVT fans who have defended this movie: Yes. I actually DO get it and what the planet, Melancholia, represents metaphorically. And you know what? It still doesn't work. It gets even more convoluted when Justine goes from being a mental case to a psychic who sees the future. Oh and did I mention the "shaky" camera thing. Please, PLEASE! Invest in some tripods next time! Hand holding the camera looks so amateurish and makes us dizzy!So I am lowering my review from a 5 to a 3 and that's because at least the visuals of the planet and scenery are pretty good.</fullReview>

Von Trier uses his colour, tone and amazing imagery to make this a real epic mood piece, a modern danse macabre. The special effects were understated and enhanced the mood perfectly.

		<fullReview>Melancholia (2:15, R) ? other: drama, 3rd string, original, OSIT cynicsHamlet is known as "the melancholy Dane", but Danish director Lars von Trier seems to be bucking for the job with his latest film, Melancholia, starring Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg as Justine and Claire, a pair of sisters who don't look even a little bit alike but who share a propensity for gloom, despair, and depression.Casual moviegoers can be excused for confusing this film with the earlier 2011 release Another Planet, as the 2 of them share the same gimmick: Thru a grotesquely improbable flouting of orbital mechanics, Earth is about to have a planetary rendezvous with another world-sized object. Now "rendezvous" sounds cozy, maybe even a little racy, but this is nothing to be casual about, as writers from Edwin Balmer to Immanuel Velikovsky will attest.Nonetheless, both movies treat the imminent celestial osculation as very much secondary to the foreground plot, the emotional turmoil of the heroines. For all they know, it's TEOTWAWKI, but it's treated like the background chatter at a cocktail party while the protagonists discuss their love lives in the foreground. Really, you sort of wonder what the point is of hauling in such a monumental event, only to largely ignore it. Are the filmmakers saying that we shouldn't take their work seriously? Or is it the flip side of Casablanca, where Rick claims that "the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"; maybe the point is that human concerns are the only things that matter. Whatever the intent, I found it distracting and, as I said above, gimmicky. Certainly you should not go to this movie expecting to see a science-fiction picture.The film is divided into 2 parts, the 1st focusing on brand-new bride Justine and the 2nd, apparently occurring some months later, on Claire. It takes place entirely in and around a palatial country estate, complete with a like-new (hardly ever used) 18-hole golf course, owned by Claire's filthy-rich husband John (an effective Kiefer Sutherland, whom I never, not once, expected to see drag someone off to the garage for a little conversation with the tire iron).John and Claire have agreed to host the wedding reception for Justine (and pay for it, as John keeps reminding her), and it's the social event from hell. Who ARE all those people dancing and milling around in the background? Justine and her bumbly groom Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) appear to know none of them, except the harridans, scalawags, jerks, and doofi they're immediately related to. It's a festival of impoliteness, condescension, lack of consideration, and other socially appalling behavior from wall to wall. Justine tries to keep up a fake smiley front, but Claire keeps nagging her that she can't let herself go, a dark hint that letting go is something Justine has had a lot of practice at. Well, with THOSE parents and THAT boss, small wonder! Eventually everything implodes, not with smash bash crash bang but with soggy deflation.Almost nothing is made of the approach of the planet Melancholia in Justine's half of the movie, but it looms progressively larger, both literally and figuratively, in Part 2, as Justine, husbandless, jobless, and hopeless, returns to the estate to vegetate in a fetal position while the focus shifts to Claire, trying to cope but not very adeptly. She frets not only over her helpless, dysfunctional sister but also over the war surrogate that literally hangs over her head, despite John's cheerful reassurances that the scientists have figured everything out, and it's all going to be OK. He seems sincere, but all the while he's being confident and comforting, the sound track is moaning a steady, bone-deep low-level rumble reminiscent of an avalanche half a mountain away.There's weird, inexplicable imagery here. Among the opening super-slo-mo vignettes is one of Justine raising her arms with Saint Elmo's fire sparking up from her fingertips, a scene which had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Why, exactly, does the horse refuse to cross the bridge? Who knows? Why does Antares, the bright red star at the center of Scorpio, appear during the daylight in Part 1 and never get noticed or mentioned again? Beats me.The film goes on for quite a long while, but not much happens. There's maybe 60-70 minutes worth of dialog, most of it blandly mundane, grudgingly parceled out over the 2:15 runtime.It's a film for cynics, and the cynic in me thinks that maybe the whole enterprise was pitched to the financiers (TWENTY!! production companies listed) to cover an elaborate plot by Von Trier to get Kirsten Dunst to take her clothes off. If so, mission accomplished. And thanks for sharing.I'll give it one thing. Alfred Hitchcock said that, if you're going to call attention to a cannon at the outset, you'd better show it going off in the 3rd act. Melancholia does that. It's just that, by the TIME it does, you no longer care whom the cannon is pointed at, or whether anybody's bothered to point it at all.Pointless. Get it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another perfectly titled Von Trier oppressive nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I have to start by being honest. I am NOT a Lars Von Trier fan. My first experience with him was in 1996 when I saw "Breaking the Waves" at the Toronto International Film Festival. When it was over I found I'd been both bored and depressed. I was very impressed by Emily Watson and Stellan Skarsgard, but beyond that, I've never understood why critics were so impressed by it. I feel pretty much the same way about Melancholia. First, it's the perfect name for this film. And the blue planet is just the right colour. The film left me feeling blue. Which would have been fine, if it hadn't also left me feeling like that was two hours of my life I'm never going to get back. And I even fast- forwarded over a few parts. The film is absolutely oppressive. From the despair of the main character, who is borderline suicidal on what should be the happiest day of her life, to the anger expressed by her brother-in-law, played by Kiefer Sutherland, because he paid so much money for a wedding that is starting to feel more like a funeral. That's not to say the film is without any merit. Once again the acting is first rate. While I don't like Von Trier as a writer or a creator, he does have a talent for getting the best from his actors. Kirsten Dunst is so depressing she made me want to slit my wrists. The rest of the cast of primarily A-List European actors also turn in fine performances. However, while I thought they did a great job with the material, part of my problem is also the attitude that most of them take with regard to the possibility of impending doom. There are momentous events taking place in the world around them, but the characters seem totally uninterested, even disconnected.So I guess I came away from this Von Triers nightmare feeling pretty much the same as I did after seeing Dancer in the Dark and Dogville. Not Idiots though, I just plain hated that experimental disaster. Once again Von Trier has treated us to a film that is visually striking, and very well acted. But the stories that these actors present are for the most part confusing and tiresome. There is certainly a lot of originality in his work. Of that there is no arguing. But for me, once you get past the performances, the icing if you will, there's no cake. So the whole experience leaves you empty, and dying for a cup of coffee to wake you up! If you want to see a movie about the sudden appearance of a companion planet, I would instead suggest "Another Earth" by Mike Cahill and starring the terrific William Mapother and the fresh new Brit Marling. This movie has a few of the same problems, like the lack of surprise that seems to accompany the news of an identical Earth suddenly appearing in our sky. But the plot is so much more compelling that the flaws are much easier to forgive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia aka Self-Absorbia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has anyone but me noticed that nobody bothered to cast two actresses that were believable as "sisters?" That seems really important since the entire film is centered around their relationship. Yet, one is blond with an American accent, and the other dark with a British accent, from two parents with British accents...so, in the first instance, it was hard to even believe the characters who carried the entire film. Secondly, this movie had the effect of making me feel like I was supposed to buy in to under-developed characters, then believe that the character played by Kirsten Dunst named "Justine" was plagued by depression in the midst of all this sumptuous grandiosity that surrounded her: a castle, with an 18-hold golf course, and an indulgent, hovering sister married to a man who didn't mind forking over thousands of dollars to make Justine "happy," as everyone in the movie apparently was trying to do. I'm pretty forgiving in my criticisms of a person's art, but I found nothing about the plot of this movie believable and felt confused and irritated throughout the film. Admittedly, the photography was breath-taking, and in fact, the best part of the film. But in a time when people are dealing with feeding themselves because of economic downturn, it's very hard to sympathize with a character who comes across as self-indulgent, self-absorbed, cruel to animals, and generally hateful to everyone around her while enjoying the luxury of being cared for by everyone around her. Did we have to "beat a horse" to get the point of Justine's depression? I think the movie would have been more interesting if everyone had just let Justine sleep. I'm still wondering why the little boy Leo called Justine "Auntie Steelbreaker" or was it "Deal breaker?" who knows? Why bother to develop characters when the point is to exhaust your audience by dragging them into your auto-biographical nightmare, which is beautiful, yet ugly; somber yet comedic; ironic yet fatalistic; American yet British/Swedish, Blond yet Brunette. I may never watch another Swedish film. What a waste of talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing like spoiling the show is there. I saw this film knowing nothing about the director or the story only that there was a good cast of actors and something about the coming together of two worlds. After an irritating long opening which contained sequences of forthcoming events that do not actually happen the film concentrates on Justine's (Dunst) decline into manic depression immediately after her wedding. The festivities that follow profile and establish the characters of the other major protagonists Hurt, Rampling,Gainsbourg and Sutherland and just when you are starting to think that the astronomical references are some-kind of metaphor for Justine's mental condition, you are informed that a planet called Melancholia - well there's a coincidence - is on a possible collision course with earth. But hold on, it will fly past because Sutherland the amateur astronomer and his little telescope tell us so - who needs Hubble, Mount Palomar or Jodrell Bank? Melancholia then veers away before changing course for earth again. What?? Okay a complete suspension of the laws of physics has now taken place which was probably all too much for the Sutherland character who now tops himself. The fact that the world would have been devastated long before the actual impact is another irrelevance as we now watch Dunst and Gainsbourg sit, take coffee and await the planet's final demise. Not soon enough. The acting was good throughout as was the photography. The rest was just nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is purely a piece of trash where the best acting was in supporting roles and shows a complete lack of understanding of even the basic tenants of science which is not surprising seeing as while actors and Hollywierd always feel the know all and the rest of us know nothing the reverse is actually the rule. Here's the spoiler - look for Kirsten Dunst getting nude - sadly that is the highlight of the film. Charlotte Gainsbourg makes me feel like I am at a birthing class with all here over dramatic breathing, I'm guessing she went to the hyperventilation school of dramatic farts! Even in Sci-Fi a premise must have some level of believability and the most basic tenant of acting is to cause the audience to suspend disbelief. This fails on all levels. Dunst is flat in delivery though not in chest. Her character doesn't cause any empathy nor do any of the other characters. Save yourself the time and just take a line from the movie - "it's a piece of s@#t!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How anyone can call this a piece of art is beyond me. It's simply a dreadful film. Its mystery lies in how bad this movie really is.Perhaps, if the character development of the parents had been strengthened more, the story would have been enhanced. As written, this is pure junk.That wedding reception will live in our nightmares for ever and a day. Everyone is so uptight and the Kirsten Dunst part makes me want to institutionalize her. You have to have pity for the poor guy who married her. Her sister Claire is really not that much different.The best thing about this travesty of a film is the music of Tristan and Isolde, even though the misery of an anti-Semite, Richard Wagner, wrote it.The world coming to an end? The film industry could easily do that by producing more films of this sick mentality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, also this review may contain spoilers. I have not much to add to those who wrote that it may be best to watch the first 5 minutes of the film, then go for a dinner or doing the dishes or mowing the lawn, come back after 2 hours to watch the last 30 seconds and you will not have missed anything.Except some exceptionally bad acting (who said Kirsten Dunst will get an Oscar nomination for what is called "acting" in this movie?). And of course the unavoidable hand-camera. Another one of LvT's pieces of art: let a cameraman who heavily suffers from Parkinson Disease make a movie, add some very bad lighting technicians and yipeee... we have a new style of film-making, we call it the "Dogma"-style and declare everything that is done this way a "work of art". Period. Like it or leave it... I prefer to leave it.And I did not even mention the script which is as bad as the whole movie (coming as no surprise, as the author is the same).My best guess (and excuse for LvT) is that he was watching too much "2001 - A Space Odyssey" and wanted to make an evenly mysterious work of art. In being mysterious he may have succeeded, but the result is not a work of art. It's the product of a man who apparently doesn't come to grips with his life and the world he lives in, so that in the end the only question that remains is: What does the man want to tell us???I really tried to approach this film open minded, but Mr. Trier has just wasted 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

I'm not easily bored and I don't give up early, but I could sense in the first 5 minutes of endless, random, slow motion scenes that with nothing but dramatic classical music at 150 dB to help it....that I was in for a long night of pretentious bullshit. Besides the pervasive dull pace, the Dunst's character and many others were simply inane...and unintentionally. Scene after scene could not be swallowed. The eye-candy CGI of the planets colliding was not the gist and not spectacular, but still the bright spot of a dimly lit and dimly acted effort to present a theatrical/cosmological metaphor for a doomed soul. I wouldn't even recommend buying this on VHS for $1 at a yard sale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starts with a scene of the earth being destroyed which would rival Kubrik ( if we hadn't already had Kubrik for it to remind us of ). It isn't the directors fault that someone has done a near balletic space scene already so I enjoyed this and was then flashed back to weeks earlier. Suspension of disbelief has to take a pounding here as obviously we are all destroyed, there is no life, how are we watching a film exactly. This puts the Germans winning the war, the flooding of New York, the Americans capturing an enigma machine, and every previous "re-writing of history" movie in the shade. the destruction of the earth should only ever really be at the end of a film and preferably one from the nineteen forties when all the credits were at the beginning so you can blackscreen in silence; But for the sake of film I waltzed through that with no problems compared to getting through the next two hours ( that felt closer to four ). I'm not against pretentious movies per se, it all depends on how they're done and the story they're telling like any other movie. This one possibly had a good story to tell but told it in such a way that only the most devoted advocates of sticking their skulls into their own rectal passages could consider it effective. This is a film made by an unwell man featuring his illness apparently and if so underlines the dangers of being "too close" to a project. It had as much clarity as a film about the dangers of alcoholism made by a roaring drunk and none of the laughs. One could imagine that this was looking like a four hour film when a studio or distributer looked at it and said "If you can't get that down below two it's going in the bin!" The editing is shocking, giving the impression that whole scenes were truncated arbitrarily. The script was likewise either terrible or large chunks of dialogue that would have made it credible hit the cutting room floor due to the aforementioned editing. The result was none of the sub plots gained any credibility. The boss who wants his copywriter to keep working through her wedding and takes on someone just to follow her around till she comes up with the "tagline" he's waiting for. The divorced parents who slag each other off in their speeches then seem to stop abruptly ( editing again?) it's just a "mish mash" of possible ideas that don't really work well. Unlike some of the previous reviewers I didn't find any substantial difference between part one and part two ( yes that old trick is employed as well )in terms of tedium, lack of credibility or appeal but also unlike some I found the acting good. Kirsten put in the very best performance she could reasonably have given in the circumstances and given the lack of feasibility of their characters' actions and dialogue so did John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling and many others. Keifer Sutherland I thought made a particularly good fist of it; but in the end you don't care much about the characters not because of the acting but because of the characters' characters as written ( or edited possibly ). For most of the film when I wasn't dozing ( I actually sat through this twice just to make sure I hadn't missed huge chunks that made it all work. the director should have shown similar heroism before releasing it upon us) I wanted to get each of the main characters by the scruff of the neck and shout "PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!"but then I couldn't be bothered because I knew what was going to happen anyway from the first, and only decent, 5 minutes of the film.I think this mess will broaden Kirsten Dunst's repertoire careerwise demonstrating a willingness to get the "girls" out for "artistic" reasons without actually having many of the public see them. I doubt it will harm the other very skilled actors on display either but as far as writing, editing and directing is concerned, they should have thought about my idea for the 1940's style end credits. That way I wouldn't have been able to note their names to start my Internet Movie "avoid at all costs" Database.</fullReview>

Only surprise being that the characters themselves didn't think of it. And don't watch it, just for the "flesh".Kirsten Dunst delivers a power house performance. And the other actors are good too. I was still missing something. I liked the movie (and I can tell you there weren't that many in the cinema I watched it, who actually liked it) and I could see the allegories and everything Lars v. Trier was trying to convey. Still thought the break (it's kind of like watching two different movies back to back) didn't really work that well in my opinion.

		<fullReview>Huh?Huh?What?Huh? (I need to fill in a minimum of ten lines you see..)What?-Huh?I just don't get it. Okay, obviously from the beginning this is an "art film". I get that. And I love a lot of the visuals and some of the ideas overall.It was interesting at the beginning. At the opening, obviously we are seeing what will come, or what may come in an artistic way. Then a bunch of confusing moments. At first it appears some normal kind of wedding for a wealthy couple. Then there is some kind of what I thought was a mystery unraveling. Things are not what they seem to be.From there on out it just got more and more confusing. I know somewhere there is supposed to be some deep indirect/implied message or theme to it all.. About this time the slow tempo and all the disjointedness of it all made it incredibly boring. Now I look over and my wife who is fast asleep. For the first time since I don't know when I just wished a movie was over.. I was dying of boredom and angst thinking of all of the things I could do better with my time.And then an idea popped into my head about where I had watched some documentary about so called "fan edits". I immediately thought of a great idea for when this film comes out on DVD I will make my own edit of it where the whole thing only lasts around 15 to 20 minutes. I will take all the great SFX shots,the sci-fi parts, and rearrange them. Perhaps with a different theme, or just provide a short narration of the wedding, etc., then just skip to the cool parts.No offense, but I don't get any of the positive reviews for this film at all. Maybe I'm just not refined enough to appreciate the fine artistry of it all. Although I certainly don't need to be told every story explicitly/directly either.An apropos quote from "The Emperor's New Clothes" by by Hans Christian Anderson: (QUOTE) A child, however, who had no important job and could only see things as his eyes showed them to him, went up to the carriage."The Emperor is naked," he said."Fool!" his father reprimanded, running after him. "Don't talk nonsense!" He grabbed his child and took him away. But the boy's remark, which had been heard by the bystanders, was repeated over and over again until everyone cried:"The boy is right! The Emperor is naked! It's true!" (END QUOTE)Wait for my fan edit (if I ever find the time to make such a thing), and, or get your you finger ready on your remote to fast forward to the cool parts when it comes out on DVD.Skip this one and watch something else. Else you might find your self saying... Huh?-what?-huh? Although it might be a good replacement for counting sheep as a sleep aid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With such a great cast, including some of my all time favorite actors, I really had high hopes for this movie. The fact there would be a SciFi element as well only added to my excitement. Unfortunately these superb actors seem to have been duped into make a ridiculous and completely self indulgent movie that was just excruciatingly painful to endure.None of the characters have any redeeming qualities or are likable in any way. While the performances were great, (hence the 2 score and not 0), they came across as completely self absorbed narcissists making it impossible to care for any of them, except for Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) who I just pitied.I happen to know people in real life with chronic depression so I know first hand how debilitating and destructive this affliction can be. By the first half of the movie I actually wanted Justine to die horribly. I can't imagine anyone on planet Earth being pathetic enough to rape someone on their wedding day. I felt physically ill watching that scene.I didn't understand the metaphor of the planet slamming into Earth but I was certainly overjoyed to see it happen because it was honestly the best thing for these poor self absorbed souls.I've seen better material from film students. Seriously.In future I will avoid this director like the plague.</fullReview>

This planet in the movie is huge, it is the earth should worry about changing orbit, not this planet.Long before the impact all things and people would fly into the space because the gravity of this planet would overpower the gravity on earth. In fact the earth would break into pieces before the actual impact.Long before the impact the cataclysmic events would happen, like high winds, tsunamis, earthquakes, etc..If Earth would manage to stay put upon the impact, the least it could do is to cast a shadow on the planet when it was that close.And what is with the 19th hole on the golf course, other than some obscure snobby reference to the constantly reminded fact about the number of holes on that golf course .Plus, watch out the number of the spoons in the father's of the bride pocket.Great movie idea, not new though, kind of reminds the Canadian "Last Day on Earth", and dozen of other movies, but all b-actors cast doesn't deliver beyond that.To my like, only Charlotte Gainsbourg managed to develop a character with more than 2 dimensions.

		<fullReview>This film tries to tie too many things together into one and hence fails.The "Claire" part is better, but its finish is weak. Let her go to the village, show the pain of the people and at least that part would have been fine.No can do, since, if Wagner ruins "Die Götterdämmerung" by Brünnhilde's self immolation instead of letting it end properly with Siegfried's death, then Lars von Trier must of course ruin his film in the exact same way.It is a dramatic impossibility to go from grief to blissful resignation.And, by the way, that's also not how Schopenhauer said blissful resignation comes about. (Explicitly, resignation comes from either suffering or insight and insight comes from being lucky and a genius.) Not that Lars wouldn't know, he knows things, just like Justine does, in particular that life is evil. And hence she is... clinically depressed. What went wrong there? But the more idiotic the twist... all of a sudden it's "Always look at the bright side of death, just before you draw your terminal breath", which is actually quite sane, but... where did that sanity come from? I also wonder why the film is called "Melancholia" and not "Depression". I must admit that Kirsten Dunst does a good job at looking swollen and old in the second part, but in the first part all she looks is consternated, like a woman who just heard the words: "It hasn't rained in weeks. Go get the bucket and water the apple trees. I would do it myself, but it would be rude, if I would let my good friend here drink all the moonshine alone by himself." And that is not melancholic and neither is it depressed. Gloomy, yes. Filled with hatred, yes. But that's about it. And her actions? Well, stage fright isn't melancholia and neither is it depression. Let me put it this way: What would Amy Winehouse have done? Certain things similarly, other things very differently. Why should a melancholic person be afraid of marriage? If it doesn't change anything, well, what to be afraid of? In my opinion Lars simply exchanged the person. In the first part Justine has a choleric temperament, a power complex and strong regressive tendencies. In the second part she's clinically depressed. Until in the very end she makes for a silly parody of blissful resignation.There are other horrible mistakes in the first part, like that Lars can't make up his mind, whether he wants to narrate or show. I mean, if you show a wedding like that, then it stands for itself. Good art actually, the best depiction of a wedding I've ever seen on film, but in its glorious objectivity it totally destroys any consideration of the plot or Justine's inner life. I was thinking: "Yeah, just like that on my friend's wedding. And what a tour de force it is..." And I am not to blame. You shoot like Tarkovsky, you better also steer like Tarkovsky. Is that too hard to understand? And then the thing which annoyed me the most, the constant use of "Tristan und Isolde" as if "Tristan und Isolde" would be about regressive tendencies, clinical depression or what have you! If you read this Lars, let me tell you what "Tristan und Isolde" is really about: "Heilige Elisabeth, bitte für mich!" How dare you! So, Wagner went to Paris, didn't like it, but Minna did. Wagner's reaction? "Der fliegende Holländer": A woman should drown herself, if that would bring salvation to her husband and not enjoy trivial things. Still angry, back in Dresden, he composes "Tannhäuser": Yes, I married her for sex. If only it could be any other way! And then "Lohengrin": Forget about it. Women shouldn't even know the names of their husbands, so little do they grasp a man's greatness and depth. But... now... low and behold... Mathilde Wesendonck! Did she come out of the blue? Or did Wagner finally find a woman who fitted the Elisabeth role? But the thought had taken on flesh now and Wagner had to wrestle himself out of its grip and so he composed "Tristan und Isolde".That's it. No room for interpretations here.The only time when I thought the music was fitting was in the second part during the hail storm, fitting for the naked desperation and pain.And all the other times, it's just a silly artsy fartsy thing.On the plus side, visually and metaphorically the film is quite good and even connected to melancholia.Nevertheless... all in all... this is just pompous. Compare it to "Breaking the waves" and you'll see.</fullReview>

See On the Beach to view an exploration of people dealing with the end. We sit through many emotions and characters acting out without enough information to understand any of it. There are whole scenes that go nowhere. Justine on a rock under planet light. We already know that she is seriously disturbed. Is there a purpose here beyond showing her naked body? Where do her psychic abilities fit in? The whole script reminds me of a sophomore in film school. The only positive feature is that it is beautifully filmed.

		<fullReview>That planet that looked like a flat moon should have hit Lars in the head. Was it a planet or a meteor? It looked as fake as the rest of the movie. Glad I didn't pay for the ticket. Seven people in a huge theater should have given me some kind of indication that the movie would leave me scratching my head, saying "Duh..." At the beginning I was thinking, "Oh no, another movie like District Nine. That totally sucked." And the only reason I'm giving Melancholia two stars is for the ending, which should have happened sooner, like thirty seconds into the film. I didn't like the way it ended, I just liked that it ended. Even my review is too long, and I'm making up stuff I don't want to put here. The movie ucked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia Falls Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is how to make Melancholia a brilliant movie.Take the beginning of the film roughly 5 minutes, and the last 30 seconds and edit them together.There you go, beautiful artistic sounds and sights with gorgeous high definition picture and enough bass at the end to blast you straight through your movie seat.For a movie that could have been so damn excellent this one falls directly on it's face as soon as the Melancholia logo frame hits the screen. The movie turns into a self engorged, elongated, misshapen and misdirected drawn out snore fest. Anything that can be wrong, has will and is wrong. This coming from such an amazing start to the movie which was truly stunning and gorgeous ending, to turning out to be one of the most monumental failures in modern day cinema. My god, what a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, you know after 2 min it's LvT. I have nothing bad to say about this first minutes, they are beautiful pictures. About the acting: Dunst is good but I don't believe her. It's seems she's using that natural dull face of hers during the whole movie....so not impressed (but who am I). Like Gainsbourg in Antichrist, liked her in this movie, that's all I have to say. The Story: Okay, I'm student. The English translation of my study would be something like "the science of theater, film and media". After I saw the film I felt stupid! Because I didn't get it! Not a clue what that so called genius LvT wanted to tell us. So that's the reason I give this movie 2 stars. I just can't recommend a movie that makes absolutely no sense to me. If you get the movie, I'm open to answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best anti-depressant I have ever experienced.If you want to see, feel and experience how much depression can be energy consuming and destructive, especially when it is a depression at the edge of insanity - than watch this movie. (Energy consuming: E.g. during the second part it was extremely difficult for me not to fall asleep.)I have problems with depression myself from time to time. And this film showed me in an incomparably impressive way how much depression is my enemy and not my friend, because it destroys.I had a very bad night after watching this film - and the really good it did me was, that I decided, NO: I won't worship a person who is very much narcissistic, egocentric and it seems to me more insane than sane. I am sad about a society that worships people like Lars von Trier (don't get me wrong, I don't despise him). And I understand maybe in a deeper way as before, that depression can be extremely destructive and that I want to fight it or help myself out of it and don't want to worship or romanticise the destructive side of it (I think I romanticised it sometimes too). Lars von Trier himself explained in an interview, that this film is also romantic - he chose a romantic piece of music to give it the romantic touch.I can understand why Lars von Trier understands Hitler, because I think he understands how much Hitler was insane and egomaniac. And to give insane people power is the most destructive thing you can do.In my opinion people like Lars von Trier should get treatment as much as possible and better not get the opportunity to earn a lot of attention and money out of the insane side of his personality.I would very much have appreciated that all the money and time that is lost for this film was invested in finding more ways out of depression or anything that is destructive in this world. You can call me idealistic - but you can also call me pragmatic.I like that Lars von Trier said in an interview, that he feels guilty doing melancholia. Guilt seems to be in place: as a viewer I felt kind of used - he wanted to treat himself with this film and the film gave me a bad feeling and a very bad night after watching it. Maybe I felt a little bit like with my mother, she want's me to "worship" her narcissistic and destructive behaviour too (the difference is that she doesn't realise it and doesn't feel guilty).I am giving this film 2 stars: one for awful and the other for the fact that this film made me realise in a very strange but intensive way that I myself will do what I can to find positive ways to overcome the destructive and that I don't approve of giving a narcissistic and insane mind your attention and call it's product a masterpiece.The fact, that I have learned my lesson, would never make me recommend to watch this film, although there are some minutes worth while watching. I suppose you can find these scenes at youtube (the worth while watching prologue is on - but please don't jump at conclusions if you like it, the movie is much different).</fullReview>

Kirsten Dunst is in it and shows some nice boobage, but other than that... get drunk, go out with friends and listen to some really loud music. Your money would be better spent.

My husband also left feeling nauseous. Yecch... don't waste your money! Fortunately, I was able to get a free pass to return to the Pickford Film Center in the future to see a different film at no cost to me. Even if the film hadn't been so visually obnoxious and disturbing, the depressing plot wasn't worth my time or money, either. Never again will I see a movie by this writer, director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait... what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers abound! I heard about this "beautiful" art film that Kirsten Dunst was involved in, and it took me some time to research what it was about exactly. A bride as the main subject on a movie poster about the apocalypse? Odd, but OK...As it is available on On Demand with my local cable company, which is more convenient than the one theater in West L.A. it's scheduled to be in, I settled down for what I hoped would be a good movie. Some 2 hours later I found it difficult to articulate why I was so confused. Let's just say it's a good thing I had my college coursework out of the way (although I wonder what my notes would have read like...).The first half of the movie is very difficult to follow. You could be glued to the picture but you'll be scratching your head the entire time. And it's difficult to hear just what the characters are saying amongst each other (and without subtitle help you just have to get used to it). Not only did I find it difficult to follow, I felt quite uncomfortable with all the dysfunction pumping out at me. I can go enjoy that at Thanksgiving if I wanted to, I don't really want to sit through a movie of it. Add to these two pieces of general irritation is the unnecessary shaky hand camera effect. Oh now I remember, I'm watching it at home so I don't get motion sick. The only thing that kept me from fast-forwarding to the second act was that I might miss something relevant and have to sit through the whole thing again. Sorry to say, you'll have to sit through the whole thing again anyways just to understand Kirsten's character in the second half, which is months later (and that took some time to figure out as well).The second half is now where things actually make sense. We don't have to sit through an hour of everyone dealing with the problem at hand, we're being introduced where it's a part of daily life. Although it would have been nice to get more the of the optimistic side rather than the pessimistic side to balance things out so that as a participant, you could emotionally choose for yourself. But, no. You're told what side to agree with, even if you don't, and that's where the director focuses, which can be a problem if you don't develop that emotional connection, as in my case. By the end of the movie, you're more focused on the antagonist anomaly; in delayed gratification fashion, you get a little more insight to the characters before the big show. That big show, and the movie's opening scenes, were the only things I watched for a second time. One, because I felt I wanted to understand the very "2001: A Space Odyssey" beginning sequence, and two, because the visual effects are subtle enough that they are indeed enjoyable. If anything, the visual effects are the star of the whole production and are done in such a way they add so much to an otherwise bland movie. This is a good example of using such effects tastefully.I gave this movie three stars which I feel is very generous. Being a Los Angelino I deal with out-there content all the time and usually have little trouble understanding it, but this movie was so confusing it was all the more irritating than enjoyable. I have to agree with other reviews that the cast's star power was wasted, nor do I see why this film is being heralded as 'gorgeous.' If for curiosity's sake you find yourself still wanting to sit through this production, then by all means enjoy it (I was one such person), but if you're on the fence leaning towards saving time and money, then save, save, save.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melancholia is easily the worst movie I have ever spent money to see, or at least the first hour is, I can't comment on the remainder because I did something I have not done in over 25 years, I walked out of the theater before the movie was over. This turkey gives us a "plot" that is pretentious amateurish ridiculous and dull, characters with vapid dialog who emote with LONG vacant stares at the camera and try to convince us (unsuccessfully) that their melancholia means they are deep and not just self indulgent or have a chemical imbalance, and those aren't even the worst things about this movie.If Mr. von Trier can't give us something interesting to think about he could have at least presented something for us to look at without making one seasick, but apparently Mr.von Trier got a new zoom lens for his birthday and he was eager to try it out, so he zooms in, and then he zooms out, and then he zooms in, and then he zooms out again, and then he zooms way way way in and figures that would be the perfect time for a swish pan, and all the time he's playing with the zoom he's holding the camera as if fire ants were crawling up his pant legs and he was trying to shake them off. And I'm not just talking about one bad scene I'm talking about the entire first hour, perhaps the entire movie but I wouldn't know about that. Even Ed Wood knew more about how to move a camera than Mr.von Trier, I'm serious, Plan Nine from Outer Space showed more technical skill than Melancholia; so I would humbly suggest that before Mr.von Trier makes another home movie he sell his zoom lens and use the money to buy a tripod.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Maddening Work Of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Anitichrist" I had given up on Lars Von Triar but I was tempted back after reading some articles on his new opus "Melancholia" I'm glad I did. He is still the most maddening of filmmakers because his chutzpah is larger and more up front than his talent, that means a huge, monumental chutzpah. "Melancholia" has many things going for it: the performances by the two female leads, Kirsten Duntst and Charlotte Gainsburg are pure cinematic brilliance. The photography, superb with some sound design worthy of superlative praise. Glimpses of John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling are also a major plus but the script littered by infantile dialog was a crashing blow. The film left me without appetite or willingness to talk. The one thing that I have to confess, I may, just may see it again one day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted the film to put far more emphasis on the big picture; how the WORLD reacts to this situation, not just s these select few characters. Thats what I was expecting going into this film. Instead, the script decides to spend about 1hr 10min on a wedding, over the course of one day -- the planet Melancholia isn't even a part of the plot until the final hour of the film. Up until that moment the film focuses on Justine's depression - and nothing else. This film is basically just a run of the mill (although very well made) character drama about depression, with a the plot about the planet Melancholia seemingly bolted on towards the end. I think it would've made for a far more entertaining, interesting and thought provoking film if the script had focused more on the planet and how people are reacting to it, rather than just Justine's depression and how these few characters react to it. This film is spectacular, don't get me wrong. The direction is so precise and real it's uncanny - the acting is too. I just wish the script had focused more on that oh so intriguing plot summary on its IMDb page, instead of such an under whelming story about one character and her depression. I wish it were about the entire world's depression and fear of the planet, maybe focus on multiple families around the world. Such a waste of a great concept that could've made for a fantastic film. If only this concept had been used to explore humanity as a whole instead of these few random characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I failed to feel the Melancholia - by Vicente E. Garcia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia has raised its own standards but failed to achieve it properly in my opinion. There is no doubt that the movie is visually stunning and the casting is powerful. Every actor in there deserves to be in this Lars Von Trier film. Some people really love this film because of its depth and symbolic approach while others seem to neither hate nor love it.Again, visually, the movie is stunning. The color palette used throughout the film really elevated the film like all the scenes can be posted in an editorial magazine. You can really see that the characters came from rich families and the wedding is just one of their typical social gatherings as the elites. The cinematography was good in terms of switching the flash forwards from the present time weaved to form a coherent and consistent story.The story is promising but the execution might be a little off. The film tackles on a different perspective about the end of the world, marriage, existential crisis etc. Surprisingly unlike movies about end of the world, the protagonist is not some appealing A-list actor that tries to save the world with all his equipment, wit, and motivation to save his family (typical, right). But this end of the world film is different, showing an unorthodox way in dealing with apocalypse.The idea of how the story is told gives you what will be the ending of the movie right after the movie has started. In the first 10 minutes of the film, you can easily know how the movie will end in terms of the story. But it's like a quick recap, so to speak. Also, the idea of a wedding, paranormal powers, and alien invasion is great but the result did not execute just as good as it is. And as the movie progress, it unravels some new plots. But the problem is that the pace is too slow and the script is just too lengthy. The script is a bit forceful in showing the audience the depth of the film, and it just failed some expectations.Lars Von Trier is a great director and I have to admit that the first and last scenes will blow you away. But those scenes aren't good enough to support such a lengthy film. Kristen Dunst captures the flow of the story and the character she portrays. Thank goodness that Kristen Dunst is chosen to star in the film. This is a great move to completely let loose of her American teenage sweetheart label. I think melancholia deals with death more than depression. If you like movies that challenge our existence as humans or just being here in this world, this daunting film might be good for your questions right now.But the strongest edge of this movie is that it is oozing with nihilism with a passive-aggressive tone. Also, it tackles completely in the word "end", both physically and symbolically. And as two worlds collide, Melancholia and Earth, it has meant more than just a collision. This reason, despite the flaws mentioned, makes Melancholia beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound Insight into the Depressive's World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MELANCHOLIA is the kind of movie that will generate extreme feelings either way: viewers either love it or hate it. For anyone who has experienced depression or panic, or any form of mental illness, however, Lars von Trier's work will strike an answering chord. The opening sequence sets the tone, as we see Justine (Kirsten Dunst) in a surreal world, with the music from Wagner's TRISTAN AND ISOLDE striking great aural waves in the background. The Wagnerian references are significant: we are transported into an elemental world in which the acts of "knowing" and "unknowing" assume particular significance. MELANCHOLIA offers some trenchant comments about depression: even though it is perceived as a 'disorder' in most societies, it can confer an incredible calm on sufferers. This is certainly the case with Justine, whose serene demeanor contrasts starkly with that of her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). As the two of them prepare for the inevitable strike by the planet Melancholia (a physical manifestation of a mental state), their behavior significant: Justine builds a makeshift structure which she claims will protect them from the catastrophe to come (even though it doesn't), while Claire tries vainly to escape with her son Leo (Cameron Spurr) but finds no way out. How can there be? Even though sufferers are often told to "snap out" of their depression, it's obvious that they can't. They are mentally imprisoned, just like Claire seems to be physically imprisoned.Lars von Trier's camera-work seems particularly suitable for this type of film. Mostly shot with a hand-held camera that most restlessly around the actors, unable to keep still for any length of time, it suggests a world of uncertainties, one where no one knows what will really happen next. Claire's wife John (Keifer Sutherland) tries his best to assume an air of quiet authority over the proceedings, as he continually reassures his spouse that nothing will come of them, even if Melancholia does strike; but we know that his efforts are doomed. This is a harsh, unfeeling world over which human beings have little or no control, despite their attempts to colonize it - through the use of a telescope or a makeshift device made of wire. The only way to cope with it is to encounter it head- on, whatever the consequences.In this topsy-turvy, elemental world, Justine comes across as the most capable person, despite the fact that, for everyone else in the film (especially the guests at her wedding-feast), she is perceived as "ill." She is the only person who admits to her state of mind, and alters her behavior to suit that state of mind. She might seem 'deviant' or 'odd' - especially in one sequence where she lies naked on a rock, her pale torso illuminated by the planet's rays - but she knows how to make sense of her life. MELANCHOLIA encourages us to question our definitions of 'madness' and 'sanity,' as well as providing a profound insight into the world of the depressive. A unique experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Melancholia" is an apt title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to watching "Melancholia", I saw both volumes of "Nymphomaniac". Well, really I saw the two films separately and not as a whole considering that is how the studio chose to release the film (not Lars), but I still knew exactly what type of filmmaker Lars Von Trier was. Let us cut right to the chase: If you hate Lars Von Trier, no matter what the critical hoopla will tell you, this is not the movie for you. Science geeks, prepare for the worst because this film not only negates the laws of physics, but Trier's tour-de-force is a character study more than anything. Where does that leave the rest of the audience? Kirsten Dunst fanboys, art house freaks, or anyone that will jump on the latest critically acclaimed indie."Melancholia" revolves around Justine (Kirsten Dunst) who is about to get married, but something is not quite right. Her family does not know, but that is not all that is going on here. Apparently, some planet is going to strike Earth which will cause this "melancholia". How this family will survive during this unusual occurrence is not important. The science behind the revolving planets does not really matter either. Rather, how Justine copes with everything surrounding her and how Claire evolves as the film does.Now reading that synopsis might differ from the IMDb-provided one, but it is the more honest one. It might sound less fun than what these advertisements are showing you too. And you know what, that is right. "Melancholia" is not a film where you are going to want to re-visit it again and again. It is also not a film that your parents will want to re-visit again and again. Yet, that is kind of the point. Lars Von Trier invites you into Justine's mind. She is depressed and stripped of any emotion. The moments where she does not utter even a syllable speak louder than her peeved mother or whimsical father. It is almost a juxtaposition. While the film looks absolutely gorgeous, what really steals the show here are the performers and their actions. What bogs down this dreary snapshot of life is the script. When the credits roll, you almost ask yourself "what is the point?" I understand that not every film needs to explore some deeper meaning, and not every film has to spell things out. Yet, "Melancholia" does neither. What might be off-putting is the tortoise-like pacing. This a film where the running time is about 2 hours and 16 minutes, but it feels like it is longer. The first hour or so is so emotionally draining that it is hard to keep watching. Fortunately, the bleakness is still there, but with the introduction of the "melancholia" and the regression of Justine, the film turns into something entirely different. If this review did not answer any questions such as "Is this movie worth my time and money?" or "Is Melancholia all bark and no bite?", it is because that is up to you decide. And quite honestly, I am not even sure if I understand Von Trier's latest outing all that much. I got a sense of the tone and the film's visual landscape, but I feel with repeat viewings, there will be something even more below the surface. I will say this, I have never seen a film look this good in quite a while, and I have never seen special effects this impressive in awhile. If Lars Von Trier's entree does not fill you, his dish looks spectacular at the very least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...the very core of my existence was challenged by this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia was an experience to say the least. Beginning with such a poetic view, the directors visual and musical synopsis of what the movie entails is how it begins. A dark, and entrancing score rings in the movie, and with each passing moment I found my self holding my breath. The struggles, pains and achievements of each character is what I think is the work of art which captivated me through this movie.Each character did a great job in portraying what being human is all about in this film, ever reminding us that what we struggle with most, is sometimes the hardest thing to truly explain. The pressures of the real world surround the entire plot, interwoven into every characters story, even overshadowing imminent disaster. I was baffled by cowardice, hidden and enveloped by strength; madness, ripped apart and shredded by acceptance, and love, overwhelmed and dismantled by fear. Above all else, the director made the point very clear, the human condition prevails.It is only by absolute acceptance of the present moment, that the characters true strengths are shown. Melancholia is a certain work of art, and I am still trying to regain my emotional breath of life, as the very core of my existence was challenged by this movie. This film is a great reminder on how small and insignificant all the problems of life are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a delightful surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is one of the most unique films I've ever seen. It's beautifully depressing. I was touched by its sadness and two unbelievable performances, Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg... they were incredible. The acting, the emotion, the characters, the depth, the symbolism, the art style, the score, etc. Almost every element of this film is executed to perfection and it sucks you into the events taking place. The only real negative was the camera work. The shaky-cam felt unnecessary and at times took away from the viewing experience, breaking the immersion of the movie. Other than that, this was simply a work of art that is tough to explain in words. I am certain that most people won't be able to become absorbed into the film. It's a strange movie and incredibly slow moving. Honestly, 75% of people will probably quit watching before the intro, which was so long it makes James Bond intros feel brief. Nonetheless, if you can sit through the various quirks, especially early on, you'll become intrigued and anxiously await the film's conclusion. Lars von Trier truly does a brilliant job.</fullReview>

The description of the movie said two sisters cope differently as a planet approaches earth or something like that. I mean if the director was trying to make a film about a very possible doomsday event in the most unrealistic fashion then they succeeded. It was like everything was so incomplete. After every scene I was like OK what was the point. The landscape and the graphics were amazing, the soundtrack was great, but overall it's just simply lame. I give it two stars simply because of that one lovely scene with Kirsten Dunst posing by the riverbank. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I took a test in Existentialism. I left all the answers blank and got 100." &#x2015; Woody Allen Existentialism 101: Life sucks and then you die, life has no meaning beyond that which you give it, there is no soul, Santa isn't real, the Self is a mechanistically programmed fiction, all desires are borrowed, organised religion is a sham, hard free-will is a myth, chaos reigns, indeterminism does not preclude patterns, God is dead, Tupac is alive, humans are irrational, man tends to be "rational" only within the confines of irrational systems, vegetables are good, overfishing is bad, existential loneliness is an unavoidable condition of humanity, man is both weaker and more powerful than he realises, there is no afterlife, size matters, everybody dies and nobody knows who shot Biggie.The above is two hundreds years of existentialist philosophy condensed to one paragraph. Above that is the same in one line. Both are also Lars Von Trier's "Melancholia" without the pretence. Set shortly prior to the annihilation of mankind ? Earth is about to collide with a planet called Melancholia (literally destroyed by sadness) ? the film stars Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg as Justine and Claire, two sisters."Melancholia's" first act finds Justine on the happiest day of her life. She's at a wedding party with friends, co-workers and family. The luminous star of Antares ("the creator of prosperity") hangs symbolically over her head. Everything is wonderful, until Justine abruptly (and arbitrarily) loses faith in all social constructs. Henceforth she embraces a more dour, existential, even nihilistic view of existence. "The earth is evil," Justine says. Extricating herself from a humanity which she rightly views as shared psychosis, the poor girl hops on a horse, rides off into the night and has sex with a co-worker. After giving the middle finger to family, marriage, the church, her job and various other bourgeois absurdities, Justine slips further into depression. At this point Antares disappears, covered up, one character tells us, by a super-planet called Melancholia. Yes, Lars Von Trier literally has a planet called Happiness blotted out by a planet called Melancholia. Deleted scenes reportedly include the gas giant Xanax and the moon of Prozac."Nothing is more modern than total sickness," philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche would write. "The trust in life is gone: life itself has become a problem!" Existentialist Albert Camus would call suicide "the only serious philosophical problem" and Jean-Paul Satre would dub existential depression "the nausea". In "Melancholia", this nausea becomes a giant pulsating planet, Von Trier's metaphor for an all-consuming, at times destructive psychological state."Melancholia's" second half sees Justine associated with the natural world, urinating on golf courses, bathing in mud or ensnared by vines. Like Werner Herzog, Von Trier associates philosophical pessimism with a nature that is base and uncaring. Attempting to nurse Justine back to health is Claire, whose husband John views the approaching planet Melancholia with scientific optimism. To John (a parody of those who show irrational faith in science and "progress"), there is wonder, grandeur, even a kind of atheistic spirituality, in what Justine views to be a malevolent universe. Such optimism doesn't last. John succumbs to suicide. Justine, meanwhile, calmly accepts death. Studies themselves show that those who "suffer" from what psychologists call "depressive realism" or "pessimistic realism", tend to cope with death and other extreme situations with calmness and rationality."Melancholia" ends with Justine's new-found "spiritualism" imparted unto her sister Claire. As Nietzsche himself once said: "life and love in the face of philosophical awareness are still possible, one just lives and loves differently". The duo thus sit in a tent and await termination with a mixture of serenity, compassion and love. Before this, the duo have a typical atheist vs creationist discussion. "Life after earth?" Claire asks. "There isn't any," Justine says. "How do you know?" Claire challenges. "I know things," Justine quips with atheistic aloofness, "we're alone." Lars Von Trier's "Melancholia" is sincere ? a recent crisis of faith led to him rejecting religion ? but also bad art. Von Trier treats as being profound discoveries that greater artists tend to figure out and work through in their late teens or early 20s. The existential crises of a fifty year old in the 21st century aren't "profound", just a little obnoxious, especially when dressed up in hokey visuals and blunt metaphors; "Melancholia" looks like a cross between a Sartre lecture and a Lexus commercial, and sounds like remix of Wagner and Lady Gaga. Ironically, Von Trier criticises Justine's early life, but his own aesthetic epitomises the very corporate advertisements she once worked on.Cinema's great modernists have themselves long pushed beyond "Melancholia's" existential musings, lending "Melancholia" a derivative feel. The film's apocalypse, themes and hysterical women recalls Bergman's "Shame", "Passion", "Through a Glass Darkly, "Winter Light", "Cries and Whispers", Vinterberg's "The Celebration" and Tarkovsky's "Sacrifice". Elsewhere Von Trier cribs his slow motion falling horses from Tarkovsky's "Andrei Rublev", and the "Hunters in the Snow" painting from "Stalker". We then have Dreyer's filmography, Herzog's, Antonioni's ("Red Desert" in particular), Tarr, Bresson, Bunuel or the more pulpy existential movies of Nicholas Ray and Minnelli. Modernism (the old modernist adage, "if nothing matters, everything does") has itself moved past early 20th century existentialism to a giant "so what next?". If God's not saving us, how can we help ourselves and others? Such questions always lead back to social systems, politics, economics, history, cultural values and issues of power, the chief obsessions of late post-war modernists (Godard, Kubrick, Loach, Fassbinder etc). These artists have an unmistakable "existential attitude", yet spend no time mulling about Gods. Most remain unmistakably atheistic, even when dealing with religious longings (Godard's "Hail Mary", Kubrick's "2001", Passolini's "Gospel" etc).5/10 ? See "Vanishing on 7th Street" and "Ghost World".</fullReview>

From 8 minutes of 'imagery' from the outset to the film being in two parts, it just smacks of someone trying to be deep but failing. It's dull and no one in it is particularly likable apart from Alexander S character. The two parts are essentially unrelated other than the fact that they involve some of the same people. The first part feels like a lesson in name dropping as you have Udo Kier, John Hurt, Stellan S, etc who are wasted in their roles.

		<shortDescription>About gray woolly yarn clinging to your legs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Melancholia about depression? Of course it is. Of course it is not. Melancholia is a literary topos, and a category of the spirit. The one Albrecht Durer engraved, masterpiece described by Moravia in the incipit of "1934". Depression is just a clinical object. But Justine is never said to be depressed in this movie. And we don't see doctors and pills. Science is not welcome in these kinds of movies. Even better if science is insulted (if you want to learn what a rogue planet is look for a discovery channel documentary). Thank you Von Trier for not making a movie about your depression, or about rogue planets! Nietzsche fell in love with Wagner watching Tristan und Isolde, whose prelude makes this movie float in the air (and, by the way, Nietzsche only pretended to be crazy). Listening to the prelude of Tristan und Isolde will always make me think of this movie and Kirsten Dunst (and maybe Nietzsche), just as Shubert's trio op. 100 andante con moto always makes me think of Barry Lyndon. This is already a great achievement. Justine is not depressed, she just sees things, and she's trudging through this gray woolly yarn. It's clinging to her legs. Very heavy to drag along! There is no mother or father to blame for this. I think this is it. Ah, if the shaking in the first part of the movie makes you sick take a pill and keep watching, you don't want to miss the best part, when Melancholia hits Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MELANCHOLIA is a rather slow-moving, very European-flavored drama that is driven more by dialogue and nuance than it is by plot and tension. There is virtually no fast action or violence as we know it here, and it gets a little draggy in places, like a long novel that takes its time with meticulous character development. Anyone who finds this description unappealing should probably avoid this one.Having said that, I found the acting--particularly that of the central "depressive" characters played by Dunst, Gainsbourg, and the young Cameron Spurr--quite outstanding. Combined with the painstaking cinematography and slow-burning but solid storyline, the result is a film that is amazing on many levels. MELANCHOLIA is a serious comedy that is different without being deliberately weird.Part I concerns itself with Justine (Dunst)'s wedding party at the lavish estate of her sister Claire (Gainsbourg). I won't tell you what happens, but some interesting stuff does. There is also finely embedded satire on the corporate world and familiar relations, with special focus on snooty rich people. The characters are all silly in their own special ways, making for a very fine human comedy.Part II is told from the point of view of Claire. A character who was quite dislikeable in Part I is humanized here. Claire's public rich girl front is believably gone, and the two sisters, apparently complete opposites in Part I, are shown to be very much alike. On this note, the theme in the title becomes evident. Claire's son Leo (Spurr) becomes a kindred spirit with his mother and aunt as the rogue planet Melancholia (to be taken literally, metaphorically, or both) approaches Earth. Once again, some intriguing stuff happens, ending with a climax that is predictable but apropos.</fullReview>

In the first half of the movie it is evident that the world will soon be impaled by a rogue planet but this seems to be only a minor problem when it comes to the after-wedding endeavors of a melancholic newlywed. It seems she has many problems to deal with herself. The second half of the movie is when the bride becomes indifferent to her problems and the true problem, the end of the world, becomes all the more evident.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've got no right to bitch if you didn't like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, I've got to give writer/director Lars von Trier credit for being upfront with viewers. He kicks off Melancholia with a long, wordless montage of music and imagery which previews all that is to follow. If you sit through the film after that prologue, you've got no right to complain. Von Trier does everything but send up smoke signals to indicate that this movie is going to be slow, fancily stylized and plotted like a shambling zombie. To some, that sort of thing is the cat's pajamas. To others, they'd rather undergo a root canal with no anesthesia. Whichever you are, you'll know right away whether to keep watching.Let me be as honest as von Trier. I only rented this flick to see Kirsten Dunst topless. As spectacular as she is, however, Dunst's bosom isn't the only appealing thing about Melancholia. I am not one who is usually a fan of this kind of ostentatious art house tedium, where being excessively quiet and taking forever to so or say anything is supposed to be a mark of quality. I believe any artistic endeavor should engage the audience, not demand its tolerance or indulgence. I don't need something to explode every 5 minutes but I'm also not impressed with a filmmaker trying to impress me with how deep and subtle he thinks he is. So if it weren't for Dunst's bare boobs, I'm one of those people who have turned this film off after the first 5 minutes.I'm glad, though, that the lure of Dunst's nudity kept me watching. Don't get me wrong. I didn't enjoy the rest of Melancholia and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone not already a fan of this type of cinema, but the visuals offered up are beautiful and while von Trier's storytelling could be accused of pretension, it's never aggravating. Throw in Dunst's nakedness and I'm glad I experienced this thing, though it felt more like I was watching von Trier trying to paint or sculpt through instead of making a movie.If you're wondering about the dubious plot, it's like a sci-fi double feature. The first half is about Justine (Dunst), a woman who suffers from clinical depression in an alternate reality where psychiatry and psychology never existed and we watch as her medical condition destroys her wedding night. The second half is about Justine and her sister's (Charlotee Gainsbourg) family loitering around an English estate as a rogue planet approaches Earth.Melancholia isn't for everyone and doesn't offer much, besides Dunst's breasts, for anyone. But if your significant other wants to subject you to some art house cinema, you could do a lot worse than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not at all religious but there is something in the Bible about hiding one's light under a bushel. When Lars von Trier burst on the scene with The Element of Crime, one immediately knew that there was a talent there. From there it has, for me, been a largely downward spiral - plumbing the real depths with the Dogme debacles.But, in this film, the opening sequences and the closing one, there is evidence enough the the talent is still there, but the judgement as to how to use it has vanished.While I am happy to acknowledge that the spectator must, in a complex film, put in effort to obtain the 'hidden gems', in the bulk of this film, one sadly concludes that the hidden gems are not there, it is all dross without meaning or subtlety of any kind.Film directors like von Trier should realise that they have made a contract with the viewer: (s)he will sit in a darkened room and stare at a screen, and the film maker will provide an experience BETTER than that of the previous two hours in the person's life. This film fails the test.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched the first part of this unique film, I was tempted to take it off the player. I hated the shallow and unbelievable characters preening before me in the most unbelievable wedding sequence I have ever seen. The bride has problems, so she has sex with someone other than her new husband in the middle of a golf course during the reception! Yeah, I found that totally honest! The new husband then goes packing and the entire wedding is found to be a sham. This first part goes on for exactly half of the film. The second half almost redeems the first half by going into detail about the end of the world as we know it, prompted by a rogue planet crashing into the earth. This part was much more involving and more interesting, but there were a few questions I had about this part as well. The actions of the husband who discovers the truth about what is to happen are puzzling at best. The depressed woman from the first half is now suddenly serene and accepting about what is transpiring and here sensible sister is now losing it. These are flawed characters, but I suppose that is what the director is trying to show us. Physically, the film is beautiful to look at and to hear. Gorgeous photography and a soundtrack taken largely from Wagner are pluses to be savored. All in all, I found this to be a thought provoking film, with good performances, and if this dosen't stimulate a discussion between those who see it, I don't know what will. Despite my loathing of the first half, when it was over I found it to be curiously satisfying. If you watch this, be prepared to think.</fullReview>

The overture is absolutely stunning, the tensions at the wedding magnificently told and Justines melancholic mood was felt deep inside. Until the end of the wedding, when Justine had sex with the boy and her father didn't stay. From that moment the movie got away from me. Instead of the personal struggle it became more a tension, will Melancholia hit or not? And irrelevant scene's came in, like the husband carrying supplies into the stable. The movie got slow and wasn't able to keep the same level as the start. Now the photography was amazing, almost every shot was in some way special, as we could expect from Lars von Trier. Even when the story lost me, I was still often blown away by beautiful imagery. But imagery doesn't carry a movie alone.Btw: I didn't care that the geophysics were ridiculous, they were irrelevant for the storyline</fullReview>

That jerky or moving camera affect and the long dramatic still outside shots are just annoying like the Blair Witch Project that started all this crappy film making in the first place.This is a film for the film buffs who like artsy films.

It's also a shocking film because you are placed into their story without knowing these characters and their back stories. Many times I wanted to turn it off and change the channel, but I kept thinking I was waiting for the epic moment, a continuation of the opening scene, so I kept watching despite my dislike of everything going on in the film.The structure of the film is what makes it so difficult to get into and like. I don't see the point into splitting perspectives. When the switch occurred, it felt like a different movie. It was disjointed and unsettling, which may have been the desired effect.The ending was a true disappointment, and I felt the opening scene should have been placed at the end of the film. The two perspectives could have been blended together. There's no reason to not be privy to both women's perspectives simultaneously.I will say Dunst's performance was beautiful and perhaps the only saving grace to such a dreadful film. It's a more grown up version of her character from Crazy/Beautiful.</fullReview>

This movie is do different, it can almost remain uncategorized. But this is a good thing. Why you might ask? Well, personally, I think that the mixture of cinema and innovativeness of this kind, shouldn't be put in the same basket as all of those "wanna be" good movies. But what about the down side of Melancholia, the reader might ask. Well, this ought to be simple: excess of originality. Trier is trying so hard to be original, that the movie is getting close to being mundane. Despite that, Melancholia is a movie definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's greatest weakness is its failure to establish psychologically consistent, credible characters. More than once, the dialogue and the acting seem to establish something about a character, and that character development is then contradicted, out of the blue, by the character's actions, actions that make no sense. Without giving spoilers, it can be said that various characters' (Justine, her nephew, Justine's brother-in-law) actions are not psychologically consistent or realistic.Furthermore, and adding to the disappointment, the cinematography is far less impressive than in Antichrist, for example - indeed, the acting's calibre, which is Melancholia's strong point, isn't enough to save this film. The problems with character development made it impossible for me to become invested in the characters, and without that, the film can have little impact, despite the tragedy it deals with.</fullReview>

Music should draw you into the film but in this case it kept pushing me away. The use of Wagner's Overture to Tristan und Isolde throughout the film is obnoxious. Not that i don't like the music by itself. I absolutely love Wagner's Overture. However, in this context it was wrong, over dramatic and honestly, silly at times. Glorified temp track, if you ask me.

		<shortDescription>A dark, surreal, though captivating and evocative, doomsday film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know that feeling. The films starts, it's confusing, irritating and you consider giving up already. I imagine much of the audience watching Melancholia at the Cannes Film Festival felt that way. Quirkiness, however, is the staple for director-writer Lars Von Trier. The movie proper begins with Part 1: Justine. Justine (Kirsten Dunst) has just got married to Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd). En route to their wedding reception at her sister's vast countryside manor, they are delayed by the car getting stuck. They arrive in good spirits, carefree and oblivious. Dunst is in her element playing Justine. We have seen similar frivolity from her in Elizabethtown and The Virgin Suicides.Her overwrought sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), having planned the day's proceedings with military precision, greets and berates them for their lateness. Justine is selfish ? she insists on visiting the horses before coming in to the reception and is frequently absent throughout the evening to sleep, bathe and have meaningless sex with a stranger she just met. Claire reminds Justine that she promised not to "make a scene". Not much is given away. Justine is depressed. She is not well. Her utter despair, loneliness and helplessness seep gradually into our bones. While Dunst is a natural playing the happy- go-lucky girl, she struggles to convince us that she is anything more than just self-centred.In an attempt to re-engage with her, Michael presents her with a photograph of an apple orchard. It represents hope and their future together and to cheer her up in moments of despair and loneliness. She gratefully accepts and cherishes it, then discards it on the sofa when she leaves. Suffice to say, she is not focused on him, nor the wedding and it is no surprise when he leaves, suitcase in tow, in the early hours of the morning. Before he leaves, she earnestly states, "Well, what did you expect?" A night for upsets, she insults Jack, her boss, tantamount to resignation. Her parents are a treat worth mention, played by John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling. Her mother is brash and acerbic and speaks out of turn when her crackpot father begins his speech. Hurt and Rampling aren't in the film for long but we see, while withholding somewhat for appearance sake, that they are intensely flawed and the source of much family dysfunction. Part 2 is about Claire. Oh, and the end of the world. Previously depicted as uptight and rigid, we learn she is disturbed. She is nervous and neurotic. And not without reason. A planet, Melancholia, that has been "nestling behind the sun" has somehow steered a course orbiting close to the earth. John, her husband, who is a wealthy landowner, has an apparently intimate understanding of astrophysics with complex telescopic equipment to match. He has repeatedly undertaken complex calculations and assures her that Melancholia will travel close, but not collide with Earth. She doesn't believe him. Charlotte Gainsbourg's Claire is finely observed. Her intensity is understated, her nervousness and ticks are at times so minute you might miss them. Her fear is palpable and her biggest is for the safety of her child, her son, Leo. Justine has hit rock bottom with her depression and comes to live with them to recuperate. While John gets extra supplies in ? lamps, fuel, food - should there be a "close call" with Melancholia, Claire is more pessimistic, buying medication that will put them all into a permanent sleep, if required. Justine is resigned to the end of the world. She says it will happen as she "sees things". Is this the source for all her pain and depression? An overwhelming and hypersensitivity to all the world around her? An information overload that she cannot cope with? Is she autistic? She has an inexplicable understanding of numbers, incredulously. The predicted moment of danger arrives, passing by without incident. The rising of the vast Melancholia, the blue planet, in the sky, is truly wonderful to behold. Wonder and excitement turn to panic, however, the following day when John realises something is wrong. Relaxing on the patio, Claire notices John has gone missing and discovers him dead from an overdose in the stables. His suicide is the ultimate selfish act ? he has taken the entire supply of Claire's secret stash. When Claire realises Melancholia will collide she desperately tries to get away, unsuccessfully, with Leo. Where to? She is desperate to protect him. The getaway golf buggy breaks down and she walks back, in the hail and rain, exhausted, carrying Leo. Justine sits on a wall, playfully dangling her legs, watching calmly, indifferently, as her pained sister struggles up the hill. It's painful to watch. Justine and her nephew collect sticks to build a magic cave that will protect them. Leo naively believes they will be safe there. Justine is oddly, peacefully reconciled to their fate. Claire is terrified. They sit, waiting, in the wigwam-like structure and the background hum becomes overwhelmingly loud as the planet nears.The penultimate shot is of the immense blue planet engulfing the horizon. We have a sense of nature being so much bigger than ourselves and that we are small and insignificant to control it. There is no message of hope or seizing the moment, just despair and pointlessness, perhaps a reflection of the mental struggles of Von Trier while he made this film.It is not a feel good film but it is beautifully made and you won't forget it. The images will be seared into your brain, continuing to haunt for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very slow moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming to this movie with such high expectations, perhaps I was always setting myself up for a fall. I very much enjoyed Lars Von Trier's recent movie Antichrist, a film which (whilst not completely original) was certainly a slick, disturbing and thoroughly impressive movie. I'm also a massive fan of Charlotte Gainsbourg, owning all of her music albums as well as a lot of her films. She and Kirsten Dunst often choose very interesting roles and generally I like the movies in which they appear, although there are of course some which don't cut it, and that's where Melancholia comes in...The film begins with a very long drawn out slow motion introduction, with music, visuals and no dialogue whatsoever. I can appreciate the idea behind this style of introduction, but it doesn't seem to work as well as it does in Antichrist and in my opinion comes across as over-stylised filmmaking. Once the film finally does get going (and believe me it takes a while), you start to learn about the characters and their various problems, of which they seem to have many. As interesting as they might've seemed at first, by the end of the movie I really didn't relate to or care much about any of the characters in this film, in fact I thought that the best thing that could happen to them would be a very quick death to put them all out of their misery. Perhaps that's the point of the movie, but I really didn't have any emotional investment in it. To read some of the reviews on here, you'd think that this movie is some sort of masterpiece, but I can only assume those people were watching a different movie. You can read into a film all you like but no matter what you compare it to (mythology etc.) even if it was the intention of the director, if the film isn't any good then it isn't going to matter.Visually the film is very impressive; there's little question that Lars Von Trier knows his stuff and is a talented director. There are some stunning shots and the quick-fire editing style (no doubt borrowed from Nicholas Roeg) does on occasion make a scene that little bit more poignant, although I'm inclined to suggest that it's used a little too much in this film. Technical excellence doesn't make a great movie though, and there are just so many other elements that this film is lacking. I don't often write reviews on here, but sometimes a film bothers me to such an extent that I'll take the time to do so, especially when I think the IMDb rating isn't what I expected. This is just one such movie, where I've found myself feeling totally empty at the end. I suppose you could argue that the film was supposed to make the viewer feel this way, in that they felt the pain of the characters, but that just sounds like an apologist's defence of a poor movie to me. If I really wanted to be depressed then I'd tell someone who hadn't seen the Phantom Menace that it was the best movie ever and then watch the look on their face as George's comedy sci-fi spoof played out (actually that sounds strangely entertaining in a sick sort of way, perhaps that film did leave me genuinely damaged). Some people will like Melancholia, particularly those who buy and own every film a particular director has made (in this case Lars Von Trier fans). I only own what I deem to be excellent or entertaining movies, so it doesn't matter if it's Spielberg, Hitchcock or Lars Von Trier for that matter ? if the movie isn't good then on eBay it goes, and that's where this one is listed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A metaphor for the anxiety of possession.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A work of art does not need to be explained after explanations of its creator concerning the common people and for commercial purposes. The film is something more than a film about depression. It is a testament about the possession and about anxiety and misery that possession causes to regular settled-down people. The illness and life of Justine who has lost everything (husband, job, mental health) opposites Claire's extreme wealth and healthy family life. The peak of her illness comes when Claire tries to bath her (a scene that could not be missed from the film and have been wisely put in by Trier). You feel sad about Justine's situation. Under such extreme difficult circumstances (the violent end of world), everything is changing though. What is considered to be a curse for Justine, turns to be salvation. What is considered to be a blessing for Claire, turns to be the reason of fear and sadness. The loss of possessing is the reason why Claire is suffering at the end. Justine has nothing to lose and at the same time she has only compassion to offer, the only thing she is actually able to offer. And she does: plays with the child and build a suitable place to die. The fact that Justine owns nothing is the reason why she stays calm and accepts her destiny without hysterical behavior. She fits the new environment...perfectly.I hardly remember another film since 2009 making me feel so much. Thank you Mrs. Trier!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, don' worry, be happy ? the end is always near, anyway.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most unusual aspect about this film is the almost eight minute opening sequence, whereby director Lars von Trier allows the viewer to see the essence of the story in a series of super-slo-mo shots of scenes, all set to Wagnerian music. After watching that, you don't need to see the movie at all because you know, up front, it will end in catastrophe. Others, like me, will still want to see it, however.And the reason I did see the whole film is simply this: because I like von Trier's movies; because I was intrigued by the title; and because I wished to savor the visual style and cinematic result, about which I'd read mixed reports.The story is in two parts: first, Justine (as played by Kirsten Dunst); and second, Claire (as played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). They are sisters, Justine the younger, recently married and about to attend a reception for her and her new husband, Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) at a fabulous country estate, all paid for by Claire and her hubby, John (Keifer Sutherland). To fill out the family gathering, we also meet the sisters' father, Dexter (John Hurt) and divorced mother, Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), both of whom provide the only comic relief within an otherwise overwhelmingly depressive visual story.Well, almost only: we also see Tim (Brady Corbett) who dogs Justine throughout the reception festivities to get her latest tag-line for an advertising project required by her boss, Jack (Stellan Skarsgard). Tim does much better than just get Justine's tag-line though ? he gets something beyond his wildest dreams when Justine's melancholic depression is ripped away in a sexual frenzy on a totally bizarre setting - and which maybe is a not-too-subtle joke. It's worth seeing this movie for that alone, I think. Justine's story ends with her explicit rejection of her body corporate and, implicitly, her corporal body ? both of which are riveting, emotional scenes, as you will note when you see this movie.Seamlessly time shifting, the story moves onto the second part, taking Claire's point of view in a sense, as the world waits for the rogue planet, called Melancholia, to perform a very close flyby. Gradually, technology fails as Melancholia gets closer, thus causing more anguish for Claire and her family ? or, perhaps only for Claire who morphs from being a competent, older sister into one who becomes increasingly agitated and uncertain about her future ? er, a very natural feeling, considering the situation. In contrast, Justine acquires an emotional serenity that's unlike her prior behavior. As the story looms to its awful close, Justine's new found strength helps to prepare others for the worst.Obviously, one can debate the symbolic nature of the planet Melancholia as being a metaphor for the destructive power of depression, common to every human and perhaps even some other animals. Unhappily for some, depression is more than just a nuisance. Added all together, one could further argue that the world's population, on balance, is in state of depression most of the time and is, therefore, unbalanced, erratic, moody, and often self-destructive ? much like Justine. Viewers can come to their own conclusions.Visually, the story is spectacularly dazzling, darkly sensuous, brilliantly enthralling and gorgeously colorful as we are thrust into (with hand-held camera) the many delights of the reception and then, later, the changing vista of our planet and Melancholia, as the living end nears. This movie is worth seeing for that also, in my opinion.The performances are up to par, as you would expect from such a cast and under von Trier's direction; though the standout pieces are from the older set - John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsgard. But, the acting load was certainly taken up by Kirsten Dunst who won Best Actress award at Cannes, 2011. And Charlotte Gainsbourg's effort should not be ignored, although she's overshadowed by Dunst.It's not as innovative as Dogville (2003), for example, nor as interesting for me as Europa (1991), and certainly not as disturbing as Anti-Christ (2009). Thematically, depression and associated mental illnesses have been covered in too many movies. However, von Trier's treatment here is an imaginative departure from standard fare and should be rewarded with eight out of ten.That said, this movie is not to everybody's taste, for sure; but I still recommend it for all, except children, to see.As a final thought, I still wonder about von Trier's reason for revealing the essence of the story in the first eight minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A howling critique of how boring wedding ceremonies are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its flaws, Von Trier's previous film ANTICHRIST really resonated with me. Maybe because I have fears of becoming a mother, or maybe it's all those nightmares where I give myself a clitorectomy with children's paper scissors. Anyway, MELANCHOLIA didn't resonate quite as much, outside of reminding me how boring wedding ceremonies are when I'm not drinking. The film might be an accurate representation of clinical depression, but that doesn't make it suddenly artistically valid or interesting, and the dialogue has the leaden quality of a European attempting to replicate American speech (despite the fact that the immediate family here has about 20 different accents). The beginning and ending show some film school flair, but everything in between is sort of like being trapped at the DMV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly don't know if I loved it or hated it..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that (for me) was pretty painful to watch because it was so dreadfully boring during the first half. I stuck it out because I knew the second half would be better and in retrospect, I believe the first half needed to be done the way it did - you start to actually feel what Justine feels after watching the boring and pointless characters in the first half for close to an hour.I do not think this film should be watched by those who already suffer from depression, it will probably only make you feel more hopeless and feed into your already existing depression. However, this is a good film for those of you who don't much think about the meaning of life and who live in a busy, hectic, materialistic world. The only problem, the way the film is presented probably won't attract the people who really should watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightning Review - Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dunst is worthy of the praise, but really it's Gainsbourg who anchors the film and ultimately proves the more gripping of the two sisters. With the wedding in the first half feeling, on occasions, laboured and at times unnecessary, it's the second half that proves to be the more compelling. What the film does exceptionally well is create a sense of place and passing time, and it's this that helps create an almost palpable feeling of impending and inescapable doom as it approaches its climax. Melancholia is an admirably bold, confident effort that deserves praise for doing something different, but I'm not entirely convinced there's quite enough substance to justify some of the film's more outlandish indulgences.www.second-take.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dreamily opening to a captivating and somewhat confusing look into depression and isolation. The undertone of this film lies in the fact that feeling depressed is based on the fact that something does not seem right. There is no Prozac or Lexapro to alter your brain. Melancholia seems to symbolize our current state of viral cyber news of comets, runaway planets, fallen birds, plaques of locust, Brown Dwarfs...strange sounds. Something does not seem right. Kirsten Dunst carried much of the film and Charlotte Gainsbourg was a fine balance of melancholy. Director Lars Von Trier uses his bouncy camera shoots that may cause irritation with some of the confusing moments such as a night out on a Golf Course but then slows down to moments of transcendence like the nude scene under the light of Melancholia, a runaway planet that is more of a parable to all our endings. Isolation on an English Estate. Beautiful and haunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening of the film immediately drew me in, and opened the door for so many questions as to what the imagery meant. Now some may think it is simply a slow motion experience of what is going to happen in the story throughout the film. I for one think it is much more complex than that, because I don't think Lars would have left each scene on the screen for as long as he did. The images move at such a slow speed it took me till about the 3rd scene to figure out they were actually moving. In a way they look like paintings or almost foggy pictures, the way the opening sequence was filmed was very unique, and hypnotizing experience. Whether each individual scene had its own meaning, I guess that is for us the viewer to decide, and maybe there is not clear cut answer, but a definite second viewing is a must for this film. After the spectacular introduction, the story begins and we are at the wedding of Justine. On the surface it seems that Justine is as happy as can be, and should be; after all it is her wedding day. The day all girls dream of, but not long after arriving she starts to struggle to remain happy, and not because she doesn't love her husband anymore, or that she hates the wedding her sister and brother-in-law paid for, it is something much lager than that, Melancholia. Melancholia is a planet that is as scientists call it a "fly-by" planet, as it is orbiting right past us, and is coming close enough that it is going to harm earth, or may even crash into it. Now unlike most apocalyptic films instead of seeing the end of earth from a global perspective, this film solely focuses on how this catastrophe is affecting this family. Looking back it almost seems as if no one else in the world knows about Melancholia, because we see no other reactions from anyone but Justine, Claire, Tim, and Leo. The rest of the film was just as beautiful as the beginning, and at some points, especially the scenes with Melancholia in view. Those scenes were what made this such a great sci-fi film because it actually brought space to us, much like Another Earth did. In both of the films we have our main characters obsessed with the idea of space, and spends a lot of the their time on set staring up at the sky. What makes this such a fun experience is we get to pretend and imagine what if this happens to us on earth, and in many ways makes science fiction much more real. Now the only problem I truly had with this film was the script. I don't think it was any of the actors fault in this part because it was not the way they executed their lines but it was what was given to them. For example Alexander Skarsgard's character; he is the wife of the bride in the film and does not play a huge role, but some of what he said was just so cheesy and infantile. I don't know if this was on purpose, I'm assuming it was but I can't figure out why his character was supposed to be like this. Some of the dialogue reminded of the script in Drive, some of the scenes were just so awkward, but unlike Drive that sort of dialogue did not fit well in those scenes. It also happens quite often with the child in the film, and even though he has a little kid, I think it went a little over the top and almost exaggerating the child's language.Before seeing this film and discussing it with others who had seen it, those who liked and disliked it, but no matter their opinion the majority always mentioned the ending. So of course the build up to the ending pretty suspenseful, even though I knew what was going to happen since it is shown in the first 20 minutes. But I was more curious as to how Lars von Trier was going to execute it. Now if you have not seen the film you may want to stop here because I'm not sure what people may consider spoilers in this film because we know the ending from the beginning. What made the ending so unique though was the way Melancholia crashed into earth. The main focus of the film was how Melancholia was tearing apart this family, so of course we see Melancholia not destroying earth, but it seems as if the planet is crashing solely in their backyard, focusing only on the destruction of this family, as the whole film did up until this point. The ending also resolved the problems between the sisters as best as it could, since the world did just end, and it gave the child a peaceful conclusion, and although in reality this would have been a much more catastrophic event, the last 30 seconds were gorgeous, but at the same time very eerie when thinking about putting yourself in that situation. The whole idea of having this family being the only ones worrying about the end of the earth, makes it easier to imagine how we as individuals would handle this situation. I think when films make view the end of the earth from a bigger picture it takes away the reality of the situation, and makes it simply what it is, a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The banality of Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's said that mental illness is a disease of self-involvement. Von Trier's film shows neurotic self-involvement in full force as characters wrestle for the spotlight and drag their friends and loved ones into the gravitational pull of madness. But unlike the madness of the rogue planet, Melancholia, which is fast approaching Earth in an apocalyptic "dance of death", the actions on the ground are strictly high school drama club. Bitter exes loudly snipe at a celebratory toast. An overbearing boss throws a tantrum and spoils a garden party. A spaced-out bride sneaks away from her adoring groom for seedy sex on a golf course. The protagonist, Justine, suffers from debilitating (and apparently, untreated) depression that requires everybody in her life to play nursemaid, rescuing her, providing for her basic needs, and covering for her and she screws up. In turn, she exploits or abandons her caretakers, drives away her loving husband, and torments her devoted, fragile sister who stays close in spite of being devalued and sometimes degraded. These characters behave like the rogue planet itself?they take odd turns, they defy logic, they make clunky entrances and exits, including an inexplicable and unconvincing suicide conveniently timed to allow Justine's madness to rage on. And this is the where the lush Melancholia reveals its shallow roots. Von Trier's screenplay seems less of a coherent narrative and more of a scheme to showcase his misanthropy. It wasn't enough to create a beautiful world and then doom it to destruction, Von Trier also had to populate it with vapid, hopeless characters who could never transform or transcend their conditions and who found meaning only in their petty personal melodramas. In Melancholia, the world conspires to accommodate and validate narcissistic despair. In a final, awkward plot twist, Justine correctly names the number of beans left in the wedding party's lottery jar, apparently proving her preternatural wisdom that life exists only on the tiny and doomed planet Earth. That's the overriding theme of Melancholia?when escape is futile, personal unhappiness isn't enough: you must also color the entire universe with your misery. As the rogue planet makes its final, deadly approach and Justine coldly tells her despairing sister "The earth is evil. We don't need to grieve for it." she proves that, like evil, Melancholia is also banal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Sensory Delight That Misses An Important Human Component</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier, the Danish director, melds both Stanley Kubrick cinematography with Lost in Translation (2003) immersive authenticity and relational dynamics of Margot at the Wedding (2007) along with a darker version of Koyannisqatsi (1983) to create a visually dazzling and acoustically enhanced film experience that in itself provokes intense melancholy. Trier also directs a much more difficult creative endeavor by choosing to use minimal dialogue and depending more on the behavioral performance and metaphysical, non-verbal nuances to communicate the movie's impressions. It's difficult not to be enthralled by the haunting and surrealistic visions that appear at the beginning of the movie with its patient immersive soaking up experience that von Trier has tapped into using the rich unique medium of film. Here, von Trier seems to be following in the footsteps of Andrey Tasrkovskiy's Solaris (1972) with its long non-dialogue sequences and his emphasis on having the visual elements of the movie offer much of the understanding or awareness of the movie.There is a Stanley Kubrick cinematographic approach to this movie suggestive of the influence of Kubrick's own daring as revealed in his last movie as a director, Eyes Wide Shut (1999). In the first part of Melancholia, the audience is again brought into a mysterious world of a well-to-do couple who experience the ordinary but lavish experiences of a wedding and moving the audience voyeuristically further into this world, an emotionally draining angst. Trier's use of glimpses, almost discrete snapshots of details from personalized name places to a delicate simplistic yet elegantly laid food plate creates a sharply focused and carefully sensed sharpness and richness. Von Trier uses hand-held camera shots to emphasize the here and now moment, the immediacy of the experience, the brief zooming shot of Dexter (played by John Hurt) as the father's speech. The role of reality and fantasy is blurred and blended as the notion of all these dramatized but immediate and easily, almost unscripted presentations are captured by the almost feasible belief (however unlikely, considering the eye behind the camera) that many of these shots emerging off the movie screen could just of been as easily captured by most audiences members themselves with a quality digital video camera. Nevertheless, other movies in a variety of movie genres have lately incorporated this more gritty, raw cinematography to great effect, including: Winter's Bone (2010); The Wrestler (2008); United 93 (2006), Jarhead (2005), Passion of the Christ (2004), and The Company (2003).The director adds a background rumble, much like the old use of the ticking clock in black and white melodrama movies. There is an underlying thunder that pervades the background and thus the characters themselves and the setting of the scene of immense power and inevitability. There are so many varied and changing emotional dispositions incorporated into the script of Melancholia of Sutherland, of both Justine and Claire that seem to capture a wealth of humanity?from insanity, to hate, to fear, to sympathy, to compassion? so fragile and yet so commanding in their totality. There are reassurances, hopes, and terrors, of dashed dreams and expectations. The climax of the movie moves forward in a fundamental, tide of weighty unspoken millions of tons of an alien planet ? an inexorable and almost tangible, haunting presence. There is the ruffling of the wind, the primitive wood and wire measuring device, nature almost overwhelming in its insistence to dominate the human presence and the frantic and frazzled and then the sudden absence of Sutherland's commanding, rational, and secure foundation on which to experience reality. In all this loneliness, there's a strange absence of servants, help that had earlier been included in the movie and over time their disappearance seems unexplained and uncomfortably missing given rise to either more of the eventual ominous expectations or a confusing and distracting oversight.A persistent weakness of the movie is its lack of adaptive music and sonorous melodies that would better match or lend themselves to the various different scenes in the movie. Melancholy does not come close to reaching the captivating or enhancing effectiveness as musical delight of The Devil Wears Prada (2006); the music of Francis Lai in A Man and A Woman (1966); or even Mark Isham's wonderful fusion of period music in The Cooler (2003). Von Trier relies over-excessively on the movie's musical theme over and over and over again without much variation which in some ways denies the authentic reality of the actual diversity of life on earth, much in the same way von Trier's characters in the movie offered a diversity of personalities, behaviors every within the same characters. The weakest and perhaps a fatal flaw in this movie is the unresolved cinematic conflict between von Trier's focus on immersive authenticity, portraying the richness of the moment and yet also maintaining the authenticity of understanding and comprehension of the motivations and feelings giving rise to the performances occurring on the screen. It appears that von Trier was unable to maintain this balance as the audience almost like the wedding guests are led in a way that doesn't allow for anyone to really penetrate the veil of secrecy, hidden agendas perspectives that carry the plot of the primary characters. The audience is left mostly with amazing visions of the planet melancholia and the surrealistic misty scenes doors and artistic flaming wedding balloons floating lazily into the air, while the actual plot becomes dramatically, mysterious ludicrous sexual outbursts that defy explanation as the marriage itself descends into some black hole, almost swallowed up. Possible comparisons abound between Melancholia and The Tree of Life (2011) and, additional, for me the much more moving, powerful, and personally relevant and connective movie Another Earth (2011). However, such comparisons warrant their own complete commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectionism and selfish interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The overall movie was fairly engaging. despite some awkward camera work and slow pace, the movie was mesmerizing throughout. At the beginning, Justine starts as happy newlywed and she almost came off as the happy cheerful American girl that we all know from bring it on. At the reception, everything starts to fall apart. there was not a single wedding guest that acted nicely. Her boss, her father, her sister, her husband, her mother all acted rudely and made inappropriate speech during the wedding reception. Given that this is "the wedding day", i can understand how disastrous it already was. Having said that, Justine also had an issue. I wasn't thinking much about depression or melancholia up to the second part. I was actually curious as far as why this movie was titled melancholia until they described how the star was approaching the earth. But i thought more about how Justine had issue with imperfection of herself and other people. Depression or melancholia does make sense a bit but that didn't cross my mind during the movie until the second part of the movie. I thought she was hurt by the speech made by the boss that she "couldn't come up with the tagline". and later she went to her study and furiously moved her books around in an effort to design tagline. She wasn't very happy about her husband's speech neither. and same about her father, mother and her father in law. and when she and her husband is in the room and husband tries to make love and Justine refuses, the husband continues to make move. I think she was bothered by his impatience there. I can go on but it seemed that she was not satisfied with the way how people were so imperfect and not even close to being descent human beings. also people were so rude to her. and everything went wrong. when she makes love with the new co-worker, that's when she decided to end it all. Also, everyone only served to meet their own selfish interests. no one seemed to care or love anyone truly. except the child, the boy. Justine loves him. The boy is innocent. does no wrong. but other than that, almost everyone seemed very selfish. but everything else was beautiful and perfect. the hall, people wearing tuxedos and dresses, the 18 hole golf course, beautiful mansion, all fantastic. but none of those seemed to help when it comes to human relationship and anyone's happiness. Regarding the second part, i agree with many reviewers here. The two sisters makes efforts to resolve their relationship. I can see that depression and melancholia play a huge role there. it seems as people don't really care that huge planet is about to crash onto the earth. to summarize, for the first part, i disagree with many reviewers here and i think it was more about how Justine was dissatisfied with the imperfection of all things including herself and everyone only acted to serve their own selfish interests. I am not saying it can't be about depression but it had more focus on human interaction and how everyone was dissatisfied and disliked each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salvaging My Depressing Weekend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was Friday and I only had 2.5 hours left before I could go home from work. My malaise and ennui were so overwhelming that it scared me to my core. I actually called in sick and went home with virtual moments left in my work week. I have suffered the deepest of depressions my entire life and it is a debilitating thing that can't be described in words alone.I am an avid follower of Von Trier's works for numerous reasons, not the least of which is his struggle to work his way through chronic, recurrent depression. It's difficult to create anything when one is not feeling very well. I read reviews of his work and sometimes I laugh and sometimes I get furious. Von Trier's detractors are bitter and shallow for the most part and it pains me to read the reviews they leave; yet, I still read them. Often, a poor review is the result of plain stone ignorance and when ANY single film has reviews as dramatically mixed as Melancholia...I can't spare a moment as I rush to see it.Anyway...I came home from work on the Friday I mentioned and started the weekend with Wild Strawberries, by Ingmar Bergman (1957). I had never seen it before and was left shaken, deeply moved and introspective. The following day, while cruising IMDb, I came upon the page for "Melancholia" and went at once to the laptop to rent it. It was the perfect segué from the Bergman film.Depression is vaguely treatable and the depressed tend, unwittingly, to draw their family and friends into their apocalyptic orbit. The depressed are prone to "taking hostages". As Von Trier works through his demons, he is sharing his vision with those who understand. He may be socially awkward and his flicks may be imperfect (who is perfect?); however, he may very well be a genius.Like Von Trier, I'm a Dane and prone to think in different directions than the status quo. In summation, I do believe this movie gave me a strange sense of Hope. Why? You decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half of a great movie, but overwrought rather than compelling at start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is two movies. It's in two parts, and it essentially has two plots that are tangentially related. Viewed as a whole, it feels incomplete; when each part is viewed separately, one part seems much more relatable and tangible than the other. It is at times esoteric and full of deep meaning, and it features some interesting performances by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Since it is directed by Lars von Trier, it will as a matter of course not be for all tastes. The first chapter is named after Dunst's character, Justine. The scene is a wedding and reception at a secluded mansion. Justine is getting married to Michael, and the mansion is owned by Justine's sister and brother in law. It is a lavish affair, but Justine becomes more and more morose as the evening progresses. We're not sure exactly why, and it's not evident she knows, either, but in any event she is quickly a psychological wreck, sometimes disappearing before major events as the cake cutting and dinner eating. It's obvious Justine feels she's making a mistake, but she's unable to articulate why. Only her sister Claire (Gainsbourg) attempts to help her, as nearly everyone else seems much more absorbed in themselves than in the happiness of the bride.Near the end of the chapter - not a spoiler - Justine notices that a star that her brother in law John (Kiefer Sutherland) had pointed out before, Antarer, is missing from its constellation. An oddity, to be sure. That leads us to the second chapter, which is devoted to Claire and takes place some time after the reception. The reason for the quick disappearance of Antares (a red giant some 1000 light years from Earth) is noted - a heretofore unknown planet, hiding behind the Sun, had briefly eclipsed Antares. Oh, and it's heading toward Earth. But don't be afraid, says John, who's an amateur astronomer; it'll pass by us harmlessly. The chapter is told from Claire's point of view regarding her apprehension of this planet fly-by and her relationship with Justine. In truth, we get a lot more of the astronomical aspect of the rogue planet (named Melancholia) and its approach to Earth. John and Claire's young son Leo (Cameron Spurr) even constructs a device made of wire that allows the user to determine how quickly Melancholia is moving. The first chapter is about an hour long. In my mind, it could have all been cut. My impression is that it was intended to lay the foundation for the relationship between Justine and Claire, but truthfully it seemed superficial and boring. I knew less about either than I should have, and as the chapter progressed I became a little annoyed at Claire's seemingly selfish behavior. I guess we were supposed to feel sympathy for her - and I did, a little - but without some clarification of why she felt so horribly bummed out, it was tough to be on her side, particularly when she seemed to have misgivings about the wedding right from the first scene. (This may have been explained in a scene late in the movie, but if that was the explanation, it was a lame one.)Images and imagery are both at full throttle here, but this isn't Kubrick's 2001. The opening scene, showing the slow-motion destruction of planets colliding is interesting to look at but drags on for more than seven minutes. It's arty and portentous, but it's tough to get through. After that we have myriad interactions with unpleasant characters - except for Justine and Leo, and that's about it. By then I was so tired of Justine's mumblings and attitude - even as I sympathized with her, as she tried to get someone, anyone, to talk to her - that I was looking forward to the second chapter. Claire's chapter, in which she really takes a back seat to the new planet, is the more intriguing of the two. What will happen when Melancholia passes Earth? Scientists say nothing will happen; John concurs. So why is Justine, now a complete depressive, even more withdrawn and reticent, so passive while others fret about Life? She claims to know things (with some pretty floppy evidence to support it), too. I guess that makes her Claire-voyant. I could have resisted that, but I blame von Trier on making his character Know Things.The final scene does have some deep meaning, and it's very well done. In fact, even as it unfolds I had no idea how it was going to end; von Trier could have gone in a couple of directions with equal plausibility. Those ending shots are wondrous to behold and go a long way to making the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few years back, I saw Dogville, and I didn't particularly like that movie of Lars von Trier. But if you like his movies, you will love Melancholia.In the beginning of the movie we are present at a wedding, and the scene feels a bit strange. Justine suffers from a depression, and the wedding is influenced by her state of mind.A planet called Melancholia is nearing planet earth, and it is feared it might hit the earth, or it might just fly by. In this back-line story the family tensions unfold between Justine, her sister (and husband) and her mother.The movie was carefully made, and I would have to qualify it as a great movie within its category. But, that is Lars von Trier's category, and that is not really my cup of tea.So, with respect for its quality, I rate it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been worse...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat grimly through this because it was said to be beautiful to see and I hoped it might get better. I've given it a day to see if it looked better in retrospect. If I could have warned myself, I'd have said, spend those two hours doing anything or nothing rather than watch this film.Any beautiful scenes were marred by the hand-held camera-work that was just dizzying.I think it's the most miserable movie I've ever seen. For pity's sake, if you have the slightest tendency to depression, don't see it. Maybe send your friends - or your enemies - so they can know what depression feels like.There isn't a single character you can empathise with. Justine (Dunst), presumably the most sympathetic character, having kept her wedding guests waiting two hours, keeps them waiting even longer to go and say hello to - a horse! Almost everyone at the wedding behaves appallingly. Justine's brother-in-law John even commits suicide selfishly, eating everyone else's pills. (Though there is little point in suicide: the planet will do it all quickly enough.) The husband, Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) and the little boy are harmless, but ciphers.They don't live in a world, with media, governments, people. It's all about them.The other story, just the end of the Earth, is hackwork. Trier has sacrificed all astronomical and anthropological sense for empty symbolism. John is an astronomer who works out the orbits of planets on paper with a pen. (There is an internet and Google, but "Melancholia" gets only 3 million hits, many about the condition, not the planet that's going to kill everybody.) They are reduced to looking through a handmade loop of wire to figure out if the planet is coming or going. The proposed "Dance of Death" orbit of Melancholia looks as if it is affected by air-resistance. The electrical discharge from Justine's fingertips and the power poles was caused by what? Or if it was symbolic, symbolic of what? Even the last moments were hackwork. The shockwaves I could buy, but fire? What was burning? What finally killed it for me was the abuse of Wagner (who is hard to abuse). The prelude to Tristan und Isolde was written for a particular, quite well-known context. Trier has ripped it out and pasted it over a completely different one. I don't know how many times it got played right through, but at least three, and much of it was used on several more occasions.How could it have been worse? Well, I guess the whole UNIVERSE could have ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent ending, but doesn't make up for the slow and convoluted beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie after reading some of the reviews. It was a very slow start. Character development was very weak. You get the gist of each person, but not enough to relate to them or them in the movie itself. Some characters you'd think would be there for much of the movie, end up leaving, with no defining reason. Or whatever path the writer decided them to take was so vague, you wonder what the point was for them to be in there in the first place. Other than filling in voids. You start to get the feeling that they contribute to the main characters, but by the time they are gone, you realize they didn't. That's just the secondary characters. The main character was extremely annoying for the first two thirds of the movie. Her depressed state became yours. I literally was getting depressed just watching her. Don't know if that was the point, but she made no sense to the story line. The only time she made any relevance was near the end. A little too late. The remaining characters till the end seemed like they were just trying to hold the movie until Dunst's character came into her own. Characters play a huge part for me in movies. Sutherland was OK, but the rest...I felt like bitch slapping all of them to common sense. They were like a family reunion that you didn't get along with, all sauced up on booze, and you were the only sane sober person. Nothing and no one made sense till closer to the end. Don't waste your time watching this, unless you are a glutton for punishment, that you are willing to brave it till the last 20-30 min.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lars von Trier's Melancholia is a stupendium.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier's Melancholia is a stupendium. It is divided into two parts: 'Justine', where the melancholic Kirsten Dunst fails to cut through her cardboard existence at her own wedding reception; and 'Claire' told from the point of view of her sister, Charlotte Gainsbourg, who has trouble dealing with the threat of a recently discovered planet, Melancholia, that, in three days time, either promises the greatest show on earth as a 'fly by' or the end of this pointless world as we know it by smacking bang into us. If Justine is 'depression', Claire is her sibling syndrome of modern existence, 'anxiety'. While we identify easily with her growing panic, given the circumstances, the more meaningful aspects of our lives are made to seem just as empty in part one and we share Justine's struggle to make any sense out of the faceless guests, the interminable schedule of the reception, her new husband. David Stratton hates the hand held camera, but in this film it has two important purposes: first it makes us feel Justine's disassociation in part one as well as Claire's growing panic and all out terror in part two; secondly, it distracts us from becoming immersed in the story of the film. Von Trier consistently reminds us that this is a film and the characters are acting out an imagined scenario, exploring concepts that are abstracted to a degree, which saves the film from being a beautiful but ultimately silly disaster movie. Is this an allegorical tale about how we are being obliterated by our collective empty and anxious existences manifesting as a giant planet crashing into earth? Or is it a genuine exploration of how a mere human being can come to terms with the surety of his or her own personal annihilation? It doesn't really matter. Melancholia treads the finer lines of meaning in a way that only film can do and that this film does so well: through symbolic visual imagery. In the prelude, a woman stands in mediation, surrender or exultation while dead birds fall around her. A mother carrying her son struggles over a golf green, sinking to her knees at each step as the ground ceases to support her: someone's nightmare, a premonition or their last memory on earth? A black horse collapses in exquisite slow motion to the ground. Has it been shot, drugged or is it simply sitting down? The film reel does not play out to the end of each scenario and so von Trier keeps us in suspended wonderment. Common day notions of space and time disintegrate to a booming orchestral sound track that out Kubriks Kubrick as two planets horribly, magnificently collide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrayal of depression as escape and freedom from middle-class shallowness and hypocrisy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Melancholia", is Lars von Trier's beautifully realised contribution to the sci-fi apocalyptic fantasy / black comedy movie genre. The film continues ideas from "Antichrist" concerning the nature of the universe and humankind's insignificance within an indifferent cosmos: all the knowledge, science and religious faith we can muster won't help us solve our own problems and certainly won't help us survive a collision with a stray extra-solar planet. The only thing we can do is face the certainty of annihilation with the serene and passive calmness born of depression and lack of hope: a despairing message, yes, but one that's perhaps more reasonable than trusting in a non-existent God or belief systems that so far haven't delivered on their promises of benefitting humans across the Earth.Eight minutes of silent slow-motion visual beauty in which the film's main characters and motifs appear in haunted nature tableaux to the music of Richard Wagner's prelude to the opera "Tristan und Isolde" form the extended introduction. (The music repeats throughout the film to overwrought drama-queen effect.) Allowing for possible inaccuracies and bad science in the collision scene creation ? after all, no-one's ever witnessed anything the same or similar and lived to tell the tale ? I find this perhaps the most gorgeous and poetic summation of the film's concerns.What follows after is a footnote character study of two sisters and how they cope with life and the knowledge that everything that's hit them before which they survived won't help in a Final Judgement. The first half of "Melancholia", labelled "Justine", follows bride Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and new hubby Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) arrive a little too fashionably late for their reception thrown by Justine's sister Clare (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her rich husband John (Kiefer Sutherland). The reception lasts most of the day and into the night but it's not a happy one: Justine's estranged Mum and Dad (Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt) disgrace themselves; Justine's boss (Stellan Skarsg?rd) trails her for advertising copy; and John whines constantly about how much money the reception is costing him and Justine had better be happy and grateful for his generosity. Justine becomes depressed: her parents show no sympathy but remain self- obsessed, her boss attempts to manipulate her and corporate invertebrate Michael is incapable of understanding Justine and her problem family. By the end of the evening and the dawn of a new day, Justine has told off her boss for the prick he is and her parents and new husband have abandoned her.In the second half, titled "Clare", the film targets Clare and John in their reaction to the news of the looming collision between Earth and Melancholia. Justine has descended into full-blown depression. Although John attempts to protect Clare and their son (Cameron Spurr) from the dreadful news about Melancholia, he ends up giving in to despair. Justine accepts the news of Earth's demise with calm and serenity and Clare bounces from helplessness to headless-chook panic and action to fruitless religious "ritual".Apart from Justine herself, delivered by Dunst in a sterling performance in which her blank face masks a million-and-one emotions and thoughts, the acting is cardboard cut-out cartoonish: Rampling redefines snarling bitterness and sarcasm, Hurt sleepwalks through his role as feckless womaniser and Sutherland's character is a mere whingeing rich- boy unable to have a decent civilised conversation with his wife or sister-in-law. Gainsbourg, looking gaunt and nervy, nails the panicky sister down pat. The cinematography, jumpy and amateurish in the style of a home videorecording, throws viewers' attention onto the to-ings and fro-ings of the characters as they grapple with belief and faith in science and the reality of what's happening in the sky. It might be said that the choice of filming style is unfortunate for the subject matter and is ultimately the film's downfall: the camera really should have kept still most of the time and all the characters portrayed in a remote way as though in a diorama setting that shows off Clare and John's palatial home and the surrounding forests and other greenery. Clare and John would then be seen as symbols of a helpless hysterical elite that has no more idea about how to deal with global crises than we plebeians do. As it is, we lose sight of what "Melancholia" is telling us about human society and its self-centredness in a world and universe that demand our attention more than ever, and the film becomes a fussy study of shallow rich people. Depression becomes one character's way of realising that humankind lives in fantasy where having a dream job, a dream spouse and a dream family and home turn out to be unfulfilling and oppressive: depression becomes a kind of escape and freedom.I did not find "Melancholia" at all depressing or pessimistic and there are actually frequent moments of deep black humour throughout the film. The look is beautiful and the themes are deep and worthy of attention; shame that the film is not tighter in its narrative and the camera style is completely wrong for the film's subject and themes. The science could have been a lot better: where are the earthquakes, over-blowing volcanoes and tsunamis that should have been the result of the intense gravitational attractions, what happened to the atmosphere burning up as the planet Melancholia draws near, does Earth get knocked out of its trajectory around the Sun, what about all the conservative politicians and the geologists and engineers in the pay of mining companies trying to convince us all that Melancholia doesn't exist or won't endanger Earth even though the evidence is 99.9% against them? As John says in the film, we should allow for a margin of error.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm...not for everyone (but I was mesmerized)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it is true I was mesmerized throughout this film, and its impact on me, both profoundly disturbing and lovely, still lingers. The cast is fabulous; I always enjoy when the Charlottes (Rampling and Gainsbourg) act in anything. I don't know what to compare with this one- of-a-kind film. The journey of the planet "Melancholia" and the characters' reactions to it, is shown in beautiful, frightening and unforgettable ways. Now that I've praised "Melancholia" I'll say I can't honestly recommend it. For one thing, the overall message is depressing. It's scary, nihilistic and cynical, and unsuitable viewing for sensitive souls prone to nightmares. Who needs to suffer through two+ hours of an overwhelming dose of reality filtered through such a dark lens? If director Lars Von Trier's goal was to share his personal world view, then I feel sorry for him. Following the opening montage of images, my boyfriend Joe said out loud, in a hopeful tone of voice, "The End!" In fact, you can pretty much glean the main gist of the film from its non-verbal prologue. Still, despite all my caveats and complaints, I understand why some folks gave this film ten stars and rave reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Divine Dance of Death (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you walk away shaking from. If you're the kind of viewer that has no idea what that might mean, then I suggest not "wasting your time" watching this; this film was not made for you.This is the kind of film that requires an eye from one filled with empathy and understanding. To understand Justine's behavior in the first part, and to be able to pin-point the passive-aggressiveness and the avoidance of the party-goers, you must have experienced something similar before. Lars Von Trier has quite an eye for true human behavior, and has decided to present it to us in the face of something we cannot imagine: the death of us all.For anyone wondering why we must sit through the first half of the film: Justine is majorly depressed. When you first view the film, you figure that this is all there is at play, just her depression. She is suffering from a major depressive episode at the time of her wedding, and it's not simply because of everyone in attendance projecting their expectations upon her. Every single person at the party is attempting to ignore their imminent doom and put on a happy face for the benefit of others. Justine chooses to do nothing for the benefit of others, because in the face of doom, she begins to lose sympathy and empathy for the people trying to continue on around her. She is being realistic, while her family dramatically tries reconcile their own inter-personal problems, perhaps simply in order to help them ignore the grave reality facing them.It is truly a beautiful display. I praise the first half of this film alone for the unbelievably realistic portrayal of depression, and for the lack of understanding the people around her actually have. They beg her to be happy (for their sakes alone), but she knows she can't be, and she grows weary of entertaining them.The second half of the film presents to us our own actions in a time of doom. "Fight or Flight" washes through Claire, who frantically tries to flee or hide in any fashion she can from the reality looming overhead. Justine accepts her fate, and cannot lie to herself or her sister for the sake of comfort, because no matter how pretty you dress it up, a planet is about to obliterate any semblance of existence.If you have an empathetic and realistic eye, you should watch this film. It's brilliant. If you're a general film-goer who is looking for entertainment, I don't think this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Empty plot and unsolved questions as a result of putting together two spare ideas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writing about a feeling as powerful and as empathetic with most of the humankind is, certainly, an ambitious goal. Watching this film we can expect to connect with the heart of Justine, identify ourselves with her mental state and hope to maybe find answers for us in her character. I won't speak a word about how much I didn't care about Claire, a plain external witness that tells us how difficult it is to breathe without oxygen.Anyway, meeting Justine was one of the most distant relationships I have probably ever had with a "deep character". I'll admit that the beginning had me intrigued with what might be happening in her mind due to the huge consequences it unchained in the wedding. But when the first section ended, leaving me with a thousand open questions about her problems, I then expected them to be answered in the second part. They weren't. In fact, the second part only filled my by then broken bag of problems, with more unrelated questions: Why does this incomprehensible woman has now mind superpowers? Why was she about to die for an illness that flew away in a day, and how is that and her wedding relevant to the end of the world? What did the first part told me that I couldn't actually watch in the second?So when the final fade out came I just couldn't believe how irrelevant the whole movie was to itself excepting the beginning and the end, which, apart from being very visually powerful, are completely unsupported by a plot and therefore made meaningless. This movie tells us nothing but an unresolved woman crying to an audience that cannot understand her, and this being offset with some striking CGI about a world going to an end and a supposedly underlying metaphor under the colliding planet's name that is completely needless of the 95% of the movie to be told.I won't criticize the cinematography, as I respect the camera moves were trying to communicate the anxiety and restlessness of the characters. Though it seemed the camera operator had a dog biting his leg while filming and he left all his Steadicams in Melancholia.Lars Von Trier could have told this movie in a one-line verse of poetry instead of trying to cobble together 2 completely unrelated ideas and last two hours. Or otherwise try to fill the plot with meaning and letting us to understand the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars von Trier's Melancholia is a perfect example for a successful minimalist European narrative cinema which dares to modify the classic 3 act drama with its unexpected experimental ending: Everyone dies. The perfect selection of the cast for both siblings: melancholic Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and down-to-earth Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) helps the audience to understand what kind of battle between the siblings is approaching: a battle between night and day, black and white, evil and good, which is always won by good Claire until she realizes the possibility of collision of two planets, gets anxious and loses the battle to a strong Justine. The noble castle in the middle of nowhere as one only filming location not only contributes to the idea of the loneliness of mankind but also keeps the production costs low. This masterpiece of art with a wisp of sci-fi proves us that good sci-fi -even if it's art-house- always sells.</fullReview>

But that second half was intense and suspenseful.The characters were shallow and I never felt connected, but the way the problem and solution were presented was great. While the characters didn't connect me to the story, the situation did.The story was confusing in the first half, then the second half came and it was a lot clearer. To be honest the movie could have just been the last half and been really good, but the wedding part (which was the first half) ruined it.As always with Lars von Trier there were some pretty good shots. The only problem is that he uses A LOT of hand-held cameras, so most of the scenes have a shaky camera for no reason. This annoyed me.Melancholia was pretty good. If the whole movie was just the second half I would have given it a better score, but the boring first half (that really played no relevance the the good half) made me give it a lower score.Enjoy it at your own risk.

		<shortDescription>A perfect allegory for melancholy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film relies heavily on the film grammar established by Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror; visual, metaphorical and literal. As well as his 1972 Solaris film with a planet representing emotion.If one watches this film literally one would get very little out of it. However look at it as an allegory of the struggles of life and everything just pops into place and it all make obvious senseMy only criticism is the overdone documentary style which was distracting. Otherwise it was a totally engaging experience .My synopses with research and viewingsThe film start s with a series of motifs of virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) (and possibly a homage to Andrei Tarkovsky's the Mirror); the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being tied back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one.Part 1 is of an ideal and perfect wedding that sweeps bride Justine along and which clashes with Justine's fragile world.This act begins with an clumsy, over-sized wedding vehicle unable to negotiate a curve in the road.During the course of the wedding we realise that each of the characters represent a metaphor. These metaphors are developed during the night of the wedding reception. Her brother-in-law represents sacrifice (cost of the wedding) and social conformity. Her dad is hedonistic and selfish therefore unable to connect at a meaningful level with Justine. Her mother (honesty) is brutally; ruthlessly and pathologically honest which gets her thrown out of the wedding. However Justine's sister ,Claire, who represents order urges Justine to dishonestly hide her debilitating melancholy from her bland, gormless, doting husband. (This is highlighted by his wedding speech) and anyway who would be incapable of handling such honesty.Her boss represents ruthless greed and gluttony during the most personal part of the wedding speech he is hustling her to promote a vacuous spiritually empty campaign based on a modern facsimile of Bruegel's The Land of Cockaigne (mythical land of excess) she later opens a book at this picture. During the critical part of the wedding, cake cutting, Justine and her mother independently escape to have bath, to cleanse themselves of the social deception of the wedding. Later again Justine escapes the wedding and whist watching Melancholia's approach to earth squats and urinates on the 18th hole (ultimate success).Her bosses nephew (ambition) is given the opportunity to exploit the opportunity to get the tag line at all costs, to promote his career, a similar task to what Justine was previously so successful at. He is later fired for his failure at absolute ruthlessness. Justine recognising her complicity aggressively resigns. She cannot consummate her wedding with her gormless husband and goes out on a sand trap and copulates with her boss's nephew, a professional kindred spirit. He later suggests due to their similarity they form a business together, Justine curtly declines. Her gormless husband leaves.Part 2 "Claire" deals with Justine's relationship with her sister, Claire It also follows Justine's mental decay and reawakening as the inevitable Melancholia collision approaches.During Justine deepest almost catatonic depression her sister is unable to cleanse her in the bath, expressive of her inability to submit to any more social deception. Justine is so numb that even her favourite dish tastes of ash.Before the reception Justine proudly claims to be only one to ride the Black Horse(id); her brother-in-law under his breath says that he the horse is also loyal to him.As Justine decays her connection to the Black Horse (id) becomes more remote and frustrated. on two occasions the horse refuses to cross a bridge over a river possibly to the non existent 19th hole (limbo) as Justine disintegrates she get more brutal with her frustration with the horse's refusal, finally, mercilessly whipping it to the ground.Justine tells her sister that she has the ability to predict with certainty events such as the number of beans in a bottle and she confident that Melancholia will meet with Earth, this being a good thing as life itself is evil, which from her tortured battle would be valid.The certainty that Melancholia is making its terminal rotation back to earth is at odds with the certainty of a safe fly-by her brother-in law has had, a fact that always been a reality for Justine. On realising his fallibility Justine's brother-in-law the only other person to ride the horse fatally poisons himself in the Black Horses stable the horse calms down. His wife on finding him dead releases the horse to be free. In this adversity Justine becomes the spiritually the strongest person. She has a bath stating that she is now all clean.The sister tries to escape the golf course but the golf cart shuts down on the same bridge frustrating her. She returns to the lodge as the world begins its demiseHer young nephew being scared is reassured by Justine who says that they can be safe in a magic cave something she has promised several times in the film to make. The three sit in the magic cave (a wood tepee) Justine is stoic and strong at the as the world beautifully comes to a catastrophic end, and at one with Melancholia</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy the decadent morbid vision of the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't believe the title. There is no melancholia in this woman on the front page. Don't believe the Ophelia looking front page with Justine floating in water in her wedding dress holding lily-in-the-valley, a whole bunch of them. There is no Ophelia, no suicide by drowning and no flowers floating on top of the water. Justine is not going to go to a nunnery, the nunnery of the dead, at least not what Hamlet and Shakespeare had in mind.You will discover as soon as you get into the film beyond the title page that we are dealing with the end of the world set in parallel with the end of celibacy for Justine. She cannot accept her personal perspective because of what has been announced and is coming: the planet Melancholia is going to ram into the Earth. There cannot be any enjoyment while it lasts because lasting should mean there is no end decreed even before it starts, and obviously there is an imminent announced foreseen end. So the little (though super rich, but the richer the more little) people at that wedding reveal how little they can be while they are forgetting it is one of their very last days. [...]So we are back with Justine, depressed by what is coming, always depressed because of a domineering and vain mother who hated anyone but herself and deserted her daughters to only come back once in a while to insult them. She is also depressed because of the evanescent and always absent father who cannot even find five minutes to have a personal word with his daughter on her wedding day. And she is the creative one who will be able to invent some fable about a magic cave that will create peace and bring quiet to her nephew Leo, her sister Claire and herself for the last fifteen minutes of their life.We are back with Claire who is the sound and safe one in life but also the realist in danger and in a crisis, which makes her buy some poison before the end if it has to come to an end. Like all these people who have their feet well anchored in and not on the earth she is not able to face a real existential crisis in her own life but she is the best empathetic help anyone can find in their own existential crises. And when the end comes it is the sound sister that needs the help of the depressive one. And we have Leo, Claire's son and Justine's nephew. He is a child, innocent and gullible, afraid of nothing because he has never seen death and suffering and torturing and cruelty face to face, one on one, in personal confrontation. When such an event comes he is curious to see it and he believes the soft and smoothening tale of his aunt, Aunt Steelbreaker, who makes him build the skeleton of an Indian Tepee and makes him accept this is a magic cave in which no danger can reach him or anyone with him and he closes his eyes and finds the peace necessary to reach the end of the road without the slightest jolt. He is hypnotized in a way, one of Mars von Trier's favorite device.Here we come across Lars von Trier who has forgotten his provocative and absurd dictum and pronunciamento in his Vow of Chastity that was nothing but a dogmatic fundamentalistic Dogma 95. Everything in this film is fake, unreal, artificial, using all sorts of artifices and special effects including the special effects of the story itself that is supposed to blind the audience and make them believe we are dealing with normal though completely berserk people but berserk because the circumstances are exceptional. And what is so exceptional in it?In 2011 when the world was falling head first in the worst financial crisis since 1929 (that brought Hitler and the Nazis Lars Von Trier loves-hates so much), when the first signs of the debt crisis in Europe were appearing, when the leadership of the USA was at stake everywhere in the world from China to Iraq with the economic defeat in front of the BRICS and with the military defeat in the Middle East, when nothing was improving and everything was getting worse, he came up with the fable of a cosmic end to the Earth and humanity. To make sure we get the message he does not even look at this cosmic destruction from the point of view of more than four people, first by wrapping up some gathering of the super rich in a wedding party that is a total failure but we can always enjoy the wedding cake and forget about the cosmic end coming soon. And then when we cannot avoid that moment we are locked up in a group of four people, cut from the rest of the world with no telephone, no electricity, no means of communication, no servant even, nothing, all alone. A crisis of that type cannot in our world be experienced like that. It would necessarily be experienced as a collective drama, a collective panic, a collective epiphany, maybe even a collective salvation. But there is no reference to the billions of people on the Earth, no reference to any ideology, be it religious or non-religious, philosophical or secular, artistic even or poetic, with hardly ten seconds on Google or some Bling like that for some opportunistic info given to us the audience about this Melancholia.We are manipulated in cold blood and we are not even in any way pushed towards some personal empathy for anyone in the tale, except maybe the horses. The medium is the message and the message is the massage. Good morning, Vietnam, straight from MacLuhan's Global Village on Epsilon One Billion, or is it Antares in Scorpius?

Lars was able to put the music, the motion and the photography together in such a magic way that you really feel the importance of a world end event.The rest is a consumer wedding movie with crappy colors, and a boring German example of family: fighting all the time.Now my question is: in which part of the movie Lars was not there? the wonderful start and end, or all the rest?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Closer to a 9 than a 7, though. The only strike against is the very slow pace which is hard to take and forces more attention on what is not deserving than should be on what is not deserving. In other words some things could have been done better. Dunst is a fine actress without a false note under this direction. Framing is virtually perfect. I love Hurt, Rampling, and all the veteran actors who made the wedding sequence perfection. Why things must drag on though is not apparent. It is very similar to "On the Beach" in idea. But unlike the Beach makes one wait scene after scene for finality. Still I really liked the movie and recommend it, if you have some patience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film disproportionately bad to the number of actual flaws present, thanks to its sheer length and lack of care for anything happening.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is seldom a more frustrating kind of bad film, than one that convinces you you're watching something great in its opening few minutes, and while Lars Von Trier's Meloncholia isn't exactly the strongest example of this, you can't deny a skillfully crafted opening when you see one. It's a sort of slow motion, well shot cluster of abstractions that are strangely cogent enough not to elicit any frustration. It's a mini movie, a visual poem, and a deceitful little trick that draws you too deep into the movie, before the crayon title hits and you're immediately dropped into shaky cam hell. It's hard to figure out what sort of story-telling expectations you should have going into this film. When you watch schlocky home movies as appose to the standard movie-movie, your subconscious is redirected to have different priorities, and so slow pacing and bursts of standard day in day out plot less conversations are a product of absolute reality. Meloncholia is made in such a way, sort of. The camera is erratic, and there are time jumps in which single shots cut to themselves, but the lighting and camera quality are that of a professional movie attempting to capture conventional film reality, and so standards become jumbled. If we're to become complacent with the fact the script dives head first into nowhere fast in an attempt to capture absolute reality, than this same reality is what's causing much of the family dynamics and melodrama to feel overly written and staged, which wouldn't otherwise. Girl with the Dragon Tattoe villain shows up as Dunst's boss to shoe-horn a sub-plot that does nothing but add to this dilemma. The grounded first half is a forshadow of promising things to come, a possibility, given its premise, of an almost surreal shift from gritty to abstract. The entire cast is stellar (well the adults anyways). But a quality ensemble and a vague curiosity can only mask disinterest for so long. As the minutes trudge on, it becomes more and more obvious how bland and underwritten the characters are and how horribly glacial the pacing is. We find out ten minutes, in this 20 minute story stretched to over two hours, that we're headed to the after party of the wedding. We than find out, forty minutes after that, that perhaps she might be depressed and re-thinking her life. Kirsten Dunst is directed to whisper major plot points in some scenes, and I'm simply too disinterested to rewind and listen harder. The film presents the tantalizing promise of meshing gritty reality with the abstract, only to go on far with long with too much real, and not enough abstract. Halfway through, after enduring countless minutes of a wedding longer than anything in the Godfather or Deer Hunter (but not nearly as cool), the screenplay teases and torments the viewer by telling us this was all a waste of time. The central premise, that of a wedding being interrupted by an astral body colliding towards the Earth, is split and separated into two sub premises, rendering the first half utterly pointless and dividing the film into two disconnected halves. The second half, when the setting is focused on the main character's mansion estate, takes complete advantage of its beauty. The lighting, and composition side of the cinematography is top class, and really makes you care for the mansion when the characters are sitting and awaiting their doom. Overall, Meloncholia is the kind of film that's disproportionately bad to the number of actual flaws present, simply because of sheer length, coupled with the lack of care for anything going on. Director Von Trier's film about depression is too niche, and isolates those who haven't experienced the film's themes first hand, forcing them to undergo the effect artificially through its dour, depressing tone. As the slight glimmer of happiness comes with the astral body crashing towards the Earth, I'm reminded of a time where a beautiful woman's naked rear end couldn't salvage Frank Miller's The Spirit. Replace Eva Mendes with Kirsten Dunst, and you've pretty much summed up how little any of this works. 38%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This seemed to me a very emotional yet restrained film about which I really didn't know what to think at first. It left me dissatisfied, perhaps feeling slightly cheated, but also feeling that there was more there than I could quite grasp. I gather from other reviews the film struck a chord with some who have suffered depression: I am, then, lucky to not quite get it, as my down moments are not so absolute.Yet there was an engagement of the senses in the film while at the same time a disengagement of the sense of time and of the sense of reality. This unrealism set in a large venue with so many people had, for me, some resonances of Last Year at Marienbad. There were moments where the flooding with late Classical music and the sight of planetary objects perhaps alluded to the slow dance-like scenes from 2001: A Space Odyssey and there were, no doubt, other allusions I missed. The film maker uses these motifs like colour washes to cast a vague background landscape to the disturbed and disturbing characters and relationships played out in the foreground.I found all of the said characters unsatisfying and irritating which was, of course, the point of them. The script seemed unremarkable. The music I had to turn down when it flooded in so as not to wake the neighbours! Yet the whole was beautifully shot and had a poise that felt pregnant with a meaning I couldn't quite reach.Lars Von Trier remains for me difficult, even irritating, but has shown himself again, with Melancholia, to be consistently interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I freaking hate hand held cameras in movies, they so annoying and the beginning of this movie give me another great reason to hate them. The story to Melancholia is about a new planet appears and threatens to collide with earth, two sisters find their fractured relationship stretched to the breaking point. The director of this movie Lars Von Trier, has been well known for making movies that critic's are mostly split about and he he's also well known for being kicked out of film festivals. Watching Lars Von Trier movies is like a back and forward relationship to me, like at times I will fall in love with his style and find his directing skills kinda neat, but at other times he water downs and drags the film along and will say to myself, "Why did you do that?". I'm not the biggest fan of his work, but I do respect the man for his directing and vision, and how he tells the story, and this movie is no different.Melancholia is one of those films were you sit down and be amazed by the visual's and respect the effort that went into this movie, but it's not the kind of movie that I will be re-watching over and over again, and the movie isn't a fun watch if I have to be honest. This is Art house film, not a blockbuster. Kirsten Dunst performance in this movie was Simply outstanding, groundbreaking and the best I've seen her in that isn't Spider-man or Marle Antoinette. The rest of the did fine too.The directing in this movie is, well do I have to go on about the directing, I think I sum it all up and the beginning about the kind of directing style he is, and yes his style can be off putting at times, with the odd and kind of slow but it's building up to something kind of style that he always users in his movies, but I will not lie I always like seeing it in his films, and in this movie he dose the same and even better. My biggest problem with this movie for me is the character's and the plot holes. The character's in the movie are not that interesting to me, even the main character of the movie is the only one that I found a little bit interesting, but everybody else in the background and supporting character's are pretty dull to watch. The movie has a few plot holes to my surprise and some unexplained things that happened during the film, which I'm fine with movies not giving my answers, and this time the film asks me and the viewers the questions, but this movie to me doesn't do it right like Justine can some how tell the future and nobody brings it up again, it's like the film is saying "She can see the future, just go with it", and to me that was a miss opportunity to show something really interesting about her character.Overall Melancholia is a good looking movie and good film, but the movie does drag at parts and as I said about the dull character's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She's psychotic.. not melancholic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In real life.. knowing what we know about this girl.. most people would not feel sorry for her for being depressed. They'd be running for their lives because she's a loose cannon. If I was the brother-in-law I would never let her anywhere near my kid.Justine comes across as a manipulative self-centered jerk. I would think she was pretending to be depressed in order to use it as an excuse to treat everyone like crap and get away with things. Come on.. just look at some of the thoughtless and mean things she did in just ONE night: 1- Goes to say hi to a horse even though her guests have been waiting for two hours. 2- Disappears in the middle of the reception to take a long bath. 3- Takes the horse (who she later beats) for a ride while everyone is waiting for her. 4- Rejects her new husband and opts to go rape some stranger instead! A non-psychotic human being would not do those things.. depressed or not. She fits the definition perfectly: "Psychopathy is traditionally defined as a personality disorder characterized by enduring antisocial behavior, diminished empathy and remorse, and dis-inhibited or bold behavior."Anyway.. I think the director made her do those crazy things just to keep us entertained. Which worked for me I guess, because I didn't turn it off half way through. But it also rendered his symbolism about depression pretty much meaningless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully depressing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film, but ended up disliking it a bit. The film starts off with puzzling and vague, slow motion artistic shots of the main characters. While initially they don't make sense, as the film progresses they eventually do. The director chooses to layout exactly what happens at the end of the movie in the early moments and it makes enduring the inevitable conclusion really tiresome.This film is about despair, depression the end of the world. Sure, these aren't elements that will make a feel good movie of the year, but it doesn't necessarily mean the film has to be this depressing. I found Dunst character to be confusing at first (initially because you have no idea why she's acting that way) and then really annoying upon learning of her predicament. The wedding based parts of the film are dull and some things just don't make any sense.Sure, the art is beautiful, the slow motion shots are well done and the visual effects really stand out. But it's just all really hopeless. I didn't really find any redeemable qualities of any of the main characters (except maybe Claire) and this just makes the film that much harder to like. Everyone just seems cold and inhuman. There's just very little to be positive or happy about, nothing. If the world is going to end, I'd hope they would be *something* to find solace in. Then again, maybe this is exactly what the director is trying to convey. With all that said, there are some solid performances here. Dunst is the best I think I've ever seen her (not saying much I know, she's not a great actress) but Charlotte Gainsbourg (Claire) is fantastic and I think really steals the show with an Oscar worthy performance. She's the main the reason I might say it's still worth watching.It seems Hollywood always puts out similar versions of a movie at the same time. In this case I'm not sure which one came out first, but for a more interesting dialogue around the possibility other planets and what it could mean for life on Earth (and something a bit more upbeat), I would recommend Another Earth.

		<shortDescription>The end is nigh... Hopefully not for Lars' career.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is a man I admire very much as a director, but not as a person. He may come across as the cuddly and vulnerable Dane in his interviews but this is a self-confessed pervert who makes sick jokes about sympathising with Hitler and a misogynist who had an affair with his very own babysitter. Lars is not a pleasant man. However, his films are often remarkable. They can range from the boringly pretentious (The Idiots) to the emotionally sublime (Dancer in the Dark) but they always provoke a strong reaction and he isn't afraid to push the envelope. I'm please to say that Melancholia is another near-masterpiece from Lars.I reacted to Melancholia in an extremely similar way to the first film in his depression trilogy, Antichrist. When I first saw Antichrist I didn't know what to think really. I found a lot of it boring, yet I was continuously fascinated with it. After it finished, I couldn't get it out of my head and I knew that I wanted to see it again. I know consider it a remarkable horror film and don't find it boring at all on subsequent viewings. Similarly, once Melancholia finished I didn't know if I liked it or not, but I couldn't get it out of my head and I knew that I wanted to see it again.After reading some fascinating analysis' and allowing the film to sink in a bit, I now consider it a thoroughly interesting work of brilliance. I wasn't sure what to expect from Melancholia, but I didn't expect what I got. I knew the film was going to be something pretty amazing from the gorgeous opening. It's reminiscent of the extraordinary prologue to Antichrist as it depicts perfect, artistic shots in slow motion with classical music being played. Many would find it pretentious, and perhaps it is, but I loved it. I was transfixed in a way that is very similar to when I'd watch a David Lynch film. I felt mesmerised by its dream-like quality.The first half of the film focuses on Kirsten Dunst's character, Justine as she trudges through an awkward and stodgy wedding party. It's slow, but I didn't find it boring. I found it fascinating to see how the characters interact. At first glance there's not a lot going on, but if you dig a little deeper there's a lot of important stuff happening to Justine. She's hiding her depression and there's a lot of hints as to what's causing it: Her thoroughly pessimistic mother perhaps? (wonderfully played by Charlotte Rampling) or her father who seems uninterested in her life? The closing scenes to this segment are also quite bizarre and suggest that bigger things are happening here.The second part focuses more on Claire. Charlotte Gainsbourg is again quite brilliant in her role as a woman shaken about the idea of the world ending, but it's Kirsten Dunst who really shines in this part as a crippled depressive who can barely walk. It's a shattering performance and one which I didn't think Kirsten was capable of. It's beautifully shot by Lars and directed with his signature documentary style which makes the catastrophe feel frighteningly real and thought provoking. The film looks truly stunning in blu-ray and I'd recommend paying the extra pounds for it! Melancholia is a slow film, but an interesting one. The second part is especially atmospheric and gorgeously captured. The film's final scenes literally had my heart beating because the sense of panic really leaps off of the screen. The end shot is especially haunting and very symbolic. Essentially the film is saying death is inevitable and there is nothing. It's depressing, yet incredibly interesting. Perhaps the film isn't about the end of the world at all, but instead one huge metaphor for depression. Whatever it's about, I found it fascinating and extremely deep. The acting is superb and the directing and cinematography are even better. It's one which I look forward to revisiting as I think you'll be able to get a lot out of it on second viewing.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow pacing, with manic but very human overtones provided by a cast of characters that are flawed, rich, and real tie you in to a very literary story. They who have written these poor reviews are as deep as a drop of sweat, and just as bitter. You do not need a summary, rather you need to know that the movie elegantly borders on madness.Neuroses, contempt, and the genuine phoniness of people trying to make the best of what should be a celebration of life in spite of all their personal issues is what makes the film strikingly honest. That piece of ourselves we keep hidden away, those relationships that are both strained and intimate, that power of humans to be brutally honest, and unforgivably fake are what take you through the story.The title has nothing to do with the film's theme. It isn't about depression, or being melancholy. It's about something infinitely deeper, and more painful. If you enjoy slow pacing, and the inevitability of the end, and a score that belongs to films akin to 2001, this is your cup of tea. If not, pass, and go watch Michael Bay blow something up. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so thankful to see so many one-review Melancholia haters - people hated it so much they registered just to vent. Also thankful for the humor, which helped to take away some of the hangover nausea and pain - years after watching this piece of Lars turd.Plot is simple really: Out of nowhere after millions of years a solar system planet decides to ignore orbital law and physics and go crash into earth. And so girl with boobs became one annoying bitch and even more conveniently, an indiscriminate whore who rapes Beta male. Shakycam shots of her boobs (yep to Lars those are plot twists). Her sister with lesser boobs also became an annoying crybaby. People are weak and pathetic. Humans and nature deserve to be hated and die die die. Major plot point before all goes to hell: girl bared boobs in contrived unnatural pose. Mother earth and nature went nuts, human beings went berserk. All lives get destroyed in slow-mo. Meaning? Also destroyed in slow-mo.This movie can be summed up by a single still shot of Lars smearing the face of humanity with his bowel matter.Verdict: Lars Von Tier is a third-rate attention seeker, an artless sadist and definitely has no soul nor joy in his life. He obviously harbors contempt for anything that is alive. All he wanted was to have a chance to rub shoulder - nah, boobs with an actress with little talent. But he must shove it in our faces.Those with interest in actress boobs please use Google images instead - it's not worth it trying to find that scene in that turd pretending to be a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there not enough end of the world movies: Worle War Z, Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, etc.? Apparently not, as Lars von Trier has his entry to make us think about death.Justine (Kirsten Dunst) has just been married to Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) and now they are on their way to a lavish party hosted by her older sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) at their luxurious mansion.Daddy (John Hurt)and Mommy(Charlotte Rampling) are there. And things get a little weird. One's drunk, and the other hates marriage. They both show their ass.Justine is just as weird as she walks out of her reception to look at the stars, and takes a bath when it's time to cut the cake. She even leaves the marriage bed to have rough sex with someone else on the golf course. Her actions will eventually lead to a breakdown as everyone is focused on the coming of Melancholia and the end of the world.Death. We should be facing it every day as it looms ever closer, but it takes a catastrophic event to sharpen our senses.Kirsten Dunst was magnificent, and the film was visually and musically stunning.</fullReview>

While I understand it is called Melancholia and you have to expect drama and depression, this was just dull. The main character has zero personality. Her husband may speak 10 lines in the entire film. The settings are too dark ( which sadly match the mood), there is no depth to the dialogue, You have to piece together who the characters are.

		<fullReview>"Melancholia" is not a bad film. It's intriguing in some ways. However, it might possibly have been far better.The story focuses on two sisters, Justine (Kristen Durst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Justine has just been married. She's suffering from melancholia or depression. Claire's husband, Kiefer Sutherland, who feels put upon by having to help Claire with Justine, is paying for a big wedding party. There we meet their divorced and rather unconventional, disengaged, bitter-cynical parents, John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling. Claire has a little boy.There is a planet named Melancholia that is threatening to collide with the earth. Scientists do not know for sure.The story is in two parts, titled Justine and Claire. The first focuses on Justine and her peculiarities, which are best not to reveal. Her story is quite interesting. Claire's story is mainly one of fear that the Melancholia will strike earth and kill everyone. Justine doesn't fear death, plus she is sure that they'll all be killed.Claire more or less patronizes Justine. The sisters have a rocky relationship.One thing that brings the film down is the camera work. I guess it's called a hand-held camera. It shakes a very great deal. It swivels from one person to another so that you notice it. Sometimes it zooms into a face. All of this shakiness detracts greatly and serves no evident purpose. Another thing is that the story seems unfinished or obscure in places. There was no reason to invest certain portions with obscurity and uncertainty. Then another thing is that the approach of Melancholia is not treated with the importance it deserves in Justine's part of the story. In Claire's part, there are too many scenes of her staring at the planet. There is only so much one can take of seeing Ms. Gainsbourg anyway in unflattering poses, jutting jaw, tight-lipped and looking mal-nourished and worn out.The behavior of the two sisters inverts in the two parts. This is intriguing. At first, Claire seems the strong one and Justine the weaker one or fairly daffy. In part 2, Justine seems far more composed and insightful and Claire is falling apart. Kiefer's character is supposed to be caring but insensitive, worried about money and fascinated with science, also protective. He's trying to cope with these two women.It all makes for a fairly interesting film. I think the cast did a good job, but I sense that they may have been confused by the script and its director, and did not quite know what to make of it all themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Esoteric treatise on "life", as viewed by writer-director Lars von Trier, involving sisters Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg, who represent two sides of the same coin. In the first chapter, Dunst is the unsteady, fragile one who makes a mess of her wedding day and winds up inconsolable; in the second, Gainsbourg needs the comforting once a smaller-sized planet, heretofore hidden behind the sun, makes its way on a collision course to Earth. Beautifully filmed by Manuel Alberto Claro, and scored by Kristian Eidnes Andersen (whose arrangements echo Bernard Herrmann, effectively), but otherwise rather interminable. The ladies don't match up well as siblings, and Gainsbourg's vast expanse (a mansion by the sea) seems to have been selected by the filmmaker as an excuse to keep the movie in a vacuum (certainly a well-heeled vacuum!). For thoughtful viewers, a beautiful film to absorb visually, although restlessness with the narrative seeps in sometime after the first hour. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An apocalyptic vanity movie for pretentious viewers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, warning; there are spoilers here.Aside from a visually stunning opening slo-mo scene and a much more stunning nude scene from Kirsten Dunst there is little to recommend in watching this movie. The first half of the movie with the wedding party and Dunst's perennial pouting was so boring it was almost too much to bear. I nearly walked out of the movie halfway through.It looks like trier wanted to do his take on an apocalyptic movie. He forgot one thing, a story! You can't really rely on reviews from the corporate media like the Washington Post and other big-city newspapers because they're afraid of criticizing any director with a foreign name who makes "artistic" films (not movies). As far as this movie goes; "The emperor has no clothes".It's sad to see a talented movie director like Trier trying to peddle a pretentious movie like this to viewers. The first half will bore you to death and the second half is filled with boring people awaiting their fate from a collision with a looming planet. And their "remedy", build a wooden cage from sticks to hide under just before the planet hits. GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the sexism in these reviews. A fascinating two hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot of interesting criticism of this movie, but much more straight sexism it seems. Objections to a characters 'cock-blocking' her husband or sole highlights being the sight of a character naked did more to depress me than this highly charged movie did.In fact, what we get is an all too rare female led cast who approach the subject matter without manifesto or cliché. Instead we are treated to a portrayal of real people, who can be identified as much from their internal world as their actions. A method acting treat for those who wish to safely immerse in the lives of others.If what you want is light-hearted fare, it's true that won't find it here. It's also true that you'll find it by walking through every one of the other doors in your local multiplex, so it is a little unkind to wish to deprive the rest of us of this invisibly crafted work.The tenth star was lost not by the actors or script, both of which revealed their subjects and subject impeccably, but by editing continuity lapses which briefly snapped me back into the room. But this can be taken to be churlish nuancing of an otherwise superb film, worth going the extra mile for. A convincing argument that theatre has no monopoly on the best of performances.That's my bit. Let the misogynistic fight back and juvenile comments about nakedness recommence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In theory this film should be far better than what it actually is. It has a great premise, is shot beautifully, and it features some truly excellent acting, but despite all this the finished work just isn't that good a film.The entire first act (the wedding) is completely redundant and serves no meaningful purpose to the plot - in fact, it doesn't even make any sense when you stop and think about the fact that the bride and groom literally go from infatuated lovers to divorcée's within a matter of hours.And the supposed 'impending doom' of the approaching planet that we are promised in the synopsis doesn't even really make an appearance until the final 15 - 20 minutes of the movie.In the end this film is little more than a fictional snap shot of what would happen if a bunch of over financed, self-obsessed white people were to come face-to-face with an apocalyptic event - and even then it's so one-dimensional that it just doesn't work.I have a sneaking suspicion that a lot of art house cinema fans just couldn't bring themselves to accept that they'd been sold a bill of goods on this movie, so instead they just ordered another latte to quell their nagging doubts, and pretended that this was A-grade cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie is so stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying Melancholia is definitely one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. About 90% of this movie is just waiting... waiting... waiting for ANYTHING to happen, really.I can understand why most of the reviewers enjoyed Melancholia. The movie is visually appealing and some can relate to Justine (Kirsten Dunst), including myself. I just could not shake the urge to scream obscenities at Justine for at least the first hour and a half of the film. Justine is a weak and pathetic human being, wallowing in her own imaginary crap throughout most of the film. And she's an a**hole. The first flaw of the movie was that nobody would ever propose to this idiot. Seriously, after showing up to her own wedding reception 2 hours late (not her fault, the limo couldn't turn the corners through the winding road up to the castle), she proceeds to take a bath during the reception making everyone wait for her and her husband to cut the cake. Who does that? An inconsiderate jerk does that. Then guess what, it gets better. She then leaves her husband after he wants to get it on, and has sex with some other idiot. So that said, she's an even bigger jerk for agreeing to marry her husband in the first place and breaking his heart. Oh yeah, she's also an animal abuser. These are not symptoms of a melancholic. They are, however, clear signs that you need to hang yourself.Now, people who enjoyed this film will probably think I just don't understand her "condition"... Couldn't be further from the truth. I've lived it for half of my life and my deceased wife did as well. We at least had the common decency to treat others in our lives with respect. Justine seems to have no respect for anybody that cares for her.I could definitely go into more detail about the plot but that would be pointless. Don't waste your time with this one. It is a crap sandwich (the beginning and end are decent). Well, at least it wasn't as sick and demented as LVT's last pile of dung, Antichrist. If you haven't seen that one, just watch the South Park episode "The tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs." You'll get the gist of it and you'll have a much more enjoyable experience than watching anything from that anti-semitic douche bag, LVT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something truly bizarre happened while I attempted to watch this movie for the first time using VLC: The frames passed in very slow motion, like a flower blooming in time-elapse but much much slower. And the soundtrack, the Wagner, crept by, phrases elongated, notes blooming, the string resin seemingly playing its own parallel counterpoint, the horns almost atonal...And for twenty minutes I sat there watching it, thinking this is the way it's supposed be, European, experimental, Lars Von Trier on acid. But even so I couldn't fathom why that white limo was taking so long getting around that bend in the beginning and why Kirsten kept smiling, laughing in that white gown. Wasn't just ANY music either, but Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, which is a tale of unrequited love--between siblings!

		<fullReview>I have a horrible suspicion that there's a fundamental deeper meaning behind this film that eluded me. There's the obvious theme of depression(or mental illness), with the first half seeing Dunst's character lose a battle with her demons in an attempt to enjoy her own wedding. Then the second half sees her resulting descent into deep depression following the failed wedding, which sets the scene nicely for the burgeoning collision between Earth and a planet called Melancholia (There's no real explanation as to why this is happening but it's really not that kind of movie and it's right that was avoided completely). I think there must have been more in the mind of Lars Von Trier when he wrote this though. He's gone on record saying the story was inspired by a depressive episode he suffered which made him realise that depressed people deal with stressful situations relatively calmly(A bold if not offensively naive statement in my personal opinion but, hey, perhaps that mirrored his personal experience with depression). However I suspect there's something more behind all this - perhaps a parable about the sham of distraction in modern life which shrouds the stark truth we all secretly know - that we are born and die alone, all is for naught, all turns to dust ... and perhaps something else completely. I couldn't figure it out anyway. Deeper meaning notwithstanding, I really enjoyed this film. The opening sequence was just breathtaking, as were certain others throughout the film. Almost like a Gothic Wes Anderson in parts. There's something about a high-society wedding in a lavish setting that lends itself very well to cinema and that's exploited well in the first half. It kind of grates on you how she's failing to make the most of all this, but I guess that's exactly the point. While it's a very real story playing out, there's always a slightly ethereal, dreamlike quality to the proceedings. For instance, when the wedding goes south, the groom just packs his bags and leaves; the mother/bride just ditching the proceedings and taking a bath; the guy following her round trying to get the "tag line". It's almost like Von Trier wanted it to play out like a bizarre dream that alludes to something else. Just wish I knew what. The second half has less action in terms of people but this is made up for by the suspense created by the approaching planet, Melancholia. Not sure how he did it, but this whole thing really brought me down and I was feeling genuinely uneasy and hopeless at times. I know that sounds ridiculous, but that's how I felt, and that's quite unusual for me when watching a fictitious film. There's something quite powerfully emotive in this calibre of film-making and that combined with the beauty and originality of the cinematography contributed heavily to the 8 out of 10. If I'd understood the deeper meaning, maybe it'd have got 9 or 10.</fullReview>

To his credit, von Trier attempts to avoid this at the start but waiting for the inevitable does drain pace and suspense from Melancholia.Another film made the same year, Another Earth (directed by Mike Cahill), used a similar main device to better advantage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Melancholia is not a perfect film and I can totally understand the polarisation, I found myself very much impressed by it. Some of the dialogue is rather awkward, one or two of the characters sketchy and there are a few ideas that are were introduced and broached but could have been explored more. The pros outweigh the cons though, because it is a ravishing film to look at. The settings are breathtaking, and while the cinematography has a technique that is not going to be everybody's cup of tea Melancholia was an example of its utilisation being effective and somewhat necessary. The music is likewise amazing, Wagner's Tristan and Isolde is one of my favourite pieces and was in sync with the visuals perfectly, very like a symphony on film. The story, while slowly paced, has emotional complexity and the groom's love and affection is done very tenderly. Its hybrid of European art-house and Hollywood sci-fi is very interesting. It is not an easy movie to like and get invested in straight away and does I think need to be seen more than once, but on repeat viewings you get more out of it and is rewarding as a result. The opening sequence is truly arresting and one of the best opening sequences of any film in recent years, while the ending is similarly moving. Lars Von Trier's direction is accomplished and never amateurish, again not for all tastes(I know many people who have a wide ranging taste in film and have never warmed to Von Trier). Other than the visuals and the opening, it was the acting that made the film as good as it was. Kirsten Dunst earned best actress and deservedly for a courageous- and her most meaty, performance. Charlotte Gainsburg is more composed but is a very well-characterised and affecting contrast. John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling as the parents give droll turns, while Udo Kier is appropriately surly. In conclusion, a very well film but understandably polarising. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As some of you might know by now, this is a controversial movie. Not because of what's in it but because of what it means to people. To some it means nothing, to some it means everything.To me it meant everything..For a man with little interest in Kirsten Dunst and even less in the director of the film, i have to say that i am completely stunned. This movie has everything that i have asked for; the mystique, the strong characters, the artistic aura and last but not least: the melancholy.In the movie we get to know two sisters struggling with their emotions while a giant planet is on its way to collide with earth. This is something you cannot guess the first time you see the movie (i really hate that IMDb had it spoiled for some of the people i know). There are some theories about the characters in this movie. Why are they feeling what they are feeling? Is there something more to it? Are they just afraid to die because of the planet coming towards them? Is "Melancholia" doing something to them? Well, i guess that's the beauty of this film-genre; we may never know.The acting is superb in every way, especially from Dunst's side. Since i'm a swede i was also happily surprised by the appearance of Mr. Skarsg?rd in this movie, even though i can't stand his accent (mostly because i can so easily hear he is Swedish, i don't know why but it bugs me). Some may say this movie is complete garbage because of what it has to offer. The story is not very complex and it hasn't got much to offer for the majority of film watchers. It's hard to really understand what is happening; and that's what i like about it. It gives you the time to think and reflect, even during the film.And for the people i've lost during the review;watch it anyway, you get to see Kirsten Dunst's boobs TWICE (if i counted right)And also i apologize for bad English.</fullReview>

The movement of time slows to a crawl. This to me is one of those movies that directors and the movie industry loves to make for themselves. Beautifully shot and actually well acted, but so non-commercial that it is basically a vanity project. Kirstin Dunst was beautiful and her portrayal of Justine was the reason that I gave the film 2 stars. In my opinion, the good acting by the cast and the fact that the film is no better than it is, shows that a film is only as good as the vision of the director and the editing allow it to be. I am sure that many in the industry will heap praise on this film, but to me it was a "beautiful to watch" waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Human Take on the End of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest work from Swedish visionary director, Lars Von Trier, Melancholia (2011) follows sisters Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) during the final period of life on earth before it is destroyed by the incoming planet, Melancholia.Set in two parts, the first half follows Justine, a clinically depressed newlywed, struggling to enjoy her lavish reception after marrying Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd). In the second half we revisit the site of the reception owned by Claire and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) as they, along with Justine and their son Leo, watch the progress of the giant blue planet making its way towards them.Despite its apocalyptic overtone, the film largely is based on the relationship between the two sisters and it is this aspect that lies at the core of the film that helps propel it to extraordinary heights. Focussing on themes such as emotional fragility as well as the complexity and, at the same time, insignificance of the human condition, Von Trier is able to explore ideas surrounding the entire existence of life on earth. But he ensures the film is kept oddly but wonderfully grounded through the brutally honest humanity conveyed by his actors throughout, especially by his two leads.Kirsten Dunst has never been better as the film's main driver, as we watch her character struggle with the most complex of human emotions. We discover the effect this has on not only her and her sense of place in the world, but on the people around her. Similarly, Charlotte Gainsbourg is simply sublime as the anxious but empathetic Claire as she more or less carries the final act. A solid supporting cast, most notably Sutherland and Skarsg?rd, adds a large amount of depth to the film.At times, Von Trier can be accused of being slightly self-indulgent when it comes to his stylistic tendencies. Most notably this included questionable framing of key shots, a shame considering the beautiful work done by the art department. However due to this indulgence Von Trier is also able to present some of the most beautiful images captured for film.Met with ferocious polarisation at film festivals and screenings around the world, Melancholia is ultimately a complete triumph, questioning theories of life, love and the overall human condition, all through the eyes of these two sisters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is gorgeous, odd, powerful movie that reminds me just how good film can be, even when focused on odd or distressing subjects. Kirsten Dunst is amazing as a woman plagued by near-crippling depression. We first meet her on the night of her wedding night in what can only be described as the longest night ever (the grueling clash of exhausted personalities through an endless night reminds me of the movie Gothic, and the night in which Poliodori wrote the first vampire novel and Mary Shelley came up with Frankenstein).She is at the lovely estate of her care-taking sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg, who is tremendous) and exasperated, wealthy brother-in-law (played by Kiefer Sutherland in a strong performance). Over the course of the evening, she is able to completely wreck the wedding and her life. Fast forward some short amount of time and she is barely functional, returning to the estate to mend, all against the backdrop of a fast-approaching planet called Melancholia that is destined to pass very close to the earth. That's right, melancholia is a giant intergalactic body on a collision course with everyone on earth ? read into that what you will.There is so much going in this movie it's hard to pin it down. It's an exploration of familial and marital bonds, a discourse on the effects of depression upon those who suffer from it and upon those who suffer at the hands of those who suffer from it and it tackles the meaning, and likely futility of, life. There's also a focus on fear of death and how that plays out, a look at possibly misplaced faith in science and an under-appreciation for instinct and even "second sight." It's an achingly beautiful movie about lives colliding as, literally, worlds collide, and how the filter of depression changes our world view. The music, Wagner, only adds to the power.--www.cowboyandvampire.com --</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start by saying that the film is not bad. The actors are really good, the setting is great and the effects are realized with care.Let's now consider the script and its themes. If you hated the latest VonTrier, you won't like this movie very much, since it features some topics that many people (me included) find annoying.First of all, VonTrier likes frowning on science. According to Lars, scientists believe that they know the truth behind things and think about themselves as almost godlike creatures. VonTrier sees them as a closed circle, as a group of people who tend to keep knowledge strictly to themselves (see "The Kingdom"). They are portrayed as obnoxious or ridiculous and selfish and, in the end, their science is shown to be much less powerful than they thought.Second, Lars Von Trier has the tendency to show pain in a way that could be considered either sadistic or masochistic. The viewer is shown images of suffering and is supposed/compelled to feel sympathy and share the character's pain (see "Breaking the Waves", "Dancer in the Dark"...).Last but not least, Von Trier adds just a pinch of the old "humans are all evil and hypocrite, life is s**t" ? la "Dogville".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While considering myself a huge cinephile i cannot recall a movie as depressing as LVT's Melancholia.The fact of the matter is that there have been made a lot of sad movies issuing even sadder issues but at this very moment i can't think of any movie that manages to keep that emotion so tight that the viewer's escape is nearly impossible.Melancholia is consisted by two parts 'Justine' and 'Claire'.The first part reveals the true nature of both the protagonist's miserable families and Justine's herself.It is slow pacing,revealing and quite cheerful in some cases.The second part's plot is taking place faster,is much more sad and subversive.One of the most amazing things about this movie is the poetic parallels between the movie as a 'film' and the movie as a 'living' story that unravels until it's end.More specifically the movie is so dark,sad yet beautiful just like Justine.It also is so aloof,cold,senseless and cruel upon the issue of depression,the exact way Justine sees everything and the oncoming end of the world-the way it is.To cut the long story short depression is an issue Lars Von Trier is very familiar to,and probably that's one of the reasons for this amazing mesmerizing result,one of the best movies ever made,Melancholia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie captures some decent acting and editing. Kirsten Dunst is obviously a talented actress, and the rest of the crew succeed in convincing the audience of their characters and situations. The visuals, in addition, are unarguably beautiful and captivating, matched with appropriately magical music.Sadly, there is nothing more to the movie other than good acting and good editing. The directing must have been lacking because the overall movie is quite lacking. The trailer is definitely misleading; the film is only for the fans of Lars von Trier and/or Kirsten Dunst - those who enjoy the director's style and/or those who would enjoy watching the protagonist actress on camera, especially briefly nude. And although the acting and editing are meritable, the camera is constantly shaking throughout the movie - perhaps it is to symbolize the instability of the protagonist's family, but it is too much - taking away from the experience rather than enhancing it.Finally, the most important aspect of every movie, the story, is too elaborate and symbolic (or not at all). Everything is monotonous and anticlimactic, and at the end of the film, the audience is left to wonder, "What was the point of that?" (either curiously about the film or angrily about watching the film). Like the_wolf_imdb puts it, " Nothing happens, then nothing happens, then nothing happens..."People will either love or hate Melancholia (2011). Whether one enjoys the movie depends on one's interpretation of the movie: it can be amateurish and predictable, or it can be very well done. Regardless, one thing's for sure: Mr. von Trier needs look into purchasing a dolly pronto.(On a side note: I, for one, did not enjoy the movie. At first, I could not recognize how tortured my mind was because I was so allured by the visuals and audio, but halfway through, I realized I'd dozed off. And I really don't sleep during movies... Seriously, the story just drones on and on and on until they all die.)</fullReview>

Earth may or may not be in its way, which means that the end of the world may or may not be possible. Melancholia is basically a disaster film, though, which means that the ending is determined outright and that, yes, the Earth is destroyed. This is the cool part. The rest of the movie revolves around two sisters and their immediate family. This is the less cool part. The most interesting thing here is that their husbands are, in light of the end of the world, portrayed as weak and cowardly, and the sisters are the righteous ones who see Mother Earth through to her fiery end. This is a noted turnaround from the misogyny of Trier's previous film, Antichrist, which was founded on the premise that a mother would rather experience an orgasm than stop her son from jumping out of a window.Trier wants to use the end of the world as a metaphor to make some sort of statement on depression, specifically, that depressed people stay cool like Fonzie in extreme situations. I guess this is worth exploring. Honestly, though, when Kirsten Dunst as Justine, one of the sisters, utters things like "Life is only on Earth, and not for long," I can't take the movie very seriously. Nihilism, I think, is only attractive to other nihilists, and also, personally, I'm fairly fond of the idea of extraterrestrial life.I was really only enthralled in Melancholia when it was ripping off 2001: A Space Odyssey and setting wondrous celestial bodies, locked in a dance of death in the depths of space, to classical music. I also liked the prominence of Kirsten Dunst's breasts. Trier certainly didn't shy away from them, and for good reason. When Justine strips to the nude and bathes herself in the glow of the mysterious rogue planet, now a fixation of the night sky like the moon, it's easy to think of her breasts as celestial bodies all their own.Now that's a metaphor I can get behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revealing, if not obfuscated depiction of parallel ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started to watch this movie, and thought it was one of the most confusing depictions of end of story scenarios, meets Psychosis, but then of course that would simplify the case; or would it ? ;) I enjoyed the story, as made evident by the end of the movie (?), as drawing a parallel between the end of the world and the ever so strange personal drama that unfolds between screen protagonists.I'm all for a good mystery, but honestly I think ( I realize writer/director of film had a vision, don't we all ) that falls a bit flat, as are we really to believe that Kerstens character is so psychotic as to take her entire family to the alter only to make a mockery of it ( and her fathers gift) eventually ? I personally felt the dramatic personality shifts to be unbelievable to the point of absurd, but having said that, I do think it probably is a good thing to see unfold, because if anything it does bring to the forefront, the inherent problems associated with mental illness, in direct parallel to supposed 2012 theories and all they entail, Mayan or not.I think this movie was stunning for such portrayal, but I wish they had tamed it down a bit for average movie goers, as while its quite dark in its portrayal of her psychosis, it seems to jump off many virtual cliffs in its stark depiction of mental illness to the point of ludicrousness. Are there any families in existence that are this dysfunctional; maybe so, I just don't know of any, nor have I ever met any, but I've been accused of leading a sheltered life by a few, and if so this would be a surprise learning experience.I still think, that while the movie was stunning in its poignancy and visuals, that the audience could have been delivered to that point by a more cohesive core story devoid of individual moments lacking forward momentum. I felt lost in the beginning-middle'ish, and once meaning was clear, I almost felt the end was a tad anticlimactical, even if it was delivered in a very surreal powerful way and with emotional impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being my first experience with a Lars Von Trier film I was hoping that it's quality would live up to the standard I've heard him boasting about in various interviews throughout the years. However the primary impression I was left with was just how little I cared for the characters and how unstirred I was by the themes on display.The opening montage is quite an amazing piece of film making but I found the good will from it begin to wane as throughout the film interesting characters and possible conflicts (Kirsten Dunst's mother and father, her job at the ad agency) were either forgotten about or given fairly unsatisfactory conclusions.I would have been able to look past the vapid drama if some more compelling themes had arisen through the presence of Melancholia, but all the film seemed to be interested in was asserting that Earth is an evil place and it deserves to be destroyed. And although I would usually be quite invested in such motifs, it seems a bit short sighted considering the many other possible themes arising from LIFE ON EARTH BEING DESTROYED BY ANOTHER PLANET.Considering similar subject matter had been tackled so well in two other films this year (The Tree of Life and Another Earth) I may be short changing the originality on display, but the dull wedding drama and weight of runtime devoted to it overshadow the brilliant visuals and music on display during the Earth's destruction. And for me this is what ultimately holds Melancholia back from being something truly memorable</fullReview>

But, I had given a chance to Justine and she has blown me away! Btw,I hated her at the begin, and I've felt sorry for her poor sister. Her mother is also very funny, almost like that she had known as well what will be at the end! This film can't leave you speechless! I almost started to cry when I'd seen her future/ex husband leaving the wedding! And...what more can I say, You must see this film and after it start to think what you should do in 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie provides positive and uncomfortable emotions!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie got all what it takes to be one special movie. It is about the willingness and perseverance of Lars Von Trier to dig into the abyss of the uncommon part of the humanity. The first part of the movie may seem slow and a bit confusing, but actually it takes the time that it needs to perfectly sculpt the world seen from the point of view of a melancholic person. I really believe that we all got a bit of melancholia inside us, we all (more or less) suffer of melancholia... in the deepness of us.The second part, it's the movie. Yes! The melancholia you've seen in the trailer. It's about love, courage and the mental powerfulness of human being mainly interpreted by the French actress Charlotte Gainsburg. The devoting sister who have to take care of her sister Justine while the Earth is about to experiment a collision with an alien Planet.In a few words, this movie provides positive and uncomfortable emotions. It's a silent "end of the world movie" where the devastating chaos takes place in the mind of the viewer. It's art by Lars...can't say more really. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have recommended this film to everyone ever since I watched for the first time in 2011's Mar del Plata Film Festival. Half of those loved it, half of those wanted to kill me. Melancholia is imho a great work of art, sublime from the very first scene of the prologue. But I've found out that it requires a certain type of spectator to actually enjoy it: you got to know, first hand, what depression / melancholy is. Otherwise this film can appear boring and exaggerated.The acting is great, it's mostly visually simple yet spectacular, as is the score (Wagner). The script can result confusing and even boring if you are expecting a classic, lineal kind of thing, but all the scenes in this film are not trying to tell a story but show us different ways on which people deal with the melancholy, or the certainty of an upcoming, inevitable death. And it uses beautiful, astonishing metaphors to do so. Personally I treasure this film among the best I've ever seen, and one of whom I connect the most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good grief! What a load of arty-farty rubbish. Over two hours of it - I think I should give myself a medal or something for sticking through it. (Actually I gave up at 1 hour 4 minutes and started flicking through it.) What a ridiculous story line about a wedding reception. I should have known it was going to be rubbish at the very beginning when a stretch limo gets stuck on a narrow windy gravel road and the driver lets the groom and then the bride have a go at getting around the the bend. Where in the real world would that ever happen? Stupid! And this film was such a waste of talent. I suppose John Hurt's day as a "talent" has long gone as has Charlotte Rampling's , but they could have been put to better use.It looks like the director had only one camera and was holding it himself. Perhaps he had it on "Super slow-mo" mode because the film just drags and drags.And why is it called "Lars Von Trier's Melancholia"? Does the director have some kind of identity problem? Does he need his name as part of the title? Actually, come to think of it, it's a god idea - now I know not to bother watching anything written or directed by "Lars Von whatever".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The science behind the cause... Is so bad, I can't get beyond it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I can't believe it's achieved a 7 rating. If I could, I'd go negative 10.This is one of those movies that you sit and wait for it to get better and it never does. It's an over indulgent - never ending paradox. The movie is captive in the first few minutes of slow motion scenes that you will eventually see. That's the best part of this movie.Supposedly the plot is that a planet, 8-10 times the size of the Earth, that hasn't been noticed until a week or so before it is either (A) miss the Earth by 100Km at first and then swing out to 1200km and then back again to collide with the Earth devouring it entirely. Or (B) Miss the Earth completely giving the inhabitants of Earth a wonderful show.There is one person who knows that it will hit the Earth and that is Justine played by Dunst. If this is true, why get married 3 days before the Earth is to be destroyed? Why marry a man who cares about you only to deny him sex and go off with another man and have sex with him on a golf course? The list goes on and on about how the movie doesn't make sense.Let's say you see a movie trailer about WWII and the Holocaust. You'd be expecting something like "Schindler's list", or "The Pianist". However, this is what you get instead.....The movie starts with beautiful scenes of dozens of different things one may encounter on a train trip spanning a few days. Great. Wonderful. Then the movie moves to 50-60 Jews being crammed into a boxcar in a train station by a servitude of Nazis. Some people crying, some in bewilderment. You don't know any of these people. You'd expect perhaps 3-5 minutes of this while the train moves to it's destination. NO. Not this movie. You are forced to watch 1 hour and 15 minutes of the entire trip inside the boxcar while the person filming is using a hand held camera. You see people getting squashed, their toes stepped on and people fainting from the heat. Every once in a while the camera peers through the wooden slats and shows you the wonderful imagery outside. After the 1 1/4 hour of the this, the train comes to a stop. The people are moved out of the boxcar, some people died along the way. You have to imagine why. Do you actually care for any of the people? Probably not. You don't know anything about them.They are then separated into 5 groups by the Nazis. Children, old men, young men, old women and young women. This takes another hour of the film. It makes no sense though. All of them are then told to strip and head for the showers where in the last two minutes of the film the shower stalls fill with smoke (very artsy BTW.)..... and viola! The movie is over. How did you like it?I did forget to mention one important aspect of this so called Holocaust film. You see, the Nazi soldiers are all Japanese. Not Japanese soldiers in Japanese uniforms mind you, Japanese soldiers in Nazi uniforms. You also notice something strange about the language. It's Spanish! Yes, Japanese Nazis, speaking Spanish! Picture that in your head if you could. Instead of a disobeying Nazi getting shot, he is forced to commit suicide by thrusting a sword through his belly while whistling the macarena. It doesn't make sense. It will never make sense.Just like the planet that's about to strike Earth that was hiding behind the sun. Never new it was there. It lies between the the Earth and the sun but strangely enough at night time when our view is directed in the opposite direction of the sun...we can still see it. Hmm.. No earthquakes, tsunami's. Nothing. not to mention the planet would create havoc on the Earth's and all the other planets orbits. I guess you're not supposed to think of that. You are supposed to feel the different plights of the characters in the film while awed by the art of someone holding a hand held cam corder. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

The only reason I made it that far was for the actor who played the groom, Alexander, then the bride screwed that up! I even fast forwarded twice trying to find good parts. When I first started watching the movie I was impressed with the slow motion at the beginning. I also liked how anything Justine cared about was put in the slow motion bit. During the wedding dinner it was not cool to have the mom speak about marriages being basically ridiculous in her opinion. If she was not at the wedding then she should not have came to the reception or either not allowed to speak(Everyone already knew the mom was depressed).</fullReview>

As with Antichrist, which on some levels are amazing, and on others plain awful and speculative, this is ending up the same way, with a 5/10 rating.I love the beautiful footage, but hate the abrupt cuttings.I love the poetic scenes, but hate the boredom when it's too long.I love the excitement of a conversation which insults, but hate it's every conversation.I love camera experimenting, but hate wobbly camera when it's done to annoy us.I love long good movies, but hate when they are made long just to bore.I love films giving out theories, but hate when it's totally unbelievable.I love a good shock in a movie, but hate when a film is so sick that nothing's shocking.The film is supposed to give you thoughts about if we are taking science seriously, who is really the ones to understand what's happening, the meaning of life and so on. But I don't feel like buying that. It's too pretentious for me, when it's told in such a provocative style.Go rather see the simpler "Mennesker i solen" (translated to "Humans in the sun") if you want a taking on humans not being able to see the world going under. at least there it's brilliantly done with humor as well, not only tragedy.This is a movie impossible to love, unless you are a quite unusual moviegoer, loving strange movie makers not afraid of being self indulgent.If you look for a plotted story, fast paced film with no thinking, or a film where some parts should not irritate, disgust or provoke, then this is NOT for you!I myself, appreciate much, but I'll say to the movie and LvT the same thing the sister said to the bride right in timidly of this movie. "Sometimes I really hate you". Sometimes I both hate this film, and like it. Sometimes I hate LvT, like on the Nazi statements on the press conference in Cannes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ambitious imperfect but interesting artistic effort--human emotions vs. the cosmos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia (2011)With an outsized reputation from both critics and fans, up and down, I was dying to see what was going on here. Kristen Dunst is a powerful lead, and a whole slew of excellent actors fill out the cast.You might wonder what it's about even after (after) seeing it. Well, it's best to skip that question and ask what it does to you while watching it. That is, there is a mood and experience created by the series of events--two events, mainly. One is basically a woman getting married and tormented by doubts even as the world around her gives advice and pushes her forward. The other is the end of the world (yes). The title is quite serious--it's a melancholy, deeply moving, troubling, probing movie.But it goes half way, or rather it tries to go all the way to this lofty goal and fails in certain parts enough to gut the core of it.There is much magic here, an expansion on reality into the profound and the profoundly beautiful. That's enough for many. There are scenes where the world is transformed from what it is to what you might want it to be. And the universe, the nebula far away (and altered a bit by special effects), the approaching planetary doom in the sky. It's quite grandiose and a bit pretentious, perhaps, but don't mind that too much. With Wagner gushing in the soundtrack, it's impossible to not be affected.What falters mostly for me is the human, ordinary part, much of it filmed in available light or shaky camera to emphasize the everydayness of it, and the contrast to the other highly refined parts. These scenes, which depend very much on Dunst (who is the strongest part of them), lack convincing dialog and basic acting and editing. It's a poetic, rough, yellowish or sun-glared pastiche of characters and moments meant to recreate the dizzy drama of an over-produced wedding and then the approach of the End, all with a cast of very rich characters bearing attitudes and distractions. And if the pieces are all seemingly present, there is something not quite perfect about it. I wanted to like it all very much and found it clumsy. In part I know other movies that deal with similar complex and emotional group situations with stronger effect.And then, when some style and long sequence of events doesn't quite convince (mainly the wedding parts), it drags a bit. Which is maddening because it's so darned good on the surface. The husband is a dull witted sort, and I never give two wits about him, which might be intentional. All I care for is whether Dunst and her endlessly undefined angst will survive the night. She wonderful at it even if it's endlessly uncertain.Okay, so what is the uneven reputation this movie carries with it, and why? It's partly that it's another ambitious and idiosyncratic artistic movie by director Lars von Trier. He's one of those directors you need to be curious about. He pushes boundaries. He doesn't make commercial crap. And yet, as with most things in life, he falls short. Especially in this painful business of collaborative effort, it's hard to actually succeed on all fronts.But let's focus on von Trier just a moment. He is the writer here as well, and so he takes the rap for a lot of this, better and worse. For all the depth implied, there is something off the mark in the psychology, and even the philosophy (which might at first seem easier). Some of the dialog seems awkward, or if not exactly wrong at least ineffective, which is all that matters. And even the plot as it is clear in the long wedding scenes is almost painfully improbable. All these things going wrong behind the scenes and no one quite does the right thing. There is, in fact, no real human understanding or meaningful interaction after all, just bookish probabilities. Effective ones, but affected and at arm's length.I did actually like this movie, and am grousing partly because I wanted more. I keep hoping for a movie that makes a dent in "meaning" in the big sense. The filming is intensely visual and in a way that's sometimes enough. The scenes, and the mise-en-scene, are so upper crust you might be put off by all the dour privilege. If we are to assume, from the implications, that Dunst plays a vaguely mentally ill character, even here we are left with lack of insight. Yet, with Dunst and the cosmos (a planet or comet is on collision course with Earth, almost) all of these imperfections and inaccuracies partly work. It's not a sympathetic experience, quite, but a pathetic one. You feel for the situation. You worry for Dunst. You hope for more. You get only part of the whole.Which is rather like life. "Melancholia" in the end is disturbing and gorgeous and it has enough drawn, taut, human, pretty aspects it works, it works. Of course, the big plot (that this planet object might annihilate Earth) dwarfs silly things like love, marriage, jealousy, and desire. And in a way, the second half of the movie makes the somewhat imperfect first half make sense. It's worth sticking it out. You've seen nothing quite like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't they know its the end of the world?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier is highly controversial director, both as a filmmaker and as a personal. He met controversy again at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival when he claimed he was sympathetic to Hitler and claimed he was a Nazi (a criminal offence in France) and it cost Melancholia the Palme d'Or. But Melancholia is still a very interesting and compelling film.Melancholia is the tale of two sisters, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and is told two parts. The first focuses on Justine on her wedding day with Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) which ends in failure, the other focusing on Claire as she helps Justine battle her depression and her own anxiety as the planet Melancholia is about to collide with Earth.The first eight minutes of Melancholia plays like the most depressing music video ever made, with striking slow motion imagines as the planet is about to be destroyed as the Prelude to Tristan und Isolde plays powerfully constantly. Out of the two stories, Claire's is much better then Justine. In the context of the story it works better, it is a personal story about the relationship between the sisters to the backdrop of a impending disaster. They have role reversal in the middle of this story as Justine battles her crippling depression before accepting death and sees the destruction of Earth as the end of life in the universe and sees it as what Earth deserves. Claire suffers from a deep anxiety because she was wants son and herself to live and it is implied that she has anxiety problems before.The wedding storyline did not add to the film and about half of it could have been cut. It starts well enough with Justine seeming to be very much in love with Michael (Alexander Skargard) but after seeing the red star changes the personality of the characters, bringing out Justine's depression, like when the Apes touched the monolith that brought humanity to the next leave. The Wedding could have been a great way to establish the characters, the situation, maybe announced the discovery of the planet, complex relationship between the sisters and hinting that their may have inherited their mental illnesses from their mother. But it dragged too much, ruined a lot of potential, filled the film with big name actors like John Hurt and Stellan Skargard because well, von Trier, needless subplots that could have handled better and this first half could easily turn people off the film before the much better second half.Dunst and Gainsbourg were excellent in their roles, bringing out very complex and compelling performance. This is easily Dunst's best performance as she plays the a heartbreaking depressive role. Kiefer Sutherland too gives a strong, if schizophrenic performance (but I put that down to the writing), as a rich man who is concerned about his money, has a rough relationship with his sister-in-law, becomes excited about Melancholia passing Earth and having to pretend everything is alright. Despite the uneven writing Sutherland was much more grounded compared to Dunst and Gainsbourg.Melancholia is a very grim film, keeping the tone of impending doom throughout. Melancholia is also a very thematic film, as it looks at the doom of the Earth, Justine's wedding and her character, about the acceptance of death and destruction, a look of the personal relationships and problems in the middle of the end of the world. Both halves are set in John's (Sutherland) isolated estate, keeping the film to be a personal story. There is no look at the outside world, there is no TV news, newspaper and just a quick on the internet. This is a film focused solely on the characters and looks at their problems, their fears and they influence the other. We see everything through Justine and Claire's eyes.The cinematography with its use of hand held cameras and the imaginary were incredible throughout, fitted with symbolism and just looked beautiful throughout. And the Prelude to Tristan und Isolde is only piece of music that acts as a score, but it is a fantastic, powerful and very fitting music for the film.Another Earth would be an interesting comparison piece to Melancholia: both films look at the discovery of a new planet in our solar system, how it would impact people on Earth, but Another Earth is a more hopeful, philosophical film whilst Melancholia is a grim and personal film. They are both fantastic film, but for me Another Earth has the edge, simply because it is shorter and more tout.In comparison to some of Melancholia's Cannes competition, it is better then Tree of Life which was a case of the emperor's new clothes, but Drive was a much entertaining film.If you can make it through the wedding half of the film Melancholia is very interest, compelling and striking film, top off by two great performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watching this movie is about number two: you will waste two hours looking at the two Kirsten's b**bs waiting for her to show them off, which will obviously happen, since nothing interesting happens in the middle.Maybe I am so disappointed because I thought I was going to see some sort of sci-fi film and not a drama queen movie full of people complaining for no reason in which at a certain point a previously unknown planet starts to menace planet Earth and everyone but the most mad character start to get mad about it.There is no reason to watch this movie if you are not interested into people crying on a bed or staring at the wall in silence because they are mysteriously depressed.PS: oh, and don't forget the headache caused by the ever shaking camera shootings, otherwise you can't name this an alternative and cool movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great metaphor to explain contemporary sadness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At part 1 you will see Justine trying to be happy at her own wedding,but her family is too busy reminding her of how she is not supposed to fail or even demonstrate how miserable she can be with the bitchy mother or lunatic father.Then you'll be more impressed or scared with the fact that she leaves the dinner table where her beloved husband is to...have sex with a stranger,one of her guests at the fancy wedding her family prepared for her in a huge European castle.At first Justine seemed very crazy to me and I was not able to connect the chaotic events in the first part of the movie, which is by the way,all over Justine's attempt to please her family instead of pleasing herself.But there's too much pressure and Kirsten Dunst is just divine with the whole energy she was able to put into the challenge of playing' such an important role that is basically a symbol of how society will treat you,does not really matter if you do what they want or if you just escape from the circus of living a life that is not really an accurate representation of your own reality and everything you go through day by day.Second part will explore Claire's ability to cope with the arrogant husband who keeps saying how bad is her sister's influence on everyone and,of course,Melancholia,the planet that is about to destroy the earth.Justine is severely depressed now and she is seeing everything with a bitter perspective that will really scare you sometimes.I did not find the ending with the huge planet coming towards the earth scary at all,on the other hand I found it beautiful.I was really impressed with the scene that Justine tells Claire the earth is evil and there is no life out there except on the earth.Justine,as someone who is either bipolar or just depressed is able to feel everything in a dimension her older sister just can't reach.John's suicide is also a great joke because,well,he is so busy telling his wife how messed up his sister in law is and then...well if he was able to kill himself with prescription pills,surprise,he was more depressed than Justine,who actually is the one who provides some sort of relief to her nephew and her sister when the big moment comes and Melancholia is coming.Kirsten naked enjoying the moonlight reminded me of one those art masterpieces,she is just there,getting rid of anything that could possibly make us remember how lovely she was when she just started her career with the vampire child years ago,or how nerd and cool she could be with Mary Jane,spider man's girlfriend.Lars Von Trier was wise when he picked Kiki for this particular role,I mean,you will not recognize her anymore.And that's what acting really is.I loved this movie,and I am so happy that I ignored the bad comments about it and listened to my friends who said the film was indeed amazing! Melancholia is the metaphor that you will understand completely when you comprehend that even if the world won't end in December according to the prophecy,someday you will be gone and what will be left of you is not what society thought of you,it is actually what you did with your heart and soul and the feelings you shared with others.Poor Justine or John or even Claire were all busy trying to survive through the random events life has insert into their destiny,and in the end,Claire's son,the little child was calm counting on his aunt's courage to help him in the whole process.And Justine was there,even when her depression or anger took all her energy and faith away,she was the one there,supporting her family.Great work,I'll recommend it to everyone I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Accurate Depiction of Mental Illness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, I will say I did not enjoy the slow pace and drawn out images that started the film. I thought it was pretentious, however visually stimulating.To end, I will say...what an amazing depiction of depression and anxiety. The best I've ever seen, and in Dunst's interview, she makes a fantastic point by saying people really don't get to see this side of depression very often. They certainly don't get praised for it. There is a definite stigma that even Hollywood can't overcome, and I give this film so much gratitude for trying. Having lived with depression myself, I saw myself in her character on a level I never knew anyone else could depict so well. The anxiety of her sister was also stunningly accurate. I loved that I knew exactly what Lars was trying to accomplish in the first few scenes of the film, and he succeeded admirably. I only wish those who haven't experienced it could still agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How ANYONE could like this movie is beyond me. It is utter garbage. I wonder if it is a case of The King's New Clothes? Are people too afraid too face the film's utter inadequacy? We are faced with two unrelated story lines - the dysfunctional family with their prime examples of bad to worse relationships set in the paradox of a beautiful castle. When the tedium of the protagonist's semi-psychosis has just about driven one to sleep, another arises and makes the experience even worse. Then we have this spurious planet suddenly about to crash the party. I have tried to see some metaphor, some explanation of this bizarre turn, but to no avail. It gives Keiffer an excuse to be the scientific dad who states all will be OK and then suicide because he thinks this is not the case. Then everything ends. What a dud! There are better films to occupy 2 hours of your life with - go see one of them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you didn't love this movie then you didn't understand it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I need to say how brilliant the cinematography was for those who have seen it. I noticed that each of every character had a very functional role in this film.The beginning of the film portrays exactly what we are supposed to do and how we are supposed to do it. No feeling or emotion rather than the need to play by the traditional rules. Cutting the cake at 11:30 and then everyone outside to write on those paper air balloons, the carrying across the "altar", all the money spent on the "big day" etc..This is how I see the important role of each character and their significance: Kirsten Dunst - Free Spirit. The very sensitive, rebellious and fed up with what the human species does on this planet. She was made out to be crazy but it seemed in the end she was the one who really had a full understanding and was ostracized as we do with anyone who has different thoughts or opinions. I think there was even a saying in the beginning referring to this.Keifer Sutherland - The Fraud. The one who apparently understood everything and seemed to know all with strength and confidence melted down and turned yellow in the end. A rough exterior with a weak inside.Alexander Skarsgard - Societies man. The so called perfect man. Plays by all the rules and does whats expected of him. The true gentleman.Charlotte Gainsourg - The pleaser. Out to please everyone with no regard to her own feelings. She remains in between and never really knows who she is or what she really wants out of life..it's why she completely freaks out at the end. She think she is supposed to want the "wine on the terrace" and "beethoven playing" but her sister calls her out for being stupid (a piece of $h!t plan).Cameron Spurr - Innocence. The son represents innocence and purity.Stellen Skarsgard - The egoist. The big boss who can get anyone to do anything. A true a-hole.Brady Corbett - The Simpleton. Nothing provokes any big thoughts as he cruises through life. This is this and that is that so nothing left to be understood.Charlotte Rampling - The Jaded. Been there done that and fed up with all of it. Whats the point type of mentality. A real cynic.John Hurt - The Selfish. Has no regard for anyone but himself and his agenda. Has good intentions but can't bring himself to follow through for others in his life.Just my take on the main characters and how I see them. I really loved how it all came together. The thought crossed my mind about which of these characters I am in this big film we call life. It's a film I will watch again just for all of the nuances I missed the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly unlikable characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny when you welcome the demise of the world just to insure that these two, self-absorbed sisters die in the end.The only thing that would have made it better was if they'd shown their horrible mother (played quite well by Charlotte Rampling) disintegrated as well.With all his recent heroic roles, it's nice to see Kiefer Sutherland portray a mostly unlikable character to good effect.Camera work was excellent, Ms. Dunst is in fine physical form. Also, to her credit, it's hard work playing a stunningly beautiful, yet unlovable part.At least Charlotte Gainsbourg was restricted to being merely annoying vs. destroying male genitalia as she attempted to do in Antichrist. Now this woman knows how to portray reprobate to perfection.For the last bit of irony; the male child, who I suppose I should have felt some measure of sympathy for, I was truly ambivalent to. Sad since the attitude of not giving a damn was what was so annoying about Justine and the Mother.It ends well, with the destruction of the planet insuring there will never be a scenario that would lead to a sequel. The 6 of 10 is charitable, Kirsten's "melons" and the fine camera work kept it from getting a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When SFX makes a movie fail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people have turned around and sworn on their very careers that "Melancholia" is one of the best films since sliced bread, even the invention of the wheel. However, to the few that have the luck in seeing this film, like us at The DVD Archive here in the UK, we will say that there is no rush to go out and see this movie on the big screen ? or to waste money on the eventual (if this happens to be released on) BluRay distribution.With more than half a dozen well known stars from both the UK and the US; John Hurt, Kirsten Dunst, Kiefer Sutherland, the film itself has sparked a little controversy regarding the storyline that tells of the planet which is to pass the Earth. Admittedly, the start of the film is something new and spectacular even with the special effects, but it is worth knowing that the soundtrack is very, very annoying as well as far too long. If you can get past this first bit of under dramatic ear bashing then the following hour will have you wanting to reach for the remote control, or at the very least you will be asking yourself one seriously important question: What in the hell was the director thinking when he started filming this picture? And more to the point did the entourage of A-list actors actually believe this film would accredit them for future projects, or did they foresee Melancholia as a fast ride to a better deal in the great Hollywood Hills? Shot on location in Vastra Gotaland, the storyline begins with Justine and Michael as they return from the Wedding ceremony to John's huge stately home ? with a full sized 18 hole golf course included ? for the Reception. Being two hours late and having all the guests waiting seems to be a standing joke for Justine (Kirsten Dunst) who then proceeds to go see the horses in the stables before going to greet family and guests inside the house.The dull and boring build up to the point where all the guests leave the celebration puts some in mind of watching a rich friend or bureaucrat's Wedding Video, which we believe Lars was trying to tell us by filming this movie around the locations he did.Drained by a strange condition that Justine has, Michael makes the self-discovery ? with help from Justine's embittered Mother ? that marriage can be a very short journey. Cue Michael's exit and the storyline becoming even more drawn out and boring to a single point in the movie when finally Melancholia is mentioned in a barrage of scientific talk, jargon and theoretical spoil.Adding the titillation factor of showing Kirsten Dunst naked in the woods under the increasingly large approaching planet, the storyline suddenly wakes up when John (Kiefer Sutherland) takes an easy way out by saving the Global Killer Planet the trouble in killing him. After this happens with John, it's not long before we see the huge blue planet staring down our character's throats."Melancholia" is a film that would be best remade by Spielberg on a day like that of when he created "War of the Worlds", because for us, if it wasn't for the fact of reviewing the film, then it would have certainly ended up in the bottom drawer to gather dust and be forgotten.Incidental music by Richard Wagner from his opera Tristan und Isolde The DVD Archive Rating: 5/10 (6 if Spielberg had directed)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia may be a terrifying but magnificent metaphor for suicide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia illuminates the concept that the great unknown above reflects what is also mysterious below; that both the perfection and chaos expressed in the cosmos reflects the same perfection and chaos within us. Lars von Trier's Earth destroyed by the planet Melancholia could be a metaphor for the self-destruction of a human being suffering from severe depression. The bride tells her sister that she "knows" that there is no life elsewhere in the Universe; life exists only on the Earth. She says that if the Earth is destroyed, all life will be gone forever.What could be more final than the destruction of all life in the Universe, and likewise, for an individual human being to commit the terrible and final act of suicide? Suicide is to the self, after all, nothing less than the absolute destruction of the self's experience of the Universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best films I have seen in ages. At first things seem idyllic, a happy wedding, a beautiful bride, a splendid location...but bit by bit we start to feel something is wrong. Problems of communication arise as early as in the limo when the married couple cannot get in touch with the chauffeur. During the wedding party Justine often expresses the need to "talk" to different characters, but she never gets to do it. Her boss is only interested in getting from her a slogan for his advertising campaign; her husband has bought her a piece of land without asking her and is already planning details of their married life; when she finally gets her father to stay the night at the castle so they can talk, all she finds is a note addressing her with a wrong name, the same her father uses for every woman around him. During the first part Justine is caught in the wedding program but she does not comply with it. She disappears for long, having a hot bath or taking a nap while the guests are waiting for her to do what she is supposed to do.She is told by her mother to leave the party, and by her sister to hide her depression and delusions from her husband. One by one male guests leave the party: the sadistic and self-pleased boss, the superficial father, even the husband who cannot understand his wife's deep uneasiness. In the second part, the approaching of the planet proceeds in parallel with Justine's fall into depression and pessimism. Her sister, who tries to organize everybody's life, is the only one who seems to understand Justine and maybe share some of her obsessions. Claire's husband is a rational character, but in the end his faith in science will not help him. Justine, being convinced that life on Earth is just accidental, is not afraid of the approaching planet. The real catastrophe is not in the sky but on Earth. Humankind is wicked. Little by little, with the flight of all men surrounding her, Justine finds she is stronger than her sister. Now it is just the two of them and Claire's little son. Even if Justine knows too well that there is no place to escape (there never has been one), she builds a symbolic shelter where the three of them can wait together for the end. The film is visually enchanting; the imagery of the first few minutes is simply astonishing. As it does not ask to be considered a sci-fi film, it is pointless to look for factual or scientific mistakes, as it would be for another masterpiece like "Solaris".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie by a well-known director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this movie, and I got in on DVD for x-mas. The atmosphere of inevitability and helplessness is sublimely portrayed in the movie - and the way everything is expressed on a micro plan rather than on a large scale strikes me as typically European. Justine and Claire are portraying two sisters with different sensibility and the catastrophe that is about to happen overshadows their relationship as well. The climactic finale where they manage to overcome their differences is a masterpiece in itself. I love Lars Von Trier's movies, funnily enough much more the early work than The Dancer in the dark and Breaking the waves and this movie resembles in my opinion his early work. It's very poetical and the way he uses Wagner's music is fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New "Armageddon" Is Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay this should be a brief review, mostly because I cannot find much to say. The thing is that this new "Armageddon" is definitely different and one of its kind.First, the good: The story of a possible collision between Earth and the planet of Melancholia is presented simply enough, and in a somewhat artistic way. The collision is not unheard of; it is known by the characters. Making use of that, the plot covers the reactions focusing on the lives of a few characters. The acting performed by the cast is amazingly done, and I quite like the way the ambient music and the cinematography reinforces the message of the approaching Melancholia throughout.And the bad: Some scenes are found to be quite long and boring, and sometimes the lack of conversation is also a problem. With the film divided into the two chapters, the first part is relatively more rich in contents or interactions and less sentimental, while the latter part is quite the exact opposite. In spite of the problem of the boredom I mentioned, I still find the second chapter much more intriguing while the first falls flat.The conclusion: Melancholia is one of the one-of-a-kind films out there and it describes a doomsday scenario relying on a more artistic approach instead of the totally "commercial feeling" of Armageddon. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed Armageddon, but I am not going to make too much comparison, as they are in two completely different categories though the plot is somewhat similar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is the idea of film as a collective creation, each creative mind (actor, cinematographer, writer, director...) bringing his own input into the final result, often overseen by a "producer", the surrogate of an "industry". Than there's the author way to do it, where one guy, or a very reduced number of aligned minds create everything that you see. But than there are films which are the face of its maker, inside out, as if you were actually inside his or her mind. That's where Trier's films fit in. These experiences can be life-changing, or absolutely dull, depending on the seduction of the mind we're entering.I've always had a hard relation with Lars von Trier. The man has skill, in the pure visual tools of cinema, framing, editing, timing. He did studied the masters well enough to produce a valid visual experience almost always. He does understand film as a full experience, sound to dialogue, framing to rhythm. And that deserves admiration, it's so rare to find one filmmaker who really cares about every bit of filmmaking. I was never very much into the Dogma thing. And i don't think Trier ever made a film that truly obeyed to his own premises. That's not necessarily bad.But than he has quirks that are just so vulgar and dull. He is self-absorbed in a way that makes him assume that every minor obsession or phobia that he may have is worth telling, and we are obliged to appreciate. He has this Wagnerian idea of being a master whose eccentricities have to be tolerated in the name of genius he necessarily spreads whenever he turns his camera on. So it's curious that he tried to integrate Wagner into this film. The bit he chooses is the opening of a truly ground-breaking, life-changing work. And that pretty much exposes Trier's weaknesses. His greatest strength and what binds this is the bit of genius borrowed from Wagner. It's pretty interesting that the initial sequence is so related to Malick's Tree of Life, since it's clear that one film was probably no influenced by the other. Nice to think where these trends might come from.But then, the concept is dull. 2 planets colliding, 2 sisters colliding, the world around them falling apart, as collateral damage. The men in those women's lives are supposed to have important roles, but both are just pawns, and absolutely clueless about what's happening. Kiefer's character is even supposed to "know" about stars, but falls very far from truly understanding their magical power, reducing everything to a matter of numbers.All this located in a special place, isolated yet alive, concrete yet undefined. The sense of place is important, and that is well explored, and underlined by how the horse denies crossing the bridge.The odd relation between Dunst and her horse also has an assumed sexuality that escapes the understanding of her fiancé. And Dunst's breasts seem to be on top of Trier's preoccupations all the way. Check the bride's dress, check how the camera always lingers towards her cleavage, even when that should be but another element of the set. And check how the music and climax are pointed to the first time we gaze at her, fully naked, bathing in moonlight.I admit that the whole thing is well framed by the initial and ending sequences. But all the rest is just shallow, and the whole experience ultimately worthless. Even if Trier in all his will to be polemic doesn't think so.My opinion: 2/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

An apocalyptic movie can be done so much more captivating. The movie is depressing and not because a planet is heading for Earth but because the movie just drags on forever and the characters do nothing but act depressed and whine at each other. Also the camera-work is really bad, especially in the beginning of the movie. The acting was good though and there were some really spectacular scenes to be seen.

		<fullReview>Why is this a 10-star movie for me? It's because the characters are compelling and stay true to their natures as presented.If you're looking for a science fiction thriller, this isn't it. The sci-fi aspect is merely a vehicle to bookend the drama and to, perhaps, make a statement about the human condition. Who knows? Maybe Lars von Trier, the director, knows. Maybe not. Presumably, you're supposed to think about it and not necessarily form a conclusion. Fine. I didn't. But it was worth the ponder.This isn't the type of movie you'll enjoy if you're waiting for the car chase. As a consolation, there's an early scene of a limo having difficulty slowly navigating sharp turns on a narrow road. But there's no danger there.I noticed several reviews stating that Melancholia was boring. It wasn't for me, but I understand that it could be for others, depending on the type of entertainment they're seeking at the moment. This one will require concentration.Justine is quietly volatile, wresting with her attempts to break free of her dark shell and her desire to return to it. Melancholia is the name of the stray planet that will possibly collide with Earth, ending everything. It is also assumed to be the condition that Justine suffers.Her sister, Claire, is much more stable and serves a parental role, but in a few scenes the roles are somewhat reversed. Intriguing, I think.Supporting characters are also compelling, as is the haunting wedding.I liked this movie. A lot. But you might not.</fullReview>

Yeah, typical male, no blood, guts, gore or Bruce Willis dangling from a light fitting with a ripped, bloodied shirt hanging off his back. Apologies to the males who do like a film with a bit more to it than that but my husband doesn't seem to be too fussed with a film thats more dramatic and thought provoking. Which indeed this is. At first I wasn't too struck with the opening, felt long and drawn out and the music went on, but later on in the film when it was more explained what this was about it made sense. Huge sense. In fact it was at this point in the movie I felt that everything that had gone on previously all boiled down to how the characters were going to deal with this moment. I don't want to give anything away but all i will say is my whole heart was with Charlotte Gainsbourg's character, which just goes to show how well she played her part, her strength but vulnerability also at this moment in the movie. It just goes to show that sometimes a magic cave is just not enough..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal- Can't stop thinking about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is truly spectacular. I watched it several days ago, and I've been thinking about it ever since. What drew me into the movie initially were the amazing visuals of the trailer. As an amateur filmmaker, I was immediately drawn to the raw camera-work, intensely slow slow-mo, and the beautiful and lush ranch setting. The entire movie exhibited the same visual beauty that the trailer had. The beauty of the film on the visual level alone is almost enough reason to watch the movie.Nonetheless, I was equally impressed by every other aspect of the film. The acting was phenomenal. Most of the focus has been on Dunst's acting (which was great), but I believe Charlotte Gainsbourg's acting was pitch-perfect. The range of emotions she exhibited in the film were so powerful. Also, I was very intrigued by the idea of melancholia, as exhibited by Dunst (this was a glimpse into Trier's own soul, and his experience with depression). Finally, idea of the end of the world and the fear of the planet possibly hitting earth, was SO powerful. The movie, which at the base of the story could have been a cheesy sci-fi movie, ends up being one of the most powerful and emotionally-charged movie about the end of the world. Rarely, if ever, have I been so deeply emotionally moved by a film. The ideas of melancholia &amp; the end of the world, beautiful acting, and amazing technical work all work together to make a film which I truly see as a masterpiece. Also, the last scene shook me to the core. Once you watch it (which you must) you'll know what I'm talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Melancholy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time in almost a decade we finally get a true Lars Von Trier film. While Manderlay and Antichrist served only to shock and disgust, Melancholia actually says something. It's not Von Trier's best film, though it has the potential to be one; I didn't feel it as strongly as I did Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark or Dogville, but it shares a lot of their characteristics, most obviously a suffering central female character. Unlike the heroines of those films, though, Justine doesn't get trodden on by the men surrounding her, and in fact controls her own story throughout most of the film. Melancholia doesn't feel as misanthropic as Von Trier's previous films - there's a certain affection for humanity that wasn't there before. Strangely enough, despite the subject matter, it turns out to be his most positive and hopeful film since The Idiots.Melancholia's flaws mostly amount to the fact that it feels incomplete and indecisive, in contrast with Breaking the Waves or Dogville that were stretched to the limits of the viewer's endurance. Melancholia is filled with half-ideas and intriguing but undeveloped characters, like the ones played wonderfully by John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling. There's also a lack of decision stylistically. It uses the Dogma 95 aesthetics for portions of the film, and dismisses them for others; but unlike the impressive and haunting contrast created in Dancer in the Dark between the reality and the musical scenes, this time the switch doesn't create any interesting effect. I almost wish Von Trier did without the music and slow-motion for the more dramatic scenes and kept them naturalistic too, just to see what kind of effect that had.All that aside, I liked Melancholia and I probably enjoyed that more than any other Von Trier's film before; if you're a fan you should definitely watch it, if not - make sure you brace yourself for a pretty depressing experience, though not as depressing as you might think. Special credit should go to the actors, who went above and beyond and surpassed any expectations I had from them, especially Kirsten Dunst and Kiefer Sutherland, for whom I now have newfound respect. Charlotte Gainsbourg is fantastic as well, as are all the supporting cast (almost entirely American and English, this time).One final note: It's possible to despise someone as a human being and like him as an artist at the same time. I appreciate Von Trier's films as pieces of art just as I can allow myself to enjoy Tom Cruise or Mel Gibson in a movie. Please don't pass Melancholia by because of hatred for the man himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully slow, annoying camera and barely audible dialog.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is painfully slow to watch. It is visually annoying in that it seems a 10 year old is holding the camera. Constant wiggling, fast panning and zooming. Even when two people are just sitting, talking, the camera is bobbing up and down. I have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to do with this technique - other than to annoy. The dialog at times is barely audible. I had to keep the volume turned up to maximum, but still hold a remote in my hand for when a sudden scene change occurs and the volume shoots through the roof. This movie is one big pain to sit through. I can't help but wonder why such big name actors signed on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was everyone who gave this a 7+ rating watching another film? If I ever meet the director I'm going to ask for the 2 1/4 hours of my life that he stole. After watching this I was hoping that his house gets hit by a falling planet. The lead character is a poor little rich girl who you want to slap to get her to buck up. Not sure how they got so many stars to appear in this drab, depressing, boring drama. It revolved around a wedding day reception full of well to do people. The bride obviously isn't that keen about getting married. There's a planet that is hurtling towards earth, but the experts say that it'll miss. That's about it. How can anyone make a film with a planet heading towards earth as boring as this is a real mystery to me. Maybe I'll try watching it stoned to see if that changes my perception of it. Then again, maybe I won't.</fullReview>

Why did he made such a long scenes, why? For example in one scene Kirsten Dunst looks at the sky for about 4 minutes, I mean WTF? This is not art, this is Tier's ego trying to tell us, "I want to be popular, I want to be cult..."

		<fullReview>I have not been a big fan of Lars von Trier, so I approached this movie with the idea that I would probably not like it. But, in a reversal of the, "I was looking forward to this, but was disappointed," syndrome, I was taken by this very much. Like a good novel that captures your attention in the first pages, this movie sucked me in with its rapturous overture, musically accompanied by the prelude to Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde." I can't recall any movie that uses this technique of presenting teaser images in an extended introduction. In the opening scene there is a long take of the face of a distressed woman (Kirsten Dunst); shortly we see dead birds falling from the sky, a woman in a wedding dress struggling against a train of (what is later revealed to be) large ropes of gray yarn. A woman slowly trudges across a golf green carrying a small boy where the flag pin on the green indicates it is the 19th hole--a hint that we are not to take things too literally here. The final shot of the overture has the earth being engulfed by a huge planet. These images are not just a burst of poetic imagery, they ultimately make sense.Some details. The movie is divided into two parts, the first concentrating on Justine (Kirsten Dunst), and the second on her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). It took me a while to sort out the relationships. To possibly save someone some time, the main players are: Justine's father Dexter (John Hurt), her mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), Claire's husband (Kiefer Sutherland), Claire's kid Leo (Cameron Spurr), Justine's husband Micheal (Alexander Skarsg?rd), and Justine's boss Jack (Stellan Skarsg?rd). Claire and her husband run a resort out of a castle (this was filmed at the stunning Tjolöholm Castle and gardens, in Halland, Sweden--it is a mini Versailles). Part one revolves around Justine's wedding reception at the castle. There is a lengthy scene that has Justine and her husband on the way to the reception in a stretch limo that is having a tough time navigating the tight turns. In this scene Justine seems to be the happy bride, but the movie has its title for a reason. As the wedding progresses Justine fights her melancholia, but she ultimately loses the battle. This movie details the devastating effects of depression most chillingly. When Michael finally admits to the failure of the marriage after the reception he says to Justine, "Things could have been different," to which Justine replies, "But Michael, what did you expect?" So, apparently this was not the first hint that Michael had of Justine's sickness. After the wedding Justine slips deeper into her melancholy, dragging everybody into it. How to deal with a loved one with such a problem?Part two concentrates on Claire, a practical organizer who obsesses that the wedding should proceed on a tight schedule. Claire's personality is in stark contrast to Justine. She is well adjusted and is happy with her husband and child. The proceedings play out against the backdrop of the certain calamity that the earth is about to be swallowed up by a giant rogue planet. Against this ultimate catastrophe, small daily events seem petty. What difference if someone guesses the number of beans in a jar, or if the wedding cake is cut on time? Von Trier is obviously using the encounter between the earth and the planet, called Melancholia, as a metaphor for life as he must sometimes see it--since all life ends in death, even with the earth being engulfed by the sun as it turns into a red giant, what significance does life have? It can't be asked for more from an artist than that he communicate his conceptions and demons, but I think von Trier could benefit from some existentialist philosophies.It is fascinating to watch the role reversals between Justine and Claire as the oncoming extinction draws near. Claire becomes increasingly anxious and panic stricken while Justine becomes more centered, happy that her tortured existence will end. The sisters do come together at the end; von Trier says that this is the happiest ending he has given to a movie.The filming with a hand-held camera made me a bit seasick. The jerkiness is exaggerated. In the interview with Trier on the DVD he addresses this. He feels that the effect adds an additional dynamic, provides a documentary feel, and results in more natural performances, since the actors don't know exactly where the camera is or when they are being filmed. He said that to avoid being disoriented you should focus on what the camera is focusing on, rather than focusing on the picture frame. I tried this on a second viewing, and it did make things better.There is a mixture of fact and fiction as far as the underlying science is concerned. Indeed such a planet as Melancholia would suck some of the earth's atmosphere away and there would be electrical phenomena, as presented. The probability of a rogue planet entering our solar system is vanishingly small, and if it did, there would be a lengthy warning. By the time of the wedding there would have been no other discussion but of the impending doom. The idea that such a huge planet as Melancholia, more that a thousand times the size of earth, could fly by earth only to be brought back for a collision is patently false. The earth's gravitational pull would not be that great.In any case, von Trier has given us something unique with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie, very well done, with comic scenes along with tragic scenes. I think the planet collision is a metaphoric expression of the depression/anxiety hit. In my opinion, this movie, is not as disturbing as Breaking the Waves or Dancing in the dark but it says a lot about how empty the life may be. It is a movie similar with Zentropa, although the SF part is different. Impressing subtle criticism of the suburban life, with the emptiness of the golf terrain, with how useless the pick-up truck can be, etc. Also, there is a contradiction between the over confidence in scientists optimism, and the actual facts, which lead the main man figure to leave this world when his family needed him most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The red planet has my vote if it can end this miserable film quickly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like another reviewer, I did not enjoy this movie or find much in the way of value in the plot or characters, all of which seemed very painfully self-absorbed and to be honest, tediously plodding and boring. I felt sorry for the actors, most of whom I have enjoyed in other properties. The overly-long opening montage with falling birds, the bridal Dunst in water holding her bouquet, space shots of the earth set to classical music, slow-mo shots of a mother's feet stuck in mud, then electric rays coming from Dunst's fingertips, all felt like intellectual artifice without any compelling plot or emotional engagement to go along with all of the sequential art house posing. Okay, a monstrous red death planet looks interesting on the big screen and wind-blown actresses in slow motion are somewhat chic from an art direction point of view, but after several minutes of watching unfolding special effects art pieces and enduring the angst and ennui of the cast, I kept wondering when I would start to care about any of this, or when the director would give me something or someone to engage me in this hodgepodge of imagery and boredom. (You are right, it never happened.)Unfortunately, the more one gets to know the characters, the more one roots for the swift aim of the red planet (Melancholia), so the endurance contest that is this trying film, will finally limp to some type of ending, and very soon.Plot-wise, we have a late limo, a late bride and groom, awful parents, a nagging sister, a work-obsessed boss, and a money-focused brother-in-law who all want to see the Dunst character "happy." Okay. There is also a cute nephew who is lucky enough to be able to sleep during the first half of the film. In the second half, we have a panicky sister....yawn. (Make sure you buy lots of coffee at the theater.)So, we find out that the bride is mentally ill, unstable, and has lapses. Okay. If so, then why is she promoted to an art director position by her boss? Yep, makes absolutely no sense. The approaching red death planet makes her nuttier. Okay, got it. (Check your watch here, it's almost over.)Did I existentially wish that I'd spent two-hours of my life and $11 on another film? Boy-howdy, you got that right. There might be a red planet bearing down on me right now and I would not want this film to be my last memory of life on earth.</fullReview>

It upsets me further when it appears no one cares. "Dancer In The Dark" is a phenomenal film. The improvisation with dialog is believable and incisive. The dialog here (as well as the situations) is melodramatic and just inane. It's only saving grace is the acting and visuals. The pacing is so slow that I had to fast forward through it (saw it on iTunes).The idea of manifesting depression as an audience experience is an interesting one, but ultimately unrewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that in its first 10 minutes makes you sit through virtually the whole of the Tristan and Isolde Prelude to images of planets in slow, slow motion better be good.Well, the acting was OK - if you're into a Gothic portrayal of a pretty rich young woman, racked with ennui yet oversexed, with an affinity with horses, the ability to "know things," blah blah blah - already it's sounding tired, is it not? Something of a bodice ripper, and something of the exaggerated faux-worldliness-without-having-seen-the-world-yet that adolescents are typically enamored of.The speed of action barely picks up from the snail-paced opening. Half of what happens is out-of-context flashes of odd behavior, there simply to prove how screwed up some of the protagonists are.Then there's the overarching "world's collide" theme that pits nerdy, unintuitive, science-addled male against "knowing" female (and horses). Yawn. This over-the-top backdrop to the tale serves as nothing more than a desperate device to make it interesting. But even that fails.What made me sit through it then? 1. Decent acting, 2. A JUST-adequate sense of mystery and suspense that made me want to know what would happen. That's it. And what happened? The world ended - with a pretentious, forgettable whimper.Kirsten Dunst deserved the Best Actress award that she got at Cannes 2011 for her role in Melancholia. Good on her - but she could have achieved a lot more for her efforts if she'd chosen a role in a film that had more substance than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the epitome of a movie that you don't go to watch to have a good time with. It's about the emotions of human nature and depression that takes most of time during a wedding ceremony, and it's a boring party at that. Which is why it isn't surprising why Justine played by Kirsten Dunst isn't enjoying the party that cost a fortune. There is few artistic cliché type of music to show how artsy the movie is. The movie is basically almost about nothing and how the meaning of life is nothing. Movies like "Drive" for example has proved artistic movies don't have to be boring. That isn't the case for this, I really don't think Lars Von Trier is a genius like some critics claim, he might think a bit different compared to average people but he isn't a movie genius. It is just shot in what the director thinks is artistic in his perspective and moves very slow. The first hour of this movie is a wedding ceremony and there is almost no plot, just people having a boring wedding ceremony and the family arguing amongst each other. The intro is the best part of this movie although that ain't saying much and it basically shows the end of the world and the rest of the movie goes about showing how it got to that point with hardly any plot. And I thought "Antichrist" was a boring movie, this movie is just so darn dull I kept wanting it to just end. The only thing I give props on this movie is how it makes the actors and actress ugly and not super glamorous in a lot of movies they were in. Watching this movie was like watching paint dry...Ouch I know. If this is a art film than it proves that it really isn't that difficult to direct a art film. I once saw a cup of urine at a museum and it was there as art, everyone has there own perception of art and this movie was like that cup of urine. Even Kirsten Dunst's boobs can't make up for how dull this movie is, not that I ever found that actress to be attractive or that good of a actress. At least this time the director doesn't try to be all grotesque with violence and has a bunch of very sexual parts in there while trying to push the limit to prove how artistic he is. Lars Von Trier shows once again shows that he is a Nihilist and tries to show that perspective on screen in the dullest way possible. It isn't clear with the characters emotions and the reason behind it, although there is. Like how this movie is about life and how it's meaningless as the end of the world gets closer. And I am not ruining anything since it shows the earth getting destroyed in the beginning scene. This movie is like the them of the movie, no purpose. Well at least the acting is pretty good especially from Charlotte Gainsbourg. You know how when there is a very depressed individual in the group and ruins the mood, that is how this movie felt like. There is recollection and meanings behind the characters but you could careless about that with the direction of it all. One thing I got that the director wanted to show was the two opposites of the sisters, one having nothing to lose thus she is a melancholic and the other having something to lose because she is aware of who she is and is fine with that. Like human nature we all long for something and that message of the movie was interesting, just presented in a boring manner. Well I know I will never ever being seeing this movie again.2.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review of Melancholia Recommendation: Avoid at all cost.Why? It's an art movie. It's a pretentious art movie. It's an annoying pretentious art movie.The opening scene is some kind of avant garde photographic opus. Complete with loud orchestral music. During the wedding dinner, the photography was terribly obtrusive. The DOP (Director of Photography) showcased his shaky hand-held camera skills.It was annoyingly shaky and distracted from the dialogue. Moreover, the camera kept zooming unnecessarily.Walked out after 30 minutes and dropped in on a showing of Immortals. Now, there was some decent CGI and plot.IMO, the art movie seems pretentious when presenting human emotions. This film really turned me off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars von Trier used to be one of my all-time favorite filmmakers. I still quite value his early films like The Element of Crime and Europa. His Dogma-esque films like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark I have lost most interest in them (I haven't seen either in over a decade). His most recent films haven't impressed me at all. His latest, Melancholia, doesn't impress me either. In fact, much like Antichrist, I find it quite beautiful, but a little boring and entirely vapid. Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg star as sisters. The first half of the film concerns Dunst's opulent but disastrous wedding. The second half concerns Gainsbourg's hysterical fear of a rogue planet, named Melancholia (apparently the lead singer of the band Evanescence won a contest or something), which is quickly approaching the Earth. Gainsbourg's husband (Kiefer Sutherland), a knowledgeable man, swears the calculations show it won't hit the Earth, but Gainsbourg isn't so sure. It's weird that I watched this the day after I saw another semi-sci-fi film about an approaching planet, Another Earth. Much like Another Earth, Melancholia pretty much ignores science in favor of using the premise as a metaphor. The thing is, I can understand the metaphor in Another Earth. In Melancholia, I don't really get what Lars von Trier is going for. My first impression, though, is that his point is bitches be all crazy. That is, after all, his point in every one of his films since Breaking the Waves. It may sound like I hated it. I didn't. The only film I've hated of his really was Epidemic. Melancholia is quite gorgeous to look at, and it was rather hypnotic. Perhaps a second viewing will elucidate the film more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warnings and musings from a romantic melancholic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this in the theatre because I read good critics and because the subject matter appealed to me. I tried to keep my expectations low, but I was disappointed anyway. Disappointed might not be a strong enough word. Here are my honest impressions, 2 hours after seeing Melancholia, but first what is it about? Melancholia refers to the name of a recently discovered planet that's on a collision trajectory with Earth. It might or might not hit, but it if it does, it's the end of the world. The film takes mostly place at a very fancy manor, complete with stables and 18-hole golf course, during a wedding reception and then in part 2, some unspecified time later. It focuses mostly on 2 sisters: the younger blonde sister being the bride (Kirsten Dunst) who seems to struggle with depression, and the older married sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg).The start is pretty powerful stuff with super slow-motion scenes depicting unconventional, dramatic vignettes of the end of the world. Those are not your standard, spectacular scenes, they're more like paintings featuring the characters or planets. However, even in the intro, some scenes just linger a bit too much. There's some kind of slightly distorted, older recording of a classical musical piece playing in the background (Tristan and Isolde), that will be recurring throughout and basically the only music you'll hear. This lingering scenes (without slow-motion after the intro) get worse as time passes on. I understand the need to take this approach sometimes, but in this, the pace is so slow, can stop on such trivial things that it becomes tedious and boring. This tedium is aggravated by the almost constant lack of music and/or outright silences. Emotionally, the movie felt empty and disconnected, and seriously, with the impending end of the world, it shouldn't. The director (and writer) likely wanted to avoid melodrama, but by doing do evacuated most of the emotional impact. As for any romantic drama, you can mostly forget about it. There's a few affectionate moments, but mostly I found the film rather cynical and very nihilistic. Those don't necessarily make for a bad film, but don't watch this expecting romance.Kirsten Dunst was praised for her role, perhaps unjustly so. Basically, she plays a very depressive woman. It's the art of smiling with your mouth but not with your eyes, keeping them blank. Yes, she shows vulnerability, dares to be a little topless, she does the job, but it's not great or very demanding. I found her sister (Gainsbourg) and the sister's husband (Kiefer Sutherland) better. Unfortunately, his subtle performance was undermined by, what I found, an out-of-character "exit". The kid, who should have been the emotional anchor, was expressionless in what I would call "under-acting" as compared to over-acting. I went with a friend, and I asked him what he actually liked about it, because he did like it somewhat. He told me there were some nice images. I replied quickly that there was the intro and the moon clearing scene with Kirsten Dunst, but that, for me, nice pictures were not enough to make a good film. I would add now that there were a few other nice looking scenes such as those showing Melancholia or the bird's eye view of horses galloping in the mist. However, besides those, the camera work was pretty average if not amateurish with the hand-held shaky cam and the mostly static scenes often overstaying their welcome.I thought the subject matter of this film was fascinating and there was such great potential for something wonderful and thought-provoking. What would you do in such a situation? If you knew that in a year or two, everything could seriously end? Not talking about that 2012 Mayan end that has no basis in scientific fact. Let's imagine a chorus-type of film like Magnolia or Crash with several intimate, personal stories. In fact, let's just imagine one or two personal stories, but well told, emotionally-gripping with stuff actually happening. You won't get this in Melancholia. I think most people will be bored senseless. In fact, several people walked out during the screening, and I heard others saying they were thinking of doing so when the credits were rolling. In conclusion, I found Melancholia to just be so very dull and such a waste of a promising concept. Neither the stunning beginning nor the shocking ending could save the rest of this disappointing feature.Rating: 2 out of 10 (one extra point for some of the images)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a 'movie' it is visual constipation for people who have lost the plot as far as creativity is concerned. I found it absolutely insulting too, to people who seriously suffer from strong depression because it trivialises the malady that inflicts so many by turning the second half of the film into a hypothetical ridiculous story that bears nothing to the truth of mental illness. This is a 'film' in two halves. The first half is a wedding scene, which is visually engaging because Kirsten Dunst is spectacular as the depressive bride and so mesmerisingly beautiful. We see her decline as the wedding progresses, but Von Trier does not take us on any journey to find out the root of her illness so that we could learn more about her circumstances and her journey. There are so many interesting characters in the first half, portrayed by immensely engaging actors - oh, how I wanted to know more. Then we are taken into part two, with the most boring of all characters, the sister of the bride and her family. The bride by now is in serious melt down, but what is more problematic is that the end of the world is about to happen. I do not understand what Von Trier is trying to give his viewer with this metaphor. At a very juvenile level, we understand that the 'normal' people go doolally as the end approaches and the depressive seems to handle it all very well - she does think life is evil after all, which she expresses to justify her relief that the world is at its end. One can't help but feel that Von Trier must suffer from depression and this has on one side made him creative but also in Melancholia, he is using it to portray his own limited take on the world we live in. As the end approaches, I would have been more happy to watch the spin of a washing machine. The film becomes so mind blowingly dull for a very long time. Also a total waste of a film by a fantastic director who could have explored depression on a much deeper portrayal instead of this kindergarten idea of nihilism. Von Trier may be banned from the Cannes Film Festival due to his unfortunate remarks; however I would have had him banned for making this waste of time film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With only the barest of plots and no concept of continuity this is worse than most high school films with little brothers for extras. Obviously the directory has no concept of a story board or any device to maintain any form of continuity. Many cuts look as though they are mistakes. I truly feel sorry for the actors as they tried to make a good film but their efforts were completely destroyed during post production. At $10 for pay-per-view, at least I saved $4 off of theater prices. Which explains why this was previewed as PPV. It's going to bomb at the theater.Save your money and see something, anything else. This is as complete a waste of time as I've ever had to endure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not going to rate the movie because all i could bare is 15 minutes and then turned it off. I can tell you what put me off the movie, over dramatic arty start, slow start, shaky/arty camera-work.There is a reason why movies aren't generally made like this, movies like this have a very limited appeal. Its rare i turn off a movie, big fan of john hurt and kiefer sutherland as actors, they usually put in a good performance, in john hurts case, usually a great performance.Maybe its not fair to review this movie, as a big movie fan and one who likes to have his mind expanded through this powerful medium, just want willing to sit through this...guess i should have known by the name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the rating, and then I saw the movie. I really couldn't understand the rating. So I read most of the reviews. Wow, I must admit that I'm very confused. How can anyone call this movie artistic? First of all, I wanted to see the movie because of the actors/actresses. And I also love artistic movies, and that's what I was expecting to see. But GOD, how could these actors, especially Kiefer Sutherland or John Hurt, agree to play in this movie. Here's my understanding of this film: All the characters are either unstable/crazy, or they make no sense at all. You can't in any way sympathize with any of these characters. Too much of the movie is filled by these characters staring at whatever.Shaky camera for too long and for most parts of the film, too much that makes you feel dizzy and sick, that you need to NOT to look at the screen for awhile.Too many scenes of craziness and at the same time they are so slow that you just want to forward them as fast as you can.The storyline is about the end of the world, which should make you sad when it happens. It's amazing that after more than 2 hours watching, the last 2 minutes, when Melancholia collides into earth, you're going to be very happy. Because the movie actually ends.DO NOT watch this movie, DO NOT waist your time. The only thing you'll see is hours of boringness, meaningless and dizziness pictures.OR just watch the last 2 minutes...</fullReview>

The story flow is ridiculously executed, at times, I kept saying to myself during the screening, who in hell would put such moronic ideas together and for what purpose. The storyline is too fragmented and lame. This is by far one of the worse movies I have EVER seen. DO NOT WATCH THIS LAME and DUMB story, if you want to keep some level of sanity about your movie experiences. If there was a (0) rating, it would probably describe what this movie deserved!

		<shortDescription>bad day at the office for great director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family wedding goes badly awry when the bride gives in to her depression, while global catastrophe waits in the wings.As a Lars von Trier fan, I came with great expectations. The opening is self-consciously derivative of Festen, but that only upped my anticipation. The awkward exchanges and stilted dialogue at first seem part of the overall theme, but then it quickly becomes clear that they are part of a larger failure of vision. Kirsten Dunst simply mopes her way through the film, and because we have never seen her do that, it gets labelled 'fresh.' The exchange of hostilities between John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling in their wedding speeches comes off as two actors having a bad day at an improv session. Keiffer Sutherland has garnered praise for what is the most convincing performance in the film. But as he plays a man trying to hold a large event involving various personalities together, I think his motivation comes less from the fictional wedding and more from trying to keep the film itself on track. There is a puzzle to be pieced together - an 18-hole golf course has a 19th hole; of the three siblings with British parents, two have American accents and only one British. But these seem random quirks, rather than part of an overall treatise.The director apparently battled his recurring depression during this film. It is an awful condition and he has my sympathies. We have all worked with people suffering from depression. We recognise their pain, but what we don't do is pretend that they are capable of putting in a good shift at work while they are ill. For some artists depression has been a catalyst to great work, but for the vast majority it is a debilitating condition. This film is a meandering, centerless failure from a filmmaker capable of so much more. I hope he gets back on form soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Lars von Trier: Pretentious, boring and long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching the movie I knew absolutely nothing about it. I watched it because a friend said he saw it in cinema and liked it and because Dunst looks yummy on the poster :)Right from the first minute I said to myself: Man, this movie looks so pretentious. Actually, the very first shot of the film immediately reminded me of the first shot of "Free Zone (2005)" (Natalie Portman crying in one long, endless, sequence) by another pretentious guy - Amos Gitai. It wasn't until 8 minutes in, that I got the "seal of approval", when the megalomaniac caption "Lars von Trier's Melancholia" appeared - and then it all made sense.Needless to say, I don't have much good to say about the movie. I forced myself to watch almost till half the movie. As expected, it was pretentious, boring and painful. The only good thing I have to say about this movie is that some specific shots were very well photographed and they looked more like a painting: The slow motion shots at the beginning, also I liked the specific aerial shot between the trees of the horse riding - very well executed. And the last one is a shot of Dunst naked - again, looks like a painting and Dunst is a very attractive woman.SPOILER (sort of): As for the "plot", well, if you want to see a much better film with a similar theme, watch Last Night (1998).Didn't Lars von Trier say a few years back that he's quitting? Too bad he didn't keep his word.1.5/10 Typical Lars von Trier: Pretentious, boring and long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, depressing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Life is only on Earth. And not for long. ¨ Melancholia as its name suggests is a very depressing movie starring Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg as two troubled sisters. Danish director Lars von Trier (Antichrist and Dogville) suffered from depression himself and decided to use his personal experience and share his emotions with the viewer in this melancholic film. The story is interesting at some points and the visuals are really stylish, but I am not a big fan of these dark, depressing movies so I didn't have a pleasant experience. Lars von Trier wrote the screenplay himself as he usually does with his work and filmed the movie in Sweden so the scenery is actually quite beautiful, but the story and characters are too dark for my personal taste. The film is really slow and consists of two parts, one focusing on each sister. The long opening scene set the mood for the entire movie with music from Wagner's ¨Tristan and Isolde.¨ You can fall asleep with how slow the pace is. This is definitely not a movie for everyone, but those of you who enjoy these depressing movies might have a good time it thanks to the great visual style and the psychological study of the characters. I understood the message that the director was trying to get across, and I actually enjoyed his work in Dogville, but I just wasn't entertained with Melancholia and found time moving so slowly that the film seemed like it was never going to end. A much better film dealing with depression that I recommend and also came out this year is The Beaver starring Mel Gibson. His performance is much more deserving of recognition than Kirsten Dunst's work in this film for which she won the best actress award in the Cannes Festival.The movie opens with a long eight minute scene where we are introduced to some of the scenes that occur during the movie in a very artistic style, like if we were viewing a live painting. We also see how a planet (which we later learn is called Melancholia) is headed towards Earth and collides with it. Then the movie begins with the first part called Justine and it focuses on her (Kirsten Dunst) wedding reception. She seems happy at first as she kisses her new husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), but we can tell there is something off about her. She is trying to hide her depression with fake smiles, but she can't take it for long. Her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and her brother-in-law, John (Kiefer Sutherland), have spent a lot of money on the wedding reception and are a bit disappointed with the way things are turning out. Their parents, Dexter (John Hurt) and Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), who are divorced have a discussion in front of everyone, so that doesn't help either. Justine can't keep on pretending to be happy and all of a sudden tells her boss, Jack (Stellan Skarsgard) that he is a selfish person, she ignores Michael, and ends up having sex with Jack's nephew, Tim (Brady Corbet). The second part of the story is titled Claire and it takes place at their residence a couple of months after the disastrous wedding. Everyone is aware now that a planet seems to be heading towards Earth, although John (as the scientist he is) assures them that it will just pass by. Justine's depression is getting worse and worse, but she seems to not care much about the possible collision. It's Claire's turn now to suffer anxiety and panic attacks as she fears for the worst.It's interesting to see how von Trier plays out this film, making us see how unbalanced Justine is at her wedding. Kirsten Dunst captures her depression really well (although I don't think it is Oscar worthy if you ask me). Then in the second part of the film we see how all of a sudden the table turns and Justine seems to be the stronger of the two. Justine goes from needing to being taken care of to caring for her sister Claire when she can't deal with the issue. Even John who seemed to be always in control ends up taking the easy way out. Lars von Trier knew exactly what he was doing because suffering from depression himself he knew that melancholic people tend to deal better under pressure. Kirsten Dunst really transmits this idea through her character, but I still think there have been better and more deserving works this year. I really wasn't entertained with this movie, and I don't plan on ever seeing it again. I couldn't recommend it, although I understand all the buzz it is receiving with the critics. The movie was melancholic, it did its job, but I am just not the kind of guy who is interested in these movies. I was plain and simply bored with Melancholia.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Insignificant We Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unstable and depressive Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) arrive late in the expensive wedding party promoted by her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her wealthy brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland) in their real estate. Justine is promoted by her boss Jack (Stellan Skarsg?rd) to art director and the affectionate Michael is very happy. However, Justine's bitter mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling) makes acid comments destroying the happiness of her daughter. Sooner Justine is depressed again and she offends Jack and loses her job and she decides to split from Michael.She stays with Claire, John and her nephew Leo (Cameron Spurr) recovering from her break down. Meanwhile the erratic blue planet Melancholia is in collision route with Earth, but John is calm and believes in the predictions of the scientists that the planet will pass by Earth. Claire is afraid and fears the end of the world, but John calms her down. Until..."Melancholia" is a depressive film by Lars von Trier that shows how insignificant we are and incapable to control our fate. Divided in two parts, the first one (Justine) shows the relationship of a dysfunctional family on the night of the wedding of Justine. Kirsten Dunst performs a character that is not able to be happy even on the day of her wedding. The bitterness of her mother and the indifference of her father explain the behavior of Justine. The second part (Claire) is better and better and shows how vulnerable the human race is.The cinematography and soundtrack of "Melancholia" are very beautiful. Lars von Trier is among my favorite directors and once again he makes an original and beautifully crafted movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Melancolia" ("Melancholia")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A serious, hard-to-watch, worthwhile movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not an easy movie to watch. It's tough from the very beginning - a prologue prequel with music by Wagner and an apocalyptic perspective. Any movie in which dead birds fall from the sky in the first three minutes is not going to be light and fluffy.But this movie, about deep melancholia experienced by Justine (Kirstin Dunst), the principal character, and the melancholia of the potential end of life itself, is an artistic triumph. Great acting, great cinematography, great music. Even the sometimes puzzling plot - the post-prologue movie comes in two halves - is engrossing and pregnant with underlying meaning. The three principal characters all represent a point on the compass of human feelings: Depression, anxiety, and something resembling nice normalcy. How each deals with the apocalypse is a well-threaded effort.While the movie is dark, it is by no means humorless. The wedding that occupies the first half of the movie has a great deal of fun alongside the depression.Not a movie for everyone, and a bit too long, but if you watch it, stick with it. You may not want to see it twice but you could be glad you saw it once.</fullReview>

The first 45 minutes could have been totally removed and cut out and you wouldn't have missed anything. A total 2 hour waste of time and if you paid, your money also. If I had actually paid to see this, I would have been extremely angry &amp; asked for my money back. Luckily someone else paid for it on Pay Per View or I would have refused to pay. As far as the Reviews on IMDb, There is no way to explain this unless they came from people involved in the movie. This is just a bad mistake of a movie and the director, &amp; writer should be held accountable. There, I've made my 10 lines so this can be posted.</fullReview>

I have to say that the exaggerated use of camera movements, shake and out of focus will give you motion sickness during the entire movie, this should be clearly stated somewhere so that you don't waste your money.About the action, there is none and this movie is all about the two sisters and how they think, skip it and if you really want to see it get ready for a lot of camera shake with no reason or value.The imagery is nice if you can ignore the shake and the two main leads are really good, unfortunately, because of the artistic style you can't really appreciate almost anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully Disturbing Art House Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***No Spoilers*** Being a huge fan of Lars Von Trier's work I was highly anticipating this film. It was released in cinemas on 29 May 2011 in the Czech Republic on 12 screens as well as other locations like Denmark, Finland and Italy. It soon will come to theaters in the US. Luckily we live in the time that we do and this movie can be streamed before its US theatrical release. I took advantage of this and greatly enjoyed watching this film from the comfort of my own home.I loved Antichrist. In my opinion it is Trier's best work. It was a very disturbing film, yet it had a very strong message with hidden meanings and was all around a beautiful poetic piece of work.Melancholia also is a beautiful film, though I believe I expected more. Antichrist is very deep and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat because so much is happening and you must decipher the message and meaning of the film. Melancholia is very slow and drawn out. Lars Von Trier did this due to the high anticipation of what will happen, and if it will happen. Trier used the characters anxiety and built upon that and made the viewer feel that anxiety too. Just like Antichrist, Melancholia is a feeling. Your not just watching a movie, eating popcorn and drinking a pop, you are feeling this film.Just a quick summary for those who don't know, Melancholia is a planet which is seemingly coming closer to Earth. This phenomenon happens when Justine (Kirsten Dunst) has just been married to Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd). Justine's sister, Clair (Charlotte Gainsbourg), her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland), and Justine and Clair's mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling) greatly put pressure on Justine to have this perfect wedding. Justine is not very interested in the wedding reception and seems to come in and out of reality. She is not the type of person to have such a large wedding because she doesn't care. She is a wild girl who seems to have been roped into marrying Michael and marrying into this new family which she is nothing like. There is a lot of drama in this film and for the first half, Melancholia is a back story which the viewer patiently waits for.The cast is amazing and works well together. I really enjoyed Kiefer Sutherlands character. Kirsten Dunst did an amazing job, however her performance seems unbalanced at times, though the character she is playing is unbalanced.After viewing this film I was left speechless due to the raw power of the cast and the images of the film itself. However it made me feel very uneasy, disturbed and very anxious. I immediately thought, "I never want to watch that again". Yet I cannot get it out of my mind and I watched it again later that night. This movie will deeply leave an impression on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise, but fails to live up to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an Armageddon like we've never seen, and the looming planet of Melancholia is the most beautiful way the world could end. There is no anarchy. No one runs down the street attempting to escape a flood, blizzard, or the Empire State Building that is about to come down on their head. Instead it is an account of a family facing the end of the world; some are left only with dread, others have faith they will survive unscathed. Dunst does a great job, although there are a few exposing scenes that I could've done without. (Alright already, we understand she's paralyzed by depression, but we don't need to see her sister bathe her.) Bottom line: The premise amazing, and although the movie is painted beautifully, Von Trier does a poor job telling what could have been an amazing story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and irritating beyond belief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** I'm always interested in how many people read these reviews. If you read this, please leave your rating. Thanks.*** Addendum: there is something very SUSPICIOUS with the reviews of this movie. Every person who writes a negative review gets overwhelming disapproval, but from everyone I've spoken to about this movie, it should be the opposite. This movie is a snooze fest. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. Only film snobs and people associated with this movie would claim they like it. Hmmm.... **************************How this movie ever got made I'll never understand.If the whole point of going to the movies is entertainment, then this movie fails dismally. It starts off at a wedding, and it takes agonizingly long to get us there, similar to the ridiculously long carriage ride in Charles Dickens' novel, "Bleak House". Well, at least Dickens had an interesting story! The Kate Hudson character suffers from... you guessed it, Melancholy. Wow, talk about subtlety. Her melancholy makes her so irritating and slows down the plot to such an extent that at times I wondered when this train wreck of a movie would ever (mercifully) end.So here's the summary, folks: the lead actress' character is irritating, boring, and dismal. The people around her can only react to this lethargic lump of a plot... that plods along endlessly at the wedding. Finally the tragic wedding ends, and the movie continues to plod along like a plow horse that hasn't been fed in a week.I kept expecting a "big bang" of a finish. Nope. While the end was at least the best part (because it was just a minute or so), it certainly wasn't worth the other two hours of torture it took to get there.To show how bad this movie was, how completely disassociated I was from what was going on, I initially wrote this: "How could they rope a great actress like Kate Hudson into a movie like this?", not realizing that the actress is Kirsten Dunst!This is very telling.ADDENDUM: It took me over a year to test a theory of mine. My goal was to speak with twenty people who saw this movie, a surprisingly hard task, but I finally completed my un-scientific (but accurate) survey: 19 of 20 people told me this was one of the worst movies they had ever seen.19 of 20Some raved on and on about how they despised every bit of the movie. Eight people said it was so boring they wanted to leave the theatre. If I included myself in the survey, that would have been 10 (both my friend and I both wanted to leave; ironically, neither one of us realized how bored the other was, so each of us remained silent instead of suggesting we cut our losses).What's very suspicious about the reviews of this movie is that they are completely out of synch with popular opinion. I've proved that, at least to myself, with this (long time coming) survey. It's apparent that most viewers hated this movie, and yet you can read about how some people supposedly liked it. Who are these people? Friends of the director? Isn't it odd so many of these positive reviews come from that part of Europe???One last thing, it's also highly suspicious that 84 people would have read my review and a full half of them would bother to give a thumbs up or down. In all the reviews I've ever done, never more than 10 people have ever bothered to say if the review was helpful or not. But in this case, this highly suspicious case, forty some people took the time to say the review was not helpful.Odd? I'd say statistically impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sound of void washing itself empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one probably working today can imbue the image of a bride pissing in the middle of a golf course with the afterglow of existential soul-searching like Trier does here - well, there was Peter Greenaway at one point but I haven't kept track. Side by side the romantic, the visceral, the transcendent, each one perversely subverting the others. But, having searched and yearned, eventually with Trier we arrive at nothing. Nothing in the predominantly Western, post-enlightenment worldview that has pushed god to the side and seated the mind in his place. Nothing is too much for Trier then, because nothing satisfies the mind; everything that is touched by humanity is shown to be randomly bubbling up from some cold, infertile void.But this is the thing with Trier, why it's so troubling to dismiss him; even though he makes art about a meaningless world - and so why pay attention? - he remains a powerful poet of cinema. So he is an anti-Tarkovsky, which perhaps explains why he opens the film with The Hunters in the Snow - a painting used in Solyaris - burning, and why horses are forced to kneel in the face of petulant violence. Whereas Tarkovsky understood the universe to be centered inside, and used that to sculpt space and metaphor from that center, Trier is grounded nowhere; so he resolves to orbit from one periphery to the next, nicely framing for us anxieties that we can relate to but with no deeper insight of their mechanism.But now and then he works from a powerful set of ideas. Here it is the mirrored metaphor; the pain and suffering of life on earth as mirrored on the cosmic level, and our hope that this suffering looming above will just pass us by. It is not sci-fi in any way you may recognize, or anymore than Tree of Life is.It does not work like that, of course, that is a given. So we are placed in the shoes of the woman - the bride in her wedding reception, where life is ritually supposed to become orderly, assuring, meaningful - and forced to make our way for the occasion wearing a forced smile, and hoping the pain will just pass us by. Yes, it does not work like that. The mother is haughty and domineering, the father sloppy and indiscreet. Everyone else is busy performing their roles, going through motions, speeches, confrontations which are often funny but always grueling to see. So,with the soul unsupervised, the perfect occasion for happiness inexplicably crumbles from inside.The second part is about the sister, who already has the perfectly happy life or is supposed to. But again, of course, it doesn't work. Suffering, uncertainty hangs above that we can't simply brush off. So it is the dawning of acceptance that governs this part of the film; but, properly at least for Trier and in a way that should make sense, we're shown the impossibility of that acceptance. Faces are increasingly bewildered, affections grow distant, motions agitated.A lot of my distaste for what Trier does, is exemplified in a scene where the depressed sister confronts the other; instead of reciprocating the nurture and support, however obligatory it may have seemed at the time, she preys on her weakness. Why drink wine in the veranda and pretend none of this is going to happen? Why not? But the acceptance is handled with so much nihilism, a sort of comfortable noncommittal, that I want to take a step back. No equanimity flows from Trier's emptiness, and so the vision is useless for me. I want films embedded in a world that matters in some way. Yes, we're all going to face an inscrutable fate, but it's one thing to frame this with compassion, another thing altogether to frame with contempt or cold satisfaction.So it is apt to compare with Tree of Life on more than just the cosmic level of wheels whirring life into pattern; there is the sense of emptying out, the search for a true face that restores meaning. Malick goes the extra mile though, he reconciles into the impermanence of all things and from there a deep, loving humanity. Trier is simply left aghast at it. Sex is a vice and the mind is unable to cope; so he merely casts the characters away at the precipice. But not before ironically rendering human faith as a magical cave made from fire sticks.Oh, he captures the drab, grueling unlife of depression well, no wonder as he knows from personal experience. And a google search seems to yield a nod at Filippino filmmaker Lav Diaz, that was pretty unexpected.There are aesthetically-minded pleasures though that you should see; planets caressing each other like faces below, a bird's eye view of horses galloping. Some of it borders on kitsch when Kirsten Dunst is photographed naked beneath the moonglow, the schadenfreude is so earnestly conceived.And there is the parting image; I don't know how much of it was the theater, technology, but it swell up into the most deafening, soul-crushing crescendo. I could feel particles being dislocated inside of me. But considering what comes before, it's not something I wanted to swim into but let wash. It's fitting for Trier though, the wagnerian sound of the void washing life empty.It is a powerful work, don't just take it lightly. But I urge you to meditate against it. Oh yes, it is all going to end sooner or later. But, as a principle, I urge you to never settle for a destructive void in your life: in the midst of blistering destruction, try to see around you what the Eastern mystics knew as the universe of 10,000 beautiful things trampled by god Shiva in his final dance. Let yourself be filled with a profound sadness that is joy for the 10,000 beautiful things around you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow &amp; annoying to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to forward through many of the scenes to try to understand where the director/writer wanted to take the viewers. Nowhere. The attempt to display the character as depressed and emotionless didn't really work. I would know. It was a bit over the top and exaggerated. The main character's obscene acts in the movie are not that of a depressed person but that of a hateful and angry person. The sex scene is when I knew that the director was trying too hard but failed. The movie was recommended to me online as one of the movies that truly captured the essence of human emotion. Yet, it was far from that. When the viewer notices the character trying to look more and more sad, the movie becomes harder and harder to watch.No need to watch. You won't miss anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of this movie is thought provoking, and if you have little imagination, you could come up with concept, ideas, character development and so much that could be put together to make an amazing movie!Well.. this doesn't do any of that.-- SPOILERS --A random wedding with no importance to the plot of the movie. A character, whose motivations are left as an unknown without care, a sudden realization of a big event and yet, nothing really happens. There are lots of things that don't even make sense in this movie, as to why the main character says she "knows things", why she is super depressive when the plot wants to try and make us believe it knows what its doing with the story and then she isn't.My main problem with this movie is the fact that the sister (?) of the main character knows what will happen and says she wants to, but then Kristen says "what a stupid idea", and then she goes outside and does a stick-thing that doesn't make sense.. which is even more stupid. Oh, and that they wanted her to appear naked on a river bank or something.. that's probably the whole reason for this movie and her character being "sick".An artsy attempt at wasting people's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg's acting is superb, especially during the last half.Some call Melancholia 'slow' and a 'bore', specifically Part One. This is clearly not the type of movie they would enjoy. As for you, consider a film in which characters who have been completely fleshed out (off screen, mind you) interact with one another. With a few of them comes baggage and unresolved issues. Part One is an exploration of human interaction--the kind that remains behind closed doors--while Part Two is an journey into people's reactions to sudden events as well as their handling of them. Does this sound like something you would enjoy? If not, carry on. Melancholia has enough negative reviews as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Emotional Impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me of an updated version of "On The Beach" on how people deal with the understanding that death will be coming by a certain hour. Unlike "On The Beach", however, the viewer does not know if the the collision with Melancholia is actually going to happen. Knowing the premise of the story before seeing it, I was indeed confused as to why only the two sisters appeared frightened while everyone else at the wedding was having a good time and talking about the future. This confused me until it was made to understand that the scientific community concluded the planet was going to pass by without incident while the usual unreliable sources on the internet were predicting the planet's doom.It was then when we got to share in the apprehension of actually not knowing - which I think was the real beauty of the story. Not knowing is sometimes more frightening than knowing the actual truth.It reminded me when I was in my late twenties. I was starting to face some of the demons we all have hidden inside ourselves. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan triggered something inside of me and I was able to transfer my fears of what I was having difficulty trying to face by creating something more frightening to be scared about - nuclear war. I kept on sensing the world as being on the brink without most other people wanting to recognize it - just as it appeared with the two sisters in the movie. That included the thought that our leaders were acting as if nothing was wrong just to prevent mass panic.That made the film even more haunting because of I had experienced a sense of knowing something totally terrifying that others didn't, irrational as it was. But even if you didn't have your own mid life crisis to deal with, this movie will keep you riveted for it being so real and not one of those end of the world scare flicks with a Bruce Willis to save the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful portrait of depression and anxiety</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier presents a hauntingly beautiful insight into the brain of a depressed person and one with Anxiety.He goes step-by-step through the phases of mania and lethargy, the rising feeling of angst and panic in both sister characters, and in terms of psychology- related pathologies. I find especially striking the end where both sisters sit in a house that gives no protection, waiting for the world to end. This is one of the most beautiful symbols of how these illnesses can literally end a person's world from the inside- by them ending their life. If you don't feel like being depressed- don't watch this movie. However if you've ever been depressed or anxious and wonder if anyone else knows what that feels like- watch this movie and you'll see that other people do understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a small scale world collapsing in itself ... or ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have two reviews for this movie.The first review: Melancholia is a small scale world collapsing in itself.Can't abstain from connecting it with Lynch's Lost Highway because is about the same thing, madness as chaos. Lynch's universe is a supernova where time and space collapse on the song of the siren. But chaos can't come without invitation. If you remember the scene: Fred Madison: "How did you get inside my house?" Mystery Man: "You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I am not wanted."In Melancholia, Justine also invites chaos. The scene where she notice Antares is actually an invitation. Chaos is invited in. From this point on we just have to wait for the end of the world to come. As in Lost Highway the end is at the beginning of the movie. We know from the beginning that the world ends. No happy ending because depression is just about ending. Like the planet Melancholia, it hides behind the sun (see the second part - Claire) and when it comes order stops and no magic cave can't protect you.In the beginning of this review I said that it's about a small scale world .. it's, of course about Justine's world. World means order though, and Claire is the symbol for order in Justine's life. That's why what we see is how Melancholia smashes Claire's world. Claire is Justine's connection with reality. When Claire is defeated, Justine's world can collapse, and end which Justine, as a latent suicidal, welcomes. There are some instance of Claire's defeat in the first part of the movie (the inability of Claire to help Justine to start her life - here the wedding is a symbol for life). These instances multiplies in the second part culminating with the scene when Claire can't cross the bridge. This means that she is trapped and defeated. The chaos is there and she can't escape .. Justine was already there (she couldn't cross the bridge twice, early in the movie). Actually here the village is the outside world, the world of the living. We should remember that only Justine's world is collapsing. Melancholia is just Justine's world. She is the only character of the movie. The others are just symbols. Normal people depart in the first part of the movie. The three others left in the second part are just symbols of Justine's core world collapsing. All characters here are just layers of Justine's world. She kills them one at the time ... where everybody is dead, her connection with the reality she can't deal with disappears... And I could continue in this way ...the second review: I think is a piece of ....forget about anything i said above. As Justine said in the second part of the movie, "I think is a piece of ....". It was my effort to find meaning where is none, to put order in LVT's chaotic mind. There is nothing about this movie other than some nice images and some nice acting. Snobs will love it because it gives them the opportunity to look smarter than they really are. Normal people will find it boring and meaningless. If there are any symbols they are poorly build and they are not consistent across the movie. Do not waste your time watching this movie ... And i could continue in this way ...conclusion: I can't fully support neither my first nor my second (short) review. Actually I believe that LVT had some symbols in mind and some idea for the movie. But I also think that we try to make too much sense when we try to transform every character into a symbol and to give every scene a symbolic meaning. I'm not sure that LVT world is mainly about symbols. I think it's about images and expressing deep feelings (pain, fear, desperation and so on). The movie does that in a satisfactory manner and it should be enough. This movie received mainly ecstatic reviews or resentful ones. The ecstatics are all about symbols and finding some deep meaning for every detail. The resentful ones are all about "the movie is a boring meaningless piece of .... ". Both the ecstatics and the resentful are wrong in my opinion. The idea of the movie is not bad (and to classify the movie as a science fiction movie as I saw some did .. is plain stupid), the acting is not bad (sometimes is quite good) and the images (even they are ostentatiously shaken for snob's delight, of course)are sometimes great.I give 8 stars for Melancholia. I would have given it 7 but there are too many really bad movies with so many stars on IMDb ... so 8 is a fair note for a movie which is above the average.P.S.: If LVT was Lynch .. I would have given more thought to the idea that the music (Wagner's Tristan and Isolde) has a deeper meaning. maybe it does, maybe is about Schopenhauer's thoughts on suicide influencing Wagner in composing T&amp;I. Maybe is about the night (death in the movie) as sole savior ... or maybe is just beautiful music greatly fit on nicely build image. you never know..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the other hand, what else to expect from Von Trier... Well, he has his sophisticated approach, but unlike me, he is fond of revealing ugly stuff during festive occasions. And this sadness, fear and grayness all around - it is all fake misery, depicting the line "The rich do cry too". Kirsten Dunst is great and has deserved her awards, but my biggest surprise was to find Kiefer Sutherland in Von Trier's movie - I can't remember him performing caring and nice husband and father. Anyway, I liked him there as well, and in the 2nd part he was more or less the main figure. The film is definitely for you if you like pondering and trivial plot, otherwise - skip it. Artism and directing are main features here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical filmmaking but confusing storyline...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 7/15/2012 ? 6 out of 10(Dir-Lars Von Trier): Magical filmmaking but confusing storyline with abrupt non-conclusive ending lessens what could have been a much better film. The story, I think, was about a sickly young woman(played by Kirsten Dunst), whose sister(played by Charlotte Gainsbourg) puts together a last ditch wedding effort for the sickly sister prior to what they fear will be the end of the Earth because of a nearby hidden planet named "Melancholia" that may collide with their homeland. One of the fathers, played by Kiefer Sutherland, is in sync with a group of scientists who say it won't collide but the sister, played by Gainsbourg, fears differently. The high-browed high-society wedding reception is the first part of the movie, and it is unclear what is going on until the 2nd half of the movie. I get the feeling that Lars Von Trier's movie has been spliced up quite a bit for time because some things don't make sense and don't fit together. Fortunately, the movie is paced slowly like many European films ? which gives the viewer time to think and eventually understand things. The opening scene is very much like "2001: A Space Odyssey" in it's majestic scope using classical music which accompanies very slow motion photography that tells some of the story. The fact that this scene was allowed in 2011 is amazing in itself. The acting is good, but the filmmaker is the star in this one. Unfortunately, the movie ends abruptly without a clear understanding of what actually happens to the characters, but I guess the thought of the filmmaker was the trip up to this point was more important than the finale. This kind of film would have been filled with action and special effects if made by an American but instead Von Triers focuses on the characters making it a unique film although there was definitely much room for improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That hasn't already been said. So instead I'll tell you what I thought of the movie, not how good it was, not a review. The movie is pure art, and not art in the way my generation thinks of art. I argued on the internet that lady gaga isn't art the other day and got laughed at.True art is something that exists for itself, not the audience. Another reviewer left a horrible review saying that even von Trier thought it was a horrible film. It is. I've never seen a film try to accurate depict the subject material that it does.It's not for someone wanting to be entertained. Neither is the Mona Lisa. If you're wanting to be entertained, the last thing you do is print off a copy of the Mona Lisa and stare at it for 2 hours. This film stands on its own. It needs no reviews for it to stand, and it needs no explanation. The only reason I write this is because in this day and age, art does. We don't indulge in art to be entertained, we indulge in art to better ourselves. Art is one of the highest order things humanity is capable of; we use it to depict time and space, happiness and depression.One last thing, as a violinist, I must both admire and hate the use of Wagner here, and musicians will know what I'm talking about. It has been a long time since I've experienced anything like this, and I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about it. I think that over the years I will watch this a few more times, and every time it will mean something different. Much like the use of the music here ironically.Great, but horrific, film.</fullReview>

As I too would finally be at peace with an impending disaster. I know that sounds morose, but that's just been my feeling for years and wow, this film brought it out. I think anyone who likes to delve into real emotions and the human psyche would get something out of this film as well. And I must mention - the cinematography and artwork of this film is extraordinary. I've watched it twice this week and will purchase a copy on HD as soon as I can get my hands on on. This one's a keeper and it's appropriate for these modern times when so much threatens our existence. Well done, Lars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that gets under your skin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a very interesting grip on me. I was first drawn to it because I enjoy sci-fi disaster movies, but the added twist of family dysfunction seemed imply additional conflict. I have to say that when I watched it, the first half seemed puzzling and out of context to me. It was intriguing enough for me to stay with it, only because I wanted to see how the planet Melancholia would impact all of this family psychodrama. To me, at least after I first viewed the film, the second half was stronger, and more apparently relevant.That being said, even though my initial reaction to the film was mixed, the film stayed with me for days afterward. The subtle undertones of the film really made me think, and Lars von Trier's apocalyptic vision raised a lot of questions of the meaning of life, and what everything means in the long run. I was better able to understand the context of the first half of the movie and tie it into the whole picture. I found this movie to be one that I had to read between the lines constantly. But in doing that, its impact to me was quite profound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End done right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finished watching Melancholia a few days ago, and I'm still thinking about it.I knew it was about the end of the world, but I got confused at the beginning because there were no typical end-of-the-world signposts, like news reports, or white collar government workers running around in a frenzy looking for solutions, or Aerosmith ballads. Just a wedding.I almost wish I didn't know what the movie was about before watching it, but I think that the wedding sequence demands that the viewer knows it's the end of the world to understand how subtly out of the norm everyone is. The wedding goes wrong gradually, and it's only in act two when the characters actually talk about the event that the character's actions in act one make sense.If there were days left, I wouldn't focus on the event either. I'd probably do what most of these characters did and try to make the best of the time left and try not to dwell on it too much. This is why the movie succeeds: it's completely believable.A stellar cast and great acting all around. Not one flat performance in the bunch. I loved John Hurt's character stealing the spoons and messing with the wait staff. Why not? Who's gonna care in a week? Only 9 out of 10, missing a star for the "Tree of Life" slow-mo at the beginning. Yes, it was beautiful and artistic, but I would have enjoyed the movie without it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating and real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier's "Melancholia" is not for everybody. This is a movie that goes along at a slow pace, and it's meant for people who appreciate good film. If you are someone looking for a movie of action or entertainment or sci-fi, then think again. This is a great movie, but it's not one that was made for entertainment. It runs at a little over two hours long, and as I said, it's very slow paced. But as it is slow paced, it is also paced at the perfect amount. Kirsten Dunst, who always reminds me of Mary Jane Parker from Spider-Man, plays a normal person with a very serious problem. I don't know why, but I didn't want to watch this movie the first time I saw the movie poster. I knew nothing about it, but for some reason, it looked to me like a movie that took place back in the 1800's and was a very boring-looking movie. The second time I visited the IMDb page, I read what it was about and reconsidered what I had thought about it. I didn't watch any trailers, but I did read many reviews. This movie received mainly positive reviews, scoring an eighty out of one hundred on the Metascore scale, and was described as an engrossing film. So I viewed it.This movie is primarily about two sisters, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Justine is getting married, but yet she struggles to be happy even on her wedding night, funded by her sister and brother-in-law, who really try to make a point of all the money they spent after seeing how unhappy she is. While this is happening, a huge blue planet, known as Melancholia, is on a collision course with Earth. The fatal question that is toyed with throughout the movie: Will it strike Earth, therefore destroying it, and everyone on it? Well, I'm not here to spoil it for you, so you can just watch it yourself. As the movie goes on, Justine really becomes worse and worse, due to her (hang on to your hats) melancholia. Inside, she is emotionally ill, and this challenges Claire and Justine's relationship as sisters, as well as the planet does. Claire is the most normal, but she suffers from the paranoia that this alien planet is going to collide with Earth. Her husband (Kiefer Sutherland) is the one who's more fascinated by the planet, and is one of the people who believes that it's just going to glide past Earth and be on it's way.This is a perfect example of a drama, mixed with some sci-fi. A dri-fi? A scama? People are coming up with names for mixed genres, but anyways...This movie removes all the sci-fi clichés that are in most end of the world movies. Government involvement, for one. There are others, such as weapons trying to destroy it, aliens coming off the planet, etc. The movie is more about the broken relationship between the melancholiac Justine and her sister. This was a really great movie for its script, and the cinematography. I thought this movie had fantastic cinematography. I almost felt like I was watching a found footage movie, except the camera wasn't as nauseating and it was edited. The movie is also edited very bizarrely, and I've heard some complaints about lousy editing. I believe this is wrong, I don't believe in bad editing on a full production for a movie. If it's a full production, then anyway that it's edited, I believe, was the way it was meant to be edited. You'll see what I mean, if you watch it. It cuts around a lot throughout the movie. But cinematography was a plus, for it was different, but in a unique way.Overall, if you're looking for a great film about an impending disaster that has removed all the clichés and actually scripted in a story, then watch Melancholia. Kirsten Dunst is amazing in her role as a person without red hair and isn't clutching to a man in a tight red suit. She should do more roles like this, and I know she is, but I haven't watched them, so I probably should.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ode to depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave it to the Nordics for depressing existential nauseous entertainment. It seems these fellows' favorite way of enjoyment is exploring the unbearable lightness of being and the uselessness of everyday life. Notwithstanding, this is a marvelous film that actually makes you live the angst of existence. You don't need to be depressed (although maybe to have been at one time helps) to appreciate what Von Triers accomplishes here (the camera shaking is Von Triers' visual style following Dogme 95, read about it). The impending doom of planet Melancholia gives a real reason to feel the immediate fear of death and its consequences as anyone who has no faith concludes they are, and why this belief would make anyone not to care about anything in this life, its rituals, the seek of material things, marriage, family, happiness, etc. The absence of any news (radio, TV, a la Nights of the Living Dead) actually heightens the tension and thickens the atmosphere. Another plus was the use of John Hurt, in whose face (although not that old) you could see death coming, in real life that is, thus adding depth, as all actors in this film, like all of us viewers, will eventually come to the same ending. One thing struck me wrong, and that is when Justine says she knows the end because she knows things and then tells Claire that she knows the number of beans in the jar. I guess this was saying she had a contact with things outside reality that the rest of the people lack, too concerned with material, egotistical things because of their scientific lack of awareness or concern for the supernatural. The thing is you don't need extraordinary powers to understand what this film is saying, and from which everyone suffers at the end. If there's one thing I've learned is that everyone more or less understands our existential dilemma and doubts and suffers at any given time from melancholia and depression, without needing a planet to crash Earth to understand it. Other things were awkward (the monkey sex scene, that nobody seemed to know about the planet), but all in all, it is a masterpiece. And yes, there is entertainment in art that addresses the existential doubts of man on Earth (see The Seventh Seal, and most of Bergman for that matter).</fullReview>

The utter misery of the character's heart destroyed what was humanly comprehensible by myself up to date. Watching 'Melancholia' I managed to reach a new side of myself. And basically I was emotionally unprepared for this movie, sorry, roller-coaster. Some people in the other reviews said it was boring. I believe that they just missed the whole point of this movie. Well, i can't change one's opinion, i'm just sad that they just didn't understand something so magnificently enchanting.Lars has obviously captured a mental state of his own in his work.

		<fullReview>Loved the movie, and some of the reviews here are great, but no one else seems to have noticed that the opening slo-mo montage is heavily influenced by Stanley Kubrick. The shot of the lawn with the sundial and trees could have come right out of Barry Lyndon, and of course, the planetary alignment shots are classic 2001. The addition of the stately classical music makes it even more Kubrick (Kubrickian?). Lars did a great job, and hey, if you're going to emulate anyone, Kubrick is a way to aim high! The opening is gorgeous, and so is the rest of the movie. I did find it slightly jarring that everyone in the family had a different accent--British, French, American... Great film, great tribute to Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why this movie is so polarizing. It definitely makes you think, and I was definitely affected by it. The performances are perfectly nuanced, and the mild subtleties of the movie should not be ignored. This movie is not about the destruction of the earth...if that is what you are looking for, this is not your movie. It is, rather, an examination into the processes of depression and the effect that depression can have on those who suffer from it and the loved ones around them. Like depression often does, the planet Melancholia "passes over" but returns to consume not only those it has in its grasp, but the people around them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kirsten Dunst's Best Performance Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/Director Lars Von Trier is one of the most polarizing and discussed filmmakers working today, and a lot of it has nothing to do with his movies. Is he a genius or a pompous douche bag? An endlessly talented artist or ego maniacal freak? The Danish director has had several internationally acclaimed films from "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" to "Dogville" and "Manderlay". His most controversial film has been 2009's "Antichrist" (which I have also reviewed). His Cannes Film Festival press conferences have been stuff of idiotic legend, as he can't seem to stop making bizarre and offensive remarks. I'll let you Google the rest of the story if your interested, lets get down to business with "Melancholia" "Melancholia" is his latest opus and while not as controversial as "Antichrist" it keeps some of the same dark and disturbing themes. Kirsten Dunst won Best Actress at Cannes this year for her role as Justine, a severely depressed woman who is getting married. Justine's sister Claire is played by "Antichrist" star Charlotte Gainsbourg. The cast also features Kiefer Sutherland, John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling &amp; Stellan Skarsgard. The film is presented in two parts named after the sisters with Part 1 being "Justine" and Part 2 being "Claire". All of the drama is held under the threat of global destruction as a rogue blue planet named Melancholia is on a collision course with Earth.Everything takes place within a gigantic estate that seems cut off from the rest of civilization. The tone and feel of the film is pretty heavy and dark. Justine's extreme depression has been a burden on everyone for years, with Claire being the only person to really take care of her. With the wedding being a last ditch effort to bring joy and happiness to her life. The first part of the film takes place during the reception.The only thing Justine takes solace in is that the world will soon be ending. With the planet Melancholia visible in the sky, getting bigger as it approaches, Justine seems to form a sort of cosmic bond with it. Could this be her savior? Claire on the other hand is married to John (Sutherland) and has a little boy. She is racked with terror and anxiety at Earths impending doom. John is a sort of amateur astronomer and keeps telling her that the threat will pass, knowing full well that we are pretty much screwed."Melancholia" like a lot of Von Trier's films is filled with symbolism and layers of meaning. Two sisters colliding, two planets colliding. Justine's severe depression also closely follows Von Trier's own such proclaimed depression. Justine at one moment tells Claire "The Earth is evil" "Life on Earth is evil" "Nobody will miss it". This movie is dark, depressing and oddly beautiful and intriguing. To see this movie it is showing on several on demand services and will be coming soon to theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Art from the Exponent of Dogme 95....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a terrific respect for von Trier - and love most of his films, though some aren't worth the celluloid they were shot on.Melancholia had quite a hype and pedigree before I got my DVD. I waited with baited breath. The opening sequences were visual nonsense which did not impress me much - I knew it was going to settle into the film proper and couldn't wait for that to happen.Almost a replica scene to the Dogme classic, Festen, there's the get- together after the wedding, in the mansion, with awkward speeches and prickly confrontations. Except we have a collection of French/Danish/British/American actors all playing leads and all claiming to be relatives, all speaking English in their own accents. Not terribly convincing.Kirsten Dunst should feel that she'd been given a juicy and involving role, one that her career needed, in the same way that Natalie Portman had with Black Swan. The scenes of her being tired and emotional and then doing, shall we say, stupid things, reminded me of my favourite von Trier, Breaking the Waves, where Emily Watson's character similarly displayed destructive behaviour.These scenes with her screen sister Charlotte Gainsbourg were sensitive, touching and true and whilst living up to the film's name were heartening with their vulnerability and the quality of acting.Not wanting to spoil matters regarding the possible impeding doom, via an unseen planet, named Melancholia (why name a planet after a negative emotion?), I'll skip quickly over what happens after. Except that I found much of this enthralling, almost exciting and very intriguing. A lot of nonsense, some of it, but that's the nature of sci-fi - and trying to mix it with a deep emotional drama.There's a lot that doesn't work in Melancholia but a great deal that does. Superbly different to anything that von Trier, or indeed anyone I can think of, has done before. Dunst and Gainsbourg acted brilliantly and opened themselves up fantastically. 'Antichrist', von Trier's Gainsbourg starring, controversial and frankly nasty previous film now just a distant, unpleasant taste in the mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier's film has a slow start, but definitely delivers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Controversial director Lars Von Trier is back once again with his latest dark marvel, Melancholia. With his last film, Antichrist, he tackled the topic of the outcomes of losing a loved one, and it wasn't pretty. This time, he tackles a topic that many have tackled before: the end of the world, and tackles it better than anybody in the history of disaster films.Kirsten Dunst gives the performance of her career as Justine, a depressed newlywed who is a frightened, self destructive wreck. The film focuses on her, and her sympathetic sister, Claire (played pitch-perfectly by Charlotte Gainsbourg, the underrated actress who scared the hell out of me in Antichrist), and their relationship. Amongst their relationship, there is a planet named Melancholia that is drawing nearer and nearer to planet earth.The prologue is fantastically filmed and gripping, but I just wish the film went back to it.The first part, which revolves around Justine's wedding party, is engaging, yet slow. The film really kicks into gear in the final hour, which revolves around Claire's relationship with Justine, her husband David(played by Keifer Sutherland), and the earth's demise.What sets Melancholia aside from other disaster movies is it's complexity. also, it's more of a character study, while other disaster movies give a little bit of character, and mainly focus on the disaster at hand. But here's the thing: The film's hero, the mystery that she is, is a disaster. Justie is a wreck, and in Von Trier's world, earth is going to be wrecked next.Overall, Melancholia is supremely acted, strangely beautiful, beautifully strange, beautiful to look at, but a little slow in the first act. Though not many have heard of it, Melancholia would be the role model for any disaster film in the near future.A-*Note* I re-watched the film that same night, and more makes sense. After giving it thought, Melancholia deserves an A. A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MELANCHOLIA': Four Stars (Out of Five) A dramatic science fiction disaster film with the end of the world seen through the eyes of two sisters. This is a disaster film like no other, from the mind of writer / director Lars von Trier (who also helmed such other past critical darlings as 'DANCER IN THE DARK' and 'DOGVILLE'). In this film life is threatened by a mysterious planet known as 'Melancholia', which is on a collision course with Earth. The title of the film has a double meaning as it also describes the state of Kirsten Dunst's lead character, who is in extreme depression for the majority of the film. The movie is definitely not without it's flaws but it's still a very unique and memorable film going experience.The film begins with a series of visions of the end of the world as the planet Melancholia strikes Earth (all played out in slow motion to opera music by Richard Wagner). It is unclear who's visions they are or what they all mean. We then meet Justine (Dunst) and her fiancé Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) on their wedding night as well as Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland), who are hosting the wedding reception. We also meet much of Justine's family and friends as we experience a very odd and emotional wedding and learn that Justine suffers from severe depression (which sort of puts a damper on her wedding). We later learn that the planet Melancholia is in fact on a course towards Earth, in which many believe it will collide as others believe it will fly by. We stay with the core characters as they struggle with what could be all of mankind's impending doom.The movie kind of plays out in two distinct halves, the first centering on the wedding and the second on Justine's further depression and her sister's fear of the end of the world. We learn more about the two main characters as the film goes on but the film stays solely with them, as well as John and he and Claire's son Leo (Cameron Spurr), at their isolated mansion away from the city. Unlike other disaster films the end of the world in this movie only revolves around these four characters. The main point of the movie is to explore depression and how it effects people as well as show how well depressed people function in highly stressed situations, due to the fact that their not afraid of disaster striking as they usually already expect it. In that way the film is effective and fascinating. I also really liked the unique new take on the 'end of the world' film. Dunst and all of the actors in the film are spectacular and it's a grade A production all around. It's very slow moving at times though and it isn't quite as grand a movie as it thinks it is. Many are annoyed that it was snubbed by the Oscars but it doesn't surprise me at all that this and other dark and edgy films like 'DRIVE' almost never get the Academy's attention (that's to be expected). It is better than a lot of what was nominated, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXQWgWt6cw</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever, Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to "24," we've grown accustomed to watching Kiefer Sutherland save the world/country pretty much annually. So when he ceases his self-assured running around and swallows a bottle of pills in the horses' stables instead, you know something is wrong.In this case, it's the eponymous planet in the latest Lars Von Trier film, "Melancholia," that is about to collide with Earth and kill all living things. He decided to get out a few hours early.While director Lars Von Trier may have surprised his character with this collision, he does not surprise us. The opening of the film is several minutes of footage of the event itself?or, more accurately, the moments just before. It is highly stylized and extraordinarily gorgeous. And it lets you know right off the bat: everyone dies.But the first casualty is a wedding.Justine (Kirsten Dunst), a young woman with a history of depression, is the beautiful bride getting married to her earnest, lanky groom, Michael (Alexander Skarsgaard). He loves her very much and has just bought them some property?an orchard. Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her wealthy husband John (Sutherland) are hosting the ceremony and reception at their lakeside mansion. In attendance are Justine's smarmy boss, the girls' father and his two mistresses named Betty, the girls' mother (Charlotte Rampling) and her spectacular omni-hatred, the butlers, the henchmen, and the rest of the friends and family. As Justine self-destructs, teetering on the edge of another bout of depression, the wedding unfolds disaster by disaster. Sometimes it's comical, sometimes it's devastating.The audience's feelings toward the groom become parallel to our feelings toward everyone else: sympathy for impending doom. We know about it, and they don't. We see the bride's disengagement, her efforts?and ultimate failure?to act how she knows she's supposed to act, and we know that the groom is in for some heartbreak just as we know that everyone in the film is in for some fiery death. Ms. Dunst pulls off an amazing performance (never thought I'd write that)?expressing a very yucky thing lying just beneath the surface of a very pretty thing.After the wedding, Justine plummets into a deep depression and goes to live with her sister. It is here that we get to see the vast differences between the two girls. Claire is your typical, practical, responsible woman. She helps her sister bathe, cooks her favorite meals for her, and tucks her into bed, all while managing her own son, Leo. She is somewhat worried about what they're saying on TV about Melancholia's slight chance of collision with Earth. Justine, on the other hand, can barely feed herself, has lost her job, and has checked out of life completely. She has no worries about Melancholia or the destruction of Earth, which seems to know as imminent. "Life on Earth is horrible," she says. "No one will miss it." Toward the end, though, as disaster approaches, it is Claire who is made to look helpless. Justine's resigned calm is a far more practical response in this context, and she is the one who leads the remaining three (after John's suicide) through their last few minutes.This movie is great for getting you to think about death. We don't really think about it often, especially in our youth. The approaching planet, they say, has been "hidden behind the sun" until just recently, and now it is looming as large as the moon in our sky. This, if you think about it, is essentially the same path death, as a concept, takes on the consciousness in the course of a human life: invisible at first, then more and more visible as time passes. Von Trier uses the characters in his film to illustrate the different ways people deal with it. Some, like John, can't handle it and cut out early. Some, like Claire, struggle absurdly to avoid it or delay it, and some, like Justine, accept it as they would a parking citation and then go lie naked on the edge of a riverbank. Some, like the horses, neigh.What if we could see death in this way, Von Trier asks, as a physical presence on the horizon? Would we act the same, if we just had to turn our heads to see our own personal apocalypse up there in the sky, getting bigger and bigger? His elbow to the ribs with this film is that the only real differences between the horror that transpires in the movie and what happens in all of our lives are the mode and the scale.I think the message, then, is that the most appropriate reaction to Melancholia, the planet, is Melancholia, the condition. While Von Trier may have gone cosmic with this film, no one could ever call him "sunny."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As strange as you would expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't matter if you like Director Lars Von Trier or not , there is no doubting that he's films produce plenty of talking points. His last movie , Antichrist was beautiful at times yet horrific in others and i think i liked it!Melancholia is tries to hit the heights of Antichrist but never gets close.The film is in two chapters.The first revolves around a wedding and a bride, played by Kirsten Dunst who seems to be oblivious of the importance of her big day and the second half revolves around the planet Melancholia which is heading for Earth and the destruction of the planet. While i found this film watchable i never really understood what Von Trier was trying to do.I have seen it described as a disaster movie and maybe that was said as a critical statement?! Basically it's about people acting strangely without any real explanation.I cant recommend this film to anyone as it's just too odd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi upgrade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Melancholia' can be viewed as a modern update / upgrade to the sci-fi genre. Better (psychological) drama, better graphics, better acting, though it does lack that truly cult atmosphere of many a golden oldies.The opening scene consists of hyper-stylized (or plain kitschy) moments of the impending doom. I must say I really liked some of that imagery, but I'm not sure how much I liked the idea of putting these fragments at the beginning of the film, I think they would have worked just fine at the end.Then, the film tells the story of what happened before, about a few people whose characters are exposed by the approaching of the final hour. I think it was very well done, with the exception of the part that begins with Justine's reaction to Claire's suggestion to sit, hold hands and sing songs; it felt wrong somehow, especially when they end up holding hands anyway. But on the whole, I have not much to complain here, which I certainly hadn't expected after the thoroughly disappointing 'Antichrist'.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretentious drivel of the highest order. The scenario - the potential end of the world through the Earth colliding with another planet - was very interesting. However, the human drama side was labored, tedious, pointless and very time consuming. Von Trier could easily have cut out 30-45 minutes of the movie and had a much better, more bearable, story.The best thing about the movie was the ending - quite powerful, plus, at last, the movie was over.Kirsten Dunst is solid, and suitably depressing, in the lead role. Charlotte Gainsburg is irritating, as always - she only does pretentious roles. All-star supporting cast: Alexander Skarsgard, Kiefer Sutherland, John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling, Stellan Skarsgard. Must be one of the rare occasions where Stellan and Alexander Skarsgard, father and son, have appeared in the same movie.So pretentious it should have been French.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maddening, mesmerizing Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At an opulent British mansion, the guests have been waiting for the bride, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her new groom, Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) for two hours. This has upset the hostess, Claire (Charlotte Gainsburg), the bride's sister, and her rich, exasperating husband (Kiefer Sutherland). At last the couple arrives and the event begins. But, there are shadows lingering in the atmosphere. One, Justine suffers from extreme depression and, although she seems radiant and happy, is she? Then, the bigger problem is rogue planet Melancholia has been near earth for a few months. At times, it is closer to the third planet from the sun than others. Scientists are NOT certain the two heavenly bodies will be colliding but all of earth is worried. It is one of the reasons that Justine decided to go ahead with this ceremony, as the future is most uncertain. Alas, happiness seems elusive. Justine's mother (Charlotte Rampling) announces her scorn of marriage in her brief speech, quite upsetting. Then, Justine's arrogant boss, Jack (Stellan Skarsgard) goads her work performance on a day when business should be forgotten. In addition, Justine's smile becomes false, as her own melancholy returns. Therefore, she rejects her new husband for a meaningless tryst on the lawn with a gentleman she has just met. Michael drives off, aware and sad of what has happened. The other guests eventually leave, with Claire becoming a caretaker for the newly catatonic Justine. As Melancholia gets closer again, how will the folks at this remote, secluded estate handle the possibility of earth's demise? This maddening, mesmerizing film is quite wonderful. The cast is absolutely terrific, with Dunst giving an amazing turn as the doomed Justine. Likewise, the setting is achingly beautiful while the story is clever and unique. Yes, the direction is slow and solemn, at moments, sometimes to the point of impatience but the tale is made for reflection, after all. Most maddening is the inclusion of scenes that are meant to push viewers' buttons. Think Justine's dalliance on the lawn and a later glimpse of her sunbathing in the nude, when the sun is not shining. These blue items are meant to upset audiences rather than enhance the movie. But, all in all, most serious flick fans will admire this highly unusual and compelling cinematic effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloomy depressing movie indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story opens up abstractly, contrasting the orchestral music and the long shot scenes with the absence of dialog, and even significant motion from the characters depicted. It feels somewhat like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey to some degree. Then it builds up the story. The main theme of hidden failures, conflicts and repressed feelings slowly creep into the scenes and little by little manifested themselves into the bad things the people do. The constant play of the depressing music, the darker coloration even with contrasting images of the celestial bodies, and the dominant close up shots of the characters, particularly at the second part, extends the depressing and gloomy mood to the farthest possible. Kristen Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg each done their respective arts nicely. Dunst did her fed up and later rather deranged character convincingly. On the other hand Gainsbourg depicted successfully the insecure and guilty sister and mother all along the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre and maddening - but kind of brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching a Von Trier film, we should be judging the movie, not the man. More so here than in any other film he has made, Lars Von Trier has cemented his reputation as one of the most visionary, original directors working today. He has calmed down since his last schlock horror 'Antichrist' ? and here we have a film of breathtaking visual beauty, its plot mimicking that of a bizarre contemporary opera, portraying nothing less than the end of the world.The film, I have to stress again, is one of the most visually impressive we will see all year. From the opening scene, Von Trier's defiantly arty tastes shine through in a montage of slow motion sequences, inspired straight from disquieting masterpieces in both the art world ('Ophelia' springs to mind) and in the realms of cinema as well (it feels uncanny that only a few weeks after seeing 'Last Year in Marienbad', such a direct reference is made to the movie ? who can mistake that garden with the perfectly geometric trees?). There is a scene early on in which Justine ? the main character ? opens art books at certain pages and leaves them lying out so that we can see the works in the distance. At times, in that prologue, you can imagine that these works have sprung to life in an aptly mesmerizing fashion.In Part Two of the film, as the inevitable apocalypse draws closer, and nature begins to turn on itself, we are left dumbfounded by some of the images he conjures up, building up in intensity until the very last scene, as the planet 'Meloncholia' finally collides with Earth (NB: this isn't a spoiler ? as an audience, it is explained from five minutes in that this is going to happen). But what a gut wrenching, deliriously intense crescendo he pulls out of the bag. The cinematography and the accompanying soundtrack are masterful. After a delightfully mysterious, breathtakingly opulent prologue, we are greeted with Part One of Two ? named 'Justine' ? after Kirsten Dunst's character. Justine has just got married to Michael, and they are making their way up to a castle (belonging to Justine's sister Claire ? played by Charlotte Gainsbourg) for the reception in a white limousine ? a vehicle notoriously difficult to manoeuvre round sharp bends. This opening scene is disarming. There are comic touches. The couple are happy ? aren't they? Well ? see for yourself. Part One deals almost exclusively with the couple's wedding night, and the disastrous reception party. Von Trier makes the most of his location ? whether it be the vast interior of the castle or the sprawling golf course outside, bathed in artificial yellow light. It becomes apparent through a series of strange, beautifully handled sequences that Justine is in fact depressed and mentally ill, scarred by her parents' failed marriage and their present behaviour (John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling have some of the best lines in the film).Part Two ? the longer of the two sections ? belongs to Justine's sister Claire. Of course, much has been made of Kirsten Dunst's performance (for which she won the Best Actress Award at Cannes), but I would say that she is unquestionably outshone by Gainsbourg here ? who, as ever, is incredible. Her character is the most sympathetic ? not only does she have to juggle her mentally ill sister with a somewhat unsympathetic husband (played by Kiefer Sutherland ? who would have thought he would ever star in a Von Trier picture?), but also with the increasing anxiety that the planet 'Melancholia' is going to collide with Earth in a matter of days. Justine comes to stay with her sister for those final days, leading up to the apocalypse, and what ensues is nothing short of fascinating. The planet itself is seen in shots that could be paused, and the stills put up in an art gallery ? the disquietingly erotic scene in which Justine wanders to the river bank and lies naked, bathed in the light bouncing off the planet in the middle of the night ? will be ingrained on your memory long after leaving the cinema.Of course, there are flaws. His script, for me, is chief among these: at times, it feels horribly like a first draft. As ever with Von Trier, he raises a lot of points and incorporates many themes (the evil of human existence ? as dealt with in his previous film 'Antichrist' ? crops up here yet again) ? but very few are explored to any significant depth. The most successful exploration of a theme here is Justine's depression ? which is handled marvellously. However, watching the film with a pinch of salt certainly wouldn't hurt.That said, I for one was blown away by the film's originality. It is a mad, maddening, bizarre melodrama, and perhaps it is indeed pretentious - but watching it is like gazing at an exquisite work of art in motion. Two films this year have explored the cosmos and it's relation to us as human beings ('The Tree of Life' is the other). In some respects, these two films shouldn't even be compared ? The Tree of Life is the far better film of the two in any case, and definitely deserved the Palme D'Or. But it is interesting to see the variation on a theme ? one film a devastatingly beautiful, honest, humble exploration of human existence and the other ? a manipulative, shamelessly gaudy and depressing slice of operatic tragedy.But 'Melancholia', in its own, unique way, is stunning; years from now, I have no doubt it will be considered a masterpiece. Until then, suffice it to say that this is the best film that Lars Von Trier has made in a long time. Let's hope this is the start of a trend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visionary Masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that it deals with such heady topics as depression, mental illness and the end of the world, "Melancholia" may well be the most "accessible" movie Lars von Trier has ever made. Which really isn't saying all that much given that the vast majority of his oeuvre consists of works that are, to put it mildly, cerebral, arty, and non-commercial with a vengeance. In fact, this haunting, visionary masterwork is a bit like what "2012" might have been had it been designed as a bleak, metaphysical art-house film instead of as a crowd-pleasing, CGI-driven blockbuster.Like "The Deer Hunter," "Melancholia" spends the first third of its running-time at a wedding, introducing us to the main characters and the various problems they face. Labeled "Justine," Part 1 focuses on an attractive young woman (Kirsten Dunst) who obviously suffers from a debilitating form of clinical depression. Though she is clearly trying her best to put on a happy face for the guests who have come to see her tie the knot, Justine can't hide the crushing sadness that resides at her core. In addition, Justine and her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who is desperately trying to pull off a memorable event for her sister despite all the difficulties, also have to deal with the familial stress caused by a cantankerous father (John Hurt) and a hopelessly embittered mother (Charlotte Rampling).After this deceptively prosaic opening, "Melancholia" throws us for a loop in Part 2, simply titled "Claire." For we discover that, in addition to the fact that Justine's depression has become almost crippling in its effect on the young woman, scientists have discovered an unknown planet - dubbed Melancholia - hitherto hiding on the other side of the sun that has recently broken out of its orbit and is now on a possible collision course with Earth. Needless to say, this grimmest of all possibilities hangs like a pall over the lives of the characters, like a death sentence passed on a race that daily denies its inherent fragility in the face of massive, impersonal forces of nature and a universe of crushing vastness.The rogue planet becomes a symbol for all the unspecified fears and dangers, both real and imaginary, that we face everyday as a species ? a species that, while it may be uniquely aware of its own mortality, is, nevertheless, willing to overlook that fact as the only means of making it through the day. Indeed, we make a pact with ourselves and each other that we won't focus on our own mortality. It's only at certain rare moments that we are forced as individuals to come face-to-face with the ephemeral nature of our existence - only now, thanks to Melancholia, all of humanity is having to do so at the same time. In many ways, Justine, with her depression that existed long before the threatened extinction of the planet, may be the most "rational" of all the characters in her reaction to the world around us - and, by extension, the cosmic end of humanity. And it is indeed she, at the end, who manages to not only cope best with the onrushing doom but to provide the strength the others need to come to terms with their fate.As an apocalyptic fable, "Melancholia" possesses all the stark beauty and intellectual rigor of Ingmar Bergman at his finest. Von Trier also shares the Swedish master's ability to draw profoundly layered performances out of a superb ensemble cast. For, in addition to the actors and actresses already mentioned, there is stunning work here by "24"'s Kiefer Sutherland and "True Blood"'s Anthony Skarsgard as well.No review of "Melancholia" could possibly hope to do the movie justice, for no words can come close to conveying the visceral impact the film has on its audience. It is a work of art that burrows deep into the viewer's psyche and forces us to ponder - however unwillingly - issues involving our own lives and how we choose to live them.Mesmerizing and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia will probably be best known for two things, that Kirsten Dunst showcased that she can be a serious actress rather than just another pretty face for yet another summer blockbuster, and for writer-director Lars von Trier's disastrous 2011 Cannes Film Festival press conference for the movie that resulted in him being declared persona non grata. Which is unfortunate because Melancholia proved to be von Trier's magnum opus to date, like how Malick's Tree of Life had an epic operatic feel to it, so too does this film in taking on science fiction proportions when dealing with the issue about how different people treat and approach life in different fashion.The first few minutes of the film will take your breath away. With detailed imagery and slow motion, complete with CG laden effects, this prologue puts up almost all the issues and themes that von Trier has injected into a simple, straightforward narrative. If Tree of Life showed the creation of Life at the beginning, von Trier's film deals with the end of Life as we know it, culminating in the destruction of planet Earth quite unlike the usual asteroid smash, but rather a bigger planetary object obliterating everything in its path. It sets up the finale because of this preemption, and the ending was nothing short of balls dropping scary when maximum impact becomes imminent.And how we deal with the expected end of the world, is the focus of Melancholia and its characters, specifically that of Justine (Kirsten Dunst), her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and Claire's husband John (Kiefer Sutherland), each personifying very broad categories of people and attitudes that we adopt and can identify with. The narrative is broadly split down the middle into two arcs, each titled under the sisters. The first is set during Justine's wedding to Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), relatively ostentatious at John and Claire's resort home, complete with huge mansion and its own 18 hole golf course. Things all look mighty fine and dandy at first, blushing bride and all, until ugliness started to rear its ugly head in almost every aspect, from a disgruntled mom (Charlotte Rampling), womanizing dad (John Hurt), a disrespectful boss (Stellan Skarsgard), and even a sister who's a little too uptight in the planning of the wedding event.The layers get peeled away systematically in what I thought was the more human-centric of the narrative in the first arc, dealing with a lot of characters, and each an aspect and facade of Justine's life, which isn't as rosy as we thought it was to begin with, but full of troubles and woes, hidden behind an extremely emotional and unstable person who finds herself wandering in and out of festivities, either dozing off, giving back as good as she got, or having random sex with someone she hardly knows. On her wedding day, yes, obliterating relationships with almost everyone in her life. And a nonchalant observation of a distant star by Justine set the stage and premise for the next arc, which deals with an impending doom where Earth gets threatened as it gets in the way of an inter-planetary collision course.Developed by Lars von Trier when he was fighting a bout of depression, and working on the plot with Penelope Cruz who would have been Justine if not for her opting of the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, Justine is von Trier's depressive experience rolled into the character, with Kirsten Dunst exhibiting her best in being all confused, troubled and finding it paralyzingly difficult to even perform the simplest of chores in taking care of herself. This character is of course in direct contrast with her sister Claire, who perhaps is the more normal of the three in exploration, dealing with how some would give way and panic, as compared to an already depressed state that cannot care any more, when faced with troubles and doom beyond one's control. Then there's John, who is constantly in denial with his belief that Earth can pull off a great escape, and finds an escape outlet himself when faced with irrefutable facts about how things would turn out.And in between these character studies, is a plot and story that will find agreement with science fiction fans, and a cinematography that is most upsetting and unsettling, as it contains a lot of uncomfortable close ups that usually frame a person's facial features and expression, with little else during interaction. Production values for this film is kept remarkably high, despite knowing how von Trier can also work with sparse or sets that are close to nothing such as Dogville and Manderlay. Melancholia is a film to be experienced for its audacity and grandeur, and of course if you have never been convinced by Kirsten Dunst's acting chops, then this film will perhaps surprise the sternest of detractors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia: examination of the human psyche when waiting for the tragedy of death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier shows in this film how daring and different he is. with subject matter most stunning to the mind and the consciousness, the film examines with limitless care the human psyche when waiting for the tragedy of death, symbolized by the imminent end of the world. but the film is not about that: the end of the world, or how they can stop the planet, Melancholia, from colliding with Earth by detonating a nuclear head, blended with cheap romantic subplots or any other sci-fi cliché there is..the opening sequence is my favorite part of the film: a composition of dreamlike succession of extremely slow motion images of main characters and a giant planet approaching Earth, eventually destroying it in a planetary collision; working perfectly as a prologue. running just a little under 8 minutes, the opening sequence is absolutely one of my very favorite cinematic moments of the year. it superbly captures the essence of the film and its themes, and a magnificent score to match the grandiose of the moment. i just wanna have those 8 minutes in my possession so i can see it whenever i feel like itthe film then is split into two parts: the first is from Justine's point of view, played brilliantly by Kirsten Dunst, as a bride, we watch her get increasingly depressed as the movie progresses, while maintaining a stronger response to the impending disaster. the second is from Justine's sister, Claire's point of view, played also brilliantly by Charlotte Gainsbourg, a mother who can't protect her son gets increasingly agitated and fearful. during the wedding, we see an uncommonly dysfunctional family, and a bunch of characters that, to me, seem very desolate and lifeless, stuck in their own personal lives, apathetic to their destiny.. the film, though, has point in portraying them like that, juxtaposing their blinded, empty, indifferent journey through life to that of Justine's neurotic, silent, obsession about death.. either way, it is impossible to fully realize one's life knowing that death is waiting. which is ironic since life is basically a journey to death.. and that is the big picture, i guessthe film is very symbolic in that sense, which is apparent once more in the final scene, also one of my favorites. Justine, Claire and her son take shelter in a tent made out of wooden sticks, holding hands with each other waiting for the inevitable; Claire is fearful, Justine is accepting while the kid is having his eyes closed..as you can tell, the film really worked for me. and if it wasn't for some flaws, it would have been one of my all-time favorites. the flaws being that in a lot of times the film just seems too cold and distant for me to be engaged in. and i don't think i would like some of the boring wedding scenes more upon a second view..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing and memorable masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to say that I've always been a big fan of Lars Von Trier in general. Antichrist had some shocking and obscene scenes and I would definitely not recommend it to sensitive souls, but somehow it moved me. It made me thinking about further laying meanings and intentions.And that's exactly what Melancholia did to me. The story may be "science fictional" but in fact it might be something that really could be true, even if it won't be exactly like in this movie. It could happen in a different way. Lars Von Trier pictured these scenes in such a realistic way and ain't afraid to face the truth. Something I really love.I really recommend this movie to all film fanatics that can see threw story lines and dare to question the meaning of life and subjects that remain unspoken until this day. A beautiful piece of art.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Auntie Steelbreaker and the dance of death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to appreciating 'Melancholia' it's helpful to look beyond the characters and the psychology to see the symbolism that give a better understanding of the film's themes. It also makes a lot of difference to see the first half more differentiated than just Justine not being able to cope / not wanting to cope with society's conventions, rules and traditions. I think ideally one should justifiably focus on the character of Justine but also pay close attention to the other characters by trying to see them through Justine's eyes but more importantly to see them as representatives of various, shall we say faults of capitalism, which is the big belief system that is the main focus in the first half of 'Melancholia'.This may be a wedding (in fact maybe even "the most expensive wedding on the planet") but love seems to be a secondary concern after everything money. Justine's boss (Stellan Skarsg?rd), who also happens to be the groom's best man and close friend, apparently has more to say at this wedding than anyone else and he also seems to confuse a wedding with a business meeting. Jack Bauer wants to buy happiness for Justine by paying for the expensive wedding. The groom wants to buy her happiness with an apple plantation and he looks like he feels personally insulted when she doesn't seem to care enough for this investment as she later walks away and leaves behind the photograph of the estate on the sofa.Then we have wedding planner Udo "I won't look at her, she ruined MY wedding" Kier who reminds us who and what this wedding is really for and also that those who conform to the system try to deny the mere existence of people who refuse to partake in the game of capitalism, like somebody who never logged in to play World of Warcraft, for World of Warcraft you simply do not exist (I'll come back to that later). It's quite telling that the groom leaves Justine right after she quit her job by telling Skarsg?rd off and he left the wedding furiously. This probably indicates that Skarsg?rd urged his friend to leave and due to his status and wealth the groom was compelled to obey because who would want to lose a powerful and rich friend for some chick who evidently is incapable to conform to society's norms, right? The second half of Melancholia deals with the verisimilitude (or the value) of science (Jack Bauer) and religion (Abraham, the horse). Jack Bauer, somewhat forcefully, wants to have everyone think that there's more to his person than just cold rationality, that he actually has some belief in religion, whether it is with a casual phrase like "I swear to god, your sister can't do anything by herself" or saying that he occasionally takes Abraham for a ride. Another thing that is good to know is that Leo's (the child) name for Justine, "Aunt Steelbreaker", is a reference to a character in World of Warcraft. Steelbreaker apparently is in alliance with the god of death, an alliance that reveals itself, among other things, through it's electric aura. Apart from the metaphorical allusions Leo giving her that name indicates that she's a WoW player and given the notoriously addictive nature of this RPG it's a nice thought to consider that Justine maybe got a bit too involved in the reality of World of Warcraft and the achievements in the real world became secondary to her which possibly added to her not carrying about society's conventions and eventually lead to her melancholia and depression.Leo seems to look up to her "Aunt Steelbreaker" more than to his own mother, at least that's the impression I got when he asked for his aunt's approval to stay up late to watch the spectacle of the planet "passing by", and not his mother's who sat right in front of Leo. Maybe that's because his aunt is such a big shot in WoW... But seriously, apparently they bonded through playing WoW together so their bond in that virtual reality seems to have surprisingly much relevance in the reality outside of the game.When the boy sleeps through the spectacle Jack Bauer says "Leo should be watching this". Is it because he believes that Leo witnessing science's "prophecy" come true could turn his son into a believer of science like he is one? As soon as Jack Bauer realizes that science has failed him he finishes himself off. Science lost its value, he knows that in the face of impending death his unreliable science can do nothing for him anymore. Once Jack Bauer's dead body lies in the stable Abraham and the other horses are calm like lambs after one or more days of turmoil in the stable. Science is out of the way, religion can respire. But it's a calmness that soon shall turn into total silence as the big planet crushes the small planet and annihilates all life ("life is only on Earth...I know we are alone"). The film ends and the viewer is left with a black screen and no sound. All that is left is nothing and "nothing...that's not such a bad tag line".Thank you Christina Striewski for the stimuli and to make me revisit 'Melancholia' again just one week after the first viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Word against Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier was once, perhaps, an interesting film-maker. I still remember the thrill when I had one of my first excursions into the cinematic sublime with "Breaking the Waves", especially for what the end meant to me, an ultimate excursion into the sublime kitsch of combining a sense of redemption in the manner of Dreyer's "The Word" (Ordet) as erupting in its final scene, with a sense of God's view, as exemplified, even copied by, Hitchcock's famous shot from "The Birds"; I felt this was one, maybe THE, great contemporary instance of transference and belief on the viewer's part.Maybe I was just young, that is also prone to succumbing to influence, without much adroitness into counterbalancing the counter-transference I had to invest my gaze with, for the next chapters of my encounter with Trier's oeuvre piled the basic frustration I also witnessed: he is the exemplary contemporary example of what the late critic Harold Bloom coined as anxiety of influence. Let's unpack this a bit.What is meant by this phrase is that ultimately a work of art has to gain ground for itself after all previous endeavors that mean something really close to us, that shape us and we feel an unwarranted debt towards just because they, the precursors, were there before us, having shaped something definitive.In Trier's case the name is Dreyer; he is in a manic battle with him:as in the earlier example I cited, and if you take into consideration the amount of ambivalent energies he has invested the film with, that is the perennial outcast female member of society along with the others' clinical intrusion and evaluation (remember the role of the psychiatrist in the film?) that play as almost mock evaluation of the procedures that end into the sublime kitsch of transference/ambivalence (do we, the spectators, really believe into the resurrection of Bess?), all this channels Dreyer's preoccupation of all his female heroines that up to "Gertrude" we could call "what does a woman want?" into "what can we want when a woman is clinically a black hole?" Yet this is far from valid, to call it that. What this aims at is to expose Dreyer as an impotent precursor, while Trier employs all the hysteric's devices to do that while being indebted to him: he tries to subvert his spiritual clarity by exposing the repressed undercurrent even though he uses his aesthetic arsenal: the cinematic approach is the same, just inversed.A woman in Dreyer occupies the frame in aesthetic dignity. This, in Trier, is supposedly undercut by all the misgivings of the unconscious; the thing is you cannot do it while holding to the frame even if in defense you turn into acting-out jerks of the camera and editing. This is a subterfuge that does not hold for long.Melancholia ends in annihilation as if the repressed failed to return, the repressed of resurrection in "The Word", that is. Trier goes into splitting, as in the defense process, his usual heroine into two. It is hard to say the sisters are archetypes, even if they are not exploited as cardboard characters. Too much closeness to psychological frustration fails, it does not even let destitution breathe, if that makes sense. His basic insight stands: Melancholia has to be a planet, that is because planets do not talk, and not to talk is the final depressive destination. I for one will miss when I am dead talking and listening as talking and listening go together. Trier thinks along with frustrated unconscious obscenity - since not to talk is also to be obscene, or to talk in impossible alliance with our black heart, to call it that - that he can throw some clichés in between the lines (oh, I hate you sometimes so much! twice, and one wonders how Charlotte Gainsbourg could utter twice the line without bursting into laugh) for the Hollywood he loves and exploits more than loathes, and come clean both ways. He no longer does. His cinematic stunts are there to divert the master as if diversion could deprive him of his vision; it is all there for Dreyer's gaze, not ours. And it is inane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the end of the world as Lars knows it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disaster movie of sorts, in which the purported catastrophe is laid out in an interesting opening dream sequence. This is, itself, underscored by the overture to Wagner's opera Tristan and Isolde. The scenes stylised in the opening recur in more realist versions throughout he film - the music is regurgitated at almost every possible opportunity.The reason I'm making an issue of this is that it's not totally clear at what point von Trier decides that he's telling a story at face value, if at all. Divided into two parts, the first (named 'Justine', the Kirsten Dunst character) concerns a bride at her wedding reception. The torturous awkwardness of bitter family and distracted bride undermining an expensive and meticulously prepared event is punctuated by Justine wandering off in moments of depression - the Melancholia of the title. This is also the name of the planet, although it is only vaguely referred to.The event ends in a highly equivocal fashion. Was it staged for some other reason than for the couple to marry? There are no answers forthcoming as the film moves straight into the second part (named 'Claire', the Charlotte Gainsbourg character). This, some time after the event, seems more concrete as Claire and her husband, son and sister Justine bring the issue of the planet into the foreground.It's possible that the film is all about Claire - von Trier's previous, Antichrist was also Gainsbourg-centric - with the 'Justine' act a projection of her fears in a subconscious situation. That's a stretch and if it's the case, von Trier has mishandled it.Rather I suspect that this is a two-part tableau of von Trier working through his own thoughts about this existentially challenging situation, confronting the value of depression in the context of disinterested cosmological possibility. It's certainly indulgent filmmaking, the emotional bubbling represented by the excessive use of Wagner's prelude in all sorts of mangled edits (it is perplexing that after all that he decides to use the hitherto unheard prelude to the third act of the same opera during the credits). The biggest signpost towards this compositional onanism is the script, which is dreadful. I quickly got bored of the now-dated post-Dogme95 shaky-cam too, although there are some wonderfully composed and rendered shots in the film, it would be a shame to throw out with the bathwater. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia (2011) -A Story of Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia (2011)*** This review may contain spoilers ***-A Story of Hope, subtle, as it should be A review by Ken Ashe Published: February 5, 2012Steven King's, "The Mist", is a tale of horror but ending with a small, all important, moment of hope. As the main character, his newly acquired wife, and his son travel out of their macabre nightmare they listen to the static on the car's radio for any sign of life beyond their own. And for a brief second, they think they hear something audible, a voice. This is the single instant of optimism standing out like a light house, driving them forward.I saw "Melancholia" last night. It reminded me of that subtle moment of hope in King's short story. This is probably the best movie I have ever seen. Stanley Kubrick lives, but multiplied by the genius of Lars von Trier to new levels. It would be hard to write a "spoiler" in any review about a film which begins with a spectacularly orchestrated, musically as well as visually, end of the movie where the worlds collide. This sets aside any thought of a super hero swooping in like a comic book movie to save the day. You are now ready to see the characters and the message without false expectations for the end. That said, this review has some spoilers. Even though this movie has been out for some time, if you have not seen it you may wish to before reading more of this review. The film is a novel on screen, full of types, metaphors, and references just like any great work of literature. The odd star seen too grow in the East announces the coming of something new, ultimately revealing it is a planet on a collision course with Earth. Under this star the wise men bearing gifts are attending a wedding instead of a birth. Like Shakespeare, there is no lack of biblical connection in this film. This is a complex story of mankind, of our hopes and fears. It is told from the view of the atheist, Justine (Kirsten Dunst), a seer of doom able to know that we are alone, the only life in the cosmos, and soon to be extinguished. "We are alone" she says, and like the soon coming planet named Melancholia she personifies the depression that logically follows. She is struggling with that which is supposed to give our lives meaning; marriage, family, work all wrapped up in one night. All the while her mother's voice in her head proclaims with one hundred percent certainty the meaninglessness of it all. Her sister begs her not to listen to that voice but to hold steady. Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), is the voice of reason, and meaning. She has the strength to push forward, to bath her severely depressed sister, to force her to ride their horses even if to nowhere, and to put one foot in front of the other even when it is a struggle.The strong patriarch, John (Kiefer Sutherland), the provider of safety for the family, seeing his role doomed, lies down in a manger and gives up his life. The matriarch, Justine, covers him with hey, and even the animals are still and silenced by this scene. The child, Leo (Cameron Spurr), devises a simple little twisted wire contraption which reveals more truth than all the scientists of the world, doom is coming, and it is assured. This leads to one of the most beautiful moments in the film. Justine, the utterly depressive hopeless disconnected atheist, reaches out and embraces the child. She makes a willful conscious decision to pass on the answer she has so long rejected. It is a sacrifice of intellect and knowledge as she wraps the child in the comfort of Myth. She tells him that his father, the patriarch, forgot something. He forgot about the magic cave. And through the ritual of whittling and fashioning sticks from the earth, they lose their cares and concerns as they create one last spire pointing to heaven. As Justine, Claire, and Leo crawl into the magic cave, a retreat into Plato's cave, the second and most touching scene of the film occurs. Doom approaches and Justine finally realizes something. They each reach out, hold hands, and connect. We may be the only life in the cosmos, but we are not alone, we have each other.It is then, in the chapel built and fashioned by their own hands, they go to the fear and hope of glory together. "Melancholia" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Profanity, nudity, hopelessness.MELANCHOLIAWritten and directed by Lars von Trier; director of photography, Manuel Alberto Claro; edited by Molly Malene Stensgaard; production design by Jette Lehmann; costumes by Manon Rasmussen; produced by Meta Louise Foldager and Louise Vesth; released by Magnolia Pictures.

		<shortDescription>Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is a very philosophical film and much of what you see when you watch it, you may not get all at once, so I am just briefly going over the basic synopsis for the film, but please understand that there is a fair bit to this film and one viewing of it to fully appreciate and understand it simply is not enough. As the film starts out Justine, has just married Michael and they arrive late at the wedding party afterwards much to the disgust of several of the guests there. The first part of the film focuses mainly on Justine. As the film starts out we see her laugh and smile often and see that she is taking a lot in on which is a very busy day. As the rest of the day unfolds however, we see that Justine is drawing more into herself and away from others. She often skips out on the different wedding parties and receptions that are being held for her and prefers to remain alone. The once radiant smile on her face as turned into a frown and the brightness and excitement we once saw in her eyes at the beginning of the film is going away as she now looks simply exhausted and very physically, emotionally and mentally stressed. As the film goes on Justine goes into a deeper and deeper depression and state of melancholy which nobody can seem to bring her out of. Her friends and family are at this time, of no use to her and a lot of the guests at the party from her closest family and friends to her boss at work, all seem to want to get something out of Justine, and they all seem to be their for their own selfish interests and many of them end up being very self indulgent, rude and further add to the stress of the day. All these events just barely scratch the surface of Justine's deep depression though. We see that it is more than that that is bothering her and she may just have to be on her own for awhile. The second part of the film focuses on Justine's sister Claire and her husband John. Justine is staying with them, so she is still a major part of the story, but now Claire also seems to slowly go into a panic and dread with the news of a new planet approaching Earth and starts to get desperate and frantic concerning hers and her family's safety if said planet was to collide. That just touches the film's subject matter briefly because I think depending on what you see in the film, that everyone will have their own interpretations of what is going on and how to add things up in the final act and the end of the film. I like how Melancholia did not give us any easy answers, but instead gives us time and room to think and ponder the events going on before our eyes. There is certainly a lot to think about and digest when watching this film and I appreciated it for giving us that. The story while it may sound simple has so much to it on several different levels that this would be the perfect thesis paper for a student of film, philosophy, or even psychology. The film and it's filmmaker are not interested in giving us a fast paced, big budget film that is easy to understand and with a lot of action. It takes the opposite route and gives us something more challenging, thought provoking and overall worthwhile. Because of this the film may not be for everyone, but for the art house crowd they will love it. The performances are also all very good here, but I have to single out Kirsten Dunst who plays Justine. It is a terrific performance and one of the best of last year and the single best performance of Dunst's career. We can feel her depression and pain and just how she can evoke so much feeling from us with her facial gestures, body posture and movements to the sadness and despair in her eyes. She does a great job and it was a great performance which was sadly excluded from the Academy Award nominees list. The film is also a great looking film and it is all just so intriguing and thought provoking that as I said you definitely need to see the film more than once to get everything. That being said, I hope I do get a chance to see it again soon, because I know I will get even more out of it and like it even more after a repeat viewing. While not for everyone this is a challenging film that gets what depression is really like and takes us on a thought provoking and unpleasant ride with it and I for one was really glad about that. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film. One of the year's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came home from watching this movie and am still numb. This is an exceptionally hard movie and I felt some of Kurbrick, Antonioni, Bergman and Tarkovsky throughout. This is a deep meditation on life, or rather the end of the world and how we choose to deal with it. There is a wonderful point-counterpoint between the two sisters, Justine (Dunst) and Claire (Gainsbourg). In the first half, Justine is helpless and can't function in any way; she is melancholic because she knows that the world is ending. Claire is her caregiver, and the only person who can tolerate her. In the second half of the movie, there is a complete role reversal--because Justine can see the truth so clearly she's learned to deal with it, while the usually responsible Claire, can't handle things at all. Strange things occur, particularly in the first half of the movie, at what has to be the oddest wedding in cinema history, truly worthy of Buneul at his peak. I should mention that this is not a cheap looking film shot on a shoestring. Instead it is beautifully shot and the detail throughout (costumes, cinematography, sets, and music) and world class. This is not a film for everyone (as always seems to be the case with Von Trier), but it is a great accomplishment at least as good as his seminal "Breaking the Waves". Be prepared for a stiff drink or anti=anxiety pill after the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The force of the nonrepresentational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do we watch movies? Read books? Encounter art? For entertainment? Escape? Truth? Yet it always misses the mark. Film is never a depiction of the world as it is. Art is always-already representation, a farce. To wish for more will always leaves us wanting. A filmmaker (artist) who appreciates the futility of striving for realism has the power to touch on the "real" subjects that give substance and meaning, the in-between relations - shared but never sufficient to bridge the infinitesimally enormous chasms that connect us.The cinematic tools (stilted acting, otherworldly starkness, discontinuities - so loathed by a number of critics) function as constant reminders that "this is only a movie". With "Antichrist" and "Melancholia", Von Trier has honed these tools to the point of being able to offer both a believability to the narrative while always hinting at a tinge of dissonance - the kind that lingers in the face of impending doom.The joy of this film (and others by Von Trier) is the vitality and force given to the incommensurable fact that we are all hopelessly alone, never understood, and communication (representation) premised on an attempt to overcome these failures is pointless. Lars Von Trier is a necessary voice in his commitment to the affirmation inherent in these pronouncements. Huddled in the "magic cave" moments before annihilation, we are presented with three choices (possibilities): naiveté, existential resolve, and anxious fear. We are compelled to ask the question, how else to respond to the inevitability of death? The clarity of Von Trier's is a muddled one, open to accusations of pretense. Profundity is rarely spelled out and is always lacking, but what isn't? Art that suggests otherwise is the real pretender.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melanchiolia... and the haunted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Melancholia with a friend. And after the movie finished while we were mesmerized by it, we both could not explain many parts of the film. So we started discussing about our takes for a couple of days and below is what we *think* what the movie was all about: The movie is about Claire, and how Melancholia (not only the planet. but in general, melancholy) takes everything from her. Justine is the reason Clair loses everything and she never lets her go until she takes everything from her. Remember the scenes they were riding horses together and Justine's horse refused to pass the lake's bridge. I think the lake resembles Claire's world. We never see any other place except Clair's house and a view of it that shows the horizon behind the trees. Claire's world is surrounded by those trees. When Claire tried to pass the lake (and symbolically, pass the jail she's surrounded with), Justine made her come back.In the second part we see another Justine. Clair's husband tried to give her hope. Showing how beautiful Melancholia is and convincing her that it is no threat to earth. But Justine takes it all away. Justine KNOWS what's going to happen. because the universe *is* melancholic. Justin is closer to the nature of the universe than anyone else. That's why she knew how many beans was in the bottle. Melancholia to Clair, is just like Justine. She looks at it with telescope and tells john "it looks friendly" but sometimes it frightens her. Just like she tells Justine : "Sometimes I hate you so much." Anyone else near Justin left her. Mom, Dad, husband (to be). The only one who stayed was Clair. And Justine will never stop until she takes everything from Clair. The horses are another way to show us how close nature is to Justine. When John commits suicide in the barn, they all go calm and quiet. It's like now Justine achieved what she wanted. Taking away her husband and eliminating a rival. The last thing you can take away from human in hope. And she did it when she assured Claire that we are the only ones in the universe. And we're going to die soon. No other living creature exists in the universe and life will end soon in the whole universe.Anyway, that's just my take and I wanted to share my thoughts with anyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A quick caveat: I've come to IMDb for several years but this is the first time I've felt compelled to voice my opinion.Great acting for the most part, interesting, beautiful, visuals, and great accompanying music. That said if, as the prior review that I read, this is the 2011 movie of the year 100 years from now, were screwed.Fundamentally, this is a movie about a family of misfits with absolutely no flow or connection. The closest I could come was two completely separate movies with some of the same characters. Quetin Tarintino (sp?) does much better and more entertaining. And I think that's the fundamental flaw, its not entertaining and while the characters were drawn out enough to draw my ire, why watch a depressing movie about being depressed? One of my all time favorite movies is What Dreams May Come which did a better job of making you feel Robin William's pain of missing his wife and understanding what she was going through and from his wife's perspective the lonely deadness of the depression. Melancholia doesn't. It's depressing just to be depressing. And calling it "Art House" doesn't make it better. For what it's worth I don't think this is the movie of Winter 2011. Save your money and go spend the day with the over the top depressed person in your family. You'll understand better, they'll appreciate it, and maybe someone will tell Lars that music and cinematography don't equate to a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is that 'Melancholia' is on a par with '2001'.Simply, you'll either be captivated or you won't. Some viewers of '2001' react with hostility upon the conclusion of that film. You can explain it to them over and over and they just see garbage.'Melancholia' is to emotion as '2001' was to intellect. It forces one into the most emotional extreme there is the same way '2001' forces one to grasp a greater intellectual construct.Those who call films like these "garbage" simply don't get it. But it's simple, really: the two films posit there may be something out there bigger than we are.98/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dizzifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia made me dizzy -- literally and figuratively. It's "one of those movies" that uses sloppy, seasick hand-held camera-work (or a simulacrum of such) to create a supposedly "edgy" feel that, maybe, once upon a time, suggested cinema verité documentaries and super-low-budget guerrilla-made features. The thing is, it actually carries none of that information anymore -- the look has been so thoroughly co-opted by 2nd-rate Hollywood television series and 3rd-rate movies that it is nothing today but a purely stylistic conceit, and one that is predictable, pretentious and irritating. At best you cease to notice it; at worst, as when after Kirsten Dunst delivers a particularly strong line near the end of the movie and the camera operator does a quick push-in-zoom to emphasize her emotions, it comes off as the aesthetic of cheesy reality television. Ironically, in its effort to seem "real", the actual result is to emphasize that you are watching something highly stylized, and not in an interesting way.All these artistic failures of the camera style only add insult to injury, as the movie literally had me covering my eyes for long portions, as I sat there in a cold, clammy sweat, ready to stumble into the men's room and vomit if it became necessary.That I sat through such physical uncomfortableness to make it to the end of this movie is a testament to how otherwise compelling and interesting it is. It's a weird combination: Last Year at Marienbad meets Armageddon... but it's mostly Marienbad with Armageddon as the scenic, rather than dramatic, backdrop. In its languid, dreamy pace, to me it actually captured far better the psychological state of such an impending, magnificent disaster than the typical pedal-to-the-metal Hollywood blockbuster. You felt the sick fear, the anticipation, the disbelief, and mostly the sadness of everything. More than almost any movie I can think of, Melancholia communicates the immense scope and power of the oncoming destructive force: a force that is literally not on a human scale and thus cannot be comprehended by humans, except in the most primitive of ways -- holding up a handmade wire loop to see if it is growing nearer or far; watching animals for a cue how to respond; tasting the diminishing oxygen in the air and knowing... knowing. The way Justine's mental illness dovetails with the psychological suffering that all will soon experience is gracefully done, and you are left to wonder: were her mental problems simply the effect of her prescience, her foreknowledge of things to come (as we see in the opening sequence, which to me is in retrospect a look at her dreams and hallucinations), or is there something deeper wrong with her which coincidentally makes her more sensitive to the oncoming storm? "Life on earth is evil," she says, making you feel that she herself is some alien, malignant force that is in opposition to the everyday, biological desires of the other animals: she rebuffs her husband; beats her horse cruelly; loathes her sister and her boss. She is a force to be reckoned with, even before the planet Melancholia makes its appearance.Apart from the glaring misstep of the camera-work (besides my suffering, something drove several people from the screening early, and I suspect it was that rather than the story, though without exit interviews, who knows for sure?), this is a superb movie that you won't forget anytime soon. It's a sad tale, full of darkness, both on the macro scale (the planet), and the micro (the unhappy wedding and all the bitter relationships revealed therein). It's not going to send you out into the streets with fresh wind in your sails to conquer the bad guys in your life. But it will make you think, make you look at the sky differently, perhaps, and make you wonder what life is all about anyway, and that's what you look for in the movies, after all, isn't it? That and some great special effects -- and Melancholia has some super special effects, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually didn't watch Melancholia, because for a films like this i use one special player with 10sec.jump option.So I was jumping across Melancholia.One can't really speak about this movie.I understand people who liked it, probably they experienced the mood of the film,the actual melancholia.But that's all in the movie, only a mood.No story ,no real feelings ,no thoughts, no real conversations. LvT said that :"In Melancholia it's interesting to see how the characters we follow react as the planet approaches Earth." If I can comment this, first I will say there is no WE in "we follow" ,Lars von Trier is not with us he is not WE,he is from another planet,may be Melancholia.Secondly, who cares how the characters will react at the end of the world, this really egocentric.If the end of the world is coming which twisted mind is thinking only about himself closed in a medieval castle.Who cares about the characters if it is the end of the world.It is the end of everything.THIS IS THE END!The end should be the main event,the character not the two non interesting sisters.At the end I can say that now I really like Antihrist, because the movie has great theme -The revenge of the women, but here I can't find theme ,only a mood-melancholia.This time there is not afterwords for Tarkovski,but the film is using the basic idea of "The Sacrifice"(Offret)1986.Melancholia is not in a same league with Offret.Tarkovski is an author with clear ideas and goals in his art.Lars von Tries is just mad ,he is not genius...Still I will expect his next movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vertiginous travel into the inevitable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all philosophical perspective I'd like to write a few words about this movie.It guides us into some kind of inversion. It's a process in which comes in and then comes out and vice-versa ? an IMpression versus DEpression. I mean that the real point is ? despite the obvious macrocosmos and microcosmos perspective ? the complete equivalence of "forms" running side-by-side and in unison. What we realize, going straight to the point, is a vertiginous gazing, a one of a kind vision that we don't want to face or we're too afraid to do so. Von Trier's magnificent work is perfect into what he wants to express and It certainly forces us into this deep anguish and anxiety. It takes us nervous because it's the point he wants to hit ? we can see it through the camera movements. "Vertigo" is the word for this "Sartrean" nauseating reality: the freedom amid the nothingness, the insignificance of life in contrast with a whole infinite universe and the anguish before an inescapable fate. All of this may pass through the viewer's heart and I'm sure It is the core of this beautiful piece of Von Trier's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always with von Trier, it's a roller-coaster ride and NO - they did NOT strap you in!!! The movie opens a la Terrence Mallick, or even Koyaniqaatsi mode - the beautiful poise and balance - visual poetry - of the colossal reaches of the heavens, as planet Melancholia springs from behind the sun and eventually merges with planet Earth. Then too is the strangely Tarkovskian tug (Solaris), as the lead character defines an affinity in herself for this enigmatic planet. It exerts a gravity, a pull on her that she is keen to explore, or even somehow identify with, however that may work itself out. And finally, echoes and resonances of Demme's 'Rachel Getting Married', as the revels and the joy of this celebration of wedlock rapidly decays and lays bare the diseased dysfunctionalism behind this silk and lily veneer. In the space of 2 hours the 'heroine' goes from having it all, to having nothing at all - except when the planetary fusion is imminent, she perhaps cheers up a tad! As I say, you're never strapped-in for a von Trier roller-coaster ride...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have to admit that this is probably the most beautiful film (in pure visual terms) that I have seen in a long, long time.At some points, it brings back the "taste" of 2001 A Space Odyssey. However the film does not fly? Why so? Because the film is simply too beautiful, too perfect, too calculated to be believable. It seems a piano solo performed by HAL. Absolutely flawless in each single note, but when you hear it, somehow you can feel that there is no human hearth behind?Lars Von Trier has left his best cinema well behind (for me, the first season of The Kingdon and Breaking the Waves). This combination of his immense talent and his even bigger ambition is probably a "fatal mix"(it seems that he NEEDS to come with a new "masterpiece" every time he sits behind the camera).Perfect is cold and cobalt blue. And this film is probably too perfect and therefore too cold and cobalt blue.Sometimes you have to give away a piece to save the whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very depressing. Actings are great and the scenery is beautiful. I found this movie to be painful and annoying to watch, but I couldn't stop watching since I wanted to find out what will happen next. I am still confused about Chapter 1: Justine's behaviour was very odd and was never explained. I preferred Chapter 2 over Chapter 1. However I was very disappointed by the ending since many of my questions were left unanswered. On the more positive note, I think this movie does a great job depicting pain, fear, powerlessness, acceptance of death, confusion,and not knowing what will happen. This movie is the exact definition of its name: melancholy: deep, and long lasting sadness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is with this principle Von Trier made this film (look it up, he has been quoted as saying this). This is a movie about accepting fate in a system of disbelief. It has a stark and, at times deeply depressing, message, but it is so profoundly laid out on film. This, like Tree of Life, is highly divisive visual poetry, although I would argue their is less agnosticism here, and more pure nihilism. This is a film that asks, "what if THIS life is all we have?" very directly and beautifully. Dunst deserves an Oscar for her role as the depressed central character, but I would be surprised if she even got a nomination given this film's super indie nature and Cannes success.If you know anything about German romanticism - this is probably the best use of it in film, in America - ever, and in general - in many years.See this movie, it will likely conjure up feelings in you much like a great Chopin composition, and very few movies get that kind of comparison from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia (2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film of great depth and incredible power. Von Trier gives us one of his most restrained and yet visceral efforts. Melancholia is just as the title would suggest. It's depressing and slow, but it's easy to find the beauty that hides within. The film begins with the supposed destruction of the planet as another planet crashes into it. This is all shot in a super slow-motion dreamlike sequence. This captures the tone from the very outset. We are then taken to part 1 of the movie. It starts, surprisingly, with a very humorous shot of a limousine trying to wind down a very windy country path. We are soon at a reception for Kirsten Dunst and Alexander Skarsgard. Dunst seems happy at first, but from the reactions of her family it's clear to see she is hiding sadness. As the night progresses we see the upper classes mingle with awkward emotions, mostly defined by the conflict between Dunst's divorced parents. The second part of the film has DUnst arriving at Sutherland and Gainsbourg's house, now a completely shattered woman. We also find out that a planet is going to come dangerously close to the Earth in what is known as a flyby. This is when the film becomes absolutely terrifying. The impending doom of something that can't be stopped is just painful to see unfold. There are moments of hope and love, but it soon escalates into beating the audience into submission. Funnily enough, with such a disaster approaching, Dunst begins to ease up and it is Gainsbourg that panics. This role reversal can be seen in many ways. To Dunst, it perhaps makes sense to panic about the simple things in life, but knowing of a definite end is what really comforts her. One day we'll all be dead, and that's when the panic will be over. Dunst is a revelation in this film, and I'm not just saying that because she is my favorite actress. Nor because she gets naked (teehee). A crushed soul is one of intense weakness, and even through the depression it's clear to see her attempts at loving her husband. Sutherland is also strong, as a strong man in a position to do absolutely nothing, except try and calm is wife. Like Tree of Life before it, this film is for those that like a movie to calm them whilst thrilling them at the same time.</fullReview>

With that in mind, I found the movie not slow, but very well paced, with great direction and superb acting. Camera work is outstanding. The comments stating that the middle part of the movie is, well, weak, are in my opinion - wrong.The director tried to give us the pointlessness of everyday/usual/common behavior of people, opposed to the ultimate sadness and hopelessness of the situation at which the main characters (and the rest of mankind) are placed in the end. The characters are engaging and well developed (this, of course goes for the main roles, the others, are, I believe, purposefully flat) Acting by Charlotte Gainsborg and Kirsten Dunst is superb (and I finally convinced myself that she can act :)) The visuals are amazing, and the ending left me numb and silent for quite some time. Do find the time to watch this movie, it is definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The melancholy unity between the living and the dead." James Joyce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enjoy it while it lasts." Justine's mother, Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), on the day of Justine's wedding.Lars von Trier's Melancholia, a dramatic science fiction film in which the titular planet moves toward and away from earth, is like the second half of Mike Cahill's recent Another Earth, in which a planet also appears in the sky as close as the moon. Metaphors abound, of course, as our other selves and our darkest fears become manifest in the foreign intrusions.Besides the obvious melancholic nature of living embodied in the encroaching body, Melancholia tells of two worlds in two sections: the human comedy in Justine's (Kirstin Dunst) wedding party in the first part, and her sister Claire's (Charlotte Gainsbourg) growing fear in the second part about the visiting planet while Justine grows more mature and sure of herself. In effect both represent the human awareness of a Bergman-like deathly presence as in the Seventh Seal. (In fact, the banquet and the ensuing muted chaos remind me of his Wild Strawberries.) No scene in the film can match the exotic forest scene where Justine, nude and perfect in form, bathes in the light of the new planet, offering herself it would seem to a force both romantic and unknown. Perhaps the scene crystallizes the film's duality: sensual life versus impending death. While von Trier has an affinity for the abstract and symbolic (among others see Dogville and Dancer in the Dark), in Melancholia he is what he is: representing flawed humanity in a spare allegory with little hope those disasters, be they family or cosmic, are unavoidable in the larger context of an indifferent universe and a mentally-challenged humanity.On that last point, von Trier is no stranger to aberrations (witness his recent comments about Hitler) and it would seem to mental instability (most of the characters in Melancholia are in stages of melancholy if not downright suicidal mentality). For most of the audience, writer/director von Trier may be too abstract, formalistic, and downright fuzzy.For me, he has attacked our inclination to optimism and hope and traded them for a magic realism that moves like the new planet into resignation to the human condition and acceptance of death that can bring serenity if you look at it not through the telescope of narrow vision but straight on as it inevitably consumes the earth.</fullReview>

Then there are movies like this. This movie is very very deep and full of symbolism, and as much as I'd like to I don't understand a lot of it. Much like "Tree Of Life" there was much more going on in this then just the surface stuff. The acting by Dunst blew me away and this is a good movie, but very hard to grasp (for me at least). Overall, a good movie but one that you must open your mind for in order to grasp all of it.

		<shortDescription>Happy New Year Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the holiday season again, and with it comes the usual slate of talking-animal Christmas movies and lame rom-coms set on New Year's Eve. I feel it's my duty to counterbalance this overt cheerfulness with just a little bit of morbidity. So, to open 2012, I'm going with my favourite film of last year bar none: Lars von Trier's Melancholia, a film about a newlywed bride's severe depression and crumbling relationship with her caretaker sister. Sounds none too festive, right? It gets better. The story is set during the last days on Earth, before a foreign planet collides with ours and all life is obliterated forever. Yeah.Before anyone becomes too concerned with the end of the world, though, we are treated to Justine's (Kirsten Dunst) wedding, an extravagant affair paid for by her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and Claire's husband John (Kiefer Sutherland). After everything that could go wrong does go wrong during the evening, Justine does not leave the party with her new husband (Alexander Skarsgard), but stays at Claire's castle where the reception took place. The next day, as John and son Leo (Cameron Spurr) become increasingly giddy at the chance for a firsthand glimpse of the planet expected to simply 'pass us by', Claire's anxiety peaks and Justine's depression consumes her.The film exists in two distinct parts: one covering the wedding night, and the other the aftermath. Surprisingly, Part One makes for such a well crafted, engaging story that the whole 'world is ending' angle almost seems like an unnecessary gimmick. It is an intriguing, intimate look into the mind-numbing array of family dynamics at play during what should be Justine's special night. Much of its brilliance must be credited to a tight script and, subsequently, the characterisation of the act's central figure. Rather than being lazily written as a 'woe-is-me' sad sack that finds no joy in the night's proceedings, Justine draws audience sympathy nice and early through her efforts to make the best of things despite the social disaster unravelling around her. One gets the impression that she does have a genuine love for some people, but the vexing truth is that, in spite of the seemingly significant ramifications of this night, things are about to get far more sinister. We know this because von Trier leaves the viewer in no doubt as to how this film will end. The opening act is an incredible collection of surreal scenes depicting the Earth's destruction, set to the chilling prelude to opera Tristan und Isolde. So when Claire's fears are temporarily relieved towards the end of the film, it feels devilishly cruel to lead on this fearful individual when the audience is already aware of what is still to come. Put simply, it could be said that Part One is the cinematic masterclass, with heavy emphasis being placed on all things that make a quality film (beautiful imagery, well-structured dialogue and purposeful character interaction) while Part Two is the thematically charged intellectual piece, where the audience is not spoon-fed, but rather challenged to find personal meaning in the events unfolding on screen.Certainly, by the time the second half comes around, the security blanket separating caged fiction from terrifying reality has well and truly been removed. In the morning after the wedding, the world has become a much darker place, in both a literal and metaphysical sense. Justine's condition has degraded from a person battling with flashes of doom, to one that has become sedate and eerily calm in her total submission to the illness. In contrast, Claire, who has lived a balanced, comfortable life up until this point according to universal standards (big house, married, young son, et al), and who therefore has so much more to live for, refuses to accept the inevitable. It is through this polarising pair of characters that Melancholia offers the foundation of many different interpretations regarding the film's true meaning. Personally, it appears to be not only an exposition of universal perception and understanding one's significance in the context of all things, but also an assertion of how human beings might act in times of inescapable disaster. It begs the question: 'How do you think you would react in this situation?' But perhaps more importantly: 'How would you like to react?' This notion is hammered home when, in the film's heart-pounding and visually spectacular closing moments, the seemingly soulless Justine still finds time for one last act of utterly selfless heroism, even in the face of certain death.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely, sad and exceptional film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is often a mistake to read a review of a new film prior to seeing it in theater. The review can raise expectations that cannot be satisfied, and can spoil the fun of discovery even if the reviewer does his/her best not to include spoilers. Luckily for me this film was an exception to this rule. I read its review by A.O. Scott in NYT before deciding to see it, but the review did not prepare me for the impact that the film had on me. The probable reason for this lucky discrepancy is that this is such an original film that it is hard to summarize it in a review. So, I won't attempt to do so. Yes, it is about a planet called Melancholia and yes, it is about a sense of melancholy Kirstin Dunst's character experiences, but the way the two are connected is hard to explain. It is, however, worth waiting for all the two hour length of the film for this relationship to unfold. In fact, it is much easier to say what the film is not, than what it is about. Yes, the film is about a strange planet, but it is not science-fiction. Yes, the film is about mental illness, but it is not a psychodrama. Yes, it has recognizable veteran actors such as John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling, but the most compelling performance is by the relatively young Ms. Dunst. She constructs a character that is elusive, troubled and entirely compelling. Wow, what a performance! Those of us who have grown to think of her as the harmless white bread love interest of Spiderman, better think again. It would have been so easy for her to turn her character into an Ophelia, but she didn't. Here is a young actress with considerable talent who can give a subtle performance. I also laud Lars von Trier for his bold treatment of the subject of mental illness and different ways of coping with it. Mr. von Trier is always provocative, but sometimes rather irritating in his films. In Melancholia, he has achieved something very difficult- a provocative and highly original film that transcends genres and expectations, but satisfies nonetheless. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold, boring and probably rushed ; the worst of Lars Von Tier yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Von Trier however this is his worse movie up today. As always, the movie is divided in acts; this time based on the names of the two sisters, Justine and Claire who basically from the tale. The first act is Justine's wedding which Trier tries to distanciate from Vinterberg's Celebration, ending in something that does not make any sense and it is not even funny or emotive. The second act Claire, starts after the wedding with her taking care of a very depressed Justine. Everything is about depression; but it is not difficult to feel that way when world about to collide with another planet ( which happens in the first scene of the movie ) so I have no idea where was he intended to go with that premise.In fact, I believe Trier run out of ideas, so he basically barely edit the movie (there are scenes and characters that does not make any sense(like Udo Kier character) or framing and continuity errors. Probably 30 minutes less (the movie is over two hours) could help at least to make it more bearable.Trier is obviously well recognized and admired; the movie has Kristen Dunst and Charlotte Gainsburg in an interpretative duel worth seeing by itself; but also a list of very good actors doing little more than cameos.Really a pity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The incipit of the movie, offering wonderful tableaux vivants arranged on a dreamlike progression, on the notes of a ravishing classical music, made me soon realize I was going to see something aesthetically refined and artfully conceived. And indeed, it was. The first part is set mainly inside a wonderful mansion in the countryside, but the beauty of nature outside is strongly opposed to the ugliness of human relationships inside, human sympathy is absent, although a wedding party is being held. The second part is dominated by Nature, beautiful and threatening at the same time, and it is marked by a crescendo of emotional anxiety until the final impressive ending.No flaws in the execution: perfect location, stunning photography, intelligent screenplay, sharp shooting, not to mention the chiaroscuro play in the nighttime scenes... And the cast is simply superb: I found Kirsten Dunst's performance as bewitching, and mesmerizing, probably the best and more mature of her career up date, and the pairing with Charlotte Gainsbourg proves intense and strongly felt.There's certainly a contrast between the pessimism of the whole picture, where the world, humanity, seems to deserve dissolution, as the natural consequence to the lack of any real sense, and the formal perfection of the work of art representing this apocalyptic vision, as if art were the only value in life, the only means to transcend this existential emptiness. Whether you agree or not with the pessimistic and apocalyptic vision, but from this director you cannot expect a positive one, what is undeniable is the high visual quality and the perfect execution of a great piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for an SF or chick flick - look elsewhere. This will just be a waste of time and money.This is Donnie Darko taken to the extreme. In that film, you could get SF view on things or a realistic psychological view of it to get your mind around the weird elements.Not so for this film. It's an allegory. Planets colliding, end of the world, nowhere to hide, hope and hopelessness, no one to protect, no one to protect you, nothing that can be done but wait for the end...That's melancholia - that mind-numbing depth of despair that Lars von Trier is describing though the viewpoint of two sisters.The two parts are distorted slices of the same multi-dimensional reality. There are many subtle details that tie together both. And more than a little heavy-handedness - as if von Trier doesn't trust his audience.But it's not just the cleverness that makes it worth watching - otherwise it would be a bad Lynch film. There is genuine human emotion in the interactions. Each brings out a different element of melancholia. We can not help but watch fascinated and helpless as the disaster slowly evolves to its inevitable conclusions.So sad yet so beautiful...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gem ... A Sparkling Diamond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Melancholia" is one of the most surprising and enjoyable films that I've seen in years. Maybe it was the mood I was in, assisted by a 'chaw' of K-2 incense.The film's "story" is told primarily through absolutely stunning "visuals". Don't miss one second of the film's opening sequence. Like Stanley Kubrick's "2001 Space Odyssey", "Melancholia" begins with a sequence of slow motion scenes, each more visually arresting than the previous. The entire 12 minute sequence is set to the thrilling crescendo of Wagner's opera score for "Tristan and Isolde". (Throughout the entire film the background music is wonderful; come prepared to appreciate it all.) This opening sequence ends with an amazing space shot of a monster planet crashing into, and completely obliterating a much smaller planet which looks like the planet earth. Every shot in this opening sequence is a visual treat, and each is directly related to, and foretells the story that unfolds.Like "2001 Space Odyssey", this movie is not for everyone. An elderly, 70-plus couple sitting behind us in the theater whispered very loudly (several times) to her hard-of-hearing mate: "This is a very strange movie!!". Indeed it is. And it's wonderful!! After the stunning opening sequence, the story/plot unfolds with a minimalist, intelligent dialogue that is focused on the film's principle purpose -- an honest but sympathetic depiction of serious, clinical depression (or what used to be called "melancholy").Several immediate family members have had depression, and I can attest that the film's description is fundamentally accurate. There are the euphoric highs, when the depressed feel falsely empowered to blow off authority figures (such as the 'boss', the career, the husband, the loving/caring family members, etc.) The mania is followed shortly by the 'lows' when the depressed become obsessed with death -- and are sometimes rendered incapable of leaving their beds or even moving their limbs. In one scene the depressed beauty, Kirsten Dunst, cannot raise her leg high enough to enter a warm bath that her loving sister has drawn. In another scene Dunst, alone in the woods, literally baths naked in the light of the monster death planet that is fast approaching earth -- and her.Yet the closer the death planet gets to earth, the calmer and more rational the depressed Dunst becomes. Because she's been obsessing about death for months -- maybe years -- she's prepared and the only adult family member capable of accepting the inevitability of death with some dignity.After reading several critics' reviews I was surprised that many missed the film's 'commanding heights' attention to clinical depression, preferring instead to focus on the 'end-of-the-world' dramatics. For me the end of the world theme is a mere plot device that serves the overarching focus on depression. (And what a plot device it is!) To be sure the film has several minor flaws. A few scenes strained credibility and therefore distracted. For example, it is extremely unlikely that even a manic depressive bride would ravage a male intern in the middle of a well-lite mansion lawn where she's just taken her wedding vows. And in two beautifully filmed scenes the gorgeous black horse that Dunst is riding balks and refuses to cross a small wooden bridge. None of my film buff friends understood how either of these scenes connected to the film's plot or purpose. Obviously, the Director decided they were important -- perhaps symbolic -- scenes, but we just didn't get it. These are minor quibbles, however, and in no way did the flaws detract from the overall thrill of watching this film.The full effect of the visuals and the music are best experienced in a theater -- the larger the better -- rather than via a small laptop/DVD screen.Bottom line: Despite minor flaws, this film is a creative masterpiece that will certainly stand the test of time. It may not be for everyone -- or even for the average movie goer -- but it is certainly an artistic gem -- visual eye candy. What movie fan doesn't appreciate film makers who challenge themselves and us with original, creative treatments of serious, adult topics?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot Spoiler ! !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot Spoiler ! ! - - A mysterious and suddenly appearing "Death Planet", named "Melancholia", becomes trapped in a swiftly decaying elliptical orbit around the Earth, and eventually spirals in and impacts. Everybody dies.It's a sort of cute movie, but I would have renamed it "..Waiting to Die..", had that title not already been taken.The movie is actually a thinly-disguised chic flick about two sisters, who are very close, (..kinda, sorta..) but who don't perform even one sister-on-sister lesbian act anywhere in the movie, which personally spoiled it for me. There are also two good looking horses in the movie, but again, the director misses the point - - life is all about sex - - and the obvious opportunity for the sisters to perform a really nice on screen bestiality act, or to at least ride nude on horseback, was also forever lost.There is some gratuitous nudity of Kirsten Dunst's nice nude body, with her really nice big breasts on display, which would have contrasted nicely with Charlotte Gainsbourg's petite breasts, but little sister didn't get naked for the camera, so, again, another missed opportunity.The movie contains essentially no violence, nor weapons, nor police presence, nor military, nor hysterical news media. Again, you gotta ask, who writes this stuff? What this god-awful touchy-feely chic flick provides is a character study of two sisters, who over a span of a few days, wait to die, as the little planet, named Melancholia, eventually spirals in and smacks into mama earth.The movie also, in my opinion, goes out of its way to be monochromatic and one-dimensional. There is no diversity. There were zero actors of "colour", neither black, nor Asian, nor Hispanic, nor Arabs, etc. There were only pathetic, cowardly, neurotic, and over-privileged white folks. I was also disappointed that the movie was made using the trendy kiddie-cam hand-held camera method, with all of the intentionally stupid shaky camera and poor composition effects, instead of using a proper steady cam.As the planet Melancholia makes its final orbit and heads in for the kill, all electrical systems fail, the earth's magnetic poles flip-flop, strange atmospheric things happen, birds and insects fall out of the sky, and the horses go nuts. Predictably, the Hollywood stereotype roles, which were already reversed, flip around a little more, and the weak men run off or commit suicide, the neurotic sister becomes the stronger one, and the 'normal' sister becomes the weaker one. Both of the women act their roles as if they are alcohol-dependent and/or Seroquel and Paxil abusers.Mostly, it is a movie about "waiting to die", and I wasn't impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier needs a good editor - an exercise in frustration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I can't say I wasn't intrigued by Melancholia, and I can't say it's the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's very much not a masterpiece. If I had to describe the film's methodology, I'd say that it was made by a film student who had a great idea and way too much money to throw at it, with no editorial control. It's visually wonderful, with a prologue that runs like a music video, full of striking and portentous images, including CGI of the Earth being smashed into by a smaller planet, so it's no spoiler to say you know this movie is going to end badly. There's a rather big clue to this movie's biggest problem - the overblown ego of its writer and director - in that the movie is titled 'Lars Von Trier's Melancholia'. The movie begins with Part 1, Justine. It all starts well - a little humour, interesting and realistic family and interpersonal relationships, the threads of various plot lines - but the humour is shortlived, the family relationships never clarified or expanded upon, and many interesting hints are never explored or resolved. Characters are introduced to be abandoned. We spend hours at Justine's wedding and at the end I couldn't say why we'd bothered. Everything of importance could have been much more effectively dealt with in a shorter timeframe. Part 2, Claire, is more gripping and actually has a plot, but it's not enough to redeem the waste of time that is Part 1. Add to this Von Trier's abuse of the viewer with torture by shaky-cam, a soundtrack that veered wildly from capturing every breath, snort or scratch to full-blown blasting of Wagner, and some scenes that were apparently meant to signify something but which don't ever clarify themselves, and you have a terribly frustrating two hours. I'd also like to note here that I've read a lot of the reviews and posts by people who loved this movie, and as far as I can see they didn't actually even follow the basic narrative - some are saying the tension at the wedding is because everyone knows Melancholia is on its way to smash them, but at this point no-one knows this yet. Justine doesn't, contrary to some claims, spot Melancholia as she goes into the reception - she spots Antares. Later, she notes it's gone - which is because Melancholia has moved in front of it. Frankly, I think if those who think it's so great can't even get the narrative correct, then I'm justified in disagreeing with their assessment of this film's quality.If this were a film by a film student, you'd say 'Well, these are great ideas, and you've certainly got a lot to explore here, but you need to refine your focus, tighten your editing and think more clearly about what you're trying to tell us - and for God's sake quit with the shaky camera stuff', but coming from a director with this many films under his belt, it's a terrible mess of egotistic bombast - full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The acting is competent, although I'm not sure why everyone thinks Dunst is great in this. Her performance is solid but not exemplary; she plays everything out very heavy-handedly, with no nuance or subtlety at all. Kiefer Sutherland and Charlotte Gainsbourg do very well, particularly Sutherland,who I think is the best performance in the movie. John Hurt makes his brief role look easy, Skarsgard Junior does a lovely puppy-dog husband, but the fact that Von Trier gets so much out of his actors doesn't redeem the rest of the movie. I was disappointed by this film. It had so much potential. Dogville, while hardly anyone's idea of an enjoyable film, was a truly great work in terms of execution and effect - trim, sharp, cruel and deeply disturbing. By comparison Melancholia is a flabby, overblown thing. I am by no means averse to good art-house, but this is not good anything - it's a great idea ruined by the unlimited self-indulgence of its director. Watch it if you are interested in puzzling out Von Trier's meanings, or if you just generally like movies that leave you asking questions, but don't feel like you're missing out if you don't get to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started off slow, and got slower. I really thought it would eventually take off, and it didn't The occasional scenes with Kirsten nude were not necessary at the points it occurred. She could have been fully dressed in those scenes.(with the exception of the bathtub scene) Most of the talking was a very quiet speech. Almost as if they were just above a whisper. The most noise in the movie was the sound of people leaving in the middle. I bet 10% were gone before the end. I would have too, if i was by myself, and when i mentioned that to my movie partner, i was told next time say something and we could have been gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult viewing experience but still engaging, inventive, saddening and artistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film opens with the end of the world. A large planet named Melancholia, whose path through space has been blocked from our view by the sun, smashes into the much smaller Earth, obliterating it and all on it. There are no Bruce Willis-detonated nukes and no space colony of the elite ? only the end of everything. In case you're in any doubt, this film doesn't want you thinking specifically about the disaster than spends most of the film looming, or how the characters will get out it; the answer is they won't.As everyone knows, this sci-fi has depression at its core and this is what the film is about ? the planet and the destruction of humanity is just a plot device, nothing more than that. We focus on two sisters on the week when one of them is due to get married at personal and financial expense of the other (it is held at a booked out golf-course and hotel). Justine is the bride, suffering from a crippling depression, while her sister Claire has much more of a "balanced" life, with a family and responsibilities. In the first half we see Justine's depression at work while others try to be patient with her or just help her despite not knowing what to do ? all wishing they could make her snap out of it but knowing they can't. In Claire's half of the film we see her suffering from the same feelings of despair and pointlessness, feeling like the world is ending, wanted to get away but knowing she can't flee anywhere. Both are suffering from melancholia ? in Justine's case it is the condition, in Claire's it is the planet.The allegory is just that simple and those that want to discuss what would really happen if the Earth was on a collision course, or the details of the wedding events etc are perhaps missing the point. Essentially the film is showing us the same thing twice using different situations and both are interesting although, because of their parallels, the film does feel like it could have been shorter with both sections losing about 10 minutes or so without any harm done. That said it doesn't feel excessively long and, although there are some clunky lines in here, it doesn't really come over as pretentious because it does draw you into it ? and things rarely feel pretentious when you're on the inside.What really makes it are the performances. Lars von Trier may be difficult to work with (or "for" I should say) and he does suggest he is an idiot whenever he opens his mouth, but he certainly draws everything from his casts ? particularly his actresses. Here he lends his film a gentle approach rather than the harsher, brutal tone that he has had in other films, although he does still ask a lot from his two actresses. In the first half of the film Dunst is brilliant. I have limited experience of depression (a parent went through it when I was younger) but he nails it here; the inability to function, the swings into sadness etc ? she really convinces. In the second half of the film as she takes on the other role gradually I found her less convincing ? although perhaps it was because she was harsher on her opposite number than I thought worked. Dunst is getting the praise, but to me Gainsbourg is the better of them. In the first half she makes a great carer and totally captures the feeling of those dealing with someone else's depression ? we feel her conflicting emotions towards her sister, we know that she is both angry at her for her selfish behaviour while also knowing it is not her fault. In the second half she also captures the depression and makes it work while also keeping it about the planet. The male characters don't have as much meat and are generally by the side of these two, although Sutherland does well as someone who thinks he can drive out the depression by demanding it away (Justine) or reasoning it away (Claire) but then is doing this from a position of being OK. Rampling, Hurt, the Skarsg?rd's and Kier all do decent support but really the film is all about the two lead actresses ? they are bigger than the planet itself.Overall this is not a film for everyone ? it is certainly not a film for anyone who thinks it is a European version of Deep Impact. Nor is it a perfect film as it could have been tighter and the second half is not as good as the first, but it is still very interesting and engaging. As an exploration of depression I found it fascinating and saddening at the same time. It is a clever film and, while an action movie about the same scenario (planet collision) may have been an easier viewing experience, Melancholia is rewarding, inventive and artistic with two central performances that deserve to be in the frame when the awards season comes round.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He, I mean Von Triar, is as brilliant as he is irritating. Some part of me tells me he's having the last laugh at my expense. But then, this film is hypnotic in so many different ways and not all bad. The images will stay with me even if I don't particularly want them to. Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg are sublime, like Thulin and Ullman in "Cries And Whispers" Unfortunatele, their journey comes from the mind and more unfortunately from the pen of one of the great self-promoters of the last 20 years. Enough with the hand held camera, please! The device is not a style anymore but a show of laziness. I have to grant, however, I wasn't bored, I was rather transfixed by the unavoidable planet enveloped in Wagner's Tristan and Isolde.. Kiefer Sutherland plays the selfish coward, with chilling conviction while Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt are a delight in a much to brief appearance. If you love movies you must see this, I think that's part of Lars's con.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful meditation on Being and Nothingness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most beautifully filmed depiction on being and nothingness, ever.I have to warn you, if you like your films light and fluffy, or disaster-films full of apocalyptic warnings and roomful of scientists explaining charts to military personnel, then don't bother with this film, this will not be your cup of tea.If on the other hand, you're used to Von Trier's work, his dark visions of human nature, his haunting cinematography and you're up on your European art and classical education, come watch this and be challenged, pick up the clues, put the jig-saw puzzle together, be blown away and finally silenced into awe.Von Trier has a polarizing affect of his audience, you either love his films or hate them and I'll be upfront, I love his films because he goes places as a director, where angels normally fear to tread. That takes a certain amount of guts, audacity and a whole lot of vision and originality.The opening scenes are a series of vignettes, which by themselves are so heart-breakingly beautiful, they could be painting by themselves, not unlike the visual poetry of the late Tarkovsky or Kieslowski. A castle, two beautiful women and a child drenched in eery moonlight, a bride walking away from a forest as plants seem to be grasping her like something out of an evil fairy tale, a mother and child sinking into the ground, a regal castle and estate looking out over the sea, the tiny Earth colliding into a super planet, Melancholia. A sense of doom hangs over everything.Kirsten Dunst plays Justine, like Ophelia in Sir John Everett Millais' painting, floating in the river and disconnected from the world, not only literally but mentally too in her depression. Money, wealth, power, what does it all mean when you're miserable? Like the Marquis de Sade's Justine, nothing can reach her, not even love or sex. The brightest star in Scorpio, Antares, has suddenly tuned blue. Her little nephew, Leo has built a contraption to view the distance of the planet Melancholia by placing it near the heart. The animals have gone silent.Students of medieval studies will understand the old cosmological world view of attributing absolutely everything in this world to the influence of the old 7 planets, much like C.S Lewis did in his depiction of the Narnia stories, each book attributed with themes and motifs according to each planet. Von Trier does the same here on a much smaller scale. The Saturnine difficult mother, the Jovial happy go lucky father, the heart- centered Son(Sun) Leo, the Mercurial silver-tongued brother-in law John, so good at convincing everyone, the aggressive jerk boss (Mars), the kind, loving husband Michael (Venus), the ever-changing moods of the sister Claire (de Lune --&gt;Moon), the bride who is slowly dying from the inside, Justine (Earth).This film is a meditation on the ultimate emptiness of what we deem to be markers of civilization and culture or success. How in the face of impending doom all these things are finally reduced to what they really mean in the grand scheme of things, absolutely nothing. That may sound depressing when viewed through the lens of Western civilization and materialism, but in many ways this is the doctrine of emptiness which the Buddhists have been preaching about for millennia. This isn't something depressing for them but rather is actually a clarion call to add real meaning to one's life instead by virtue of good deeds and the quality and integrity of the relationships around you, not just by accumulating needless stuff.Maybe it has to do with the sense of malaise the world is feeling now, with the economic downturn, the protesters aflame the world over on the ideological death of capitalism, maybe it's the Mayan calendar allegedly ending in 2012 or the planet Nibiru returning like Zecharia Sitchin wrote about and no doubt influenced Von Trier, who knows? But the film has been timed perfectly to catch the mood and zeitgeist of the world in late 2011. The final scene is one which I don't think I will ever forget and probably ranks right up there with the most amazing scenes ever portrayed on film, beautiful in it's simplicity and awesome in it's power. A Native American-like teepee or sweat lodge is built on top of a hill, at the end of the film, the "magic cave" which Justine promises to Leo will help them. Claire, Justine and Leo sit down inside, they hold hands in a circle because all they have left is each other now. The Earth is no more.</fullReview>

However, I failed to really connect with it or the themes presented. While not wallowing in its misery like ANTICHRIST, the film was almost impenetrable to me and I found it hard to like the movie based solely on anything but what was happening on the surface. Still, the visual aesthetic of the movie remains a strong redeeming quality and the central performances by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg are very impressive, as are the supporting performances by a number of Von Trier regulars.

		<shortDescription>Melancholia delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you make movie named boring crap, and it also happens to be a boring crap, you could say that it delivered, but it's still a boring crap.It starts with the crappiest wedding ever, it gives you good insight of how the rest of the movie looks like. In fact you could even go so far as to compare the two; characters spent a lot of money and energy on that awful wedding just like filmmakers did on this movie and they are both leave you sad and bored. If I had that kind of a wedding, with only old farts and people that I really hate invited, I would be out of my mind miserable, and would probably screw some random guy in the garden (and I am not even gay).There are the two most annoying female characters ever, with their slow, silent line delivery, although it's usually just a couple of words, and vain attempts at conversation which usually end up at "I want to speak with you". From "conversations" you learn as little as possible about the characters, not that it would be better to blatantly explain everything in one sentence, but in one hour you only learn a little something something about the main character, reasons for everyone else's behavior is left to your imagination. It is so slow paced that sometimes it was literally painful to watch. It felt like an frustrating dream in which you are late for an appointment and you keep forgetting stuff and other obstacles keep getting in your way, fortunately dreams last only 15 minutes. I kept on watching only because something had to happen, and it did, but too little and to late. Scientific value is low, though I am no scientist. Science Fiction is usually more about the latter, so it didn't surprise me. Greater focus is on the mystical aspect rather than the real science behind it.It could be a decent short movie of some 30 minutes, to make this an 120+ minutes movie is borderline criminal. It has some pretty nice scenery, even some tense and disturbing scenes, atmospheric environment, for the most of the movie it's dark and gives you the depressing feel, unfortunately it was all overshadowed by lengthy non developing story. If you really must watch it, watch the so called part two, which is the second half of the movie, believe me you won't miss anything. I understand Hitler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main message that I got from the movie is the contrast between the superficiality of all the participants of the wedding, except from Justine and her mother. Justine is able to face life without illusions, but her approach crashes with the display of all the rest. Her mother has become bitter, but she is honest. In contrast, her husband (Justine's father) seems to enjoy life, but when Justine asks him to spend the night, he runs away. Justine says she has to talk to him, but he avoid it by leaving without saying good buy.When faced with the ultimate destiny of the planet crashing into earth, Justine is the only one who does not brake down. To me, this is the main theme of the movie: The lies we make up for ourselves to avoid the hard truths of life that we ultimately have to confront anyway.Justine's sister says that she is ill, but it seems to me that her illness is just being honest.I love the subtle acting and dialog in the film, not overstating a message or moral, but making us think. I guess this is also reflected in the many different interpretations people seem to have of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were twenty-two years old again, I would probably have hated this film. Now that I'm pushing fifty, I can identify with everything that happens in it. You want depth? Von Trier carefully adds layer after layer to each character and, like peeling an onion, we see more of them as the film progresses, all played against the backdrop of an impending metaphorical and literal disaster. Dunst is fascinating to watch; her odd-shaped face expresses emotions that run the gamut from pathos to joy; the film is worth watching just for her world-weary aura. Even watching her force down a breakfast that she doesn't enjoy, surrounded by people she doesn't care about, is a marvelous bit of acting. She finally emerges from her catatonic depression when, during a ride on horseback, she glances up at the sky, sees Melancholia, and says sarcastically: "there's your fly-by", knowing full well that it's a portent of death. At the end of the film, Justine is in her element: she has been preparing for the end of the world her entire life, and it is she who lovingly leads the remaining characters into oblivion, like some kind of all-encompassing earth mother.Charlote Gainsbourg's Claire possesses just as much depth; during Melachonlia's death dance with the earth, moving closer and farther away, her reactions of concern, relief, and then panic, as she realizes her son will never grow up, are played out in all their heart-wrenching sadness, all counterbalanced with Justine's cool, observational detachment.So anyway, hate the film for its flawed sci-fi, its strangely claustrophobic atmosphere, or its implausible situations, but the strength of the film lies in its characters and their relationships to each other. For me, the film was a powerful expression of life, and one I won't soon forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia is an Allegory for Our Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gee, I read the first 20 or so reviews of this movie, and not one of them seemed to get its point. This is not a movie about melancholia (the old-fashioned term for what we today call clinical depression and treat rather effectively with drugs): it's a movie about denial.WARNING: My development of this theme herein might be construed as spoiling, and in any event, I think that this movie requires that one watch it without preconceptions, and all the way through - if you can. I can agree with the many other viewers that this may be a trial: the movie is incredibly slow-paced, virtually plot less, and, yes, depressing, but its purpose is precisely to put one into the mind of first one sister, Justine, the depressive, and then Claire, who is exasperated by her sister's ennui bordering on fugue. But those with the patience are likely to find the whole experience rewarding nonetheless. Others have complained about the apparently amateurish art-house camera-work, and I can understand their irritation (though I didn't particularly notice this myself, so caught up was I in the mood), but there is compensation and reward for all in the amazing cinematography, framed from the beginning by a nine-minute sequence of almost still-life scenes (enough to drive away most of those who are guaranteed not to appreciate this picture, I would think).So I precede with my possibly spoiler-infested review.One viewer complained about the titling of the first part of this movie "Christine", and the second part "Claire", for the two sisters, and wanted to recast the titles to identify the substance of the scenes, replacing "Christine" (the name of the sister who is the bride) as "The Wedding", but this movie is structured as a two part character study, presenting the different "takes" of the two sisters on the situation they have in common, in the manner of Kurasawa's "Rashoman", and the titling is perfectly appropriate.Another viewer said that the planet Melancholia which threatens apocalypse in this movie was an obvious metaphor for depression, when instead it's practically the only reality in the artificial (but at the same time prosaic) dream world through which the characters float. Even Claire's husband, and her sister Justine's brother-in-law (the character well played by Kiefer Sutherland), who invokes reason and science in a rather muddy way to reassure his wife and his child, and even himself, that doom isn't certain, turns out to be a denier in disguise.It is understandable that so many viewers would become fixated on the depressive state that Christine sinks into, especially for those with either first or secondhand experience of depression, and I expect that this encompasses a majority of those who have made it into their 40's and beyond. But not all depression is of the chronic, clinical kind, or responds to anti-depressive drugs, just as not all suicide is irrational. Life can occasionally deal one such a devastating hand that severe depression or suicide is actually an understandable and even reasonable response, and that, as it turns out, is the case with the depressive sister, Christine, who turns out to be sort of a one-eyed king in the country of the blind.Hopefully I have at least sketched out what I think the film's theme is adequately for those who have seen the film, without giving it all away to those who haven't. I would just like to sum up by saying that I found Melancholia haunting, disturbing, and thought-provoking, and a perfect allegory for our times here in the second decade of the 21st century. The blue planet Melancholia is well on its way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Metaphors Galore in Melacholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love parsing out metaphors in films, you'll love this one. Current cultural phenomena are reduced to the interactions of just a few people on an isolated estate, and the metaphors are interwoven, interconnected, apt and rich, which is why I enjoyed "Melancholia".I also loved the 1951 film "When Worlds Collide". Compare that to "Melancholia" and you'll wonder at how the world has changed.Compare it also to "The Road" which attempted a realistic vision of humanity faced with the end times but left room for hope. Von Trier has no hope, but the audience craves it, which is why "Melancholia" will not be a popular success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the movie is exactly as It's title suggests.I have suffered from depression for so long that I can not even remember when it first began.So it was easy for me to identify with the film. Lars has definitely created a visually stunning film.I also felt that Kirsten's performance demonstrated depth of talent. Keifer offered a poor performance as per usual. I really don't understand why anyone pays him to act.A well put together film, most of the performances were extraordinary, Lars put in a solid effort and of course I love to watch Alex.The film is a perfect dramatization of a persons internal suffering and the effect that is has on those around them. People with depression become alienated, no one wants to deal with them and their pain is so intolerable that they can not bear it alone, yet they lack the capability to function adequately in any kind of long term relationship. Possibly worth watching depending on what you are looking for.</fullReview>

He is one of those people that think life is awful and everyone should be as depressed as him but fortunately the real world is not like that and most people are decent and happy. This film is badly written, badly directed and and there is nothing the decent cast can do to save it and i really wonder why the creditable actors in this feature agreed to do it. The kind of people that say they like this type of feature are the same people that say they like Shakespeare just to appear intellectual when really they would rather watch the hunger games (which actually entertains you, which is the point of films). It is not at all entertaining. It is one complete bore from start to finish. In summary. awful pretentious crap.</fullReview>

Every moment of this film it's just more than our feelings. Every time I listen to it's prologue I fell kinda I'm not living in this planet. This film brings us to feel like Justine felt. After I watched this film I had real MELANCHOLIA. I didn't like this film, but I was surprised, that I couldn't get the music, actors, moments, phrases out of my head and then I watched this film for the second time and I realized how beautiful movies Lars could made. I think not all the people can feel this movie and not all the people can carry out the main opinion of this movie, but it's just masterpiece, I have no words. Many people just think that, this movie is only about this planet, but I saw this planet like background of something more than our feelings.Justine-Melancholia...Kirsten is my favourite actress !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Toilet and the Magic Cave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tale of two sisters. If we don't look too closely, Justine and Claire seem totally different, even polar opposites. Yet they have one important thing in common. Both are insulated from ordinary experience, but each in her own extreme. Claire lives a pampered life in a gated mentality. She strives to attain an uninterrupted state of being happy, aided and abetted by obscenely rich husband John who is dedicated to keeping her on a diet of 100% artificial sweetness no matter what ugliness reality would offer. Anything that might disrupt her fragile version of being happy is summarily vanquished from awareness. Justine's psychological self-exile is all numbness and pain. Immune from Claire's comical complacency, her reflexive urge to look beneath the surface of everything and everybody has condemned her to the role of an isolated outsider who believes life is evil. Jack the CEO, Michael the dreamer, John the empiricist, everyone is repugnant, ridiculous, and wrong. She suffers an oppressive awareness of life's ubiquitous violence. She knows no niche of warmth and love. Her futile efforts to belong collapse into complete withdrawal. She does not suffer alone for long, however, for Claire crumbles when condemned to a horror she can't escape, the approach of the planet Melancholia. Melancholia is an all- in-one symbol for the accumulated baggage of civilization (mental and environmental), the end of the world, the destruction of Claire's/western values, and Justine's nihilist mentality. Justine welcomes Melancholia as a resolution to her life-is-evil quandary, she even identifies with it (the mystical nude scene). Revitalized, Justine tries to comfort Claire with her spirituality, but neither sister could ever comfort the other.Wagner presented a similar vision of the world in his opera "Tristan and Isolde" and especially "The Ring" cycle of operas. We hear the prelude to Tristan and Isolde in the first and last scenes, and at other moments of compassion in between. In Melancholia this music represents the Wagnerian concept of Transcendence through Love, the idea that love lets us peacefully accept inevitable death. This theme is the musical equivalent of Justine's Magic Cave. In the final scene we see Wagner's music.This compassionate film about compassion is von Trier at his best. He is pensive from the heart. If he can't save the world, then he wants to console it. As in all great films, each contributor is thoroughly in tune with its message and devoted to its artful presentation. This is a huge accomplishment, given that the film engages us with unconventional ideas in a mixture of cultural traditions without lecturing or seeming contrived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your average film that you can blank out and expect for it to entertain you. It requires you to think. It is a dramatic existential commentary on societal confinement due to expectations, like the words, "should" and "ought." It juxtaposes the modern concept of happiness that derives from money and power and through the interactions between the lovers and family. It delineates the flaw in our fundamental priorities and social normalcy. Another aspect of this film is, its unique depiction of spirituality and hyper-connectedness to the intangible realities. It's magical, terrifying, and yet so human. It's a complex film and it's very beautiful. Savor it and pay attention as if you are witnessing yourself through the crises. Empathy and imagination will help you to appreciate this artwork. Again, it's not for everyone. But, if you appreciate Nietzsche, Carl Jung, Herman Hesse, and related thinkers, then you are in for a stunning ride.</fullReview>

The cast, direction, cinematography are flawless. It is dreamy. Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde plays throughout. The story details with artful subtlety the condition of western civilization. It required of me to focus on character. First Kirsten as Justine. She is the complicated beautiful protagonist in part 1. Equally important as the director shows us in part 2 is Justine's sister played by Charlotte as Claire rich, serene, nurturing The leading men are not as in focus but pay attention to the the groom Micheal's sweet nobility &amp; Claire's husband John the astronomer millionaire host. The film culminates around the precious curious nephew and son Leo. I loved it! One of the best films I've seen. Beautiful. I wept at the end of the 3rd viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this a second time since Jen hadn't gone to see it with me in theatre. It still stands up as my favourite film of last year. I think too much stock is put in some quarters on a heavily metaphorical reading of the planet, which Von Trier seems to encourage a bit by actually calling it "Melancholia". I don't think too much stock should be placed on this. This film seems to be a rather clear companion piece to "Antichrist". Von Trier seems to believe that people who go through the type of emotional trauma that depression brings emerge with a clearer and more accurate grasp of reality and are better equipped to deal with the world than those with a sunny, rationalist faith in the world and it's apparent order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unparalleled inspection of a destructive mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier performs an astounding and skillful dissection of a writhing and agonizingly tormented mind plagued by a most destructive form of lugubriousness. Unlike the great majority of drama films wherein the spectator is a mere bystander to the emotional deterioration of characters, "Melancholia" grants the audience an unprecedented opportunity of not only observing a spine-bending form of suffering but of also running our fingers across immobilizing, ice-cold waters, of sensing the sharp painful stabs of needled grass, of hopelessly inhaling an acerbic and coagulating air that heavily crawls across the haunting confines of an ever-deteriorating microcosm aptly constructed to vicariously enable the spectator to experience the despair of Justine (interpreted most terrifically by Kristen Dunst). Lars Von Trier ingeniously utilizes a plethora of scenes filmed in slow motion to magnify the listlessness inherent to such states of profound depression. Furthermore, the simultaneously transpiring threat of planetary collision better illustrates and enforces the inevitability of decline amidst the ruthless grasp of anguish. The brilliantly choreographed closing scenes inflict a dangerously resonating amalgamation of ambivalent peace and pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A night cinema experience is long overdue for me (21:15-23:30), although it is not even midnight yet, nothing should be acted like a storm in a teacup. The first thing I must declare is that hand-held camera really frets me over during this film, I may be able to enjoy it on a home-setting DVD environment (BREAKING THE WAVES 1996), but on the big screen of a multiplex, it was disturbingly wobbly for me especially the wedding banquet sequences in the first part called Justine. So in spite of its stupefying slow-motion prologue, several quite visually awesome shots (static, of course), and Charlotte Gainsburg and Kirsten Dunst's subtle while fabulous acting (btw, I put Charlotte over Kirsten, all other supporting characters are barely cameos omitting Kiefer Sutherland, a sullen wallflower), I only give a 6 out 10 in my rating. Then after two days of rumination (a spontaneous reaction and I have no reason to explain why), what strikes me is the film has evolved into a slow burn and been growing on me, and due to the fact that I possess a predilection for pessimism, I just sense a more interlacing allusion of the film (with my personal life), which effectively showcases an unaware self- assurance in me, doomsdays may or may not come, the hegemony of one's own substantiality somehow is always reined by one's own willpower (although the nude scene of Justine basking under the Melancholia-light is just a metaphorically trite stunt, even Lars cannot resist to lay out some eye-candies to meet his audience's eyes). Nevertheless now I rate this film a sturdy 8 out of 10. PS: Today's headline is MELANCHOLIA is winning big at this year's European Film Award (3 awards including BEST FEATURE FILM over the red-hot THE ARTIST), so what can I say? controversy is never outmoded, it could be arguably the best film of the year (if no one ever memorize the persona-non-grata upset in Cannes earlier this year).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark and Visually Stunning ...slow plot, lacks cohesionI gave this film a 6 out of 10 because of the stunning visual effects. The acting in this film was "Meh". The story, although I feel it could have been a great one, was not well executed. It's hard to know what was lost between the director and the final edits, but I'm going to say that from my standpoint there are holes in the storyline. Perhaps that is on purpose. Perhaps I am meant to think "Oh, the reason they don't explain this or that is because it ultimately doesn't matter, the world is ending", however, there isn't much to hold the movie together for cohesion. The camera often picks up the horizontal blue line that annoys me.I loved the horse scenes, the cataclysmic scenes, the first and last moments of the film are the absolute best moments. The first 3 minutes of the film, although visually striking, is the trailer. Now that I have purged my "meh" feelings about the film I will say that I am still thinking about the film and it's been two days since I saw it. The last scene, especially. This film is about realism, accepting that you cannot influence change in nature, (or anything) even if you have strong will (and boat loads of money). It's about the love of family and the resolve of a mother who is completely out of control on the inside, but maintaining on the outside. It's about one sister failing to influence/impose change in another. It's about accepting reality, or not. It's about panic and despair and raw human emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feelings of melancholia bursting through the brilliant colours of the Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Justine (Kirsten Dunst) suffers from depression. Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) drives herself crazy over fear of the end of the world. "Melancholia" just might prove to be the end of the world. The film just might prove to be an example of some of the best filmmaking in the world.It's an end-of-the-world movie, like a disaster movie, but unlike any that has come before it. It's not about the impending disaster but rather how two unique individuals handle it within themselves.The characters that Lars von Trier has created are fascinating creatures. Perhaps a little more extreme than most people you would meet but they are whole in their response to life. Justine can't seem to find a way to be happy even though it's her wedding day. Claire is extremely anxious about a planet that is in a crash course with the Earth. They are sisters and the dichotomy between them is enormous but provides such an interesting platform for us to view the end of the world from.The third character was Claire's husband, Justine's brother-in-law, John (Keifer Sutherland). He's supposed to be the sane one. He's rich and successful and just has to find a way to manage the insane women in his life. I thought I had a handle on him, but turns out that I didn't, just as he may not really have a handle on things himself.I would say that the film is much more about the characters than the story. But, it's also about the visual presentation. The colours, like the poster with a lost Kirsten Dunst standing in her wedding dress in a background of green, are brilliant and striking. The opening shots of the film are of the sisters on the final day. They are very bizarre representations of the sisters and their actions, but in the end, they leave us with visual cues of what they were feeling.The film is about melancholia, in all of its forms, and with some simple but effective metaphors. I never felt too sad for the sisters, but perhaps I connected more with John and I just wanted to find a way to help them. That feeling, whether it's a form of melancholia or not, will stay with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Anyone who walks into this film having not seen the trailer or being unfamiliar with the previous works of writer/director Lars von Trier has my sincere sympathy. He is a unique and ambitious filmmaker with a touch of expressionism and a unique visual style. His movies are seen by a small audience and appreciated by even fewer. And on top of that, he may be the least politically correct celeb working today.The film begins with a most unusual prologue backed by Wagner's ominous composition and numerous visuals that play like slow moving paintings. Clearly, the end of the world is at hand. After that, we get two parts: Part 1 Justine, and Part 2 Claire. Justine (Kristen Dunst) is first seen in her wedding gown heading towards the reception with her new husband (Alexander Skarsgard). Normally, this is one of the happiest times of anyone's life, but here something is just not quite right. Once inside, we begin to understand. Justine's family and friends are all a bit off-center, and she is the worst of all.I won't go into the details because what really matters is that Melancholia, a large blue planet, is headed directly towards earth. Kiefer Sutherland plays Justine's brother-in-law and he assures everyone that the pass by will be a special moment and no need to fear a collision. His wife Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) believes her husband and tries to comfort her sister Justine.The supporting cast is outstanding and includes Alexander Skarsgard as the groom, Stellan Skarsgard as Justine's over-bearing employer, Charlotte Rampling as Justine's mother, John Hurt as the father, Jesper Christensen as the caretaker and creepy Udo Kier as the wedding planner. It's quite a cast and the only real point of their existence seems to be having Justine and the viewer question if this existence is better than no existence ... which could happen in 5 days.This year has provided quite a metaphysical buffet at the theater. We have had "The Tree of Life", "Another Earth", "Take Shelter" and now this entry from von Trier. This group will have you questioning many things in life, and beyond. The other similarity between the three is the artistic craftsmanship with which each is made. Clearly two famous paintings play a key role for von Trier, and is final shot is done with such a deft touch that only guys like Tony Scott and Michael Bay will feel let down.I certainly can't recommend this one to all. It is somewhat slow moving and filled with symbolism and characters bordering on depression. It is beautiful to look at, but tough to watch. My guess is you already know if this is one for you.</fullReview>

Impressive story, amazing acting, sound and beautiful cinematography.The movie opens with Francine's (Dunst) vision or dream of the end of the world. Francine has the ability to see the future ("I know these things"). This fact is exemplified by a successful career in advertising, and guessing the exact number of beads in the jar. She went through with her wedding, but refused to create an attachment to her husband. Instead, on her wedding reception she quits her job, has sex with a stranger, and sends her husband home, preferring to spend the honeymoon with her parents. And that is just it: Francine is fearful of the impending doom of Earth, but makes peace with her fate, giving herself to Melancholia in the nude scene.I loved this movie, even though I still think about it and catch myself watching the sky once in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets me first say, I have never seen a Lars von Trier movie before, as I have thought he was only for the special people who understands art in some special level not for me as a "normal" person. The first few minutes of the movie started to confirm my prejudice, because it shows some sort of art on the screen. But then the movie actually starts and I was totally drawn into it. Finally someone that understand how depression feels, and can show it on the screen. Kirsten Dunst (Justine) has depression and it is shown so perfectly how the surroundings react on this. This is shown in a perfect summarized way, by having a lot of people to attend her wedding, so you can see the different ways people react on a depressed person. E.g. the sister Charlotte Gainsbourg (Clair), thinks she can help, and actually tries to help, but she has no idea what it is all about. Udo Kier (Wedding Planner), avoids to look at her, and even puts a hand up, refusing to look at her, this shows in a very direct way how many people also react: avoid looking at the "freak". Her father who runs away like many people also do. All in all perfect way to show peoples reaction to depression. I actually cried at the end of the movie, and I am not the type of guy crying. This movie should be mandatory to see for people studying psychology, and for people living close to a depressed person, even though, that most of the types seen at the wedding would not understand the movie anyway, and either run away, or reject and hate it. Let me say again, this really made me feel that someone actually knows what I am feeling when depressed, and also is able to show how the surroundings react. You should not see this movie, if you want to see a science fiction movie, because it is mere a movie about depression. But if you tend to be a depressed person, or if you would like to understand more about depression it is perfect!</fullReview>

Melancholia, I am afraid to say, was a beautiful movie, but I couldn't, no matter how much I tried, to like it. It starts with a wedding between Kirsten Dunst and Alexander Skarsgaard where just about everybody is a jerk. The biggest asshole there, though, is the bride! She is depressed and moping no matter what other people are trying to do to cheer her up. It basically looks like that 1998 Danish film Festen so much, that I thought it was also by Trier until I checked, and it is not.There is also a rogue planet that is supposed to pass near the Earth and not hit. People has called it Melancholia for some reason. It does provide some beautiful imagery, but not many. Also Kirsten is naked in a couple of scenes. But that's about it. The rest is a slow, excruciating wedding and then an even slower bit where the bride is depressed together with her sister.Bottom line: Lars von Trier fans will probably enjoy it, the other will just rant in frustration afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia: Themes, motifs, and symbols to mull over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time the credits role to Lars Von Trier's Melancholia, exhaustion has slapped around every viewer in the room; both stylistically and thoughtfully. He definitely throws a lot at us this time. Many of the thoughts Von Trier wants us to consider are dark and heavy, but by forcing them on us he strives to make us feel something somewhat close to what he feels in his deepest, darkest episodes of depression. It's the thoughts that color Melancholia that also color Von Trier when he is feeling desolate. In recognizing his desire to share his depression, I could see that this is his most personal effort to date. Melancholia is something of a diary, and Von Trier hopes that in reading into it, a part of our world gets destroyed much like the world of Claire and Justine. How Von Trier does this is very shrewd, the plot of Melancholia spells out Von Trier's goals. The "end of the world" aspect that makes it seem like an apocalyptic drama is simply an extended metaphor for the destruction of Claire's world caused by Justine's depression. In this case, Melancholia is Justine's mentality, and earth is Claire's: two worlds literally colliding with each. Through adding anecdotes and themes, Von Trier pushes the connection between himself and his main character, Justine. He conveys this most strongly through his portrayal of Justine as a prophet. It's Von Trier's film in which he is capable of steering it whichever way he pleases just as Justine is capable of steering Claire's mental health into turbulence. In a way, both Von Trier and Justine play God. Throughout the film it seems as though Justine simply knows things. Even in the early stages before Melancholia has surfaced, Justine quizzically looks up at where the planet will eventually come into plain view, seeming to know that impending doom is knocking on the door. Justine's prophetic nature is key because she is the driver of Claire's mental health. As the film wares on, Justine becomes more influential leading to the point where Claire is seeking Justine's approval for how they want to welcome the end of the world. At the beginning of the film, it is Claire who has planned Justine's wedding, now it is Justine who is planning Claire's death. Furthermore, Claire allows Justine to poison her thoughts. In listening to what Justine has to say about the lack of value in life. Claire is permitting Justine to be a prophet of her world just as Von Trier is ours. Due to the idea that we are witnessing the termination of Claire's world, it is possible that the whole film takes place inside Claire's head. It would make sense for Von Trier to utilize the philosophy of metaphysics, that we don't know that life exists outside our minds, for this theory further demeans the value of life on earth. At the very end, as Claire's world is nearing destruction, when Justine sees that she has destroyed the world of her sister, she almost starts to cry, but doesn't fully break down. Von Trier is trying to convey that he is sad in presenting us with such a dreary subject but he cannot fully feel empathy for we are getting a mere glimpse into the pain of his world. Only he knows the full extent. Therefore he is saddened in denting and marring our views, but only part of him feels this compassion.The truth of the matter is, in making Melancholia, Von Trier practically screams through the screen, "This is what I've felt, my world has been shattered and now I'm handing you the left over shards of glass". The contemplative pain that Von Trier has experienced is beyond what most of us are capable of. All we are capable of is taking the shards of glass he hands us and piecing them together. It's uncertain if we'll be able to see through them into what he sees, but one thing is certain, we will most definitely get cut along the way.

		<shortDescription>Makes you want to buy an Acura.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier starts the film with near static tableaux mostly involving Kirsten Dunst in a wedding dress. Unfortunately, the high gloss style resembles nothing so much as a luxury car commercial ? you know the type that use stylized interpretations of "precision" or "power". After the first six minutes or so that these images take up, you will think about buying an Acura until you realized you can't afford one). The remainder of the film presents an extended interpretation of concept of melancholia as Dunst struggles with the sadness she feels dealing with her wedding day and her put-upon sister played by Charlotte Gainsboug. Von Trier eases understanding of the film by using the high-stylized car-commercial cinematography when he is speaking metaphorically and that horrible shaky-cam style so common these days when the action is literal. Also, he helpfully calls the planet on an earth-collision course "Melancholia" so you realize it is a symbol of the Gainsboug's character attempts to avoid the depression that her sister struggles with. These pedagogical touches are helpful as this is not a straight-forward three-act story arc film. The shaky-cam story development portions drag and suffer from serious script deficiencies. The car-commercial dream-like portions are gorgeous to look at particularly a scene where the moon and the errant planet Melancholia compete in a cloudy night sky for dominance. Also, a scene with Dunst naked on a luminous hillside also does not disappoint visually. In short, not a great film to see sober but if you treat it like a Kenny Loggins laser light show at your local planetarium and med up beforehand, it makes for a good two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fall of Icarus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember, after seeing "Mulholland Drive," that it didn't quite work as a whole, but pieces of it were brilliant. Of course, it was later discovered to be thrown together as a promo for a pilot and then we understood. Similarly, "Melancholia" did not feel complete. The creative and psychological potential holds promise, if only more time had been spent on editing; paring and pruning to re-align with intention. At times the dialog seemed ad-libbed, the actors striving for authenticity despite the theme's moving target. I did stay to the end, while others peeled off mid-way, and am glad I saw it, but I'm not sure I can tell you why. Kind of like watching a staged reading, and saying "Bravo! Now keep going!"The prelude, which seemed to last a long time, was confusing: was the whole movie going to be like this? No dialog, just scenes, set to the soundtrack we would hear over and over again, from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, no coincidence I'm sure. A creative film short that neither stood alone nor enticed for future promise. A woman carrying a child, struggling, had an almost Balthusian quality, other shots surreal as a possible nod to Magritte.Thankfully we are relieved when the film segues to a wedding scene at a country estate. Part 1 shows what happens when Justine (Kirsten Dunst) takes the plunge to marriage; a perfect setting to reveal the family dynamics: philandering father, played with jocular fatigue by John Hurt, resentful mother in an unusually predictive performance by Charlotte Rampling, and most notably, the rescuer/enabler sister Claire, portrayed with crescendo by Charlotte Gainsbourg. A re-enactment she struggles against, while her husband, John, (Kiefer Sutherland) stands by with frustration. (Think Lord of the Flies: Id = Justine, Ego = Claire, Superego = John.) Part 2 flips gears to show who holds it together during a different sort of crisis and who falls apart. Justine, whom we saw imploding in part one finds solid footing in the crisis of part 2, for relief is nigh. Her composure relaxed, her gaze, constant, as the world around her unravels.This flip, internal strife vs global calamity and the impact it has on the characters was for me, the most interesting gem of this work. Thank you to Film Columbia, a festival in Chatham NY for this selection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's probably the best thing I can say about Trier's latest. And that the acting was good.I am a big fan of his previous work. I have come to expect some sort of meaning, some social commentary, something more than superb cinematographic scenes. I suppose, as with chronic anxiety and depression, the film "doesn't make sense" and I guess that's fair enough. It's not clear why we are being shown what we are watching. What is the purpose, if any? Towards the end, there is an inkling that perhaps, due to the circumstances, a deeply depressed, therefore utterly self-centered and self-involved Dunst makes a real human connection, but it is too vague to really enjoy this fleeting moment in the film.One thing I did appreciate was that there weren't scenes of hordes of panicked people trampling each other on the streets (or in the village, in this case,) which, I learned from the book I was reading at the time (Nerve by Taylor Clark,) is really not how masses respond to impending disaster.All in all, another disturbing and depressing film from Trier, but the golden heart trilogy and The Kingdom remain my favorites of his works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exhausting Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie maker, it is important to have an idea. This idea has to carry the movie. It should be able to absorb the viewer. The idea behind "Melancholia" does not really. The movie would have failed if it had concentrated on the meteorite. Lars von Trier concentrates on how his characters deal with life and death. What makes this movie so special is that there is no right or wrong. It is the pure essence of our being: Questions. And these questions are exhausting. And paralyzing.The movie begins with artistically crafted scenes. They are in the tradition of the classical overture, in which composers already prepared what was to be seen in the actual opera. Not only the atmosphere is striking in these scenes, also the symbolic strength which is to be revealed later. The film is divided into two parts: "Justine" and "Claire". The first part is stylistically in contrast to the beautiful, pompous overture. It is Justine's wedding party. The camera erratically focuses, unfocused, close ups, a nice wedding dress, a comic situation - a spectacle for the viewer. The first minutes of "Justine" are funny. There is even a running gag - but there are hints. A conspiratorial conversation between Justine and her sister, a highly depressive mother, who is funny at first but evolves to a tragic character. More and more details are added which make the wedding party seem rotten under the gleaming surface - a metaphoric scene is added, a meaningful tumult of insects in the grass. Justine becomes more and more depressed, tries to become happy by having sex - not only with her husband. She is alone. The only person close to her is her sister, Claire. "Claire" shows a Justine who is tired of life. A paralyzed Justine, who is hard to watch. But who is that sister? Lars von Trier intimately films her life, her child, her husband, her horses - Claire is someone who has something to lose. Especially her clever son is touching. That a meteor might kill him is a very sad thought. It is up to the viewer to judge whose opinion is closest to oneself's: Is it sad that our planet is destroyed, as Claire feels? Or is it a salvation, which is Justine's position? Claire, who first was the tough woman is the paralyzed one now. And Justine becomes the strong woman. They simply swap roles because of the simple essential formula that a human being has to live and also has to die. Justine does not want to live and is therefore tragically depressed. Claire does not want to die and starts to behave just like Justine when she had to live. Justine can die now. The picture starts running. The blue glimmer is omnipresent. Leo sees the horse his father allegedly has ridden away with. The picture leaves us alone with all these questions. It is hard not to identify with Justine. Maybe because she is unbelievably well played by Kirsten Dunst. In general the actors are amazing. Still, one cannot immediately leave the cinema since the movie has induced such a terrifying heaviness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pre-apocalyptic cracker. A big return to form for Lars Von Trier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahhh. Lar Von Trier.The ex Enfent Terrible that was the darling of the critics only to upset Bjork and have them pretty much universally turn against him.This movie has largely been slated by the critics despite Kirsten Dunst's best actress award at Cannes.Me? I loved it. His best film in a long time and up there with both Breaking the Waves and Kingdom.It's far from Dogme, that's for sure, with its absolutely thunderous score from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde being one of the movies main focal points. It's a powerfully moving musical theme that picks out the more arresting moments in a film that is bracketed by 'epic' whilst the meat of the sandwich is a languidly paced examination of the relationship between two sisters as they deal with one of their depressive tendencies.Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg both put in excellent shifts as the (highly unlikely it has to be said) sisters. I'll be honest, you do have to make quite a leap to see this pair as real life sisters but once you are over that you can just enjoy the film for what it is.Dunst plays a role that could have taken her into the field of major histrionics and self searching angst, but she carries it off with such a lightness of touch that she really does grab the audience sympathetically, Gainsbourg is a seriously good actress in a fine role well suited to her personality. She too could have overplayed several moments in the movie, but holds back suitably.The men, for once in a Von Trier film, have the less sympathetic roles. Keifer Sutherland as the partner of Gainsbourg and father of their child spends more time acting like a boy scout leader that husband fearing the end of civilisation as he plots fun and games with his young son played sweetly by Cameron Spurr.Like Mallick's recent Tree of Life (with which several comparisons can be made) it's an oddly compartmentalised affair (the aforementioned bookends are high octane sci fi - initially in the vein of 2001 Space Oddessy and latterly in the style of Danny Boyle's vastly underrated Sunshine). It's in the main meat of the film that styles particularly diverge.The first Act is Dunst's story as she endures her deeply dysfunctional wedding day - way too much hand held camera for my liking that contrived the action a little but gave Dunst the chance to develop her story of depression - John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling as her deeply unpleasant parents get really nice cameo roles to play around with.Act two is her sister's story, here the cinematography is much more relaxed and often breathtaking.Dunst continues to draw the plaudits as she emerges from her depressed catatonia as the world heads rapidly towards apocalypse in the shadow of a giant planet headed for collision with earth.It is the planet, Melanchonia, that gives the movie its name and its theme.For some the whole movie, at 135 minutes, may be too long. For me, it was perfectly paced and the slight twist at the end of the tale was deeply satisfying and ultimately enthralling.Strong recommendation. 8/10 maybe 8.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwhelming--if you have the stamina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Melancholia"--which I had to wait almost a year to see because of my location and booking problems at the one "art house" in town--is, I believe, the best film of the year. It seems to have gotten lost in the crush of Hollywood hype and, perhaps, was badly distributed for reasons that may or may not relate to Von Triers' Cannes "gaffe." Whatever the case, the film is a triumph for anyone who knows anything about art, opera, and film. I would put it in the same category as some of the classics (Les Enfants du Paradis, per ex) in that it uses the day-in-the-life model to trace the trajectory of both the planets (Melancholia and Earth) and of the lives of these characters as they epitomize human self-absorption--whether it is chosen (denial) or forced upon the characters (depression). This film is definitely a big screen experience, as the acting and writing demand the audience's close attention and patience (not unlike many of Cassavetes' and Altman's epics), and the effects are transcendent without being flashy. One critic gave the film a less than stellar rating simply because he misunderstood (didn't hear?) the dialog and assumed that all the characters know the earth is about to collide with Melancholia but ignore it because they are so "shallow" and self-absorbed. On the contrary, many either do not know much about the astronomic disaster headed their way or believe that Melancholia will "pass closely by" the Earth but not hit it (as does John, Kiefer Sutherland's character). Denial? You bet. Realistic--yes, in terms of psychology and in relation to the mess humans have made of the planet--one they keep thinking they can "fix" later. I found the ending somewhat comforting, in that I'd rather that a cosmic cataclysm took us all out at once than I would having to witness the long, slow, ugly death of the planet we're currently engaged in orchestrating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is an imperfect film. And as it's the case with most masterpieces they are perfect in their imperfection. I believe that a great work of art is one that transcends, one that defies rules, one that is both modern and conservative in it's approach. Melancholia is one of those.What separates the greatest films from the good or the average is that when they tackle themes like depression, cosmic influences, death, hope, they manage to take the viewer to the extremes just like a shrink would probably make you face your worst fears before you can feel liberated.Most films do only the first part, lacking the cathartic feel at the end. But the again that is the most difficult thing to achieve. In Psychology, doctors have techniques. In Art though, this is not an easy task. As an artist not only do you need to find the right tone, but also to find the rhythm of your narrative and that develops through work and work and work. And I think this is where most artists fail. They become too preoccupied with their obsession, their fears, and fail to give it a value when they translate it into art. Sometimes you need to distance yourself from things to get a better view. For many years I thought Von trier was in the latter category, too self indulgent, having great ideas, great themes, and yet not getting the technique right. In Melancholia he is bang on.And even if the first half is slightly over the place and not in the same category with second chapter, I would still rate this film a 10 because sometimes these things are not important. When you see someone has a heart, you forgive that person all their clumsiness. I thought for long if the first part, the wedding, was necessary. Probably not, but I am not the director of this film. However, what I do think that was needed, was the introduction of Kirsten Dunst's character outside the larger context presented in the second chapter. Her performance is one of the best of 2011. And even if the first chapter is uneven, without it, her understated performance in the second part of the film would never pack a punch as it does now. This film reminds me a lot of Bergman's 'Cries and Whispers' or Tarkovsky's Stalker which employ the same techniques as this one. If you like this one, check Bergman's and Tarkovsky's films too. Also check my list 'My favorite movies, recommend others' for other films in the same vein.Other films I enjoyed in 2011 are: The Tree of Life, The Skin I live In, Certified Copy and Poupoupidou.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I seen an "end of the world" movie where A: The world is actually destroyed rather then being saved at the last moment by some unlikely hero pulling off some far-fetched plan and B: Is a beautiful dramatic work of art void of any cheesy Hollywood disaster movie bullshit, and C: unfolds in a couple remote and isolated locations in Sweden rather than a chaotic city. The focus of this movie is on a character struggling with depression while a planet threatens to collide with Earth wiping out all life. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate a somewhat long and slow-paced drama that is a little on the depressing side. I found it to be very visually appealing and the end of the world theme gives it a haunting vibe that I came to really enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Myth and Magic of Melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is true to its name, so if you are not acquainted with the mood -- I don't think you will appreciate the movie. For those of us who have lived through the melancholic state, or visit it on a regular basis, it is is a wonder to experience.The movie itself is a visual and emotional feast. Every frame is gorgeously rendered and often set to the majestic strains of Wagner's 'Tristan and Isolde' opera. But there is something disturbing about it throughout. I watched it at home and thought I was coming down with a virus . . . I had to keep going to lie down, feeling nauseated. Each time I resumed watching, I became nauseated again after a short time. Finally I wondered if the movie was making me ill? Only after reading about the experiences of others on IMDb, I realized that indeed, it was. The hand-held camera motion, which I did not even notice given the beauty of the scenes, made me sick.This was my own reaction and I think that it is actually part of the point of the movie: underlying all life and birth, there is the reality of death and discomfort. The one sister, Justine, journeys to embrace death while in the midst of the utmost celebration: her extravagantly beautiful marriage ceremony to a perfect groom is the beginning of a life most people would envy. But she cannot embrace this new life, which doesn't seem real to her. After sabotaging her marital celebration and successful career, she falls into a deep depression. Her sister, Claire, has to take care of her -- even helping her to bathe and eat. Justine collapses in tears when her favorite food tastes like ashes.Claire, the one who throws the glorious marital party and tells Justine afterward that at times she 'hates her so much', is forced to face death based upon a literal event: the impending destruction of Earth via a collision with Melancholia, a hidden planet. By this time, Justine is comfortable with the potential destruction and finds it irrelevant, as she is well-acquainted with death. But Claire has attempted to ignore and repress dark emotions in her life, and she disintegrates when the reality of her destruction comes near.People who are depressed are often seen as the architects of their own demise. In our culture, they are given little sympathy and offered pills to support repressing their feelings (something Claire actually buys to avoid facing Melancholia). I think this movie suggests that those who are going down are actually in touch with something as part of a whole. The melancholic Justine is able to handle the crisis of impending doom and takes care of Claire's son while Claire disintegrates into hysterics. I wanted to just hug Claire and tell her it would be OK -- she was so ill-acquainted with the dark side of life that she appeared more as a helpless child than her little boy.Although difficult to digest, this was a poignant and beautifully rendered film. I only wish the camera motion had been different, but I get this was part of Lars Von Trier's metaphoric storytelling. The film was worth it and most of you will not get sick as I did, although it will impact you in some way, I am sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching. I did know what to expect from a Lars Von Trier film, cause i've seen some of his work. Like Dancer in the dark, which i cannot watch without crying at the end. I've read some of the other user reviews and i also think that the rating of this film is accurate. But i always focus on the negative reviews, whether i like the movie or not. Not to troll or anything, just to see different point of views that may help me to empathize, disagree or maybe understand something i missed. Based on those "hated" reviews, here's what i think, in the only way i can express it---a list:1- That thing that some people call "shaky camera" in a filmmaker like Von Trier it's his language. He created the Dogma 95 movement in the 90's and the hand-held camera was one of its features. Off course this is not a dogma movie, but to underestimate the camera work as "shaky camera" as if this was "Battle LA" is just....rude.2- What is so wrong with using a different pace? What is so wrong about symbolism? Why would Justine be depressed about something in particular? Why do sisters have to look alike? Seriously, it may sound rude, but is not and Adam Sandler movie. It is what it is.3- Acting was great. Not only Dunst, who won Best Actress at Cannes for this role (yeah, besides the "Nazi-VonTrier scandal", there were awards) but Sutherland and Gainsburg deliver strong and deep performances. It wouldn't surprise me to see them at the Academy Awards.4- It moved me and i'm not depressed or anything. As another Von Trier movie and myself a fan of symbolism, for me it was about cancer. The depression, Justine weakness, the big thing coming, the thing disappearing, then coming back and the undeniable and helpless end. There is no more life, no matter what we do.To enjoy this title you don't have to be depressed, to be on heroin, to love Kirsten Dunst or Von Trier previous work. You just have to open up your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always like movies that give you a bit of a mind f**k. The fantastical opening of the film is followed by a painfully real wedding from hell. It is all so messed up. The bride is seriously messed up. It all ends up so catastrophically bad. Cringeworthy. But then, the second part makes you forget about the train crash wedding, because the overriding foreboding makes something like a wedding so trivial. Dunst's performance I think was outstanding. Actually, all of the acting was good. I think the best way to think about this film is as a collection of experiences. The scenes are there to make an impact on you, they don't all have to have some deeper meaning. It is the feeling that arises in you that is the point. In that way I think the movie was a great success. It was long, but I was captivated throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have nothing particular thing with Lars Von Trier or the whole Dogma thing. You can tell some of the Dogma heritage in the sometimes shaky and flinching camera-work...it shows.This is a film that really tells us nothing new, it just tells us how LVT likes to make movies, how he sees women, especially the most beautiful and successful ones, and what he thinks the world should do. As in: be destroyed. This is a truly pessimistic movie, and some self-deluded people mistake utter pessimism for artful invention, and consequently think this is a great movie. There's not much story at all: she gets married, the world might end, very little in between, and then the world DOES end. Now when there is no story in a film, it ALL revolves around atmosphere and character development. Too bad..the characters are shallow and the atmosphere is simply one of chronic depression and suicidal thoughts. Hint for LVT: nice poetic looking scenes don't replace storyline.To cut a long story short: -If you are a normal person, you don't understand this film and don't know what all the hubbub is about. After thinking about this film for 10-15 minutes tops, you'll go home, wake up next morning, take your kids to school and go to work.-If you are a depressed emo kid, you'll think this movie is the absolute mirror of your soul, is the pinnacle of movie development, that it connects to you in soooo many different ways all the 'normal' persons mentioned above can't relate to at all (and you love the many ways in which this movie justifies your self-pity for feeling cr4p) and you will most likely want to tell ALL the world how explicitly excellent this movie is in the vain hope that you will finally find a soul-mate, or at the very least, that you will be more understood by the people around you once they see this movie. Too bad kid, you suck. Get help.-If you are a bit of a cynic like me, have seen many thousands of movies of all kinds, and you're more interested in actually enjoying an interesting movie, you're going to get bored and annoyed. This movie has a shallow script while the very fact that the whole plot is made obvious in the first 5 minutes necessitates a deep, well thought out script for the whole duration. Acting is decent but the actors are visibly let down by the pathetic script. LVT fails at directing, instead he seems to focus more on photography. Pretty pictures a story don't make...maybe it works with shorts but not with a full feature film. I feel sorry for Dunst getting an award for this, must feel pretty empty getting one for something you don't feel you deserve. I liked her minimalist, stuck up performance in Marie Antoinette much better and she deserves more credit for that movie than for this one.Unless you feel depressed and LIKE feeling depressed, SKIP this one..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My advice to writers/directors: spare us a movie about your depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is split in two parts. The first part deals with Justine's (Dunst) wedding party. At first she looks like the happiest girl on earth but as the night progresses she just loses it, going to the bathroom in the middle of a golf course of the palace where the party is, taking a bath in the middle of the party, going to sleep, drinking nearly a bottle of alcohol, having sex after the party with a stranger instead of her husband, and in general not giving a damn about anything. Her too-good-natured husband tries and tries till he finally gives up and leaves.Justine's sister is Claire (Gainsbourg- what does Von Trier see in her?). How those two are supposed to be sisters only Von Trier can explain, different mother and father perhaps? Claire is like a caretaker with infinite patience for all her of crazy relatives, and all of them are nuts, the father is some happy go lucky eccentric, the mother is a misanthrope, and Justine is just out of it. She tries her best to save the party to no avail.The second part of the movie centers around Claire, who hasn't had a single good-hair day. Now Justine is completely mentally disabled and just stands there and sits there like a zombie. Claire is somehow married to John (Kiefer!), who is filthy rich. They have a son named Leo. Both John and Leo are fascinated with the event of the night of a planet passing near earth. Claire is convinced the planet will crash into earth and takes preparations to exit this life with her family. At first it seems that the planet is indeed just going to pass by, but the next morning John notices that instead of receding it is approximating earth again. Claire gets into a panic, while Justine acts like a calm prophet who all along knew that life on earth would come to an end, which is a good thing since it's evil, she says.This movie starts with a 10 minute intro of images with the foreground moving at a very slow-motion. The first half of the movie dealing with the wedding party is entirely disposable. It is annoying and nasty. Seeing a bunch of clueless jerks going about being clueless jerks is not entertaining nor interesting. It's like this movie is populated with a whole lot of little Von Triers playing different characters.The second part is slightly less annoying. The tension builds and is sustained as the planet approximates and you wonder how will the movie end. Fortunately the ending is satisfying. Still the behavior of most of the characters is mind boggling.Not even Von Trier can make a movie about depression and madness watchable. I don't think anyone can. That is not to say that it is intolerable, it still manages to be engaging. Enjoyable elements are there: great camera-work, his signature editing, great acting (Udo Kier rules, again), great imagery, occasionally some brilliant lines. But it's just not enough. The music is obnoxious and unsuited for the movie. Movies that condemn us to partake in the pathological mental state of its characters are simply not worth seeing, especially when there is a reality outside of those minds that is far more interesting- as in this case of the planet threatening earth. I doubt that this project would have gotten anywhere without Von Trier's name attached to it. It's a shame that while most people have to suffer through their depression silently, renowned artists get to make movies, write books over it, and make money. My first experience with the work of Von Trier was the too-brilliant-for-words The Kingdom. Nothing else he has done since comes close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read several reviews complaining that this film was complicated or didn't make sense. It was neither complicated &amp; made perfect sense. Question :- If you knew for certain that in a few weeks &amp; months that the world would come to a violent &amp; terrible end &amp; there was nothing you could do about it, how would it affect you? Several reviewers on here are obviously much more appreciative of the 'TRANSFORMERS' eye candy type of sci-fi movie where plot comes way down the list &amp; CGI is paramount. Trust me, if you liked 'Donnie Darko', 'The Nines' &amp; 'Moon' &amp; have a brain watch this movie. If you liked 'Armagoddon', 'Transformers' &amp; 'G.I. Joe' &amp; have half a brain, then best stay home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia (may contain spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just come from seeing Melancholia... and I am in the same boat as a lot of people who have been reviewing it. I'm almost at a loss for words. Throughout the movie I was extremely engaged in trying to notice patterns, numbers, colours, coincidences... in an attempt to hopefully understand the movie in its entirety when it came to a close.To no avail. Lars von Trier probably had his agenda on what he wanted audiences to take from the film. And although there are a lot of people talking about him and his own 'melancholia' I tried looking at the film differently than from this depressive episode (being a Psychology Major I analyzed Justine, accepted what von Trier was trying to tell us and moved on). I think this film offers a fresh and disturbing view at a post- apocalyptic world. I am obsessed with apocalypse movies and books and TV shows. I love reading and seeing stories of 'survivors' and seeing how everything fell apart - because that's how I view it. As something I'm just reading or seeing, as fiction, as something that is not real. Melancholia was real. I felt everything Claire was feeling, I felt her pain when she used her son's contraption from her chest. And when the end came, I felt sick. But almost in a good way, because it felt SO real. I've read a lot and seen a lot, but this is the first movie to have scared me. First words out of my mouth: "Holy f*** that was scary." So maybe I missed everything he wanted to say and maybe I missed the important things about the movie, but I do know that I was absolutely captivated for all 2 hours and I left shaken, and thinking - and I think that is what makes an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting End of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very curious about this film when I first saw the trailer and my curiosity was properly sated. The film centers around two sisters who are somewhat polar opposites but both have clear emotional problems. The first part of the film surrounds what most of the trailers show, which is the wedding of Justine (Kirsten Dunst). Right off the bat one starts to see the way she works and the way that slowly but surely, during the reception, she keeps getting sadder and sadder. Everyone in her family that has put an effort to be there or to make the wedding happen seem genuinely upset that she has not been made happy when she had previously promised to be so.The ever growing sadness gives allusion to the title, and as we later find out, to the planet Melancholia. I thought that the play on this deep sadness on Justine's part of the film was rather brilliantly thought out, even if we do see Justine as inconstant.The second part, which revolves around Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), reveals that a planet that has been hiding behind the sun is either going to pass by the Earth or strike it. Here Justine remains the sad woman we had seen her become before and Claire worries about her life and the life of her son and her melancholy stems both from the doubt of their impending doom and later from the certainty of it. Though Justine is only a shell of a woman, she still manages to be there for her sister and nephew in the end.This film is a wonderful take on the end of the world and as opposed to centering on mayhem, focuses on the people and what they feel and how they panic and cope with what's going to come. The pace is somewhat slow but in the end it's very worth it. The visuals are stunning and my hat goes off to the filmmakers for being able to pull it off. The interaction between the sisters is beautifully done by both actresses. Kirsten Dunst deserved the acting award she received in Cannes for playing Justine in a wondrous way that almost made her seem real. Charlotte Gainsbourg did well too as Claire; she gives a performance, throughout the second act, that makes one sense the despair and the sadness that the character---and most of us---would feel at a moment like that.One of the best movies I've seen this year so far and definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thinking-person's apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Van Trier, the Danish film director, doesn't make happy movies. He makes films that are masterful works of art, but are never-the-less soaked in melancholy and overtures of gloom. His favorite subjects are women under various forms of physical or mental abuse who are facing the end of their definition of bliss or happiness. With that pedigree, I guess that makes Van Trier the perfect candidate to write and direct film about the end of the world.By telling you that the world ends, I'm not giving anything away, the earth actually does come to an end in the first six minutes of the movie. The rest of the film tells the story of the eminent lead-in to that tragedy, opening with a series of seemingly disconnected operatic scenes that are shot in slow-motion and set to the music of Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde". These scenes climax with a shot of a rogue planet, called Melancholia, smashing the earth (I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings but according the Van Trier's special effects people, when the earth does collide with another planet, it looks like east Africa is going to go first, sorry Africa!). At first, the opening shots don't seem to have anything to do with each other, but only gradually do we come to understand what they actually mean.The main body of the film is told in two parts. The first is called "Justine" and focuses on a beautiful young bride (Kirsten Dunst) on her wedding day. This should be the happiest day of her life but circumstances in her heart and soul, and the overwrought selfish drama brought on by family and co-workers are turning this day into a wading pool of misery. Lost in a world of her own, Justine seems to want to be anywhere but where she is. The only person at the wedding who doesn't seem self-involved is Justine's happy new husband Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) who seems like a good man, always smiling and always attempting to comfort her. The rest of the family is not so giving, Justine's father and mother (John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling) have split long ago and seem angry with one another even during the toast. Her mother in particular seems to be self-centered and hateful. Her new brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland), an astronomer, and her sister Claire seems at odds with Justine all through the proceedings. They may have something to do with Justine's mood. Something inside of her won't let her enjoy this day and she keeps struggling to get away.There is nothing about this wedding that looks familiar to us. No one seems to want to be ingratiating to the event itself, they all seem to have some other agenda and that may be fueling Justine's depression. As the day goes on, she becomes sadder and sadder and even the prospect of making love to her new husband doesn't seem to fit. Something in her mind is keeping her at a distance.The second part, called "Claire", takes place long after that disastrous wedding reception and deals with the planet Melancholia, which is initially only suppose to pass by earth, but as time goes on, it becomes clear that the two planets are going to collide. This chapter of the film focuses on Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who is more clear-headed and therefore less able to deal emotionally with the coming calamity. Justine, meanwhile, has slipped into a state of weary depression and therefore seems more prepared for what is to come. This second story is more direct, dealing squarely with four characters (Justine, Claire, John and their son Leo) and the coming collision. This half essentially tells us everything we need to know and even ties up some questions that we had at the end of the first half.The central joy of Melancholia is the performance by Kirsten Dunst, who has done great work before, but here does something I haven't seen from her. The performance doesn't come out through words, but in the manner in which she is able to hold the moment just with her eyes. There is a fragile spirit within her that is long broken and forgotten and, in the first half of the film; she fails to hide that sadness behind a veil of false happiness and joy. She remains silent but her face reveals an inner turmoil that is screaming to be heard. She does more with this quiet performance than most actors can with a raised voice. She has moments in the film when she is willing to reveal herself body and soul, but it never feels trashy or tawdry. She reveals Justine as a woman who has long since banished any joy or false front. It is an extraordinary performance.Melancholia is, admittedly, not a film for everyone. This is an art-house film from one end to the other. It is often painfully slow, and that happens only because the film takes time to build its characters. This a film that asks for your patience, as all of Von Trier's work does. It is one of the most beautiful films just to look at. The interiors during the wedding reception are lit in such a way that they convey the formality but also the claustrophobia taking place in Justine's soul. The later scenes, shot mostly outdoors are lit with grey and blue, conveying the darkness that is about to consume the world. When the world is consumed, it doesn't come out of the Roland Emmerich special effects factory, with crashing buildings and hysterical masses. The end focuses squarely on two characters that we have come to know, their personalities and their appropriate response to the situation given what we know about them. This is a thinking person's apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delving the depths of a fractured mind...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not an easy task. In fact, to even attempt to do this would not only be risky for ones career, but in the case of Lars Von Trier, laying oneself bare for the world to tease apart piece by piece. However, Mr. Von Trier has not only seamlessly coerced us into the inner workings of a clinically depressed mind, he has already done the teasing apart for us.Every single piece is there for us to see, laid out in plain sight, within every frame. Not obviously, not cheaply and not in any crude manner. No, he has placed every detail with such creativity and cleverness it is easy to see how this Art house-esque masterpiece will be thrown aside by many who do not realise what is in front of them as "Too slow, too pointless".Drawing from the depths of his own experiences with depression, this film is rich with detail and poignancy. After watching and indeed absorbing the film, I still find it fascinatingly intriguing how Von Trier has managed to condense all the aspects of a fractured mind into two hours and two parts of cinematography. I cannot help but think a large part of himself is within each scene with Justine.As the story unfolds over the course of several days we see a stark contrast not only between sisters, but between the various facets of Justines character. This itself will leave the thinking viewer with questions that test our own sense of acceptance, of right and wrong.Cinematically, the film is beautifully shot. Again simplicity and careful use of intimate dialogue builds an atmosphere so heavy and intense yet joyously easy on the senses. Everything is there for use to absorb, but in such a delicate way you may not even realise what you have taken in.Is this film a mass, cross-the-board hit? No. There will be many who unfortunately let the meanings and thoughts float by them without reaching out a hand and taking hold of the key themes. But for those who see the beauty in the darkness of depression, this film will leave you lulling over questions for days after.Lars Von Trier has not only triumphed, once again, in the cinematic arena, he has given all the gift of witnessing a journey so dark that the destination will be be nothing short of a blessing in disguise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a reflection on the human soul, an invitation to truthfulness and to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier is a bloody genius, and Melancholia a sad, beautiful reflection on the human soul, an invitation to truthfulness, and to life.The movie is, of course, no light meal. But it isn't one of Lars von Trier's heaviest either (which would be IMO "Dogville", and above all "Dancer in the Dark"). It wouldn't be a Lars von Trier, though, if it didn't think the subject through to the very end, if it offered its characters (and you in the cinema seat along with them) a cheaper escape. And I don't mean the obvious level, that there is no Bruce Willis around to place some nukes and save the day. I mean for example that the main character, strong and quiet, the only one strong enough to face truth in its entire bluntness and monstrosity, has to cope with extinction on the most general, absurd, and unfair level possible. It is always dangerous and unhumble to aim at interpreting the director's supposed message. I, for one, saw the following in Melancholia: (i) that what truly matters is the essence of character, not the superficialities of the safe civilisation bubble we live in, (ii) that apparent strength or weakness within the bubble do not say much about the essence, (iii) that pride, shabbiness, sacrifice, treachery, compassion are as relevant as ever in the small scale, when only very few are affected by one's actions, and (iv) that we die as we truly lived, not according to the surface.By beautifully connecting two stories that could have made two separate movies (a less dogmatic "Festen" and a more subtle "Last Night", the Canadian movie from 1998), von Trier conveys IMO this last message. It might be hard to live truthfully, the temptations to give into a shabbier path large and abundant, but in the end it would be the wrong choice. Wagner's music does the rest. I always liked the prelude to Tristan and Isolde, and Melancholia gives it the best possible visual appearance, and is in turn enhanced by it.It is worth seeing Melancholia in a theatre. Only there the music and the images will be able to protrude you. And only there you can share the experience. You might not love the film, but I can hardly imagine anyone not being touched by it. And you might come out, like me, with a larger desire to live, and to do it - as much as possible within the constraints of own weaknesses and social responsibilities - truthfully, less compromisingly, and compassionately so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was apprehensive about seeing this film. I'm a fan of Kirsten Dunst, but not fanatically so. I'm not that familiar with the works of Lars Von Trier. But, festival pre-speak of the film intrigued me so, last night, when I saw it listed in Comcast's On-Demand line-up I shelled out the ten bucks for the film. I don't regret it.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I can understand that many will not appreciate the slow pace. But, I was consumed and mesmerized by the visual content and style of the film. The colors, lighting, time manipulation, and even the pageantry, drew me in and fascinated me.It's difficult to talk about the story without releasing spoilers. (And I don't want to do that.) But I feel two performances stand out and deserve mention: Kirsten Dunst's and Keifer Sutherland's.Kirsten Dunst was simultaneously radiant and nuanced. There were times when she was startlingly drab. Her role was the anchor post that bound the entire film together. I enjoyed her performance in this film even more than her performance in "Cat's Meow", which is saying a lot from me.The other performance that stood out to me was that of Keifer Sutherland. The role he played was understated and peripheral. But it led you to a certain conclusion about the character of the man he was portraying. Thus, the final reveal of his character was unexpected.In whole, I found "Melancholia" to be a pageant of visual imagery and nuanced character interaction. If you're looking for a sci-fi action fest, look elsewhere. But if you appreciate pure artistry on a cinematic canvas then I suspect you will enjoy this film. My final statement is that I went to bed and dreamed about "Melancholia". And, when I woke up this morning I was still replaying the film in my mind's eye. That doesn't happen very often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are alone with the sky full of stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Lars Von Trier said in an interview, we are brought in the world knowing that we are going to die.I think he is trying to see what we make of this knowledge, especially in this age when religion ran its course and only science seems to have any authority about the sky above us.The main characters,Justine and her sister Claire,John,the scientist, Leo, the child, are all aware of the huge blue planet hovering towards the Earth. Justine, fragile and depressed, cannot play by the rules of everyday life. She doesn't see any point in worrying about her table manners when she knows the world will come to an end. Claire, tries not to look at the sky and wants to fill every moment left with beauty and kindness.John, the scientist, seems to be shielded by his scientific certainty; he seems the most normal and adjusted and in the end he is the most unprepared. Justine finds her strength in her love for little Leo and her sister,Claire and builds for them' the magic cave'. It seems that in the end, love is the only answer.The film is powerful, the image is stunning. It left me curiously uplifted.We know the truth, but we do have the choice to make the most of what we were given</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the movie yesterday and still feel a bit wishy-washy about it. Now Van Trier creates some incredible images, a unique mood and a couple of really funny scenes but in the end it feels like the work of well...a melancholic man who didn't have the power to finish his job properly. Especially the 2nd part feels kind of empty, now some might argue thats the melancholia and the intention of the director but too me it felt just uninspired. But most of all i disagree with many reviewers about the acting performances. Dunst is in no way bad in this but in the end she is a bit too Hollywood and doesn't carry the movie in the way Kidman did or Emily Watson or even the non-acting Bjork. Dunst-Gainsbourg-Sutherland rarely create that natural dogme-documentary feeling you get/got at other Van Trier movies. Kind of lame were the Tarkovsky references, its obviously some kind of joke by LvT but after 40 years of vT doing it doesn't even work as a joke for me anymore. But in the end its still a movie i would recommend, simply because if its aesthetics and the unique feeling it transports.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A portrait of depression and a meditation on life - Lars von Trier's opus magnum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning, there is a face, unmoving, in close up. A closed expression, unapproachable, an empty look, eyes that don't see what they see. That look beyond, to some other reality, some other world perhaps. It is the face of depression but it is so much more: the realisation of something about to be lost, a present that is already past without us knowing. The depressed as clairvoyant, as a seer of things we, the "normal" cannot comprehend. It is a motif that will return throughout the film. Von Trier starts right at the end. The first ten minutes are a stunningly, even frighteningly beautiful vision of the last moments of mankind. A slightly paling and increasingly vague painting of what is disappearing as we see it. There is peace, even poetry in these images that quote the apocalyptic art of Hieronymus Bosch. There is no grief nor triumph in this prologue, this visualisation of the approaching nothingness as everything comes to a standstill. Just acceptance that all must end, an acceptance that can help one find peace. If this vision of the apocalypse feels strangely positive, it is not due to the manifestation of some death wish but to embracing the painful truth that life entails death, that without the inevitability of death there can be no life. When the gigantic planet which collides with earth finally hits, swallowing tiny earth like a tasty dessert, von Trier paints this with a quiet beauty that there is no room for shock. This, we are told, is the end, and it's OK because without an end there could have been no beginning.When the story proper finally begins, the contrast could not be more drastic. Filmed with a nervous hand-held camera that constantly loses and regains focus, we are plunged into a wedding party. The fun the couple have as they try to negotiate a tiny lane in their stretch limo cannot conceal that this marriage will not last the night. The parallels to fellow Dogma director Thomas Vinterberg's Festen are not coincidental. The broken facade cannot long hide the dysfunctionality of this nightmarish group of people. Charlotte Rampling is unforgettable as the cynical unforgiving mother, John Hurt is the lovable and despicable weak and unsupportive father, Stellan Skaarsgard the power-hungry boss and Kiefer Sutherland the snobbishly brutal yet vulnerable brother-in-law. Alexander Skaarsgard's husband is a deliberate non-entity, helpless and dispensable. With just a few swift brushes von Trier and his cast sketch full life histories. a backdrop of hurt, grief, selfishness and indifference.Among all this, Kirsten Dunst's Justine tries to play her role but loses her grip more and more as the night proceeds. On one level, Melancholia is a well-observed portrayal of depression and Dunst a perfect object as well as subject of this person's journey into night. As her look becomes emptier, as her face seals and eyes close, we can sense as well as witness her drifting away. In a way it is a blessing to get away from the stifling hypocrisy, though not for her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who needs support ast least as much as she can give it and who is stranded by the events of the night. In the end, Justine almost rapes a stranger, her new husband leaves and all is wrapped up in desolation and loneliness.Dunst and Gainsbourg carry this film on their shoulders. Kirsten Dunst is breathtaking in her portrayal of depression, in her attempts at "normalcy" and her final acceptance of life and all that entails. Charlotte Gainsbourg ? light years removed from the psychopath in Antichrist - is the loving mother and sister, stern, yet caring, battling with her own fears, honestly, without pathos or excuses.As part two begins, the scene is utterly changed. Justine, hardly conscious, moves in with her sister, brother-in-law and nephew. All narrows down to this uncomfortable foursome as the setting becomes more and more claustrophobic ? for them as for the entire world as the beautiful yet deadly planet Melancholia closes in. And as the perspective narrows, the view moves inside ? and expands at the same time. On the one hand, we see a family drama unfold, very subtly but at times almost unbearably painful as the protagonists have to embrace the fact that all will end and will do so soon. The focus shifts to Clair, her anxieties and fears, especially her fear for her son. At one point her husband gives up and vanishes - Melancholia is also a celebration of the strength of women ? from an assumed misogynist. Von Trier paints this portrayal of desperation and panic with unrelenting frankness but tenderly as well, unlike the cowardly husband, he never abandons Claire and Justine.A I said, as the story narrows down it also widens ? into a full-scale yet unassuming meditation on life and death. Justine, the prophet of doom is the agent of this. When everything else unravels, she begins to spring back to life, the impending end infuses her with a peace and calm that ultimately helps the others to bear the inevitable, too. The depressed turns into the only one who accepts the interdependency of life and death, even embraces it. When she bathes naked at night in the bright light of the deadly planet, there is no depression or death wish, just a quiet understanding of what must be. So in the end, it is she who creates a last moment for herself and her family that is full of harmony, peace, love and forgiveness. And so, as all ends in an apocalyptic vision, there is a strange sense of peacefulness, optimism almost, reconciliation. This may sound like a celebration of death but is quite the opposite. Without accepting death as the inevitable end, we cannot really enjoy life. An unusually positive message from von Trier. Maybe he does not hat humankind this much after all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bewildering film by Lars Von Trier starts with an endless wedding reception scene which reminded me of the equally pointless one in "The Deer Hunter." Justine(Kirsten Dunst) as a new bride seems bipolar; laughing and kissing her husband one minute &amp; then brooding in a bathtub the next. The husband exits the great estate early and Justine takes off only to return in an almost comatose state shortly thereafter. Her sister Claire(Charlotte Gainsbourg) is married to Jack(Kiefer Sutherland) and they live in an enormous house with horses and Jack spends most of his leisure time looking through a large telescope studying the planet Melancholia as it nears a brush with earth. While pondering the end of the world as we know it, Justine bathes naked by the night light of Melancholia for no apparent reason. There is no explanation for Dunst &amp; Sutherland's American accents and Gainsbourg"s &amp; her fathers'(John Hurt) British ones. The family's strange behavior continues to the end as they await possible doom. I see this movie as a two hours plus version of "The Twilight Zone" in need of some editing by Mr. Von Trier.</fullReview>

I felt truly anxious for the first time in my life. I can imagine someone with depression who d watch it would become suicidal. Beware! A very serious movie that will get under your skin all right! Acting 10/10, human relationships portrayed 10/10, realism 11/10. Did I want to cry? No. So no, it is not a drama. It is something beyond a movie- a summary of our miseries in this world. It is to be lived through, not felt for. Enjoy, but if I had choice, I d rather not watch- too much stress. P.S. So far I don't find any other movie to compare. Maybe just the English Patient got so much to me, but totally different buttons were pressed as it is totally different genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Get past the opening of Melancholia, please.This is clearly one of the best films of 2011 and a definite front runner for the Best Picture Oscar. It's a movie that involves a RICH family's small corner of the Earth with a supposedly oncoming and colliding planet called "Melancholia." And it's also one of the SLOWEST movies I've ever, EVER seen. And despite my usual objection to slow-paced films, this movie was mesmerizing.While most "Disaster Films" focus on the actual destruction, Melancholia zeros in on a wealthier-than-God family vs. showing the mass-hysteria in regards to a newly discovered (well, "hidden behind the sun") planet on a collision course with Mother Earth.You see, the previously "hidden" planet, Melancholia, is on an unintentional, albeit kamikaze, path with our home and the movie's scientists do predict it will simply pass us by, like a thief in the night.Oh, that's just the backdrop of this HIGHLY dysfunctional family. And speaking of a chaotic reality, it's really tough to figure out what's going on here in the first hour. One sister's a little (little?) loony and melancholy despite her 19x-my-yearly-annual-income expensive marriage party and the other sister's rightfully depressed and stressed due to the looming blue planet on a demolition path.The "opening," I forewarned to get past, involves some kind of art project scenery that goes on, well, a little too long. It, unfortunately, leads viewers to believe it's a slow-moving art-school project when in reality, and you get past that, it's a character-driven, almost emotionally draining film about a broken family.I don't know what I liked most about this?but by the end, I was truly enthralled. The acting was pitch-perfect, the colors and cinematography were absolutely beautiful and the score was gorgeous. And yet, beyond those good qualities, I was enormously enraptured by the message, desire, drive, filmmaking and this is definitely one to see again.Now, this is NOT for the general public. Most will find it slow enough to turn away and the remaining will want to see more "destruction." It's not about that, even though it does use little, though significant, special effects. Let the juvenile antics of Roland Emmerich/Michael Bay cater to that crowd. This is for real movie-lovers.Unfortunately, the one downside was Kiefer Sutherland, who didn't do much to change his normal schtick. That said, if you are fond of him, like me, then you'll continue to enjoy watching him here and he did deliver the best line in the movie. Sadly, it would be too much of a spoiler to give the quote away, but let's just say it's when he makes a toast in the third act.And speaking of raising our glasses: Cheers for hoping no planets are coming for dinner soon and this film's "theory" is, in fact, FICTION.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone is white.That's my only complaint. Otherwise, pretty solid stuff. Kirsten Dunst plays a weak character with much resolve. She plays off of Charlotte Gainsbourg in the first half, and the roles switch in the second. I found the beginning of the film to be lengthy, but necessary. The third act will leave you feeling trapped with the characters, and it is harrowing. The set location is stunning, and I believe it is where parts of X-Men First Class was filmed? There is nudity so don't bring your kids. In its entirety this film somewhat reminds me of Tarsem Singh's The Fall since it looks like the director wishes he was a painter. You will leave the theater feeling sadder and more fatalistic than usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Von Trier's masterpiece, but only for the awaken mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wedding part grew into my mind as it was a painting of the master Pieter Breughel himself: Boring and dull at first glance but growing faster and faster into that particular piece of art caricaturing the mindlessness of 'average' mankind whilst acting like unaware passengers on a train on the run. With only the bride being truly aware of the final destination (we all share) People might find her behaviour selfish and obscene by moments, but in fact all she does is between the endless "why-questions" swallowing her into depression, enjoying the things she really wants to do before dying. As we all should do! Part II Brings us the grand finale cutting deep and lethal like a knife in a kidney leaving anyone in a small theatre in Ghent speechless while the credits were rolling over the screen. A film that made me think several times this week as if it was a dream still partly unexplained, means it is a stayer in my personal hall of fame. A Massive 9 for Von Trier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pointless reviewing the cinematographic qualities of this title. It's pointless and clueless calling it a beautiful movie. It's again pointless commenting the actors' work, the director's work, the script, etc... Watching this for me it was like a deep dive into the world of pathological depression. It was choking, destabilizing and almost traumatic experience.'Melancholia' with its phlegmatic pace swept this awful sense of hopelessness. It felt like a slow farewell to life. But at the very end I wasn't crushed at all. I have survived. This immense sadness and melancholia actually just flew by me, leaving me thinking only about Kirsten's beautiful breasts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two faces of depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to see this movie today after a loooong wait. First 15' after watching it i was so angry that i was swearing about the myopic critics here in Greece, according to which Melancholia is a sci-fi movie about the end of the world, product of a Nazi-lover director, so that would qualify the movie for only 1 or 2 stars out of 5. I had to walk 1,5 hour back home to let my feelings and thoughts settle down.So first things first : Melancholia is one of those movies that every spectator may get in a different way; there are no tag-lines -in fact it's also a little bit ironic that there is an actual search for a tag-line in the movie-, there is no story path that leads to some conclusions for the spectator to adopt. It's a masterpiece that tries to sketch the relationship of two sisters, Justine and Claire, with their loved ones, family and friends during the last days of their world.The movie is divided in two parts and it seemed to me like describing the two faces of depression.The first part is centered around Justine a self destructive depressed person, during her wedding reception, who cannot help it but ruining every hope of happiness she might ever have. The whole first part of this movie seems to describe the thoughts and the acts of the subconscious of the depressed person; every scene seems like a fragment of the story or an instance in Justene's day, where we can witness her incoherent self destructive acts. Scene by scene, as she is expected to be more and more happy, she is burying herself deeper into depression, hurting and pushing away everybody who might care for her.The second part describes the following days after the wedding reception disaster and is centered around Claire. Claire could represent the conscious thoughts and acts of the depressed person; she tries to make her sister do little steps at a time, make her get through her daily routine; her storyline has a normal flow, it's not like the collection of instances in Justine's storyline.For me, Justine and Clair could be the same person and together they represent the battle that takes place in the mind of a depressed person. This is better understood towards the end, where the total destruction of their world that is about to come finds them in diametrical opposite directions.For Justine it's kind of a salvation, the only think that could make her smile again, that could make her functional. As she cannot fight her depression, her only hope is the end of her life as she knows it. This prospect leads the character to a fantastic scenery where, in ecstatic, almost sexual anticipation, she lies naked watching the planet Melancholia -the end of her world- approaching.On the other hand, Claire seems unwilling to accept her sister's thoughts about the end of their world and tries to find a way out of there. She cannot understand why her sister insists that life in their world has to end and as the end approaches and every hope is vanishing, she becomes more and more desperate and hopelessly tries to save her child (this small innocent part of herself); but she fails and the two characters (Justine &amp; Claire) finally accept each other and reconcile towards the end.For me the movie was a perfect description of the life of a depressed person. There is no easy way out of depression; you have to reconcile with your self, accept your self-destructive nature and embrace the destruction of your life as you knew it (embrace the idea that "planet" melancholia will destroy your world). Then you have the prospect of a new life; this is also exactly what would happen if two stars or planets would collide : their "death" would result to the "birth" of other celestial objects, so in a way the end of their existence would result to the beginning of a new existence....Or it could just be a sci-fi movie about the end of the world...Last thoughts : i loved the characters of Justine's mother and husband; the authoritarian mother who is trying in a -never effective- strict way to tell her daughter to snap out of it because she doesn't deserve it and the caring boyfriend/husband who loves her in such a desperate way that is willing to go down with her if she lets him...but even this door is closed for him, there is no way to approach her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do like Lar's von Trier's unique take on film and life in general, however, I also understand why others might not. But this is a film where he invites everyone to the party. Albeit an ostentatious wedding party that is undermined by a bipolar bride who infects her loved ones and the viewer but sucks us in all the same and then flips us on our heads by validating depression in the most beautiful way. What this is is a great apocalyptic film which explores humanity like no other 'end of the world' film has ever actually done which is surprising considering the amount of those films out there. Say what you want about this guy, he has his finger on YOUR pulse. His film's know us. You can't hide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is Suffering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FACT: the world is evil, Life existed only by consuming others, and only the person who are detached from human being can realized it.1. Father and Mother At the wedding scene, the film introduced us to the unlikable mother and amusing father. These two characters embodied the theme of the film really well; the TRUTH hurt, and only when you stop sugar-coated it you can realized how things really are. I think the director purposefully made we all felt the same way about Justine in earlier scene that she is such an ungrateful, confusing bitch but when she had a face-off with her boss, we then realized that she's the only one who knew the TRUTH all along. In fact, she's more mature than her older sister. (this is pretty obvious in the latter half)2. Human Nature I once watched the documentary about how animal will behave when it's about to die. First fear will kick in as a mechanism of survival instinct (they run like hell!) but after it realized that death is inescapable, it will calmly accept it. Animal simply know how nature work, while we human have to created illusion to cover it, like when Claire covered her husband's corpse with the straws. It's fair to say that happiness is the state of ignorance because the truth is life is suffering. So, when Justine suffered from depression that renders her unable to feel happiness, she then realized how things really are. When all lives are about to end she couldn't care less. Sooner or later, we are all gonna die some day anyway, does it matter that it's because of planets collision, car crash, or old age?Best film after "Uncle Boonmee who can recalled his past lives" for me.</fullReview>

If this was a look inside the melancholic mind, then I prefer to keep my eyes closed. The character development was shoddy and the gratuitous sex scene was nonsensical. I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters and I'm glad it ended the way it did! I just wish it had 90 minutes earlier. Aside from seeing Kirsten Dunst nude I would avoid this film all together. The cute kid that played Kirstens nephew was about plastic. He had no emotions and was probably the only "adult" acting character in the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dance of death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"dance of death, also called danse macabre, medieval allegorical concept of the all-conquering and equalizing power of death, expressed in the drama, poetry, music, and visual arts of western Europe mainly in the late Middle Ages. Strictly speaking, it is a literary or pictorial representation of a procession or dance of both living and dead figures, the living arranged in order of their rank". Or as Von Sydow would say in Bergman's 7th Seal: " I met death today. We are playing chess." The Danish director Lars von Trier's latest jewel offers the most amazing images in cinema in recent time. A cinematographic tour de force but also a genuine question: how does one face mortality? Some people know they will die, some don't want to face it, some rather worry about their next milkshake, some pray and go to church before they kick the bucket, some fantasize about it day and night......some directors talk about it ( Woody Allen - a constant when younger) and seem to echo the existentialists ( life thanks to death is reduced to absurdity). The title: Melancholia is a trick from the director who knows we will fall in the trap with preconceived notions. What does it mean to be melancholic? depressed, crazy , ill, fearful or feeling something others don't ever feel? Kirsten Durnst is exceptional as one sister while Charlotte Gainsbourg , the other, for once holds her ground. Both are different yet intrinsically bounded to each other. The blond and the brunette will have to answer to those questions? Lars von Trier has kept his sense of humor and morbid longing to toy with us as in the great tradition of European directors. He throws at the two women ( and us ) a very large metaphor and let the women perform that dance of death and ranking. Any other clue would be a spoiler. Not like any other movie. Very entertaining and difficult to put it in a genre because Von Trier is each time redefining his own. In brief : stunning,deeply moving, haunting ( and so a propos next year!!!!!!!!!!!)and a great, great conversation piece to have with friends and a few ( or many) martinis. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's no Antichrist, but it does come very close. An end of the world movie like no other.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier, psychopath some say, others say genius, I personally am in the genius bunch. I dint think there's any other film maker working today who is a daring as Lars, his subject matter is always striking to the mind and a danger to the senses.Melancholia is in my opinion is his most mainstream film to date, I also think it's his most tame, but all in all it's probably one of his greatest achievements as a filmmaker. There's slot of symbolism which some may not get but if you kind of just let your mind go and go with the story you are certainly in for a treat.The story is split in 2 parts, the first is from The view point of Justine, expertly performed by the usually mediocre safe player Kirsten Dunst, she certainly impressed me in this film. We follow her on her wedding night as she falls deeper and deeper into a wave of depression, watching the first part of this movie is so weird, you see that this family are very strange and basically have zero love for each other. The first half also introduces the meteor heading towards earth aptly named Melancholia.The 2nd part of the film is when it amps up and really starts to become a Lars Von Trier film, it is from the viewpoint of Claire, played to perfection by the always amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg. In this half the meteor has gotten closer to earth and Claire is very fastly becoming terrified. The Justine character is a lot more interesting I think because she shows a lot more emotion and fear about the oncoming doom.From beginning to end this movie is a masterpiece, the opening scene is very reminiscent of the opening scene from Antichrist, the acting is absolutely stellar, a lot if people are raving about Ms Dunst but Ms Gainsbourg also deserves a mention, they are both mighty impressive, the music is thrilling to the ears and the setting is gorgeous, all the way through right up to the epic grand final scene I was entirely glued to the screen, I didn't want to miss a moment of it.A lot can be said about this movie but its hard to put into words, every viewer will have an entirely different opinion of it, a lot will be bad but that's nothing new for a Lars Von Trier film, you either love him or hate him.See it if you dare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb homage to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An homage to life as the end of the world approaches. Great story, masterful metaphors, excellent acting and superb cinematography. In line with Lars Von Triers' tradition of powerful movies such as Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, Melancholia is another beautiful dive into the abyss of our souls.Archetypical human characters are turned upside down when confronted with the imminent apocalypse of the impending collision of a planet with the Earth. Justine, the superb Kirsten Dunst, and Claire, the less superb Charlotte Gainsbourg, are sisters and the central figures of the story. Justine speaks for those who try to understand the world almost entirely through feelings; she is inevitably depressed and not very impressed by humanity. Her sister tries to understand the world mainly through her eyes, hence she is compassionate and sensible (some may say balanced). And further along the spectrum is Claire's husband, the very good Kiefer Sutherland, who represents those who try to master the world exclusively through their minds. Or that is the way things look under normal circumstances... When the end of the world starts looming bigger and closer the tables are turned. The normally rational and self-confident Claire's husband is utterly incapable to deal with such an overwhelming prospect. Claire crumbles but still tries (and to some extent succeeds) to carry on while the otherwise weak and depressive Justine emerges triumphant, ready to face (and help others to deal) with the apocalypse.The movie is superb, yet with some awkward aspects. First, it somehow failed to engage me emotionally (perhaps it was me, perhaps the rather sedated tone of the film, perhaps too much intellectual aloofness, perhaps something else). Second, the structure of the film was somehow disappointing. There was no need for the rather rigid division of the film into part 1 on Justine and part 2 on Claire. A single and more integrated narrative, while focusing on building the characters of the two sisters would have also perhaps managed to embrace more organically Claire's husband (but also their parents, the excellent Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt) whose roles in the film help substantially the story.</fullReview>

This flick was the second worst movie I've ever seen - the first being 'Twin Peaks - Fire, Come Walk With Me'. Feel free to watch both of them, then vomit all over yourself.The plot? Who knows.

There is no other explanation. Although you might want to read hedgehog5's review posted on October 1st, just to see what type of nutcase enjoys a movie like this.Watching this movie has nearly caused me to lose all confidence in IMDb's rating system. 7.7? Out of a billion, maybe.Seriously, if you liked this movie - don't come within a 100 feet of me - thanks.I didn't know Kirsten Dunst was a crackhead.

		<fullReview>The film opening was great, if a bit pretentious, and the last minute of the film is probably the best part of the film. Everything between the two is pointless, uninteresting and empty. Shallow, plastic characters, stereotypes and superstitious nonsense are all there but the worst part is the non-existent story with several irrelevant digressions that come to nothing and lead nowhere. Camera is disturbingly shaky in parts, perhaps on par with unsuccessful student experiment.In fact, *nothing* happens in this film until the last few minutes. That would be perfectly fine quality for a film had there been other content to employ the mind, soul or senses. There was precious little.Ending really comes as a relief. Perhaps that is the ultimate success of the film. By the end you are so sick of everything, you can't wait for it to happen. It makes sense.There were two acting performances worth praising - Alexander Skarsg?rd produced a reasonable performance and Charlotte Gainsbourg came through the dismal script reasonably well.I like Lars von Trier's films and love Charlotte Gainsbourg. Hope they do better next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loved every second of it. Intense, visually stunning, true in its complexity, with an amazing, rewarding final. I don't think I can praise it enough. The first sequence is a passionate tribute to Tarkovskij, but not without a meaning: it displays immediately where the movie is heading to, a pact with the audience that amplifies so much the climax throughout the movie. You know what's coming... you just can't stop it, like pessimism itself. The acting from both Dunst and Gainsbourg deserves applause, maybe even awarding, but in a movie like this you can't separate the actors from the master behind it: with his photography and his timing, the director amplifies every small sentence with new meaning, adding more levels to the naked script. Mystery, love, anger are hidden behind whispered words just like a small planet is hidden behind the sun. There's so much you can learn from this movie, and learning has never been so beautiful. Thank you Lars Von Trier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Melancholia"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with the wedding party of Justine(Kirsten Dunst)and Michael(Alexander Skarsgard)arranged by her sister Claire(Charlotte Gainsbourg).But what could have been a perfect party becomes an absurd evening due to the increasing depression symptoms of Justine.Meanwhile a planet(called "Melancholia" and deeply connected to the depressed bride) threatens to collide into the earth. Although this film is surely the most accessible among the works by Von Trier,some audiences will find it boring and meaningless due to the slowly pace of the movie and its controversial subject.But I think this is one of the best films of the year with remarkable performances and a beautiful story of characters that makes you feel every inner turmoil.It's not a predictable portrait of emotions that are often bad portrayed in other films of mental illness and fear.So if you expect dynamic don't watch it.Von Trier is a master and I am sorry for his bad reputation of egomaniac and daring director of films made only for narrow audience.But nobody can deny that he is one of the most original and fascinating directors out there."Melancholia" is a stunning and captivating film ,impossible to forget.I dare to say it's art because there are some poetical moments and moving scenes that are overwhelming.It's almost perfect.The Wagner music elevate this powerful experience.This film is occasionally too meaningful to be caught by some people who will find it difficult but unique.The acting is absolutely great.Kirsten Dunst is terrific in her complex role.She proved she is an A-level young actress and her win at the last Cannes film festival(and the National society of film critics association) is completely deserved.An Oscar nomination would be a must for the Academy although I fear that they will snub her in favor of more stereotyped performances and due to the lack of a big studio behind it.Charlotte Gainsbourg is amazing as well even if her role is less showy.The supporting cast(Kiefer Sutherland,Charlotte Rampling,John Hurt and Stellan Skarsgard)is equally great.My vote of the film is 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utterly beautiful piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote a review for Lars Von Triers previous film, Antichrist (2009), so I won't reiterate his 'agent-provocateur' profile outside of his films. I also have to confess that I've never really been much of a fan of his work. The aforementioned, I found intriguing, The Idiots (1998) was OK. Other than Breaking the Waves (1996 - which whilst utterly depressing, was a fine film), I can't say that his films have enlightened me in any way. His approach has always been interesting though. Now to his most recent effort. Melancholia, whilst forming around the concept that a planet (Melancholia) is heading towards Earth, the film is largely focused upon the relationship between siblings Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who are, emotional, polar opposites. The film is split into two chapters, each with the sister's names as titles.The first half focuses on Justine, and specifically her wedding reception. This part of the film plays much like another of the Dogma '95 films, Thomas Vintererg's excellent Festen (1998). We are introduced to Dunst's character as someone fleeting. She constantly leaves the party, sporadically moving around outside of family and friends. We know from this that she is without conscience when considering people around us. We see in this section that Justine is a person attracted to chaos; she despises order. This is perfectly illustrated in a scene in the bridal suit, where coitus is about to take place. Her new husband, Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), begins taking his clothes of, folding each element of garment and carefully laying them down. This show of order seems to frighten Justine, as she leaves.In chapter two, the main focus is on the sister, Justine. She has a seemingly austere life, married to John (Kiefer Sutherland) with a young son. They stay in what seems to be a manor house. Justine, who is now staying with them in the throws of deep depression. Claire, unlike Justine, is petrified with any form of disorder. All things have to be in the right place. From the start of the film the presence of the approaching planet is referred to. As it gets ever closer Claire's husband constantly reminders her that it will most certainly not impact with Earth. The film progresses as each character comes to terms with their existence in the face of utter destruction.A drama which alludes to science fiction, it is an interesting film on two very different people living with the idea of total destruction. It is without question an utterly beautiful piece of cinema, with some exceptionally great performances, particularly from Dunst, in what must be her finest role.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visceral, raw, and ultimately powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes at the end of a film one cannot do anything but just try to absorb it. I am one of those people that at the end of a film I always try to write a review as soon as possible. After watching Melancholia, I said to myself- "Why do I need to let others in on this? Why do I have to write my feelings toward this film for others?" I have felt this way after watching a film only a few times, mostly really personal films. I want to start off talking about the prologue. Amazingly photographed and edited, with great music. When people compared it to Antichrist I was skeptical. Yeah sure, I think Antichrist was powerful, but to me one of its biggest flaws was its prologue besides the 3rd act. I just thought that while the music was great and there were some great shots, many of the shots were just so self-indulgent even for Von Trier. A lot of its prologue seemed too stylized, too pretentious, even for me (whose favorite films usually consist of terms like that that would be used by people). However, I thought the prologue for Melancholia was all around much better. It felt better constructed, more realized, more meaningful (especially because he didn't have too many shots of other unrelated things), not to mention its last shot was absolutely incredible. We are then taken to the film's first part titled JUSTINE. I thought that it was a great start. Kirsten Dunst starts off the film like a seemingly ordinary happy bride. However, as the first part progresses we see her deep feelings of pointlessness and darkness. I am happy to say that I have not met many people who are depressed, but even then one can see the incredible subtle work Dunst did. In fact, this is one of those performances that hits deeper the more it sinks in. She makes it quite clear how much of an illness it is. Part Two, titled CLAIRE, focuses more on Justine's older sister. Unlike Justine, Claire seems to live a more ordinary life. This is where the science-fiction aspect of the story comes to play. Funny that I wouldn't really want to label the film as sci-fi, or maybe I should label it as such as a new form of sci-fi. Personally, I have never been depressed, so I could understand Claire's feelings of fear much better than Justine's. It doesn't mean I like Claire better, it just means that I could definitely sense a sort of shared fear and sadness with Claire. Yet because we know how the film will end, one cannot truly ride this journey along with the characters. It isn't a flaw, not at all, it's just Von Trier's purpose. He wants us to be able to know who the characters are and then, while not truly sharing their same feelings and experiencing this with them, be able to distinguish by how different their fears and states-of-mind are. In the film's central theme I think it is similar to Antichrist. It may not be as controversial or disturbing, but it definitely belongs in the same trilogy. That ending is Von Trier's most powerful to date, and the film is a near-masterpiece behind Dogville and in the same ranks as Breaking the Waves. I am glad that he decided to tell a story more patiently, more soothingly and more gentler than Antichrist, and it turned out to be better. I thought Gainsbourg would never top off her work in Antichrist, but here it makes me wonder. A stand-out.</fullReview>

Also I was blown away by great music, picturesque shots and movie techniques in general ? everything works great together and hypnotizes your brain in a ruthless way. I gave 9 not 10 of 10 just for a last 10 minutes of the movie which I assume could be more pushy and CGIed (and, probably, more mass-marketed and trivial - so i missed these CGI petards stuff a little).

		<fullReview>I went to see "Melancholia" without reading anything about it and got flushed into this weird yet realistic scenario. I want to applaud the creators for this beautiful, honest and epic piece. The pictures, settings and actors are just amazing.With "Melancholia" you will find a story that didn't fit into a special effects filled Roland Emmerich movie anymore. I would not describe the movie as boring at all, because on an intellectual level it is filled with subtle details about people and their relationships to each other, which we all can relate to. These moments need their time, because that's exactly mirroring reality. All in all a great social study that makes you think about our happiness.--Just like the movie "I am Love" with Tilda Swinton, "Melancholia" is able to show, how privileges in life are not worth a penny, if all that is around, is self-interest, gaucherie and lack of understanding. Kirsten Dunst understandably got awarded with a golden Palm in Cannes. She was brave enough to trust the director and certainly convinced in her difficult role. Just as all other actors did.Embedded into a science fiction event the movie has a strong visual and emotional impact and should not be missed out by real movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parable about error</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful film about art, life, sacrifice. Very European, refined, splendid image, subtle acting, atmosphere of a historical period recreated in magnificent way. But the principal error is the beauty of a movie in which food, costumes, colors, words, art in every form transforms the story in ordinary pretext.Kirsten Dunst is a brilliant Justine and her impressive talent, her artistic force are reflected in acting. But Justine was not a victim of hypocrite nobles, of time and of his social origins. The last gesture was not only result of duty conscience. And Von Trier was not a great artist in a fragile domain.Her ennui was her life. The parties, the food, the organization of a entire show was essence of an touching existence and reflection of the time's glory. This sophisticated art to be crux of a world was secret ingredient of a special moral victory. So, Justine was more than a small character, builder of little extravagant shows, toy of aristocracy. Her life, her death was ineffable form of sacrifice for a special gift: art to be yourself, part and builder of dream, heart of miracle and desire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars von Trier certainly is a great promoter and what he said about Hitler in Cannes, will obviously make people curious about this film.It's about the nature of depression. Kirsten Dunst goes through a hellish wedding dinner, while this planet, Melancholia approaches Earth. As it comes nearer, Dunst accepts it and she also accepts her own melancholia on the contrary to her sister, Charlotte Gainsbourg, who has no contact with her feelings, until it's inevitable.Nobody makes pictures like von Trier. And nobody uses such beautiful photo. In the end, this is a film for viewing, more than thinking or feeling about. von Trier has the tools for that too. Impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly unnecessary inclusion of a blue planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the film in parts such as the tensely formal wedding scenes and potential for things to get really out of hand, the play-acting by John Hurt (magnificent actor) and the gradually wayward antics of the beautiful Kirsten Dunst (absolutely fabulous set of tits, btw) but I just couldn't see the point of the epic inclusion of the blue planet about to hit earth. Will it, won't it, who cares.The film is about depression and the gradual descent that a sufferer goes through, the erratic behaviour, the illogical mood swings and the inevitable desire to burn bridges and destroy everything that is good in life by telling your boss he's a nightmare, your husband he's inept, your sister she's rubbish, that sort of thing. But so what? We've all been through a certain amount of depression and we understand the whole 'what is the point' aspect of life, why should I get up, take a bath, etc... but why make an overly dramatic metaphor for it all with a story about a planet that's going/not going to hit earth and make it all end, ultimately leading to death?The story would have been fine for me if it had stayed as a kooky film about a woman that descends into depression, strangeness and perhaps even a little bit of depravity, but no, it had to be more cosmic than that. There's nothing really cosmic about depression whatsoever.Some of the acting was really good, the character interactions were just fine, the pacing and camera work were all right, but the film lacked that extra touch or shock value that Von Trier's other films such as Dogville and Manderlay were so good at. Initially boring films, leading us down intriguing, yet soporific pathways that suddenly narrow and guide us into very clear light. I didn't get that sense of magic in this film because I didn't care about the big blue, potentially cataclysmic colliding planet metaphor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acidly funny, traumatic, haunting, overwhelming - an experience not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier has become somewhat infamous over the decades of his illustrious career. His films have been labeled misogynist, misanthropic, and manipulative, as they often chronicle the downfall of a young, beautiful woman. None of that, though, applies to his newest film Melancholia - perhaps that's why Von Trier himself doesn't like it. Melancholia is his tamest and perhaps most subtle film yet: there can be no emotional manipulation when we already know the Earth will die, and the obnoxiously overt symbolism in Antichrist is missing here and is replaced by a startlingly intimate, human character study. For those reasons, because it's so confined to the real world, to human relationships, and we can see ourselves in it - it may be his most daring and stunningly powerful achievement to date.Melancholia is split into two chapters, titled Justine and Claire. Chapter 1 details Justine's (Kirsten Dunst) wedding party, organized by her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). We immediately get the sense that something is off with Justine, and soon learn she has a past of battling depression which resurfaces at her party. The first chapter ends with Justine destroying her life, at which time we transition into Chapter 2 and learn that something is coming that threatens to destroy all life. A previously unknown planet, named Melancholia, is coming towards Earth, and despite Claire's husband's (Kiefer Sutherland) assurances that it will simply fly by, Claire and Justine know it won't - and it doesn't.Melancholia has huge promise, but is not perfectly executed. The two chapters lack congruity and as a result, "Claire" drags quite a bit. Von Trier is also guilty of letting his old habits seep into the film occasionally in the forms of awkward, unnecessarily primal scenes, clunky, oddly formal dialogue, and hammer-to-the-head symbolism. His lack of self-restraint, though, thankfully isn't enough to taint his successes. Even when he gets it wrong, Von Trier is one of the best and most unique working directors, and while Melancholia missteps a couple of times it remains another notch on Von Trier's belt. Few directors have the eye for satire and brutal humor that Von Trier does: "Justine" finds the dark comedy in serious family matters and as a result is every bit as acidically funny as it is mellowing. Von Trier never loses focus of his characters, though, and he allows the comedy to act as a backdrop for a harrowing study of depression, rather than losing control and having it maim the seriousness of Melancholia's core themes. And while Chapter 2 may drag, it builds itself back up again to one of the most satisfyingly stunning, overpowering and draining finales in cinema history. Melancholia relies heavily on the use of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde prelude, which permeates the film at all the right moments. The movie crescendos along with its musical theme, ebbing and flowing with oceanic power, alternating quiet calm with astonishing darkness. Melancholia feels alive, it has a pulse, and in spite of Von Trier's occasional blunders, watching it is a beautiful, awe-inspiring experience. It's almost like a poem in its unpredictable shifts in tempo and tone, layered with subtext, addressing and expressing the human condition in a way that other art forms can't - what Melancholia lacks in fluidity, it more than compensates for with its haunting imagery, meaningful symbolism; it is truly an artistic achievement.The film would not be as successful, though, without a transcendent performance from Kirsten Dunst. Dunst has shown glimpses of her potential throughout her career, and finally here she is given a role that lets her show the world what she can really do. Depression this extreme has rarely, if ever, been captured in film, and she tackles it bravely and relentlessly. We can see the light slowly burning out in her eyes, we can feel the disdain, hatred and shame all communicated in a single glance. It seems that in every scene, Dunst reveals yet another layer of a deeply complex character until she is the most naked - emotionally and physically - that she's ever been. Her descent is simply stunning to watch. She receives excellent supporting from Kiefer Sutherland, John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling, Stellan Skarsgard, and most notably, her on-screen sister Charlotte Gainsbourg. Their sisterly dynamic is tangible and deeply explored; Gainsbourg and Dunst make up one of those all-too-rare pairings that is exhilarating to watch just for their chemistry together. Gainsbourg's outward emotionality is the perfect match for Dunst's cold incisiveness, and it's thanks to these two that the film expresses its themes of duality so well.It's true that Von Trier stumbles a couple of times (one sex scene in particularly seems forced, out of place, and, for lack of a better word, Von Trier-esque), but it's also true that this movie wouldn't have worked in the hands of a lesser director. In Melancholia he has created a near-masterpiece and a uniquely rewarding experience, a science-fiction film where the characters and not the science take center stage, a drama that grows organically from its characters and not from ridiculous writing. Melancholia is equal parts bitingly funny, traumatic, haunting, and overwhelming, and is an experience that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melancholia, a mix tape of emotions. As known for trier's earlier films, the film is introduced by these lovely slow motion takes, which is absolutely amazing. I Just love trier's work with the camera here. Later on in the movie i got a bit disappointed though. I wanted to see more of these slow motion scenes. But that's noting I'm going to chin up on. The acting in Melancholia makes me forget all my expectations. The acting in Melancholia is something extraordinary. Kirsten Dust does a brilliant job during this movie, and so does Alexander Skarsg?rd. The blue planet Melancholia seems to get closer and closer. The closer it gets the more ignorant does Justine get. It appears that everyone is suffering from something,(Melancholia?) at the wedding, Michael loses his bride, John keeps his emotions and thoughts inside him which causes his death, a suicide he committed by overdosing Clairs medicine she got for her anxiety. As said: everyone suffer. At the end Justine takes "Leo", Clairs kid to go pick up thin trees to build a "Magic cave" that will make them survive. At the end of the movie there is a great scene of Melancholia brings the Earth to it's death. The film is slow, fine, but sometimes a bit to slow. A little more unpredicted twists would raise the rating of this movie a little bit more i think. Good job trier, again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was, perhaps, one of the best movies I have watched. My wife initially watched it as a streaming video and when it was over, she commented that I had to see it (she knows me better than I do myself). We rented a DVD and watched. The opening scenes were very reminiscent of the opening of "The Tree of Life" which I had viewed some months prior to watching Melancholla, but as the opening scenes progressed, and we watched Justine walking in a field amidst with dead birds dropping from the sky, and then seeing the collision of the planets, it was obvious that this was not about the creation, but maybe about the cosmic end. I must admit that I found Part 1, "Justine" to be a little trying and at one point, found myself dosing off and had to shift my position so as not to doze off. My biggest complaint about the movie was that early on, when Justine asks about the red star, it was incorrectly identified as a star in Andromeda. My own feeling is that it would have been more meaningful if it had been identified as the rouge planet, for surely, if it was visible to the naked eye, they knew what it was and what was to come. My own recommendation is to watch the movie on a DVD and be sure to watch the special features, which tie everything together and then watch the movie a second time, which I plan to do (and buy the DVD for future viewing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier has written a most impressive screenplay in "Melancholia". It is a true Museum piece of both art and music. He has created a film that should be seen by all. There are reflections of the film, "2001: A Space Odyssey" and musical genius that complements the cinema like none other. The cast is an outstanding one and much credit should go to the casting director. The character of Justine is beautifully played by Kirsten Dunst, who is both gorgeous to view and captures the mood of the character to the utmost degree. She gives a brilliant performance and deserves every award she may receive for this dynamic role. Her understanding sister, Claire, is wonderful at underplaying her part. She is portrayed by Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she too is compelling in her roll as well. Kiefer Sutherland gives and expectedly charming performance, and he too, like his dad, is outstanding at underplaying his part so that he blends in so very well as John, the husband of Claire.There are dynamic interplanetary scenes which boggle the mind. Combined with the dynamic sound track, one can only dream of the mental gyrations that the director went through. There are no surprises here in my selection of a truly masterful film. See it, or if you already have, see it once more to enjoy the fruits of this labor of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia revolves around two sisters and how they deal with the fact that a rogue planet is going to collide with Earth. Melancholia is written and directed by the brilliant filmmaker, Lars Von Trier. What makes Trier different from other filmmakers is that his films are beautiful works of art that you don't want to take your eyes off of. Trier has been on my favorite directors list for awhile now. The way he shoots Melancholia is like you're watching a documentary because basically the whole film is shot hand-held. The style of Melancholia grabs you and takes you into this emotion driven, end of the world film. Lars Von Trier did a ton of research before he started writing Melancholia. The idea all started when he was getting help for his depression. The way Trier wrote this film to show how humans would react during a disaster. You get a look at how one sister(Dunst) reacts so calm with the world about to end and the other sister(Gainsbourg) reacts in a the complete opposite. Melancholia's cast consists of: Kirsten Dunst, Alexander Skarsg?rd, Kiefer Sutherland, &amp; Charlotte Gainsbourg. The performances by everyone are impeccable, but the two that stand out are Dunst's and Gainsbourg. Kirsten Dunst won Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival. Dunst's performance in Melancholia stands out as her best work and is the perfect showcase for her talent. What stands out the most from her performance is the emotions she show without saying words. You can really feel what she is feeling just by her facial expressions. Charlotte Gainsbourg is a very powerful actress and the few films I have seen that she's in, you can her talent shine. Gainsbourg's performance is a little bit better than Dunst's performance. The way Gainsbourg is broken-down with emotions to the very end and how distraught she looks is powerful. Once again I'm having a hard time finding words to explain everything about this film. Melancholia is a film that not everyone will be able sit through. This is a very depressing film and is beautifully shot until the very end. Melancholia come highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&#x200e;'Melancholia' starts with one of the most beautifully captured prologue scenes in cinema. It's apocalyptic, melancholic and yet beautiful, yes, beautiful. The movie tries to explore relationships between two sisters as one of them has got just married and earth is about to get shattered by a collision with a planet called, 'Melancholy'. It's pretty obvious here why Von Trier chooses this name for this planet, isn't it?The movie isn't your typical sci-fi adventure, those who are familiar with Lars Von Trier's works would know that already. It, most importantly, tries to explore psychological and behavioral study of the people who are attending the wedding, at a grandeur palace, I might add. When your planet is about to be doomed, how much importance would one give to things like social nicety or hiding your honest emotions? No, Lars Von Trier makes his characters emotionally naked. There is a sense of desperation but with honesty in each unpredictable actions of the characters. And also, yes, melancholy.Melancholia is definitely a work of art. And like all the genuine artsy creations, it might just connect with you or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The controversial Danish director Lars von Trier has forgone the nastiness of his previous films and retreated to a more conventional aesthetic style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is divided into two chapters. The first is entitled "Justine" and focuses on a bride named Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her partner Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), who are attending a party at a manor house. To the annoyance of her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland), both of whom have spent time and money organising the party for them, the couple arrive extremely late. The party is occupied by various friends and family. Most bizarre are Justine's parents who have separated and Justine's boss who has her followed. Their behaviour prompts Justine to find excuses to leave the guests and head outside. In the night sky is the planet Melancholia, which we are told is closing in on the Earth, with a chance of both worlds colliding. As the night continues, Justine's behaviour grows increasingly irrational. The second part of the film is named "Claire". It concentrates on how she is trying to help Justine recover, as well as her fear of the oncoming planet too. The bad boy of cinema hasn't changed. The controversial Danish director Lars von Trier, founder of the abstract film movement Dogme 95, has forgone the nastiness of his previous films and retreated to a more conventional aesthetic style. There are thankfully no invisible doorknobs in Melancholia. It's visually spectacular at times, with appreciation towards the scope and grandeur of outdoor landscapes. While the style might have changed, the same mind games are intact, making this still very much a von Trier film. We're distracted by the film's lunacy, black sense of humour and sci-fi tropes but at its core it is a film about how two different women respond to death. That is very personal issue for von Trier, an admitted depressive, who claims to use filmmaking as a form of therapy. Melancholia seems like a more accessible story for the director to express himself through but there are familiar tricks at work. A common technique in von Trier's films, one that's sustained here, is his reliance on avatars rather than traditional character arcs. Characters in his films appear normal on the surface but then subvert their image through aberrant behaviour.Using the image of a bride is smart because it feels less contrived than David Morse's bad cop in Dancer in the Dark (2000). The anxiety that a woman must feel towards marriage is understandable. Physically embodying this tentative role is Kirsten Dunst. She finds the perfect balance between concealing her unrest from the other guests, while selectively revealing her personal conflict to the audience through von Trier's tight close-up shots. The first half of this film genuinely shows her range and her class as an actress. She is aided immeasurably by von Trier's intelligent visual design too. The shifts in her personality are reflected in the film's lighting. The wedding party scenes, complete with fake smiles, are brightly lit and juxtaposed against the backrooms and manor grounds, which are dim and shadowy. Rather seamlessly, it shows the transition between each avatar's surface appearance and their true personality. There's a chilling scene where John intimidates Justine in the backrooms, revealing his own personal conflictions. For much of the film's aesthetic control, there are a lot of strange details that are never explained. Still wearing her wedding dress, Justine climbs into a golf buggy, drives off into the night and then relieves herself on the course. One of the pleasures of Justine's dad (played by John Hurt) is to antagonise the waiters by putting spoons in his pockets and then calling the waiters to replace them with new ones. My favourite is the organiser who declares Justine has ruined the wedding and every time he walks past her he covers the side of his face. The first chapter is brimming with strange, sometimes funny, threads like this. I laughed at many of these oddball characters, assuming it was meant to be funny and intentionally absurdist. The oddity of the piece makes it appealing but it is also dramatically rich enough that it could have expanded into an entire film. It is all the more disappointing that the second chapter, focussing on Claire, is dreary and morbid. All of the darkly funny characters are missing and Dunst's fine work isn't sustained because the emphasis rests on Gainsbourg's character. She can carry big scenes of emotion like she did in Antichrist (2009) but her character's hysteria over such an unlikely event is difficult to sympathise with. Worst still, we realise the purpose of the flawed side characters from the first half. The separation of a woman from the foundations of life, from her marriage, her job and her unlikeable family is, I think, reflective of von Trier's aversion to the American Dream. Justine, becoming a stark alien-like figure, announces that the Earth is evil and willingly accepts death because she will be free from the self-importance of others. Von Trier contrasts this attitude with Claire's protection of her child but given the film's inevitable resolution there is little question of which woman he sides with more. It is not a view of the world that I could ever find agreeable but that's Lars von Trier isn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The realism of suffering, in a life that's far from perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Melancholia's closing credits begin to roll, nobody moves. You all wait for the customary credit music to start up, which it eventually does after a lengthy silence, and then breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe because making noise and exiting is now a real possibility, but honestly, it's more in response to having just taken in an intense and highly cinematic closing shot.Melancholia is an emotionally engaging and profound experience. Since those closing credits rolled, I have gone from just liking this film, to appreciating the true scope of it, and as a result, have a strong desire to see it again very soon. It's an appreciation that has come about through reflection, considering the challenging theme it chooses to tackle, and the unique story with which it uses as a platform. Having never seen a Lars Von Trier film before, I had no preconceived expectation on style or substance. But after reading a short synopsis that sounded intriguing, and even more so, being drawn in by such an ethereal yet beautifully surreal poster, it became a must see.The film opens with a stunning sequence that is set in the story's near future, and could be seen as somewhat of a spoiler for the film's main drama, that being the threat that a planet may collide with Earth. But as this is far from your average end of the world movie, it works to enhance the narrative that follows. The sequence is a few shots, slowed right down to almost frozen moments in time, letting one's eyes drift through each image, much like a painting. These shots draw similarities to other film's this year which have shown nature at its most dynamic. But with this there is purpose, you feel the engagement, as you realise the event, and watch the tragedy at its peak, whilst being in awe of the spectacle and the enchanting way it has been composed.From here the film is presented in two parts, each titled after the two sisters, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Part one of the film focuses on Justine, and her wedding day, before the threat of a planet hitting Earth has been discovered. Claire and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) have put a tremendous amount of effort and money into Justine's wedding day, yet at the reception the bride struggles to remain happy and interested in the formalities. What is not immediately noticeable but becomes evident, is that Justine suffers from depression, and Kirsten Dunst plays it out perfectly. Putting on a fake smile, and pretending like nothing's wrong, even though it can't really be hidden. She is a soul lost in the illness. Cleverly the film presents depression without it becoming the focal point. It almost has an affective presence on the narrative, like it does a person, draining the story of its ability to be happy with all things perfect.For the second part of the film, the imminent threat of a planet hitting and destroying Earth, becomes the centerpiece of the story, and is played out on a such a personal level, that it is very affecting. Claire becomes the focus, as she lives with John, her son, and a sick Justine, in a cottage on its own golf course, some distance from the local town. The isolation that is created by the location, means the outside world is somewhat non-existent. It is just four people, all with their own fears and emotional instabilities, reacting in entirely contrasting ways, to what could be the end of their life. It becomes a character study of sorts, as the human reaction is amplified, by the isolated circumstances. It uniquely made the threat so much more real, as the cliché of doom and gloom news reports, and shots of worldwide panic, were omitted, or probably never considered. It was so refreshing and added so much to the reality of the situation.Melancholia is a highly ambitious film. It portrays the quiet suffering that is mental illness in a very real and damaging way, accompanying it with an end of the world scenario that can't help but be taken very seriously. Somehow, Lars Von Trier has been able to juxtapose two completely different topics together, so it is a seamless cohesion. It is a sad film no doubt, but it seems to simply represent a type of life that really exists. A life where things may be achievable, but a mental illness such as depression holds one back. The end of the world scenario facing a character suffering depression, brought to the fore the very real fact, that for no apparent reason, some people live far from enjoyable lives, that cruelly so it seems, are cut short before having any chance of improving. It's a subject that may be tough to watch, but is worth recognising, and in this film, feels so real. Best of all, it will have you thinking on numerous levels come the close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is clear that viewers will either love this movie, or just hate it with a passion. Judging by the crowd gathered at the Angelika when the film made its commercial debut, the reaction fell somewhere in the middle. It is clear director Lars Von Trier is a believer of tackling subjects that might not resonate with his audience. Such is the case with "Melancholia" which is divided in two sections, both involving two sisters that are as different as day and night.The wedding of Justine and Michael is an odd affair. For starters, their stretch limousine cannot make it through the country lane it must take in order to reach the home of her sister Claire, where the reception is to be held. Being late does not matter to Justine one bit. She is not your typical bride intent in having a great time at her own wedding. One has to question if Justine is in love with Michael. Is it all for show? Things get complicated when Claire's son watches what appears is a red star in the distance. To everyone's surprise it is a planet and one gets the impression a collision with our own planet is imminent. The second segment is more about Claire. She is married to John, a wealthy man, whose generosity included the wedding celebration for Justine. Where Justine is flighty, Claire is a responsible woman. There are hints that Justine's instability must be some sort of mental problem that is not completely explained. The film kept reminding us certain aspects of Alain Resnais' "Last Year in Marienbad". The film was beautifully photographed by Manuel Alberto Claro. The music of Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde" is heard in the background and serves as the theme of this production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The earth comes to it end...... but Classically.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The earth comes to it end......Sounds haunting? yes it sure does. They have made films like this before how the earth will end. Different religions have different beliefs but they have the doomsday in common.Films have been made before and some of them were pretty decent, Melancholia 2011 is just like them with some added slow motion prolonged scenes and beautiful visuals.Melancholia's best part is its direction. Even the story told is not very good, the way its translated on screen is neat. The length of the movie is more than 2 hours in which at least 30 minutes of the movie are EXCESSIVE. Performances are decent and the plot looks interesting and haunting. I am neither disappointed by it by any means nor impressed. But the whole impact of the movie is positive.8/10. Classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been said before, but merits repeating. This is one movie you'll either love or hate. I'm still trying to decide which it is for me. Several times while watching this I was tempted to turn it off and forget how I'd just wasted my time, but I managed to get through the whole thing. While it is very depressing, scenes keep coming that make you want to keep viewing it to see what'll happen next. Kirsten Dunst gives a great performance as the lead, showing a side in her acting abilities that I'd never seen before, as a clinically depressed woman who, at first, tries to go through life as others expect her to but ultimately can't be anything but herself. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the sister who both loves and cares for Dunst, and at the same time hates her for being "uncaring". The first 8 minutes of the movie is visually stunning, showing short, different versions of scenes that will later be viewed, and silent except for a hauntingly beautiful classical music soundtrack. What you see there does give away the ending of the film, but not how it'll end for the sisters. So, would I watch it again? Probably not for awhile, sadness and anxiety are not something I want to revisit often, but yes, I'll see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The strange state of melancholia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A large planet is on collision course for the Earth but no-one seems particularly concerned, least of all Justine who is late for her wedding reception at her sister's large country house. No one listens to TV or reads the newspapers.Lars von Trier's film seems to be the antipathy of a disaster movie. No one suffers from hysteria for very long and the closest you get to a mass exodus is Justine's sister Claire trundling along in a golf cart for a hundred yards, until the battery gives out.I guess this is part of the charm; everything is certainly very beautiful in Justine's world. Then in the second half, there is an abrupt change of pace. The wedding guests leave the mansion and eventually the house is just occupied by Justine, her sister and young nephew. They peer at the looming planet through a twisted piece of wire, to gauge how close Melancholia is coming.I loved the acting, particularly Charlotte Gainsbourg as Claire, in the film but it is an unusual mix of genres. However, events unfurl at such a refreshing slow pace that it would seem churlish not to like Melancholia a little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understatedly emotive, in a manner which is overwhelmingly bleak.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is a film-maker whose work goes without definition; he's the kind of artist that defies what the mainstream may consider to be the proper and appropriate way to present a narrative, yet somehow still manages to find himself at the talking end of press and internet blogs the world over. The explanation is simple; Trier makes films that take the basic premises of modern cinema and tip them on their head, exposing secrets we never quite saw before, and in turn capturing the attention of movie-goers either through disgust, ambivalence or enlightenment. So whether you find the man's work to be refreshing or just downright indulgent, there's probably a part of your argument that's completely correct; and that, I guess, is what makes his films so often the talking points of any film-festival or internet forum.Melancholia (which is coming to theatres now in amongst the dark dreary shadow of perhaps Von Trier's most publicized work to date, Antichrist) has big boots to fill but will once again no doubt have audiences who manage to sit through the undeniably stark and barren film at odds with how they feel towards it. Part requiem for planet Earth, part character- study and analysis on chronic depression and the acceptance of our mortality, Melancholia is very much just as dismaying as the bleak and horrifying Antichrist was, but in a much more subtle manner. And while the overarching plot revolves around a flyby planet that is destined to destroy the Earth and everyone on it, Von Trier never once divulges in the fantastic?instead he subjects the viewer to the mundane; the crawling, agonising, polarising, sometimes exhilarating viewpoint of his central character Justine who is played by an astoundingly muted Kristen Dunst.What results is a film that is understatedly emotive, in a manner which is overwhelmingly bleak. Conceived during a severe bout of depression that Trier experienced prior to the production, one can easily digest where the darkness of Melacholia comes from and how instead of coming across as a bloated, indulgent essay on the condition, the film-maker acknowledges the sometimes serene, and calm qualities that can be distilled in a depressed mind during times of crisis. Justine, who begins the film getting married, cheats on her new husband on a golf course, quits her job soon after and then laments her loneliness all in the one night, might not be the most understandable or empathetic of characters, but we're never meant to feel sorry for her?on the contrary we see her as she is, as troubled, hard to deal with but yet still with a sense of integrity and intelligence. Which is why, when the movie comes to its strikingly bombastic halt, we're surprised to find that it's probably Justine that we would hope to be, should the curtain come crashing down on us.How Von Trier achieves this is part of what makes Melancholia a treat; despite its tendencies to overdo and prolong the mundane. It's a complex and often very sharp, precise and punctuating discourse on the ever- looming prospect of death that awaits each and every one of us. What Melancholia does is explore how different characters react or deal with the realisation that, yes, death is coming, so how are you going to deal with it? What kind of person are you? The result is startling, and for a movie that depicts the end of the world with no quarrel; no reservations; the final bullet point is a refreshingly conclusive one, which in this day and age is hard to come by. So if at all you find anything to appreciate about Melancholia, it will probably be just that? that it has something to say, and it does so without compromise. It may be depressing, and it may be a tad dull and dreary, but when you're dealing with manic depression and the end of the world, what do you really expect? Independence Day? If so; give it a miss. If not, then you might just be surprised at what you find within yourself as you join Justine and company as they stare into the fading light of their mortality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the way the world is supposed to end? Both with a bang and in silence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary Jane Watson has a come long way since her upside down kiss with the masqueraded Peter Parker. Named best Actress at Cannes; MELANCHOLIA is undoubtedly one of her (Kirsten Dunst) best works as of date. Its Justine's (Kirsten Dunst) wedding day! Clearly depressed beyond fathomable explanation she does seem to come through as inconsiderate towards her nurturing sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her Husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) who have thrown her a lavish wedding party on their estate. There is something that Justine is aware of; there is something that is holding her back from her own wedding party, what could this be? What makes Justin not even notice her husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) on their wedding night? What makes he do what she does on the golf course? Does Justin know something that no one else does? It is indeed obvious that the world will end in MELANCHOLIA. The movie unfolds with a beautiful enchanting overture, set to Wagners "Tristan and Isolde". A mime that is tangled but personally one that I felt was indeed a bit too long. Justine standing while living creatures fall out of the sky, Claire is shown fighting her way through the golf course carrying her son and running for their lives. Then suddenly director Lars Von Trier shows the earth colliding with MELANCHOLIA and the earth as we know it is destroyed! Lars Von Trier; whose work I have never experienced seeps through as a mastermind. Although MELANCHOLIA is extremely difficult to watch and now that I am doing this piece it seems extremely hard to forget, this unorthodox script is certainly a worthy mention at the Oscars of 2012. However considering the Golden Globe Awards that took place and its nominees and winners the chances of even a mention may be unlikely. This assumption is based of the Golden Globe tagline "Road to the Oscars"! Is MELANCHOLIA a movie of damnation of mankind? Is it a reflection of all our wrongs and how it will be dealt with by a grater force than man? Or is it just coincidence that we happen to be in the way of the blue planets (MELANCHOLIA) trajectory path? Either way the prologue clearly does for certain emphasize that there will be no hope for the planet earth or us! What an appropriate theme to bring forth at a time where there is wide panic and theories of the end of the Mayan Calendar! Smart is what Lars Von Trier is indeed? Is this the way the world is supposed to end? Both with a bang and in silence? Title: MELANCHOLIA Directed by: Lars Von Trier Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gansbourg, Alexander Skarsgard, Stellan Skarsgard and Kiefer Sutherland Rated: Rated R for some graphic nudity, sexual content and language Rating: 07/10 136 Minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only give this movie a 3 because it has good actors, good music and a story which makes enough sense to understand what's going on prima facie.A movie doesn't need a point to be good, it doesn't need to make sense. A movie can be good in numerous ways but this gives you the feeling of exactly that melancholia. Unfortunately because we have something called empathy, if I show you someone suffering long enough you eventually feel something for them if you've ever felt in a similar way.I have a feeling this movie is directed at people who are artistic and who are depressed. Who knows, maybe when I'm depressed I'll enjoy this movie but this movie does not even have a message to give out. Like, save our planet before this is too late. Instead, yep, you're all going to die.A movie does not have to have a point to make it good but this movie does not have one and it only brings a feeling of melancholia. If I wanted that I could watch documentaries of Africa, it wont have the special effects or actors and extremely long, boring and awkward moments but it'll do the job.If you are depressed at the moment or think yourself as some art hippy who only tries to see the beauty in everything. Sure you'll like this, other than that I don't see the point in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shallow person's idea of a deep movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I mean Von Trier. I really wanted to like this movie, but I ultimately found it very cynical and pointless. There are some beautiful shots, particularly in the opening, but even there, the excessive slo-mo and deafening Wagner only made me think "How turgid! How German!".The loopy camera work, particularly in the endless wedding sequences (exactly how long did this reception go on- seemed like about 24 hours) was just aggravating, could we just settle on the actors' faces for a moment? The characters were all depressingly dysfunctional- the sequences with her boss who was a total ass were completely unnecessary. Even (spoiler) John's suicide at the end seemed out of character and nothing more than a plot device to get the sisters alone together. And what gives with the accents all over the place? Where was this set? One sister with an English accent and one with an American?! And the husband seemed to be doing some type of Southern accent. The ending was rushed and didn't fulfill the promise of the prologue for visual poetry.Despite all this, the movie is strangely mesmerizing. Some of the shots of the planet, however unlikely, are hypnotizing, and there is some good acting by a distinguished company, which is why I gave it 5 stars.Ultimately, though, this felt like a film by a visually gifted director who doesn't really understand, or even value humanity and relationships. I was led to believe from the reviews that maybe in this film, he had made something more human and profound than his earlier work, but I think not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must Let Go When Viewing Lars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to keep reminding myself when I watch Lars Von Trier films: Don't try to "keep up" with the story by tying in what you just saw with past scenes to form a chronology! Rather, feel the emotions that you suspect the lead character feels about his/her circumstances - and not necessarily his/her immediate circumstances but his/her life situation, allegorically represented by whatever setting(s) Lars conjures up. I kind of saw this as the Tale of Two Sisters. I don't necessarily think either is being described as clinically depressed. They simply evidence the sadness, fear, failings, misadventure, misdeeds and remorse all people do. Justine is the more overtly despondent and Von Trier is trying to show us her recklessness, irresponsibility, evasiveness and immaturity (both causes and effects) using a single evening; i.e., her wedding night. That Part I is simply a painting of Justine's entire life is evident by how loosely drawn most of the characters are; e.g., her poor husband, her boss, her parents, etc. We see a women who rejects the world and selfishly and repeatedly turns inward, oblivious to the impacts of her actions (and more important, her lack of interactions). Claire, on the other hand, faces reality with better strength and has built herself a more practical and socially responsible life. Claire's character and serious mindedness allows her to better navigate the practical realities of living. However, Claire's approach also results in a too objective belief in reward and fairness. When she realizes that an apocalyptic catastrophe fails to discriminate between; e.g., her hard-working, practical self and irresponsible wrecks like Justine, Claire falls apart. Note that Justine, who in Part I is the weakling who largely wastes her life, appears much better equipped to handle the fast approaching Planet Melancholia.Clearly, both parts make clear Justine's lack of sexual inhibitions and contrast such to Claire's tight demeanor. Part I, Justine's world depicts sex as carnal, totally divorced from emotions; e.g., her husband's courting approach is simply too wrapped in the conventions of love, longing, etc! Justine's sexual frankness, viewed through Claire's world in Part II, is truly provocative; e.g., even Claire must view such from a hidden vantage point.Bridges in literature, film, etc., are important and Lars had something in mind with the country road bridge in this film; e.g. the difficulty each sister encounters in crossing such, respectively, on horseback and motorized. I'm open for suggestions on this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring - from a devoted Von Trier Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all Von Trier films I've seen (maybe 7), this one is the least entertaining of them all. I've grown to like this director over the years because of his strengths, namely: documentary-style up close and personal cinematography, ability to tell a good story, but most his ability to get real emotions out of the actors. Early on his strong suit was emotional story-telling. Later with Antichrist we saw a super natural edge added to his traditional style of hand-held camera plus powerful emotional drama. With Melancholia, I found none of the traits present that made Von Trier films what they were well-known and loved for. The super natural element was present for about 2 minutes in one scene of the movie, but was developed no further. The first hour of the movie focused on the main character's wedding, but contributed nothing to the plot, other than to introduce the characters and set a brooding mood. I watched intently waiting for something to happen, it did not. I feel the movie could have been a 6.5 or even 7 had the wedding been scrapped, but then it would have only run 60 minutes. Really the only interesting parts in the movie are the first 5 minutes, which have almost no connection to the actual story, and the final 5 minutes, which are mildly intense but as the preceding 115 minutes have drained you of will to watch intently, is quite a letdown. Watch any other Von Trier film before watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Apocalyptic Depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "Melancholia" is indeed a science fiction film, as Wikipedia tells us it is, it's one that only Lars von Trier could have made. Its depiction of a rogue planet on a collision course with Earth is joined at the hip with the story of two sisters, one of whom is deeply depressed. Trier, widely known within film circles for his bouts of severe depression, claims the idea came to him during one of his therapy sessions, in which he was told that, because they've conditioned themselves to see the bad side of every situation, depressives tend to act more calmly than others when under pressure. The depressed woman is resigned not only to her fate but also the fate of everyone on the planet. The same cannot be said for her sister, in the throes of panic and despair. The irony, of course, is that their behavioral roles have been reversed.The film is not a disaster movie in the Hollywood sense, in which audiences gawk helplessly at cities being reduced to rubble. Rather than typical death and destruction, it's a psychological drama, a story about how we as human beings cope with impending disaster. Some are able to stay level-headed. Others will emotionally self destruct. In the end, it makes no difference; we're all in the same boat, which is to say that for everything we do, it all amounts to nothing. I resist nihilism as a rule, simply because I find that belief system very unpleasant. In this particular case, however, I recognized what Trier was trying to convey. In the inky depths of depression, absolutely nothing matters ? not your loved ones, not your professional or personal life, and certainly not an inevitable apocalypse. It's a void, like a black hole.The depressed sister is Justine (Kirsten Dunst), the subject of the film's first chapter. At the start, we see a woman that's all smiles. It's her wedding day, and she has just married a wonderful man named Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd). She even has a promising career in advertising. They arrive for their reception at the palatial home of her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and her wealthy husband, John (Kiefer Sutherland), and that's when the cracks begin to show. She has an eccentric father (John Hurt), who insists on calling every young woman he meets Betty, and a deeply bitter and cynical mother (Charlotte Rampling), who thinks nothing of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. She has a boss (Stellan Skarsg?rd, Alexander's father) who's only interested in power and money and will not stop pestering her for a new slogan. As the night goes on ? during which she notices an unusually bright star in the sky ? she becomes less and less engaged with the party. Eventually, even Michael is forced to concede that it has all been a lie.Claire is the subject of the second chapter, which takes place after the disastrous wedding reception. Justine has moved in and is in a depression so severe that she can't even walk without assistance. Claire is willing to nurture her sister. John, on the other hand, is distracted by the discovery of a heretofore unknown planet dubbed Melancholia, which has eclipsed several stars and is scheduled to pass Earth. He believes the scientists who say that the two planets will not collide. Claire isn't as optimistic. As the days pass and Melancholia draws near, she visits numerous websites and worries that it will not be a flyby event but a deadly slingshot orbit. Soon enough, her fears get the better of her. She thinks of her young son, Leo (Cameron Spurr), who may not have the chance to grow up. Justine, despite being certain of Earth's impending doom, inches closer towards once again being a functional adult.In Trier's previous film, "Antichrist," Gainsbourg played a woman who, following the death of her son and the questionable therapeutic techniques of her husband, came to believe that women are inherently evil. (Incidentally, Trier was in a depression of his own when he made the film.) Now in "Melancholia," Trier's cinematic misogyny expands to full-blown misanthropy; Dunst's character is convinced that all life on Earth is evil, and that no one will miss our planet when it's gone. She says she knows that we're all alone in the universe ? not a trace of life anywhere else in the infinite vastness of the cosmos. There's no explaining it. She just knows. I would not say this comforts her, although she certainly is prepared to accept it.When the film premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Trier attracted attention for making contentious statements during a press conference and for getting banned as a result. Most inflammatory were his jokes about Jews, Nazis, his own German heritage, and his affiliation with the Nazi party and admiration for Adolf Hitler. He later declared ? wisely, I believe ? that he would never again make public statements and decline future interview requests. I wonder: Will this draw people to "Melancholia"? It cannot be denied that controversy generates interest, and yet I'm concerned that certain audiences will see it for all the wrong reasons. In my opinion, Trier's immature and objectionable behavior should have no bearing on the film's strong character development, compelling performances, and striking visuals.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever felt understood by someone, just by looking into their eyes? The feeling is emotionally overwhelming but also very disturbing. That's the same feeling I got from watching MELANCHOLIA. Like someone (Lars Von Trier, in that case) just opened the core of my very soul and screamed it out loud.The opening scene is, in itself a masterpiece. The images are so powerful and beautiful than it's painful. The slow motion movement mixed with the loud, intense classical music charms us again like it did in Antichrist. My own personal favorite is when Justine (Dunst) is trying to walk trough the gray yarn in her wedding dress. This is just so meaningful of everything her character has to face especially in part one; Justine.I have to say this was atrociously painful yet comforting to watch. I just felt so close to Justine, to her reactions, to the way she tries so hard to handle things and fake happiness trough all life's endless stupid rituals. But she fails. Even tough she tries real hard, she can't fake her own happiness on a day most girls dream about; her wedding day.The shaky camera-work, that is not always winning, was clearly a winner in MELANCHOLIA, it helped showing the instability of both the situation going on and the characters' mind.In part two; Claire, Justine moves in with her sister Claire (Gainsbourg, who planned her wedding in the first half) and her family, who try to help her get better from the depression that's dragging her down more and more. But everyone have their own issues and Claire is actually terrified by a planet called melancholia, which is supposed to pass by earth in the next days. Her husband (Sutherland) keeps explaining to her that melancholia wont hit the earth, but she develops a sort of obsession with the idea.Up to that point, the movie becomes so tense, you actually forget to breathe. The tension keeps going up to bring you to the final scene, which will leave you speechless. That final scene has to be one of the best, most worth watching in theaters one ever made. This was truly my most physical experience with a movie. My muscles went like water so I could not even stand from my seat. You have to experience it to understand. Don't miss that incredible chance.</fullReview>

That is the sole reason that i was able to finish it . I also found the cinematography to be sub par. too many shots were done with a steady cam or shoulder cam when they could as easily been done with a tripod or rail cam .the camera bouncing was distracting and added nothing to the movie. there was essentially no plot throughout the movie . Im surprised Kirsten Dunst actually consented to showing nudity for this film , it contributed nothing to the film ( except for a juvenile wow factor) and was unnecessary for the plot or character development. in summary i would only recommend this film for those heavily sedated or with severe heart conditions that cannot handle sudden shock or excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalyptic Saga of Two Sisters in von Trier's Idiosyncratic Hands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Armageddon is given a surrealistic, chaotic and thoroughly avant-garde treatment that only Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier ("Breaking the Waves") can give such a grave subject. This is no Michael Bay-style extravaganza of bombastic special effects but rather a brooding mood piece that is bound to frustrate as much as it impresses, quite often in the same scene due to von Trier's emotionally jarring, uniquely idiosyncratic perspective. At the same time, this 2011 drama is probably his most accessible work for a mass audience, even if it amounts to a study in psychological depression. The narrative splits evenly into two parts revolving around the lives of two sisters, Justine and Claire, on a large estate owned by Claire and her no-nonsense husband John.The first part, entitled simply "Justine", is about her elaborate wedding to Michael on the estate and how their reception deteriorates into emotional chaos and deception. Initially, Justine appears to be a carefree bride, but she turns out to be a rising creative director at an ad agency gradually revealing herself to be a manic-depressive on a path toward self-destruction. This part of the film is filled with von Trier's penchant for shaky hand-held camera shots and awkward confrontation scenes that turn the party into a social apocalypse. The second half, entitled "Claire", carries forth the natural consequence of the failed wedding with Justine in a catatonic state and now within the context of the impending collision of a rogue planet called Melancholia. The inevitability of the situation causes the sisters to transform their natures relative to each other - Justine changes from fatalistic to near-spiritual, while Claire moves from protective and insular to uncontrollably fearful.As with several of his more renowned films, von Trier has assembled an eclectic cast of actors whose differing accents would come across as puzzling if this was not clearly one of his ensemble films. Keeping a relatively low profile of late, Kirsten Dunst delivers a powerful, sometimes unsettling performance as Justine, a near-impossible role that takes advantage of her combination of unforced winsomeness and singular introspection. Looking nothing like Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg ("Antichrist") is watchful in the more restrained role of Claire even as her character spins out of control toward the end. As her patronizing husband John, Kiefer Sutherland has to play close to the vest exuding contrived optimism in the face of insurmountable odds. Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt make their few moments count as the sisters' emotionally disconnected parents.Stellan Skarsg?rd shows up as Justine's manipulative boss, and his real-life son Alexander plays Justine's smitten betrothed. It's interesting to note that Penélope Cruz was originally slated for Dunst's role, but her delayed schedule on "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" prevented her participation and yet another accent to the hodgepodge already presented. The film feels overlong at 135 minutes, especially with von Trier's often lugubrious pacing, but his cinematic artistry is in full bloom in the hallucinatory introductory sequence of images which initially confound but then reveal all too clearly where the story is going, all to the strains of Wagner's Prelude to "Tristan and Isolde". The ending is handled with surprising subtlety and poignancy. This movie will not be everyone's cup of tea (which may explain its appearance on Direct TV prior to its theatrical release), but the more patient and thoughtful among us will be rewarded.</fullReview>

This is a recommendation to those who have not seen it: Go and watch it, but do it with the expectation of watching a piece of art, not an enjoyable movie experience. Don't try to analyze what the causes the characters to behave like they do; don't expect plot twists; don't wait for bright revelations about secrets or other intrigues; don't expect a story cut down and served for fast consumption, life is not like that, and this movie is more like life. Most of all, don't expect a happy ending. Enjoy the film like you would enjoy your favourite painting, or classical music. Enjoy the ride and don't hope for its ending. It is a long movie, but every minute adds to the mood and the tragedy that you know is coming. You'll find yourself asking for an extra 5 minutes at least just to delay the final scene from breaking your heart. Watch it and understand the fragility where we all stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word. Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is a genius. His films have a very unique quality to them. He manages to tell stories that are immensely entertaining while at the same time still being utterly unique and artistic. Melancholia is absolutely stunning. It works on so many different levels it has to be seen. Words cannot do it justice. Literally. There are scenes in this film that visually have never really been attempted and certainly not achieved with such grace. And yet the central story and the acting are so good that the movie would be completely engrossing even without the end of the world aspect, but throw that into that mix and you have a movie that has truly done something on a grand scale. Evoking a wide array of emotions while at the same time raising interesting and profound questions about life, depression, family, and the end of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Danish auteur's latest is a study of depression, and more specifically suicide. Subtle suicide imagery abounds: a jar of beans doubles resembles a pot of pills; a child hacks at the wrist of a tree branch with a knife; a bridge doubles as a gateway of doom. But aside from metaphor he also faces mental illness head-on, in the relationship between the catastrophically depressed Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her caring, resourceful sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg, back in the ring for another round).The early wedding scenes, in which beaming Justine slowly self-destructs on her wedding day, are reminiscent of the masterful Festen (directed by Dogma 95 brother-in-arms Thomas Vinterberg). But the agenda here is quite different: a prelude to a desperately solemn second act, where it is never quite clear who is aware that the world is going to end, who is unaware, and who is in denial. We never move outside the manor grounds ? does "the village" really exist? How much of this world belongs to Justine's dreamworld (brought to life in a seductive Wagner-scored opening sequence)? Or is the planet Melancholia some kind of sister to Solaris? Indeed, Von Trier, who dedicated his previous film to Andrei Tarkovsky, directly references Solaris with his use of the painting "Hunters in the Snow" by Pieter Bruegel. It's worth remembering, also, that Tarkovsky's final film, The Sacrifice, focused on a remote country house, whose wealthy occupants were caring for a disturbed, melancholic loved one, who may or may not be seeking psychic consolation by imagining the end of the world. Von Trier doesn't quite match that film's bleak humour, but the comparison is valid.Regardless of Lars Von Trier's off-screen japery, there's no denying he creates serious, memorable, deeply textured film worlds, each time squaring the wheels on another Hollywood genre. I think Melancholia could have done with a more static camera, and a slightly fuller script (Von Trier's skills as a writer shouldn't be underestimated). But there aren't many filmmakers who would be willing to make a disaster movie which is both vaster and more focused and singular than any that have gone before. With all the dollars and extra dimensions in the universe, Roland Emmerich could never make us feel such a sense of sadness and loss.</fullReview>

Five couples left the movie in Dublin during this movie,i guess those people are the ones writing the bad reviews around here :)The helpness is the strength throughout this movie,it never really gets too joyful or happy but instead it scales down to pure soul.So here are some thoughts to you want to see something different;1.Do you and your partner want a love story,choose something else. 2.Do you love Hollywood movies,choose Independence Day.Otherwise,this is the kind of movie that just after seeing it you really can't put your finger on it.The next day you really appreciated it.2 days later you realize you have been watching those rare one that just like a strong memory lasts with you until you go old and start to forget things.I love to forget this one and see it again for the first time,remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film as an Art Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier is a master in creating films that jar the audience into a different level of perception. His films (Dogville, Dancing in the Dark, Europa, AntiChrist, Breaking the Waves) explore the use of stage sets as though we were in the legitimate theater instead of a movie theater, uses the camera in a fashion that makes allows the viewer the feeling that we are overhearing or secretly observing of the characters the actors are portraying, writes stories that seduce us to think vertically instead of horizontally, and paints his films with music that is unexpectedly poignant to his story. Such is the case with MELANCHOLIA, a film that is yet to be released, one that likely will have a small audience in the art film houses, but at the same time for those fortunate enough to see this work of cinematic art it will jolt into the realm of possibilities about the end of life as we know it.The film opens the way it ends: a planet named Melancholia hidden by our sun circles into the earth's atmosphere and collides with earth. The extended opening sequence is carried out is gorgeous pictures that reveal a tranquil stage set as the strange collision takes place - all to the Prelude to Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde' (beautifully played by the Prague Philharmonic with some arranging from music director Kristian Eidnes Andersen). The two hour film is dived into Part one: Justine and Part two: Claire. Once the action begins we discover Justine (Kirsten Dunst) - in full bridal regalia - and her husband Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) attempting to manipulate a wedding limousine to the mansion where Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) and their little son Leo (Cameron Spurr) have been waiting for hours to begin the vastly expensive wedding party. Present at the party are Dexter (John Hurt) this discombobulated father of the sisters, the girl's vitriolic mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), Justine's boss Jack (Stellan Skarsg?rd), a new speech writer for Jack's company Tim (Brady Corbet), Michael's parents (James Cagnard and Deborah Fronko) and the wedding planner and assistant (Udo Kier and Jesper Christensen). The party is tense and we slowly realize that Justine is 'distracted': she seems to be suffering from a form of melancholia and spends her time at the party unwisely (a physical encounter in the garden with Tim, napping, and always at odds with Claire and John, and eventually wandering off to be alone, away from Michael. There is a new star in the sky that the people dismiss but that some say is a planet headed in a collision course with the earth. In Part two we find Justine being returned to Claire's home, disheveled, and the relationship of the sisters is more fully explored. There is an air of anxiety - the time of the predicted collision is approaching and the manner in which all observe what follows is at once terrifying and eloquently meaningful.The entire cast is brilliant. Many viewers may find this film a preposterous apocalyptic vision, many will see it as an overly long and self indulgent artsy piece by von Trier, but the beauty of the film is not only in the visual aspects and the musical aspects of the production but in the intensely realistic view of a truly dysfunctional family - and perhaps that is the driving force of the collision of relationships as we currently view them that merely marry the metaphor of Justine's melancholia with the incipient act of the strange planet Melancholia's collision with earth. Do we care to mend our existence, or do we passively wait for the consequences of now? Grady Harp</fullReview>

From the very start of this film i was hooked i wanted to know more about each of the characters as soon as they appeared on the screen and for some that happened and others not so much but you were not left looking at empty shells of characters that are just brought in to look pretty they are really tangible people that make you want to know them and you are happy for the little glimpse that you are given into each of there lives (and that is just the first part)The second part is just as gripping it is both subtle and beautiful in ways which are really hard to describe and with a final moment that has stuck with me a the front of my brain ever since i left the cinema. this film is not for everyone and normally i would give it a lower rating for just that reason but not in this case i feel that even if you watch this film and you hate it you life will be better for just seeing it. please watch it, please please please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melancholia for me was an excellent illustration of a feeling. Having been extremely melancholic at one point in my life I definitely felt taken back by it and reminded of those feelings. I'd draw a strong distinction between melancholia and depression (having had both). Depression for me would be characterised by thoughts such as, "Things never going my way", and is very much mixed with anxiety, "Can't get a moment's peace to think about my problems". Melancholia is very different, and has, in a way, a richness to it, which for example is reflected when Justine (Kirsten Dunst) bathes in the light of the planet Melancholia. You can get a feeling of peace say by thinking, "I accept that the world is fundamentally rotten", or, "It would be a very good and right thing if the world were to turn to ashes". Melancholic thoughts like these generally seems to happen at periods in your life when you have a lot of time for reflection. I think you can definitely be nostalgic about melancholy. I'm nostalgic for my student days, for climbing into bed at midday on a Wednesday and listening to Satie, impassive tears. The film in general reminds me of a song lyric from my youth, from Soundgarden, "Black hole sun won't you come and wash away the rain".It's Justine's wedding day and she relapses into a melancholy that (it's hinted) pockmarked her childhood. Why does this happen? Melancholy is experienced not because of one's own failings ("I'm not clever enough to pass this exam", "I couldn't make the football team"), but due to the world being shabby compared to fairy tales and dreams, your idols falling as you grow up, realisations that love is often selfish and mere lust in disguise, that people are vain and egotistical and self-serving, that commerce is degrading and inimical. Justine surely a reference to the Marquis de Sade's character of the same name, a virtuous ingenue who is subjected to abuse at every turn. Upon rescue from the the sins of the world she succumbs to depression and is struck dead by a bolt of lightning.It's a pure form of depression, it comes to Justine even though she is beautiful, marrying Michael, a wealthy and handsome man, has been promoted at work, and is in the middle of a magnificent wedding.As in Antichrist, Lars von Trier shows us the dark lines of the chasm between men and women. Justine craves spontaneity, and amity (just as Jack thrives on hostility), Michael is wrapped up in his super-ego (Freud suggested this was much stronger in men), John trusts in science.There's an aesthetic to the trajectory of the planet Melancholia (the dance of death), and melancholy is also here associated with higher knowledge (Justine is aware of exactly how many seeds are in a jar without counting). It may be apt to compare the film to Albrecht Dürer's famous engraving Melancholia I, which echoes this, there's an awkward shaped solid in the image (note the awkward angles of the trees in the garden of von Trier's Melancholia), and also a square of jumbled numbers. However the shape is a special one called Dürer's solid, all points of which can be fitted to a sphere, and the numbers are not only part of a magic square, but also list the date of the engraving's production. Melancholy both unshapely and sublime.Melancholia for me was a calming and beautiful experience for me, like Justine, I rediscovered the comfort of eating jam neat from the jar, comme un ours! (And also the comfort of not caring if the world ends).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the privilege of consuming this beast twice within 36 hours &amp; I think I can honestly say I haven't seen a film that dug it's claws into my heart and wrung raw emotion from my soul like that since maybe The Virgin Suicides (yeah, it's been awhile, I've been jaded). Lars von Trier has a penchant for tragedy, for despair (Medea being a hauntingly perfect allegory of such) but this is so so much deeper than simply a surface display of emotion set-dressed in von Trierian style &amp; cinematography. The fact that the majority of the movie doesn't even center on the imminent omnivorous title is part of it's genius. We start with a girl on her wedding day going through the motions but inside questioning everything &amp; we click, we know her, we see who &amp; what she is &amp; we FEEL her, then over the next two hours as her interpersonal relationships play out we experience the film as two acts, the two sisters, Justine &amp; Claire, but it is not two chapters, it is one relationship, at its core it might even be EVERY relationship. Kirsten got Best Actress @ Cannes for this, but its not enough ... I wish the crew the best of luck this coming awards season (and pack some meat on the blu-ray please!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did you do to me von Trier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is especially for those who are prone to depression and, of course, melancholia. After seeing Antichrist just two weeks ago, I must admit I was not ready to see another von Trier movie since his movies are very powerful and they stay with me for a very, very long time. But I was very curios at the same time. Even though I sometimes wish I hadn't watched the uncut version, Antichrist had the best cinematography I have ever seen and I wanted to see more of it. Besides the thrilling story, stop motion scenes and those colors just amazed me and I also love the way he shoots, not like a shaky camera as some say, but like wondering eyes, and anyway, I got what I wanted. And more.With the prologue, von Trier began his magic and during those two hours, I did not blink for a second. I was completely in the story, having lost the track of time/space, whatever. At the wedding we meet several characters, important for revealing more of the two sisters. But in the end, we see only couple of them facing with death.It is, I can say, the only movie which made me feel sorry for myself because of the character I sympathized with. When the movie ended and the lights were back on, I was in no way ready to move. I had melancholia all over. I still cannot say if I was feeling a relief or emptiness. Be careful of timing, but certainly see it. No regrets</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melancholia is mesmerizing from beginning to end! It will leave viewers reeling in their seats! You will find yourself captivated by the cinematography and your own personal interpretation of the film, and you may find, as I did, that interpretations vary. Simply put, this film floored Me and haunts Me, a film rarely does that. It is the best I've seen yet from Lars Von Trier, it's more than a movie, it's a brilliant work of art. The hopes, fragility, vulnerability and isolation of a person within mankind is explored here in vivid imagery and empathy. Again, the visual aspects are STUNNING! The acting is superbly perfect, I can't make complaint.The story and direction is wonderful too. Not a love story nor quite a "doomsday" action flick, it's something else entirely. It's a provoking drama / psychological thriller as somber as the title implies. It begins a bit slow, but the threat and drama increases. The characters are well developed, and do precisely what they're there to do...make you speculate and wonder more. This is one film you will NOT want to miss! Most amazing film I've seen in years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another powerful LVT movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going to see a film by LVT is always an experience. When sitting in the movie theater waiting for the film to start, you know that you're in for an adventure that will leave long- lasting impressions, and you never really know what to expect and how changed you will be when leaving the room.This film revolves around the theme of Death. The moon that finally crashes into the Earth, seems actually to be a symbol of death. And the 2 main characters, also epitomize 2 different types of extreme human reactions to the issue of death: those who choose to ignore it (like Claire and her husband, fooling themselves until the last minute in an endless series of petty considerations and even building fake evidence to support their blindness), and those who have an acute consciousness about death in their daily lives (Justine). But this is the ambiguity of human life: whatever you do, you are on a journey to death. Living a life full-throttle on the one hand without taking a step back to think implies having a strong complicity with death, and perhaps, this blindness also means that you are already dead to some extent? Just like all the other characters of the film that seem lifeless and empty because they are trapped in their daily human lives (the mother, the father, the boss, the husband?). But, Justine's obsession with death on the other hand is also preventing her to fully live the most important moments of her life, and is thus already "half-dead" also? This is where the "Nature is evil" or "Earth is evil" theme (that already was central in Antichrist)comes back.The film is also built around these two female characters, weaving a psychological intrigue in parallel of the planet looming bigger: Justine who was scared and obsessed by the planet while Claire was playing down her fears with rational advice in the first part of the film, is now taking the upper hand during the second part while Justine is overwhelmed by the thought of dying.But this is it for the "philosophical" content of the film. Perhaps more importantly, this film is to be seen as a work of art in itself. LVT is someone who experiments new things, he is an artist. Watching the film is a bit as magical as reading a Bradbury book. He creates a very interesting and unusual sci-fi background to a social and philosophical reflection, although you could see it as a very interesting and unusual social and psychological background to a sci-fi story. And these two aspects also alternate: in the first part of the film, there is no mention of the "planet" and the focus intentionally loses itself in the boring details of a wedding party, thereby highlighting the platitude of our lives. But, in the second part of the film, the Science Fiction feel comes very much to the foreground. The film is also visually beautiful, (as it was also for Antichrist), as if LVT was always in search for some aesthetic perfection, that also includes a subtle but strong play on atmospheres.It is hard to remain insensitive to this film. Like it or not, LVT films leave their print on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the one thing of which you are most certain?. . . certain beyond your wildest dreams? your worst nightmares? Justine is getting married. A wonderful wedding. Best wedding planner. And as she lifts her head to enjoy the kisses of her groom we sense the sparkle of love entering what almost might be a world of darkness. Kirsten Dunst comes of age as an actress in this finely sculptured character as a successful career woman, enjoying a magnificent day in all its finery, where no expense has been spared. Yet somehow we can sense, in this beautifully interiorised performance, that the tinsel of the outer world means little to Justine. It is not that she is some new-age unmaterialistic hippy: on the contrary, her powerful mind commands a high salary as a tagline creator for a powerful advertising concern.The truth is that Justine suffers from clinical depression. A disease with which our director, Lars von Trier, is also afflicted. Yet does the film tell us how depressing the world is and ask us to feel sorry for its leading protagonist? Not at all. While von Trier has used his own experience to create a vivid reconstruction that goes beyond sympathy or melodrama, the film is ultimately a celebration of Justine's strength and inner clarity. Her non-attachment to the trappings of happiness ? things in which most people would seem to find such joy ? is almost Zen-like in its conviction. Why do we go to such lengths to find meaning in transitory and superficial sense-gratification? Love, the deep and wonderful communication of one person with another, can't be bought or bartered. Yet we spend our lives building castles of sand ? even as expressions of 'love' ? and if Justine can't have the real thing in each touch, she certainly doesn't want to settle for lust dressed up in lace.Von Trier is becoming increasingly operatic in his films. The theme music from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, both as a soundtrack and, by implication, the doomed love it's saga represents, is a perfect setting for this grand vision of life and meaning. The leitmotif reminds us that, beneath everything, there is a more serious theme at work. If death is the only real certainty of life, this is symbolically illustrated in the second half of Melancholia. For someone who is deeply depressed, death is a mere detail. But for others, it is the worst of all possible eventualities. To get the point across in the most vivid way, and also show how Justine's illness gives her a strength denied ordinary mortals, von Trier turns his film into an end-of-the-world movie. A rogue planet (aptly named Melancholia) hurtles through space and, having narrowly missed some of the other planets, is on a collision course for Earth. As the actual collision has been previewed in the film's opening scenes, we already know that last minute intervention (for instance, to save the earth Hollywood-style) is not likely.As supporting characters struggle, and eventually lose the battle to convince themselves that everything is OK, Justine warmly embraces the development. There are two nude scenes ? when one might say that our heroine is not only naked but that her soul is stripped bare. One is when her sister, trying to care for a 'mentally unbalanced' Justine, is trying to persuade her to have a bath. The wretchedness of her sorrow is profound: having endured the symbolic show of an overblown wedding reception, she has lost the one thing that meant something to her. It is stark contrast to her self-assured second half of the film, where her calmness is like something I have occasionally witnessed in gently smiling hospice patients (who know they are about to die). The second instance is more beautiful, although completely unglamorised. As other characters swither between denial, fear and bravado ("Let's have a glass of wine outside"), Justine calmly enjoys the epiphany. Identifying with the earth about to meet its nemesis, she bares herself to the onslaught of the coming planet in a gesture that finds her sprawled in adoration on a hillside.Von Trier's controversial furore at the film's Cannes premiere ensured wider distribution than might otherwise be expected for an art-house offering as dark as Bunuel. This maybe misleads some people into seeing a film with the false expectation of something more mainstream. As one teenager exclaimed, walking out of the multiplex screening I went to, "I've never sat through such gash in my whole life." But to cinephiles more attuned to von Trier's style of filmmaking, it probably represents his greatest triumph since Dogville. One could even imagine allusions to Justine's name with the eponymous novel of de Sade, an abused protagonist who accepts approaching death. Raw, original and uncompromising, yet also a work of uplifting beauty, Melancholia is an end-of-the-world movie the likes of which you have never seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb start, then mediocre, after that just sadistically boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of Lars von Trier's Melancholia is just amazing. A series of truly excellent slow-motion images from Earth and space plus an overwhelming (and loud) soundtrack. We learn that a large planet Melancholia is going to crush the Earth, and some shots are a homage to Kubrick's 2001. A scene of a horse falling extremely slowly backwards is astonishing image, just pure bliss. I'm sure I almost wept for the beauty of it. The first 3 minutes are a work of art, especially when seen in cinema.After that we get to see lavish wedding, partly humorous, partly satire, somehow very usual in the tradition of dogma. I think this part was well made, you see some interesting characters and the tempo is nice. Even Kirsten Dunst acts OK, but nothing more. Some of the scenes are sadly just unbelievable (bride's quickie with unknown guest, groom leaving bride that night etc.) but you get along with them.After this part, the pain starts.The last part of film is just sadistically boring, like seeing Ingmar Bergman's drama on slow-play video. I am sure, that von Trier made this part as irritating as possible, because you really start to hate the characters, really hoping that the planet Melancholia will gain speed and get them killed. Dialogue is very frustrating, it goes nowhere, and the scenes just drag on and on. This whole part could be 30 or 45 minutes shorter and even then this movie would be close to 2 hours.Antichrist was a disturbing yet powerful experience, and Melancholia could have been the second true masterpiece of von Trier, but the hellish last hour of boredom it has, is just a waste. See this film anyway, for the beginning is marvelous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Read the full review at http://nickplusmovies.blogspot.com)Many of you who have seen Lars von Trier's notoriously disturbing "Antichrist" are probably curious to find out exactly in what direction the director is headed with his films. Does his latest effort, "Melancholia", measure up to his other work? Does he explore new terrains here or does he continue to aim for the usual edginess seen in his most controversial crafts? Answers to these questions can be found in what's written below. So, you kind of have no other choice but to read on...The opening sequence of the film is magical and sublime. Lars von Trier toys with our minds by making us sit through what appears to be a series of insignificant, nonlinear shots; simple bits and pieces arranged in a dreamlike progression. There is no dialogue or sound in this sequence, but rather powerful classical music (Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde") that does a swell job accompanying some of the most gorgeous slow-motion photography I have ever seen. Lars is teasing us with all of these nonsensical shots; this spectacular, operatic prologue is really just a sneak-peek or preview, setting the tone for all the bizarre sights we will soon come to discover in this motion picture. Did this opening ever blow me away! And you should have seen the faces of the other audience members throughout these first 10 minutes! Most of them looked as bewildered as any human being would be while watching the famous ending of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". If you've seen a Lars von Trier film before, you probably have a pretty good idea of what his style is when it comes to composing shots. When he isn't shooting in slow-motion, he employs his trademark Dogme 95 influenced unsteady, "moving camera" cinematography, with tight close- ups and recurrent jump cuts that make for more of a mesmerizing, absorbing cinematic experience. If you're new to the man's work-- and especially if you're a fan of smooth, subtle shots-- you'll probably be irritated by this. But trust me, this unique filmmaking vision should grow on you with time-- or rather, with more viewings of his movies. (Come to think of it, the only gliding shots I can remember are the helicopter shots of Justine and Claire horseback riding on a beautiful, foggy, countryside road.)"Melancholia" is breathtakingly beautiful all throughout. Most of it is shot on location in what must be Denmark, Sweden, France, or Germany (how am I supposed to know in which country it was filmed!). But somehow, in these natural conditions, the lighting is able to be fiddled around with to achieve an aesthetic brilliance nearly unmatched by any other film. I can recall the particular beauty of the nighttime scenes shot outside of the estate, where the tall, trimmed hedges cast a line of shadows over the well manicured lawn. The first thing that came to mind then was Alain Resnais' "Last Year at Marienbad". Furthermore, it's obvious that a fair deal of CGI was used to transform the landscape and atmosphere (mostly the sky) into something out-of-this-world, yet it's so well done you wonder how anyone could have accomplished such visual perfection.On to matters of greater importance (at least, in your eyes): the acting! Is it possible to describe how mind-blowing Kirsten Dunst's performance is? Perhaps it isn't, but I'll give it my best shot. I've never been much of a fan of her work, but by the end of this film, I had a new appreciation for this fine, young actress. I think she owes credit to her director, though, because obviously it isn't a coincidence that he always gets the most outstanding performances out of his female leads. For the first part of the film, you really get to see Justine's level of emotional vulnerability thanks to Dunst's spot-on portrayal of her character. I think she gets better as the film progresses into the second part, though. When she plays a woman in a state of deep depression, you could swear she was actually going through a hard patch in real life. She makes her character feel so apart from the rest of humanity; so aware of things that she has purposely disconnected herself from reality. I wouldn't be surprised if she snagged an acting nomination at the upcoming Academy Awards.As for the rest of the cast-- I'm not just saying this to sound proper-- everyone does a fine job at getting into character. Some remarkable performances would be from Alexander Skarsgard as the husband who isn't quite familiar with his wife's distant attitude, Charlotte Gainsbourg (who would be the runner-up to Dunst in my book) as Justine's loving, nervous wreck of a sister, and Kiefer Sutherland as Claire's continuously aggravated husband, who happens to be the one to deliver all the comic relief in the film. Even the actors and actresses I didn't name have glowing performances in the film. "Melancholia" could almost be placed alongside "Network" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" for having some of the best acting from an entire cast."Melancholia" is a one-of-a-kind, visionary film that uses gripping storytelling to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. It manages to be an extremely intense, sensational movie-watching experience without relying on the same old formula of most apocalyptic films. I love how it doesn't get too caught up in its own imagined version of the end of the world, but instead chooses to focus on subjects involving humans in a much smaller, deeper, and more personal scale (such as the troubles of dysfunctional families). This is without a doubt one of Lars von Trier's greatest works, as well as one of my favorite films of the year. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia- simply excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loads of beautiful and mesmerizing pictures fill the screen at first. As I did you might wonder "hm what is this all about"? But don't worry, you figure it out later. Part 1 of the movie (Justine): It is a cheerful start somewhat nice with this beautiful and expensive wedding between Justine (Dunst) and Michael(Skarsg?rds), they seem like a good match, but we get the feeling that something isn't right, the sister Claire(Gainsbourg)keeps asking her "is this the right thing"? "Is this really what you want?" Soon we find out- that this is not about what she want, it is more a question about "Is she capable of living a perfectly normal life, husband and wife"? As we kind of get the idea that this is exactly what she'd hope for, it is sad to know she fails drastically! And that because of her melancholia which is taking over the control of her. Well she is literally a very ill woman.The wedding is canceled, and the sick Justine get's to live with her sister who we follow in part 2. (Claire): We get introduced to this huge, blue and very realistic planet which is coming towards the earth, Melancholia, which Claire and her husband studied for a while. Claire is very afraid, that life on earth soon might be over, while her husband assures her that it won't happen. And along with her fear, with the planet getting closer each day, she's also struggling with her sick sis, who is now so ill of her Melancholia that she's incapable of lifting her legs into the bath tup. Justine's acceptance of the melancholia destined to destroy the earth, is just a methaphor for her acceptance of her own melancholia taking over. As well as Trier's intention with the sister, opposite of her sis, is very afraid of not living life on earth. I don't want to reveal the rest of what's going to happen, so I'd better stop. But you definitely get an overpowering experience with this film, sometimes you feel so much with the characters in it, that when they tear up, you do too, and when they suffer from hypoxia so do you. Excellent plot, excellent acting, excellent MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dunst is brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier like always delivers another impressive and stunning piece of work into his film collection as a director. The special effects aren't 3-D like, but that isn't a bad thing at all. It is precisely his style to reel in the audience by doing as little as he can to impress, he doesn't overdue it, which is really good. Kirsten Dunst as the depressed bride Justine on her wedding day is simply amazing. Her performance is bewitching and is exceptional. I have always thought of her as a great actress, it took her awhile, but with the right part she did it. Many thought that when the Spiderman franchise was canned in mid 2010 her career would fade away with little parts, that isn't true here. Dunst in my opinion delivers her best performance out of Justine, so convinced was I after this movie with her serene and fierce performance as the depressed bride that I recommend this movie to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Nazi Apology from Everybody's Favorite Apologist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I'm beating a very dead horse, but since "Melancholia" was inspired by Oswald Spengler's "The Decline of the West" I guess I'm not too far off the mark. After all, the important thing to know about Spengler is that he wasn't writing about a "decline" in the manner of stock-market crash or the influence of "foreign" ideas on Western Culture. He was talking about the decay of the dead body of Western Culture. As far as Spengler was concerned, Western Culture "died" in the nineteenth century, when it reached its apex, and we have all been attending to the corpse since then.The title (Melancholia) comes from a cartoon by Olaf Gulbransson entitled "Melancholia" and featuring Spengler, looking like a Buddha, considering a planet or sun whereupon the image of a nude young woman on the back of a...some kind of animal is superimposed. Wild, huh? Spengler's link to Nazi's is nihilism. The Nazi's were always looking for nihilism in respectable intellectual work in order to appropriate it and use it as justification for their death cult. Nihilism is a justification for barbarism and terror and cruelty and just about anything you want, as long as you insist that their are only two legitimate responses to the end of the world, or the decline of the West, or to one's own death. Those two responses are despair (now called "depression") or rage. Given that we are all going to die, the Nazi "philosopher" provides us with a choice--either meekly submit to death like a loser or stand up, bravely, and throw oneself into the fury of pure instinct and native cruelty. Two choices. Choose one now.This is a very, very false dichotomy (of course) but it appeals to people who have lost their faith and are afraid of aging and death. It appeals to "modern" people especially. So it's dangerous. Von Trier should be ashamed of himself for making a movie about it but he is, apparently, above and beyond shame. He's depressed. Poor guy.The film "Melancholia" provides a series of tableaux. Everything is a metaphor, but not a Freudian one (I swear, if Freud hadn't existed the Nazi's would have had to invent him to hide behind). The wedding is, of course, the great corpse of The West. It is stinking to high heaven. The bride, which is all of us, is almost killed outright by the smell of decay. The stupidity. The selfishness. The lack of love.We spend some time, as the film progresses, learning how to "deal" with the calamity. It would take a director with more courage than Von Trier has to leave out the approaching planet, but without the planet we have people who are just wallowing in depression. Where do they go from that? I think the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky already explored the idea of burning down the house in his film "Sacrifice," so that's out.Anyway, Von Trier wants us to understand that there are only two choices (otherwise we don't have a Nazi world-view, and I'll give Von Trier credit for having a consistent, Nazi, world-view). You either fight like a cornered mink or wallow in crying like a baby. Your choice. Engage in a blood orgy or be a mewling little punk. Make a choice. Quick like a bunny! CHOOSE! The key line in the movie is when the Kirsten Dunst character replies to the suggestion that they sit quietly, sip some wine and sing a song (sounds like a church service) with the furious reply "I think your idea is a piece of (censored)." That's telling 'em! Religion is for old ladies! Now imagine them standing there, having worked hard in the gym to combat aging, having worked hard at exterminating anyone who might detract from the beauty of the moment, having worked hard at making themselves into "hard" and brutal people, covered in tattoos, dressed in black leather astride large motorcycles and flexing their hard-won muscles at the approaching planet, and then giving the fascist/Roman salute as the flames engulf them, knowing that they will die young and never grow old.Hilarious! Even Lars didn't have the nerve to show that. So, instead, we get a tipi. No motorcycle. No flexing abs. No grotesque tattoos. Just a tipi. Straight out of Karl May. (Look it up).I will admit that I enjoy the films of Lars Von Trier. They give me something to hate, and that's what's wrong with them. They breed hatred. But of course they do. They're ideologically Nazi material and they should inspire you to become a meaner, nastier, more violent person. Now look around. There are all these "intellectuals" declaring what a genius Lars is. I admit that he is a genius. And there resides the tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a planet is headed on a crash course towards Earth what do you do? You lay down in a pond full of lily pads, that's what you do according to Lars von Trier's new apocalyptic art film, Melancholia. Kirsten Dunst stars as Justine, a young woman whose wedding reception is not going entirely as planned. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays her sister, Claire. The film follows the relationship of these two sisters as they prepare for a planet called Melancholia to crash into the earth, destroying everything. It begins on the night of Justine's wedding reception as things slowly start to fall apart due to the impending doom heading for Earth. The film is a visual wonder, yet the story isn't as thorough as you would expect.Melancholia is a unique film that chronicles the end of the world in its own very special way. There is a lot going on in this film with the story surrounding Justine and Claire and how these characters evolve as Melancholia gets closer and closer to Earth. Yet, this film seems to boil down to nothing more than two sisters and their reactions to the end of the world and the way they cope with it. I searched for hidden symbolism and creative nuance that would make this story more than that, but I was not successful in my search. I really feel like there was no more to this film than what you can easily make of it. Perhaps there doesn't need to be and my expectations were just set too high, but with all the strange occurrences shrouded in ambiguity I expected a lot more.Yet, despite the lackluster effect of Melancholia, it is actually a very fascinating film to watch. It has a superb visual quality and a powerful soundtrack to go along with it. The film opens with a beautiful symphony washed over a collection of slow motion frames that don't make a lot of sense at the time, but by the end of the film it all makes sense. This haunting montage also throws in glorious shots of space, in the vein of Tree of Life, ending with a moving outer space shot of Melancholia crashing into Earth.After these wondrous 10-15 minutes we are introduced to all of our main characters and the visual style turns into a hand-held shaky cam style that exemplifies a kind of fly on the wall perspective. The style here switches from slow and tense to jumpy and shaky, full of quick cuts and sporadic edits which do indeed make for an interesting watch. But this style is drawn out so long and so pointlessly at times that it doesn't stay interesting for the entire film, which clocks in unnecessarily at over two hours.Melancholia is a memorable film with its own style that warrants attention. Lars von Trier has definitely made the film he wanted to make in his own special way, and I would say he did a fine job at making an interesting film. I just feel like my expectations were not fulfilled when this film, emotionally, didn't strike me at all. It's slow, mundane, and even trivial at points. I didn't get the sense that there was a lot going on here, even though it seems like there should have been. Melancholia is a good film, but nothing incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thinking mans film if I may be so bold?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the other superficial reviews I felt compelled to write.This movie only makes sense in its context. That context being the imminent end-of-the-earth (as we know it (my sub-context)). This is so widely known that I do not cast this as a spoiler.If there is any fault this is it, that the context is pre-set up. Rather it should dawn on the audience as it does literally indeed, on the protagonists. This would require a 2nd viewing, but given the vagaries of commerce I am sure the "bean" counters insisted on the opening sequences, which weren't bad anyhoo.Many write about the acting, the photography and direction et. al. but these are mere baubles adorning the concept. In many ways I was struck by this film being the anti-thesis of the Tree Of Life, a film I would have rated negatively if possible.Back to the concept ... the concept of a cataclysmic event ... the concept of an important event ... the concept of a significant event ... How would the powers that be not extend their existence for 1 iota more? by lying and cheating? wasn't the Vietnam war always in imminent threat of success? isn't the war in Afganistan always being won? hasn't Iraq been a victory? Likewise, no that world is not going to hit this world. Lying is supposed to be the 1st sign of intelligence.So dutifully the Amercan torturer falls on his sword (Sorry I like to be cryptic, as no spoilers what?).I could go on and on about the thoughts stimulated by this movie in my brain but I'll spare you that. Clearly Lars is a thinking man: I thank him for his sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MELANCHOLIA (Lars von Trier, 2011) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being on something of a recent/award-winning movie frame-of-mind, I decided to check out von Trier's notorious latest offering. Though the film hardly provoked the controversy that met his previous outing, ANTICHRIST (2009), he went even further down the tasteless route during the Cannes Film Festival press conference (earlier, his dedicating ANTICHRIST to Andrei Tarkovsky and the egomaniacal assertion that he is the world's greatest director elicited ridicule and boos from those present!) by making a half-assed and totally irrelevant apology for Hitler's behavior by claiming to understand him, apart from confessing that he is himself a Nazi! The reaction of the organizers was to ban him from the Festival for life ? which, on the night of the awards ceremony, ironically bestowed the Best Actress prize to Kirsten Dunst (coincidentally, her co-star Charlotte Gainsbourg had been similarly rewarded for ANTICHRIST itself)! Considering that it was competing at Cannes with Terrence Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE (2011), it is odd to note how the two film-makers became seemingly obsessed with the solar system and how, presumably, it governs and affects our lives. However, here it is actively incorporated into the narrative rather than used as a reference point (like Malick did) ? since, firstly, Kiefer Sutherland's character is an amateur astronomer, Dunst apparently senses the oncoming doom and, suddenly overcome by the titular temperament 'retreats' from life (at least for a good part of the duration), alienating even her husband on their wedding day(!), while Gainsbourg (Sutherland's wife and Dunst's elder sister) gradually turns into a veritable wreck over her, as it turns out, justified terror of the apocalypse (brought on by the collision of a fictional planet, also named Melancholia, with Earth).The film (running a hefty 136 minutes) is divided into two parts, named after Dunst and Gainsbourg's respective characters. The former details Dunst's matrimonial shenanigans: these also see her unnerving Gainsbourg by arriving late at the party, paid for by "filthy rich" Sutherland, offending both employer Stellan Skarsgard and wedding planner Udo Kier (who literally blots out his client by hiding his face every time he passes her by!), and cheat on her brand-new spouse, played by Skarskgard's real-life son Alexander, with a boy she has just met. This is not to mention the mutual insults hurled at one another during the festivities by Dunst and Gainsbourg's estranged parents, played by Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt (who seems to have grown an annoying fondness for two unattractive female guests both of whom happen to be called Betty!). The latter section, then, revolves around the end-of-the-world vicissitudes ? where, taking a leaf out of fellow purveyor-of-misery Ingmar Bergman, von Trier has Dunst and Gainsbourg slowly exchange roles, as we see the former regain composure (if not motivation) while the latter descends deeper into paranoia! The irony is that Sutherland, who had continually tried to reassure her that Melancholia's course has been methodically-charted, commits suicide and selfishly leaves none of the pills which Gainsbourg had bought for her personal use as a way out to his immediate family, when he realizes that all his calculations had been futile and illusory! While the film contains some mild nudity by Dunst, it is nothing like what one had come to expect from this director (ANTICHRIST being a prime example), so that what had critics and audiences murmuring here (apart from the fact that the result was deemed a minor work!) was the surreal opening (where, amid footage of the all-important constellation, Dunst ? already in her wedding gown ? is showered with dead fowl and subsequently caught up in assorted vines, whereas Gainsbourg sinks into quicksand as she crosses a golf course while hanging on to her child!) set to Wagner's instantly-recognizable strains of "Tristan &amp; Isolde" and, appropriately enough its polar opposite, the swift concluding depiction of Armageddon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a difficult movie to watch and then a difficult movie to forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: Finally i saw some great work by Lars Von Trier that truly impressed me. i really like his vision, his creativity and his originality. i haven't seen much of his work but heard a lot about them. i was truly disappointed by his last movie Antichrist which was truly a near mess movie, i don't mind violence or violent sexual scenes but he went too far to achieve something that wasn't meant to. but very satisfied and in time very impressed by what he achieved through this wonderful movie Melancholia. though it is not a flawless attempt but still a work of art and near perfection. i think it is his nature to not make flawless movies. this was a movie i couldn't wait to watch once i heard earlier this year that it is coming with this star cast based on a planet collision theory and concerns with the psychology of characters. i knew he was up for something greater than his previous work and he did proved that here thankfully. This movie is not just a Sci-Fi movie but more of a character drama in response and in the lights of all that was happening in a Sci-Fi premise. it looked like a dramatic as well comic Sci-Fi opera with grand visuals and outstanding music. one thing for sure that Von Trier is a filmmaker whose movies makes you incredibly tensed and uncomfortable like a lot, which is not a bad thing at all and shows the power of a great filmmaker and i believe he is but this work has not been taken the way it should have.He does things off screen too as everyone knows about that Press Conference at Cannes drama or as i called it "A Dark stand up comedy", i don't know what was on his mind or whatever but it didn't hurt or effected me at all and nor should everyone else. i would be really disappointed if that would overshadows his work, that should never happen. but anyways this movie was brilliant, well thought and outstandingly original. it does reminds you of a movie like Black Swan but completely different and opposite and still stays as original as was Swan. The idea behind this movie was when he himself was in depression and heard something from the therapist that Depressed people acts very calm in tensed or difficult situations because they already have experienced it and knows whats coming. he applied this one line into his entire movie so beautifully that you just admire him with open heart and gets stunned by the underlying genius, creativity and originality. You will see the end of the movie in the very first scene where two planets collide making audience calm throughout with still that basic tension and experiencing the movie as experienced by the character, which is something great.Performances are so great in this movie. first of all Kristen Dunst in a role no one ever thought about her doing that, she is the one that truly impresses you. she is pitch perfect in her character. she won at Cannes and i hope she gets an Oscar nod but i do realize it is tough for a Indi movie to achieve that but there have been exceptions a lot. she deserves all the praise and awards she gets as in a year where most of the movies and performances disappointed immensely, she is a breath of fresh air. in every scene and every glimpse, she just grabs your attention and never lets go. it is like observing a very deep painting by some great artist, the more you observe, the more you dig deep into her psych. she was outstanding and impressed me very much. on the other hand i don't think people should totally ignore Charlotte Gainsbourgh who really blew me away by her performance, i think she deserves equal praise that Dunst is getting and i will be rotting for her to get or at least get recognized for the Supporting actress category. there are moments in the second half where she completely shadows Justine's character and her performance also because oh her calmness but still the acts like two sides of something. impressive and bravo performances by both of them which is one great thing about this outstanding movie. i also liked the brief screen presences of others like Charlotte Rampling, John Hurt and Stellan Skarsg?rd but i also thought it was Kiefer Sutherland's best performance though i haven't seen him much. this movie has spectacular visuals, superb camera work. it feels like to watch this movie in an IMAX theater or something because it looks so good. brilliant cinematography which is one of its kind this year. exquisite art direction and visual effects that just looks so lovely and not overdone at all. the opening and the ending scenes are truly something i would never forget in my life. Direction was great though screenplay and plots stumble a bit under its own dramatic pressure which never feels so bad and does not however effects the entire movie.Rating: 4/5 B+Full Review On: HollywoodAndMe.Blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Performances and Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia (2011) *** (out of 4) Lars von Trier's latest film centers on sisters Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and their relationship in the week leading up to the possible end of the world. The first portion of the film deals with the wedding of Justine and how she slowly begins to lose her mind during the process. The second part of the film focuses on Claire as she slowly begins to crack when it appears that another planet is about to hit Earth. MELANCHOLIA isn't going to hit with as much controversy as many of the director's earlier works but I think it's safe to say that the meaning of the story will be debated for years. I'm sure you could show this movie to a hundred different people and each one would have their own ideas on what the film was trying to say but I'll take the easy way out and say that only von Trier really knows what was going on here as I'm quite certain that the surreal universes he puts on film are just images in his mind. As with most of his films, the visual style of this thing is certainly something very special and unique and this is especially true during the scenes where this other planet gets closer to Earth. There's a scene at night when the characters are looking at this planet close to the moon and the image is quite breathtaking. Another memorable scene (and not just for Dunst's nudity) is when the Justine character is lying by a river as the light from the planet hits her. I think the story itself is a fairly bland one as the Dunst character is the crazy one with Gainsbourg being the normal one until the planet comes closer and the roles reverse. I was a little surprised to see how "simple" the story is but I think the director makes up for this with the strong visual look, the haunting music score and of course the very strong performances. Dunst picked up the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival and it's certainly her best performance to date. It's getting some talk as being one of the best performances of the year but I'd fall a bit short of saying that since it's not even the best performance in the film. With that said, Dunst has certainly delivered a very strong performance and it's good to see because hopefully she can take her career into a new direction, digging into some deeper roles. For my money it's Gainsbourg gives the best performance and especially in the second half of the film when she slowly begins to lose her mind. You can't help but watch the actress and feel as if you're really seeing someone in terror of dying. The supporting cast includes strong work from Kiefer Sutherland, Alexander Skarsgard, John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling and Udo Kier. At 136-minutes the film does go on a tad bit too long but you have to once again give von Trier credit for doing something original, quite daring and challenging. In a time where the word "art" is missing from movies it's good to see someone at least trying to do something special. MELANCHOLIA falls quite short of being a great movie but it's certainly well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(This Review Contains Extensive SPOILERS)I can only review this film by discussing all of it, including the finale. But, if you have not seen it, you truly should. It is a very emotional experience. I had to stay seated for a number of minutes afterward.This is truly a magnificent movie of incredible power. The ending will leave you awed, emotional and spellbound. This is an ending along the lines of "2001: A Space Odyssey" where you feel totally transported by what you have just seen.The film's opening montage foreshadows all of what will come, but in an impressionistic way. After the opening, you already know that you are on a level of film almost never seen.There are two halves. The story proceeds through the slowly-falling- apart wedding reception half slowly and deliberately. By the end of the first half, we are left with characters in various states of disrepair. The second half is all about the planet Melancholia and whether it will hit Earth or not. When we find out it will, the characters all have to find their way of dealing with it. Towards the end, however, they are unchanged. Justine is still as unsympathetic as ever. Claire is still crying, unable to accept her fate. It is only in the final minute that you feel a sense of coming together by both as they sit with Claire's son Leo in their "Secret Cave."And, it is that final image that truly stuns. The conceit of "The Secret Cave" is so quiet and beautiful, allowing the child to have the only peace of the three. And, as we see Melancholia rise, the winds howl, the Earth destroyed and the screen faded to black and to quiet, we are genuinely shaken by what we have seen.This is such a unique film. von Trier has made a truly magnificent film that pushes the medium beyond its boundaries. What you experience is something that transcends film and goes to your very soul.Highly Recommended! (Be prepared for a very emotional experience.)10 Stars Out of 10 **********</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Von Trier after movies as Breaking The Waves and the Kingdome series his work has not been without let downs, as the supremely boring Dogville and Bjorks all too good, impossible to like -personna in Dancer In The Dark.Melancholia however is not a let down. It is more of a psyche penetrating state of daydream. It's Von Trier at his best. When he manages to put his understanding of psychology into images and actors he is a true filmmaker. In Melancholia all this comes across in an even pace that doesn't halt or ring bad at a single note. Not all is understandable in logical terms, but very so in emotional or perhaps archetypal ones. Kirsten Dunst is fantastic in the way that her simplistic, minimalistic way of acting gives the role limitless depth and I find myself constantly wanting to know more about the person she portrays.In these days and times the theme itself is straight at the center, the end of the world must be a theme awakened in everybody's mind, at least the clever rightfully scared ones...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that literally takes your breath away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow.. and 20 to 30 seconds of total silence in the theater until you finally realize you have to breath. That is what happened at the end of the movie to all people watching this latest masterpiece by Lars von Trier.This is not an easy movie to digest. It will make you think about it for the next hours and even days.The first ten minutes of the movie are like watching a Dali painting. The music of the Prelude from Tristan and Isolde by Wagner adds undoubtedly to the mood. I realized my hands were cold like ice after that part of the movie. Then you have about 10 minutes to relax while seeing a romantic and funny scene after which Von Trier sucks you right into the deep, dark places of the human mind.Part 2 is even more impressive with the threat which becomes more imminent every minute. The way everyone deals with the situation is so disturbing, so real life.. There is no escape, nowhere to go, no way to protect you loved ones. Von Trier does a perfect job to show this despair.Apart from the intriguing story the movie is a piece of art. The scene with the moon and Melancholia showing yellow and blue light on the grass, the horses, the hail falling on the golf course.. wow..OK, as you might read I am very impressed by this movie. Great acting, art-like images, great music and an intriguing story. I cannot recall another movie that has had this effect on me in a long time.10/10.. no doubt about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting visual and psychological experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier has never disappointed me with his polarising but deeply interesting films. After several triumphant efforts ('Breaking the Waves', 'Dancer in the Dark' and 'Dogville')- films that can be called masterpieces-he gave us the rather underwhelming 'Manderlay' and after that the highly interesting and quite shocking 'Antichrist'. With 'Melancholia', Lars decides to settle down and deal with his own demons in a different, much subtler way. Though the film deals with several script problems-for instance the film is divided into two main chapters which feel a bit disconnected and the main character's arc is underdeveloped in several occasions-, it offers a beautiful canvas of emotions and visually breathtaking imagery.The prologue of the film along with the very last sequence left me completely breathless. That was poetry on the big screen. Strength beyond emotions. Chilling and and mesmerising, shocking yet beautiful. The film follows Justine's (Kirsten Dunst) growing depression through the night of her wedding party, as she eventually collapses emotionally. Meanwhile, the planet Melancholia is approaching the Earth, causing uncontrollable anxiety to Justine's sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who deals with the possibility of the earth's destruction in a totally different way than her depressed sister. Kirsten Dunst gives the best performance of her career. Subtle, poignant and nuanced, Kirsten dives into her character and becomes this depressed emotionally destroyed woman. She's absolutely magnetic. I've always admired Kirsten. She has given some very underrated performances in films like 'The Virgin Suicides', 'All Good Things' and 'Marie Antoinette'. In 'Melancholia', she manages to captivate the audience with the strength of her performance. Meanwhile, Charlotte Gainsbourg keeps not disappointing with the maturity of her body of work. Though she doesn't reach the level of brilliance she achieved in 'Antichrist', she gives another beautiful performance, becoming a wreck by the end of the film, showing the contrast between her character and Justine's in a very impressive way. Congratulations to both ladies.The cinematography is brilliant, Wagner's Tristan and Isolde prelude is mesmerising and elegiac and there is some haunting harmony and peacefulness in the film that's actually building to a breathtaking finale.As I mentioned before, the script faces some several problems. The two halves definitely feel disconnected, the film doesn't surprise you in the end (I expect more twists, knowing Lars) and the characters feel a bit underdeveloped. That's my main grip with the film. Lovely supporting turns by John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling, Keifer Sutherland, Stellan and Alexander Skarsgard, but the two leading ladies are the ones who steal the show. It's a poetic-yet flawed-and beautiful study of the human soul, refreshing the typical 'disaster movie' genre and focusing on the characters rather than on the 'disaster' itself. A worthy effort, another important film in Lars Von Trier's already significant filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 hours watching annoying immoral unstable people....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all I'm no teenager who only likes transformers... i actually like a lot of slower movies but! i had 2 major problems with this movie 1 i had absolutely 0 sympathy for the main characters as i mentioned in the title they where pretty annoying,very unstable and so wrong with morality 2 having such main characters... other than being depressed,they actually doing absolutely...NOTHING! 5min in the movie i started to dislike the main character...she arrives hours(!) late at her on wedding,but feeling any guilt by letting so many people who're loving her wait for hours,Nooo... she found it necessary to go first hug her horse and let the guests wait a little longer... at the wedding its pretty fast clear that she is surrounded by people who love her very very dear (with the exception of the mother perhaps) and how she repays their love... by showing no respect at all, been missing all the time,cheating (!) her husband with some loser,insulting her boss who actually promotes her to a fancy position as a wedding gift so rude he has no option to fire her...torture her horse and insulting every single person who's actually kind to her.. her sister has better morals but boy is she unstable and weak... then finally keither Sutherland character was the only one who i liked just until he appeared to be the biggest coward of them all by taking his own life abandoning wife and child... so for me it was 2hours plus seeing characters i so dislike while they're actually doing absolutely nothing most of the time... at the end i was actually so glad that melancholia planet hit earth and everybody died...seriously i was happy... 2 10? hours of my life wasted only recommendable for those who like what i just described,otherwise avoid it like the plague</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good, But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Triers always presents interesting, often compelling twisted dramas. There are usually little comic moments scattered about as well. So if you're willing to give yourself over to his vision for a couple of hours, it is quite rewarding, even if those couple of hours leave you a bit disturbed. But hey, that's part of what makes great movie-going, isn't it? This film's title, and I'm giving nothing away as it has been part of every interview, is both the mental state the lead characters are going through in this film, as well as the name of a planet which may or may not be hurdling toward the earth the night of Justine's wedding, Kirsten Dunst's character. It is also a part of the mental state of the Director of the film. His last two films (Anti-Christ the one previous to this), in particular, have been ones which have been outward expressions of that state.In any event, while Melancholia is available currently (as I write this) On Demand on cable TV, see this in the theater if you can. The visuals are marvelous and a large screen experience allows you to be enveloped in these larger than life images.Regarding the performances, while it's an all-star cast, including velvet voice himself, Kiefer Sutherland, Alexander Skarsgard, Stellan Skarsgard, Charlotte Rampling, John Hurt, Udo Kier (of the Warhol/Morrisey films), many are rather throwaway roles for them. Here, it is really Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Sutherland's film.Kirsten Dunst's performance is the celebrated one, as she won Best Actress at Cannes. While she gives an extremely raw and brave performance, and she does show off a range and complexity of emotions, Gainsbourg gives a quieter but more well-conceived performance. Dunst, for me, doesn't pull it all-together in as coherent a way. She doesn't give the character an arc I can believe in the way the best acting performances do. There is no doubt that this film shows Dunst to be an actress who is willing to bare her body and soul for the sake of a film (and there is little of her body that is not bared here), but her acting seems, at times,more of an acting exercise in emotions. So I liked her performance, but didn't love it. In the end, Gainsbourg's was the more interesting performance. It had more nuance and I believed her arc much more. And while Dunst has a natural beauty about her which is stunning, Gainsbourg has a understated beauty it may take a few more looks to appreciate. On the surface, she is certainly a plain Jane next to Dunst, but she has the ability to pull you quietly into her character.Sutherland was all right, nothing special. I think he was put in there for box office purposes rather than being the best actor possible for the role. I really didn't buy his performance that much. Vocally, he has a rather limited range. Emotionally, his range is limited as well. He's like a volume knob than only stops at 1, 5, or 10. He still sounds like his character on 24.Melancholia is both enthralling and a bit frustrating. Worth seeing, but not always totally satisfying. Fascinating at times, not quite believable at others (There are a couple of plot point holes I won't go into here.). Is is a very unusual 2 plus hours in the theater. Overall, if you're a Von Triers fan, see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholia is an Insightful Meditation on Depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia, the latest ejaculation from director Lars Van Trier is a film about depression, deeply entrenched, life altering, worlds colliding depression. It doesn't attempt to candy coat it like a rom com by making it funny, or silly, or quirky (think Paul Giamatti in every movie he's ever been in). Depression is given this kind of treatment in mainstream cinema probably because depression is boring (as anyone who has dabbled in it can attest to). But Melancholia is anything but boring. Sure, it's pacing is on the slow side but its beautifully shot and honestly written.What began as a majestic opening scene, much like living, breathing oil on canvas, it devolved into an excruciating hand-held-cam nightmare. Within two minutes of shaky cam, I was nauseated, intensely so, and I don't typically get motion sickness from this style of camera work. Throughout the entire movie, there were moments when saliva filled my mouth (you know the feeling), my stomach gurgling. I thought I was going to need to make a run for the nearest garbage pale. I never reached the tipping point but the nausea lingered even after the film was over but maybe that was the narrative rather than the bouncing frame.You may assume I mean the movie disgusted me, it didn't. It was the tightly spun tension from beginning to end that left me feeling anxious long after the closing credits. This is, I believe, Lars Van Trier's gift. The same subtle tautness threads Dancer in the Dark, Breaking the Waves, Dogville, and Manderlay. The peak for me was when John, Claire's husband, was looking through his telescope the morning after the "fly by" and he promptly disappears leaving his unsuspecting wife on the balcony.The performances were genuine, scary real. From the vapid bridegroom to the ice cold mother of the bride, each character was infused with depth despite the lack of screen time. I wasn't so impressed with Kristen Dunst's performance. I felt I was always watching Kristen Dunst be Justine rather than watching Justine as her own life force. I must admit, knowing that Penelope Cruz was originally cast caused me to like Dunst's performance less. Remembering Cruz's roles in Don't Move, Elegy, and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, she would have fit well into this picture.The final scene took my breath away. All of the tension cultivated, codifying into one moment where the depressive is the one calmly chaperoning her family into the void.</fullReview>

If you want a real movie to watch and not some pseudo artist's mental excrement then check out Boy A. That was a real movie.I did not like it. It was not good. If you like it you are a pretentious poser as well. Is this ten lines yet? Oh wait this is. This movie deserves just one word--sucks. No wait, it's still not ten lines yet. I have to post some more filler here to get past the silly line requirement. I feel I have wasted enough of my time and life on this movie but I really want others to know that we need to stop encouraging garbage like this so I will continue until I have met the line requirements. Let me test again and see if I can now post.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films by the visionary film maker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is only on earth &amp; not for long. That quote by Kristen Dunst - the lead actress of "Melancholia" hit me hard. It is a powerful film with an easy &amp; slow pace. I have never seen a movie with so painful beautiful emotions. It is a milestone visionary film with breathtaking photography.Story is simple. In first part, we see Justine getting married and she is very happy. However, her family does not support her much. They live in their own world of materialism &amp; caring only about expenses. Her divorced mother hates her, as she does not believe marital bliss anymore. During her wedding, Justine notices a bright star in the sky. In second part, we found that bright star is actually an another celestial body called Melancholia which is going to hit earth. Consequently, we see how people find the importance of life when one actually loosing it. Instead of focusing on end of the world, the complicated human emotions have shown with dash of realism.Kristen Dunst has given performance of her lifetime. She will definitely win an Oscar for that. The direction Lars Von Trier is simply masterpiece. He is one of the best European filmmakers. Overall, one of the best films of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, subtle and intrinsic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melancholia is a planet which threatens to destroy the Earth, at first hiding behind the Sun. If this is not symbolism, let me know. Spoiler- warning hereby awarded! Apart from von Trier hiding behind the old, tired adage of a depressed woman having to behave in sudden, nymphomanic ways, his wonderful eye for detail as far as letting what's considered "normal" seep through how people usually and actually behave is present. The first example of this, when Michael (Alexander Skarsg?rd) and Justine (Kirsten Dunst) try to maneuver a stretch-limo through a very narrow, twirly path, is brilliant. The use of music in the film is very fine, as are the subtleties of the actors; von Trier's directing feels so present you can nearly see it through ripples on the actors' eyes, and he's even written the script. A simple story, but human in its mirth. Still, I think it could have gained through editing by another person than himself. All in all: an experience worth going through. More a sentiment than a wrapped-up story, more Antonioni than Spielberg, to put things bluntly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Justine is getting married, even though she doesn't seem that interested in it. Her sister Claire tries desperately to keep up appearances in the large dysfunctional family. This is about the relationship between them, and the possible impending doom threatened by another planet approaching Earth... it may hit us, it may not. I have not watched that many Lars von Trier films, but I expect them to be visually and thematically interesting. And going by that, this is fine. It is attractive, and without being gratuitous. However, it does not seem to have that much to say, or a terribly compelling manner of communicating it. The acting is great, from all other than the child(who, to make matters worse, is clearly there to deliver exposition), no surprise given that we get Stellan Skarsgaard, John Hurt, Kiefer Sutherland and Udo Kier(who has a pretty funny running gag that I won't give away, in his role as the wedding planner). The psychology seems pretty realistic, and we understand how these people are as a unit without it being spelled out. There is strong sexuality and frontal nudity in this. I recommend this to fans of artistic cinema, as long as one doesn't go in thinking it will be on the level of Dogville or Manderlay. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The king is dead...no really he is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who would list 3 Lars Von Trier films amongst my favourites of all time and another 2 in the like-a-lot category I can only assume that a reputation management company is being used to load the scores on IMDb. This film suffers (chronically) from: - A ridiculous sense of self-importance. - Clunky redundant dialogue. - A plot that could be easily stenciled on a grain of rice - with plenty of room left for cast and production credits. - Pointless character meanderings. - Cardboard cut-out performances. - Ridiculously overstated symbolism. - Afternoon soap style dialogue and family 'dramas'. - Painfully slow development of not very much. - The utter waste of a powerful concept. - The direction of Kiefer Sutherland to a familiarly meat-headed performance. - The direction of Kirsten Dunst away from what could have been a brilliantly dead-eyed depressive performance into a jellybean counting seer of doom. - Everything about this film is patchy - unfortunately the patches are of cataclysmic dullness and bad creative decision-making amongst the mediocrity.Sadly this continues LVT's drift from the Dogme brilliance of Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark and the more stylistically elegant Dogville back to the indigestible and overwrought Europa trilogy. You have been warned...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. Never Try To Be Successful Success is the bye-product. Excellence always creates success. So, never run after the success, let it happen automatically in the life.2.Freedom To Life Don't die before actual death. Live every moment to the fullest as you are going to die today night. Life is gifted to humankind to live, live &amp; live @ happiness.3. Passion Leads To Excellence When your hobby becomes your profession and passion becomes your profession. You will be able to lead up to excellence in the life. Satisfaction, pleasure, joy and love will be the outcome of following passion, unless an unknown planet appears in the sky and smashes everything! 4. Learning Is Very Simple Teachers do fail. Learners never fail. Learning is never complicated or Learning is always possible whatever rule you apply.5.Pressure At Head Current education system is developing pressures on students' head. University intelligence is useful and making some impact in the life but it cannot be at the cost of the life.6.Life Is Emotion Management Not Intelligence Optimization Memory and regular study have definite value and it always helps you in leading a life. You are able to survive even if you can make some mark in the path of the life. With artificial intelligence, you can survive and win but you cannot prove yourself genius. Therefore, in this process genius dies in you.7.Necessity Is The Mother Of Invention Necessity creates pressure and forces you to invent something or to make it happen or to use your potentiality. Aamir Khan in this film, 3 idiots, is able to prove in the film by using aqua guard pump at the last moment.8.Simplicity is Life Life is need base never want base. Desires have no ends. Simplicity is way of life and Danish culture highly stresses on simple living and high thinking, and this is the way of life: 'Legs down to earth and eyes looking beyond the sky' 9. Industrial Leadership Dean of the institute in Melancholia is showing very typical leadership. He has his own principles, values and ideology, and he leads the whole institute accordingly. This is an example of current institutional leadership. In the present scenario, most of the institutes are fixed in a block or Squarish thinking.10. Love Is Time &amp; Space Free Love is not time bound and space bound. It is very well demonstrated this movie same love was demonstrated by Krishna and Meera. Love is border free, time free and space free.11.Importance Of One Word In Communication If communication dies, everything dies. Each word has impact and value in communication. One word if used wrongly or emphasized wrongly or paused at a wrong place in communication what effect it creates and how is it affected is demonstrated very well in this movie.12. Mediocrity Is Penalized Middle class family or average talent or average institute is going to suffer and has to pay maximum price in the life if they do not upgrade their living standards. To be born poor or as an average person is not a crime but to die as an average person with middle class talent is miserable and if you are unable to optimize your potentiality and die with unused potentiality then that is your shameful truth. One should not die as a mediocre. He/she has to bring out genius inside him/her and has to use his/her potentiality to the optimum level.What can I say, when the whole world is pouring accolades on the movie. Going by the reviews I too ventured to the movie with the whole family. In return what we go was crude jokes, tasteless scenes, senseless situations. The climax aptly summarizes the misery.At the end we realized that they almost re-made Munna Bhai MBBS all over again. This time around they just replaced Doctors with Engineers, Medical college with Engg College &amp; Munna Bhai with Rancho. However at least the former was a clean comedy.If you are still curious about the movie, leave your kids behind &amp; go watch at your own risk ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film begins with a very long prologue showing, what will finally happen. Then it takes us to a beautiful wedding, which starts quite well, and looks like a typical high-budget party. The problem is, that the main character starts doing things nobody can understand neither explain. Mine idea was, that it's all going to come clear in time. Unfortunately it has not.Next stage is the main 'body' where we are told about Melancholia, the planet that's going to collapse with Earth. That was the part, where i was sitting quite interested watching different types of human reactions to possible doom. And hoping that some allusions will be made to the first part of the story.Unfortunately, I found it quite impossible to connect these two parts the way this whole movie can make any sense.However, there are some positive things i may say about this film- the pictures are great and psychology shown by several characters can make you thinking about different types of people and their reactions to hard situations.In conclusion I strongly recommend to pick any other movie they're playing at your cinema.</fullReview>

Im so sick of watching movies and seeing unnecessary nudity that I'm ready to stop going to see them. Whats the point of her being naked in a film thats supposed to be about the world ending?! It was weird too, it wasn't like nudity in a sex scene where the plot involved two lovers, come on people clean it up. Hollywood is getting such a bad name these days for producing crap. Such a serious event as the world ending should be presented through a story, in a more epic demeanor rather than in a movie that doesn't make any sense and just relies on overemotional viewers to tap into their overmedicated depression issues and potentially relate.</fullReview>
