		<shortDescription>Halle Berry's shining moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Independent filmmaking is alive and well and evident in Monster's Ball. This film had a minuscule $4 million budget, a terrific script and a director not afraid to take some risks. Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry practically donated their time they were paid so little. The result is a powerful and disturbing film that walked off with a boatload of awards, not the least of which was a best actress Oscar for Berry.Director Marc Forster conjures a forceful presentation with stark sets, next to nothing in the way of props and other set decoration, and a non existent soundtrack. Forster does it with innovative use of the camera, sharp editing and most importantly excellent actor direction. Forster could have done better at character development and the ending is nebulous and unsatisfying, but these shortcomings can be partially forgiven for the films many assets.This is an actors' showcase, with outstanding performances all around. Heath Ledger makes a short but intense appearance as the son that Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) despises. Ledger pumps the character full of repressed anger and disappointment, simultaneously resenting him and seeking his father's approval. Peter Boyle is despicable as Hank's bigoted and self centered father. Billy Bob Thornton delivers his best performance since `Sling Blade' with a complex character torn between his prejudices and his attraction to Leticia (Halle Berry).Of course the big story here is Halle Berry. Berry shows once again that she is not just another pretty face. I first took serious notice of her after seeing her performance in `Introducing Dorothy Dandridge', a little seen TV movie in which she won both a Golden Globe and an Emmy. After that marvelous dramatic performance, I was surprised that she couldn't land roles any better than `Swordfish' and `X-Men', which tapped nothing more substantial than her looks. In this film, Berry is sexy and alluring, but these are only incidental attributes. She displays a full range of emotions from vibrant elation and unbridled passion, to utter despondency. She practically rips her heart out and throws it at the camera. She can convey volumes with a single look, or come completely unglued with equal impact. Her Oscar for this performance was richly deserved and had nothing to do with her race as so many have rationalized. She just flat out won it going away. As good as Nicole Kidman was in `Moulin Rouge', it wasn't even close.This is an excellent film that is worth seeing for the acting alone. I rated it a 9/10. It is a compelling and deeply disturbing drama that serious film lovers will surely enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowing, daring film. One of the year's best. **** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MONSTER'S BALL / (2001) **** (out of four)When I finish reading a great book, I don't close it right away. Treasuring the story's emotional grasp, I just sit there and hold it for a minute, enthralled, sensing the character's lives are continuing even as I put the book away. "Monster's Ball" is a similar experience. The film contains so much truth, vigor, and so many harrowing moments, I just stared at the screen through the ending credits. Even after a second viewing the conviction did not diminish. It really says something about a movie when you know what happens and you're equally as mesmerized every time you watch it.Most movies about depravity are really about entertainment, but director Marc Forster avoids preachy speeches, big sappy moments, and melodramatic music. Even during the movie's most important scenes, Forster does not overplay the material. He knows that careful, quiet dialogue, and long, silent pauses speak louder than lengthy emotional summaries.Consider a scene where a character checks his father into an old folk's home. It does not feature long good-byes or conclusive hugs. Instead, it projects unflinching, raw emotion. "You must love him very much," reassures an attendant to the character who replies, "No I don't, but he is my father?"The character, Hank, is played by Billy Bob Thornton, who makes his Academy Award-winning performance in "Sling Blade" look like SNL material. Hank, bitter and racist, lives in a Southern country house with his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), and father (Peter Boyle). Hank and Sonny work as prison guards on death row. Sonny desperately wants out of the family business, especially after an unpleasant emotional reaction to the latest execution. When Hank explodes at him for his mistake, Sonny teaches his father a lesson he will never forget. The film eventually becomes a story about the relationship between Hank and the widow of the man he has just executed. She's played by Halle Barry, who was paid an extra one-million dollars for doing an extended sex scene completely nude. This is a gradual, yet sudden relationship that is not based on physical attraction or love, but emotional need and depravity.Forster makes interesting editing choices. During certain scenes, he cuts back and forth between separate occurrences while the central action fills the soundtrack. Especially unique is how he handles a sex scene. While two characters engage in some of the most graphic stimulated sex of last year, Forster flashes images of a caged bird before us. A metaphor of shattered innocence or repressed emotion, perhaps?Actually, Forster fills "Monster's Ball" with metaphors, including the title itself. He even includes a moving soundtrack of timid rhythms and sudden beats, symbolizing the characters complex states of mind. Forster's haunting, daring feature reminds us why we all love the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary Performances by Berry and Thornton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very rare, but occasionally a film comes along that plays out so realistically that it doesn't even seem like you're watching a movie, but participating-- albeit as an observer-- in this particular drama of life that is unfolding around you. And so it is with `Monster's Ball,' a riveting film, directed by Marc Forster, that is so real it transcends entertainment and becomes a voyeuristic experience that leaves you with the sense that you've been through everything that's happened yourself. It's a thought provoking examination of relationships and perspectives, including the ingrained, subjective attitudes-- especially prejudices-- that have such a profound and lasting affect on our lives, as well as the lives of those around us. It's a film that says so much about the way we respond to one another, as well as certain situations, and why; in short, it's about the world that we, as a society, have created and must live in together-- right or wrong, good or bad, black or white. And at the heart of the story is a message that rings through loud and true; a perception that we can do better-- and must-- if we are to survive as a civilized, dignified and progressive species. In the final analysis, we are, all of us, members of the family of Man; and it's time we realize and acknowledge it. After eleven years on death row at a Georgia State Penitentiary, Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs) is out of appeals and is headed for the electric chair. There to make their final visit is Musgrove's wife, Leticia (Halle Berry), and their son, Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun), while veteran corrections officer Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) oversees the proceedings. Also on hand is third-generation corrections officer Sonny Grotowski (Heath Ledger), who during Musgrove's final walk discovers he doesn't have the stomach required to perform his duties, which will later create some conflict with his father. Bigotry, it seems, is something of a family trait; Hank's father, Buck (Peter Boyle), a retired corrections officer, is the product of a time when African Americans `knew their place.' But it's an attitude that's apparently become somewhat watered down in his family from one generation to the next. Hank seems almost indifferent, even apathetic, when it comes to race, though under stress, especially, he defers to his father's views. Sonny, however, has a mind of his own, and by nature is more willing to embrace all of the myriad and diverse aspects of life as he sees it. And with the three generations of Grotowski men living under one roof, needless to say, there is more than some tension in the household, which inevitably leads to tragedy. Leticia, meanwhile, is riding a downward spiral in her own life, attempting to cope with both her husband's situation and a problem with her son, while having to make a living on top of it all. And just when it seems that her world is about to fall into total collapse, circumstances bring her into contact with-- of all people-- Hank Grotowski. Call it fate, or just one of those things; but it becomes a turning point, not only in their lives, but in the lives of a number of people close to them. And very soon, for Hank and Leticia, especially, the world becomes a very different place. Working from a screenplay by Milo Addica and Will Rokos that is intelligent, incisive and uncompromising, Forster delivers an emotionally absorbing drama that is raw, insightful and presented with a subtle intensity that is so thoroughly engrossing it becomes mesmerizing. It's a film that does not allow the viewer the luxury of casual observation or an indifferent attitude; the story is told in terms that are so brutally honest and starkly realistic that it does not provide for neutral ground or ambiguity on the part of it's audience. This is powerful drama, and Forster makes sure that everyone watching has the sense of actually being included as the story unfolds. He makes you a part of this world in which Hank, Leticia and the others live-- there's no standing on the sidelines with this one. As in real life, with this film you are confronted with situations that demand resolution and force you to make decisions.  It takes a number of elements to make a truly great film, of course, and in this one they all come together beautifully-- especially in the performances, beginning with Billy Bob Thornton, who is without question one of the best leading men/character actors in the business. He's a true chameleon who never ceases to amaze with his versatility and his ability to create believable, interesting and memorable characters, from Karl (arguably his most memorable) in `Sling Blade,' to Jacob in `A Simple Plan,' or Russell in `Pushing Tin' to Hank in this film, whom he captures with absolutely incredible subtlety and depth. It's a terrific performance, delivered with nuance and restraint, and it should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it was clearly one of the best performances of the year. What really takes this film to a higher level, though, is the extraordinary performance by Halle Berry as Leticia, in whom she creates a finely layered, three-dimensional character that is singularly effective and entirely believable and real. In Leticia, you will find every conceivable emotion woven around conflicts born of the definitive complexities of life, the things we all experience in one way or another at one time or another, and to which everyone will be able to relate on some level, according to personal experience. In this performance, Berry does it all and gives her all, and it's work for which she deservedly was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress. When you come away from this film, it's with the indelible images of Leticia and Hank burned into your memory, thanks to the talents of Berry, Thornton and Forster. `Monster's Ball' is compelling, unforgettable drama, and an example of filmmaking at it's best. 10/10.          </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far More Than Just That Sex Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not a big favorite with audiences and I figured I would be among the majority on this one......but I wasn't - I like this film. In fact, I liked it even better on the second viewing.I found it to be one of those rare movies that deals with racism that doesn't come on too heavy-handed with all the political correctness nonsense. It handled the problem intelligently, I thought.The cinematographer, Robert Schaefer, did a terrific job with this, too, and that is another reason I have come to really enjoy this film. The visuals - and the audio - are outstanding.None of the characters are particularly likable but I thought Billy Bob Thornton's "Hank Grotowski" was so interesting a character that I concentrated more on that than whether I liked him or not. However, I wound up liking him, anyway, and boy, did his character change in this film. There is a steamy sex scene in here with Billy Bob and Halle Barry that was quite the talk when the film was released. I didn't think it was all that it was made out to be. I've seen steamier moments such as Alec Baldwin and Kim Bassinger going at it in the non-rated version of "The Getaway." Overall, this a rough film in spots but I think it is a solid, underrated drama that offers far more than the "celebrated" sex scene. This is a well-made movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent job of peeling away the layers of racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is the middle generation of three generations of prison guards. His father Buck (Peter Boyle) is long retired and a near-invalid, using a walker and leaning on an iron lung. His son Sonny (Heath Ledger) is a novice guard. Hank and Sonny work together on Death Row and are among the guards responsible for the executions (Hank's in charge).The first thing that strikes one about this particular group of men is the level of racism that's apparent in each one. Buck's the worst - he screams at young black kids who happen to wander onto "his" property (all three Grotowskis live together) and is liable to spout off some hateful rhetoric at any time. Hank's not a lot better, but his feelings seem tempered in contrast to Buck; he seems more weary than angry. And Sonny is actually friends with that same neighboring black family whose kids come over every now and then.Thus the line of racism is significantly watered down as the generations progress. This is not to suggest that Sonny is an angel, or that Buck is the absolute devil. Sonny and Hank share the same hooker (though not at the same time); all three men drink, smoke, and cuss like sailors. In short, they're simply not nice folk.While Hank and Sonny are transporting a prisoner to the electric chair, Sonny takes ill and can't continue. Because of this, the prisoner (who had bonded a little with the compassionate Sonny earlier) suffers a little during his execution. Enraged, Hank attacks his son in the locker room after the execution, and the other guards have to separate them.That's one relationship being examined - that of Hank and Sonny. The other is the more important one, however. The widow of the executed prisoner, Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), is trying to make ends meet as a waitress. But her car constantly dies on her, and after being late to work repeatedly, she's fired - shortly after her husband is executed. She has one overeating kid to feed, too. She does get another job as a waitress, but has to ditch the car when it dies a final time. Walking home in the rain, her son (who has to come with her; can't leave him home to binge) his hit by a car. Hank happens to be passing by, and with some reluctance (remember, he is racist, if not as bad as his father), he stops to help. There's a wonderful dichotomy between the relationship between Leticia and her son and that between Hank and his son. Milo Addica and Will Rokos, who wrote the screenplay, weave a very effective tale that manages to keep all of the characters interesting and relevant. What makes Hank act the way he does? What are Leticia's motivations? And it would be very easy for the actors to portray the characters as nothing more than stereotypes - Hank the nasty, racist white male, and Leticia the vulnerable, victimized African American woman. But both Thornton and Berry rise above their characters' limitations - Hank's not the devil he might think he is, and Leticia isn't the angel that a lesser actress might make her out to be.It's also worth mentioning that each of the two leads has something shocking and powerful happen to them near the beginning of the film, before they really meet. These two events have a huge impact on the characters - you might call the events "life-altering". The events allow us to see actual change in the character. Not sudden change, which can be jarring and unrealistic, but gradual, authentic, eminently believable change.The performances by the leads are nothing short of sensational. Berry won the Oscar for Best Actress for her work here. Yes, you read right - Halle Berry. She of The Flintstones, Swordfish, and being married to David Justice fame. See, this is what happens when you give a good actress a great role. The best actresses will rise to the level of the role; the mediocre actresses will sink below it, collapsing under its weight.Thornton has a tendency to pick offbeat, idiosyncratic roles, albeit usually with a Southern twist. His Hank is not a carbon copy of your stereotypical Dirty White Boy; he's a multilayered character with charm and evil mixed in. The film doesn't make him out to be a complete hero; just a flawed one. By the movie's end, he has come to grips (a little) with his failures and his shortcomings.Berry and Thornton have a great supporting cast in Boyle and Ledger. When you think of a hateful, misanthropic, misogynistic demon, you don't think of Peter Boyle, who's turning in great comedic work on the TV show "Everybody Loves Raymond". But after this movie, you sure do. Great job. And Ledger - well, I know him best from The Patriot, as Mel Gibson's oldest son. In that movie, he was tough, but he was still a boy in a world of adults. That boy's grown up, and Ledger proves his mettle as an actor in this role.There will be some who find this movie too slow; granted, if you're looking for action, this won't appeal to you. But it's an excellent story, and not as simplistic as it may seem on the outside. It's very well written (meaning that there are few plot holes), and ably directed. You may be fascinated, as I was, with the character development from beginning to end. Things are not - pardon the expression - treated as black-and-white issues; there are varying grays that are resolved and not resolved by movie's end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very compelling and sincere movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball wasn't made with a big budget by some very well known director. And to make things "worse", it's controversial as well because the story isn't exactly about a family living together happy with more money than there is water in the sea. And they weren't afraid to put a lot of racism in it, which was necessary to make this movie believable, but for some "politically correct" people, already reasons enough to say they didn't like it.The movie tells us the story of Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), a racist white prison guard who works on Death Row and Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), a black woman whose husband is about to be executed. Hank lives with his father and his son, who he really hates, under the same roof. But when a tragedy takes his son away, he starts thinking about his ideas. In the mean while he has met Leticia, not knowing who she really is and soon they fall in love with each other. This is the start of a relationship based rather on desperation than on love.Monster's ball doesn't use cheap Hollywood sentiment like you might expect from this kind of movies, but is sincere and very compelling. This is of course also thanks to excellent performances. Halle Berry got an Oscar for it, but what I don't understand is why Billy Bob Thornton wasn't even nominated. His character may not be as likable and no he isn't as good looking as Berry, but his performance certainly wasn't any less. In fact, the entire movie was more than just worth a watch. It's very nice to see that there still are unknown directors who can make good movies with a good story, some fine actors and a small budget. I really enjoyed it and that's why I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Southern Gothic - dark and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is a compelling film of family conflict, rage and redemption. Halle Berry throws herself into this role like a prizefighter who leaves it all in the ring, and wins by unanimous decision. Billy Bob Thornton gives an electrifying performance as a man grappling with his demons and wanting his better self to emerge victorious.This movie is a study in ambiguity. The characters are complex with human imperfection, no one (with the exception of Hank's father, played by Peter Boyle) emerging as completely likable or entirely bad. Hank's son played by Heath Ledger fulfills the adage that no good deed goes unpunished, and it's never clear that anyone truly gets whats coming to them.I'm not sure one should read too much into this movie as a study of attitudes towards race in today's America, but as a portrayal of human frailty and the continuing quest for hope and optimism, Monster's Ball is a can't-miss film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Monster's Ball" is presented by Director Marc Forster as a dark, dreary film-noir like drama involving the role of fate in bringing together two different but distraught people from different races.The film opens as preparations are underway for the execution of Lawrence Musgrave (Sean Combs). Two of the prison guards are Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and his son Sonny (Heath Ledger). Musgrave's wife Leticia (Halle Berry) and his obese son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) have come to see Musgrave to say their final goodbyes. Hank and Sonny live with the bigoted Buck who is Hank's father and who was also a prison guard. We learn that Buck has apparently bullied Hank all his life and now Hank is doing likewise to Sonny.Following the execution, two tragic but unrelated events occur in the lives of Hank and Leticia. Hank, fighting off the predjudices taught him by his father, begins to fall for Leticia and eventually an inter-racial relationship ensues. But what if she finds out that Hank had a part in executing her husband?Berry deservedly won the 2001 Academy Award as best actress for her role as the tragic Leticia. She displays a wide range of emotions from pity to sadness to dispare to ecstacy to happiness. Thornton is equally good as the similarly tragic Hank who goes through much of the same emotional changes. Peter Boyle is also excellent as the bigoted Buck. Ledger, in an all too brief role, shines as the son who really doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. Calhoun evokes pity and sorrow as Leticia's son and the old Puffmeister, Combs gives a good low key performance as the doomed convict.An excellent film but be forewarned that there are a couple of graphic sex scenes in the movie. Definitely not for the kiddies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Acting Fills Out Taut Small Town Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Monster's Ball" is the fourth of the 2001 movies for grown-ups about adults dealing with death. Here the main characters find redemption through personal relationships and provide hope.While some in the audience complained it was too slow, the original script by Milo Addica and Will Rokos feels like an expansion of a short story, as the outlines of the plot are fairly simple and not all the back story is explained, and riddled with coincidences barely made feasible by taking place in a small town. Director Marc Forster finds a way to visually communicate the difference between sex and intimacy.But the actors fill the spaces of inarticulate characters with complex performances, not just award-winning Halle Berry (a long way from "X Men"). Billy Bob Thornton starts out slightly less laconic than in "The Man Who Wasn't There" but very gradually finds the ability and a reason to smile. Less attention has been paid to the excellence in smaller roles by Heath Ledger (yes hunky Heath) and Peter Boyle. Country music is used in the background only when the radio is on; it's a nice local station they got there that plays Jimmie Dale Gilmore.(originally written 2/17/2002)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White Man's Burden Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What are you repulsed by? Perhaps it's having sex with women of African origin inspite of the fact that you are a White male raised in a racist culture that dehmanises them. Add to this predicament, that you are a retired, widowed prison corrections officer who's only son kills himself because he feels he's failed you because he is not racist enough. Even worse, you become enligthtened enough to realise that .. you were ALWAYS wrong.This is a brilliant story told from the rather selfish perspective of the White male. Mark Forster has directed a tour de force so intricate and psychologically honest that the story literally TELLS itself. Indeed, I'd bet this story organically spewed from souls of screenwirters Milo Addica &amp; Will Rokos. They won't top this fete anytime soon. Such a gateway of insight only comes around once in a lifetime.As a huge fan of David Mamet and Sam Shepard I am biased to appreciate a well balanced story, illustrated with terse dialogue, structured acting and effective filmic devices (i.e., the use of "white" paint", "black" coffee and "chocolate" ice cream in the film).Any film student will also appreciate the poetic use of foreshadowing and irony in this film. This truly is SOLID filmaking that takes real chances with provocative subject matter.The acting is superb more because of the Direction. To be certain: this is a Director's Film. Every aspect of Thorton's and Berry's performances is the result of very savvy Direction and attention to dramatic detail.Kudos to Mr. Forster. I look forward his upcoming film "Neverland" with great anticipation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Victim's Ball"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writers, director and producer of Monster's Ball should be ASHAMED and EMBARRASSED for actually charging innocent people to view this feeble attempt at a love story between a white male and a black female. You have to assume that is what they are attempting because the movie actually has no real story with a conflict or problem that needs to be solved.*****spoiler follow*****The black people in this film are all victims. The victimization starts with Lawrence Musgrove (Sean P. Diddy Combs) who is to be executed for a crime that is never mentioned. A large amount of time is used to show how the prison guards are preparing for the execution and Lawrence spends time with his wife and son. It would have been helpful to know if he was being sent to the electric chair because he shot 16 innocent people with a machine gun, or was he caught stealing at the local Walmart? As it is, he is just a victim without a story.Then there is Leticia Musgrove who is the greatest victim in Hollywood history. Her husband is executed, her son is run over and killed, she is being evicted, she loses her job, and her car breaks down. She has no friends or support people. No mother, father, sisters or brothers to lean on. She is just alone in the big world all by herself.Meanwhile, Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is busy being a racist and child hater. He quits his job for a reason that is never explained, wanders around aimlessly, and must contend with a father who would make a member of the KKK blush. His son commits suicide in front of him and yet he has no remorse!!SUDDENLY there is a change of heart by Hank who decides that black people really aren't that bad after all. He is nice to his black neighbors, who earlier in the movie were told to stay off his property or else. He gets a black girlfriend, sleeps with her, and decides he'll have her move in as well. We don't know why Hank changes. This script requires that you be a mind reader!! Maybe it's because Leticia is so beautiful but that is just a guess.Is it a surprise that Leticia would be interested in Hank? What other choices does she have in life? It's really sad to think that the writers and director couldn't envision a love affair in which these two people come together because they like each other as equals. Instead, we get the 1902 version of race relations. The empowered and the victim.The final victim in this story is Halle Berry herself. I will never understand how she was talked into an X-rated scene. There was absolutely no reason to go that far. She should have talked to Sidney Poitier who turned down roles that were negative stereotypes of black people when roles for minorities were almost impossible to find. She should have received an Oscar for "bad judgment". This movie gets a "1" on the scale of "1-10". Truly awful. It probably would have received a "10" in 1902.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summed Up By Berry's Acceptance Speech</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a well known fact that MONSTER'S BALL won Halle Berry an Oscar for best actress and led to one of the most bizarre sites in the history of the ceremony where Berry shrieked , wept and gnashed her teeth in an uncontrollable manner . She probably wasn't overcome with emotion - She was impersonating the average person's reaction to seeing this film !Depressing doesn't even begin to sum up this movie . It starts with the domestic life of three generations of prison officers the Grotowski family , two of which give racist redneck scumbags a bad name . A black prisoner is about to be executed and the middle and younger Grotowski ( Hank and Sonny respectively ) are looking after him and these scenes are amongst the most feel good moments of the story ! Words fail to describe what a bleak depressing movie this is . It's about redemption and finding love in the worst of circumstances but it's never entirely convincing . The fate of Sonny Grotowski didn't ring true and in the case of Berry's character just how unlucky can someone be in such a short period of time ? I will congratulate the performances of the cast in this very well acted movie . Billy Bob Thornton is probably best remembered as " one of the men who married Angelina Jolie " but is also one of America's underappricated actors ( His screen writing abilities are also overlooked ) who manages to rise above the sometimes inconsistent material while Halle Berry what can I say ? Apart from that she really did deserve the Oscar . Well regarded character actor and acting guru Peter Boyle might be disappointing as Hank's reactionary father but since his character spends most of his time sitting in a chair slowly dying from respiratory failure he's not given much to do But it should be pointed out once again that this is a very sad and melancholy film that won't have anyone dancing in the aisles I did appreciate the good performances but I doubt I'll be watching it again in a hurry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a film's finest performance comes from Puffy, you know you're in trouble.I've never racism, poverty, murder, and guilt so maudlinly handled without a second of truth.I'll just list why I hated this movie:1. Billy Bob, in the stiffest performance EVER, manages to recover from his life-long racism because Halle Berry's hot.2. To demonstrate that she's poor, Halle Berry drives a car that has apparently been drenched in acid rain.3. Berry wins the Oscar for SCREAMS and CROCODILE TEARS. The scene where she consumates her hormones with Billy Bob would be very much at home on Mystery Science Theater. Or in any movie with the word "Rod," "Suckers" "15", "Crack", or "Only in the...." in the tite.4. Peter Boyle looks like he just woke up for each take.5. Dramatic cross cutting allows us to watch Billy Bob buy ice cream and gas. WHAT THE F%^$?6. Last like: "I need somebody to take care of me." Somewhere, Gloria Steinman is baning her head against the wall.7. Chocolate ice cream with a plastic spoon. That's a character detail. Damn it to hell!!!!And yet, critics, audiences, and the Academy loved it. Has anybody actually been in a poor rural town for even a second? Or read any Steinbeck novels? Or seen somebody cry? Or heard people speak? I adore rotten movies. I DESPISE "Serious" films that don't have a even a second of human truth. Shame on all of you for liking this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poorly written.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will insult your intelligence. It mocks humanity. It is very poorly written. Why did these famous actors agree to do this? Did they go out together and lose all their money in Vegas and become extremely desperate?Why did the father hate his son so much? Why did the son commit suicide? Why was the nice black man executed?I was horrified by the impossible evil nature of the father and wanted to just stop watching this ridiculous movie, but I had to find the answer to these questions. I trusted the writer would not be so abandon that he would least give an answer, and believe it or not, THERE'S NEVER A SINGLE ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS! That's just wrong.This movie is absolutely mindless. Nothing has any virtue at all except for shock value and dramatic emotion.I'm sure this author does not know what it's like to have children. There has probably never been parent in the history of mankind who has ever hated their child like that. I don't think it's possible. After you have sacrificed time and money and pain to just to change diapers until the child can walk, he will be very precious to you. HOW MUCH MORE if he grows up to be a good and handsome young man with a good job and he looks up to and admires his father so he even follows his career.We are supposed to believe that the star of the movie could be so evil that he tell his son he has always hated him and could then watch his son commit suicide and never shed a tear and then tell everyone he was glad he was dead!These kinds of things never happen in reality. Only in some amateur author's depraved imagination. The average 14 year old, 9th grade English student can write a more convincing script than this.Anyone with a soul will want this man to die and someone else take center stage. That's what I was expecting to happen. But he becomes the hero of the movie! That's twisted!Watching this movie is like subjecting yourself to trauma based mind control. I wouldn't recommend it. I'm scarred for life now. Please save yourself!The only thing good is the acting. Not enough to make it worth watching. The only way I can redeem this tragedy is by making a solemn vow to forever steer clear of these writers, Will Rokos, Milo Addica. I'm sure everything written by them stinks. Guys, writing is not your calling. I beg you, please find something you're good at.The rating system usually works great at IMDb, but I'm sorry to see that in this case it has failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly powerful and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Halle Berry was getting publicity over a film called "Monster's Ball", a movie I had never even heard of, I was a little skeptical. I mean, come on, this is HALLE BERRY. The star of "B.A.P.S.". The actress who said "You know what happens to a toad when it gets hit by lightning? The same thing as what happens to everyone else," in "X-Men". I was not convinced. Then I saw the movie and my jaw dropped. Who knew Berry had this in her? A performance of emotion, range, and power, Berry's Leticia Musgrove redefined the actress' career and brought new meaning to the phrase "emotionally distraught". The film's plot, while fundamentally simple, hides layers of emotion and deep character analysis. Billy Bob Thorton is as strong as he's ever been as Hank Grotowski, a selfish and racist prison guard who lives with his vicious and hateful father, Buck (Peter Boyle), and his sweet and utterly decent son Sonny (Heath Ledger). Hank hates his father, who has ruined his life up to this point in time, and also says he hates his son, in who he sees the character traits he lost so long ago. Halle Berry is a deadbeat African-American mom of an overweight son (Coronji Calhoun) with a husband (Sean Combs) who is on Death Row. Unforseen tragic events bring these seemingly unmatchable people together, and their mutual hurt and sadness climaxes in one of the most powerful and emotional love scenes in film history. A common complaint I have with sex in the movies these days is that it doesn't ever seem to make sense with the story. This sex scene, however, is a perfect evolution of the story and is an extension of the two characters' mutual need to feel something other than grief. "Make me feel good" Berry cries in a mix of ecstasy and anguish. In another brilliant moment later in the film, Hank gives oral satisfaction to Leticia, but the moment is not uncomfortable or pointless because it illustrates Hank's devotion to this woman and how he is now wholly devoted to giving everything he has to this other person ("I've never done that before."). His act of rescuing her is his own redemption. "Monster's Ball" is a truly beautiful and effective film about redemption and the importance of our love for other human beings. The final shot, with Hank and Leticia on the front porch of Hank's house with a bowl of ice cream, is one of the most quietly poetic and effective endings I have ever seen, and Hank's final line is a perfect closer to a film about the ultimate redemptive quality of love-"I think we're gonna be alright."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film broke my heart and at the same time filled it to swelling. I never cried in the film, but had a lump in my throat the whole time. Halle Berry's intense insecurity mixed with a murky but strong sense of personal pride anchored this film, but Billy-Bob Thornton's brilliance gave it wings. It is incredible to me that he plays such unlikable characters with such pathos, but I am always grateful that he does. He doesn't choose easy stories, and this one is no exception ... a man ugly from the inside but still the most advanced person to come out of his raising. Heath Ledger showed such a weary sadness ... you almost feel glad that he escapes the same cycle, however terrible his method of doing so. I was surprised when the film ended and I felt a sense of hope and not hopelessness. It seemed to be saying that we have a future if we try to forgive and protect each other ... some secrets are about who we have been and will never be again. Forgive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Walk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This project is the first mainstream film to be built around the increasingly popular idea of simultaneous different characters. The root of the idea comes from the Brando school, where an actor both presents the character and his `commitment' to the the character. Over time, and with the saturation of irony in the culture, this has been embellished. The French Lieutenant's woman was the first (at least to me) mainstream film where two roles were fully conflated. Kubrick had pulled the opposite trick with Sellars in Strangelove and Lolita.We have been seeing this notion grow and grow mostly in actor discussion but few performances except those from Penn, Depp, Moore and Blanchett. But it has completely captivated Hollywood. Recently we saw one mainstream solution in Nurse Betty -- relatively simple for the actress to pull off because she was supposed to be unknowingly inhabiting several persona. Ball is another, relatively simple solution.I myself consider it a real evolution in society when advanced notions like this enter the popular mainstream. And there is no mistaking that this film has nothing original, but is an engineered product using ideas tested in the arthouse. No fatal knock, that.The setup here is that the multidimensional bit only happens in the last few seconds. Everything else is preparation for that moment. We know it is coming, underlined by the signals. Among those signals are the artifice of the characters (the evil Dad, the noble, talented prisoner, the poor fat kid), the synthetic situation (three interlocked deaths in three days) and the coincidence (the chance of her waitressing at his diner, the happenstance of his arriving at the accident scene). We are used to such simplification when presented as expository setup. And we are now used to spending a whole film being set up (Blair Witch, Sixth Sense) for that final moment. Hollywood loves it because it sends us out of the theater wondering and talking, and that buzz drives boxoffice.So. The deal is that Ms Berry is supposed to be spending her 110 minutes establishing character dimensions, mileposts, souvenirs throughout the film that she can have us recall in those final moments. `Multidimensional' here means more than real, it means ultrareal, something that is so unusually rich it enriches. The camera helps by adopting the odd ultra real perspectives that have also been wrung out in art houses by clever people. We saw similar mainstream use of these ideas with the recent Mothman.With all THAT setup, I must say that Berry disappoints. She does well enough slogging through the setup, but she is unwisely directed away from the rural blackness that could really have provided scaffold for this richness. Except for some strong jungle evocation in the first sex scene, she acts `white.' A few slang terms and emotions (mostly about her son) are a poor substitute for an investment in thinking and speaking as genuine rural Georgia black.She seems completely unaware of what this situation demands, of setting these places for recovery at the end. So when we are given the big final scene, it doesn't deliver the power it might have. Three graves, ice cream, service station, outside the house, sharing spoons, recalled drawings, sex, comfort, `correction,' resignation, `execution,' prostitution, service, that scene as the last walk. All these and some others were establishing points that we might have seen in her face and manner, in the acceptance of the spoon.There are less than a dozen actors alive capable of doing this, none African-American. My money on the first black woman to hit this level will be Phina Oruche from the UK. No beauty queen -- someone who is coming up through what real actors need to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very brave movie. Not because of the racism or the sex or the execution, but because it trusts its viewers. It does not insult us by making the characters chatter for hours beating the themes into the ground until even the most simple-minded viewer "gets" it. The screenwriters (like William Faulkner and Hemingway and Welty before them) understand that they won't reach most of the population. They teach to the top of the class by entrusting the theme to a few well-placed, well-acted lines. In a culture where few people have ever read a novel, much less a good novel, much less a great novel, this movie is brave enough to be literary. It challenges the viewer to draw from his or her own emotions and life experiences to meet it half-way. Most aren't willing to do that. They take their movies like they take their food, fast and easy. But for those of us looking for more, this is art. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an Oscar Worthy Performance???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie expecting great things. I like all the stars. However, the movie was a major disappointment -long and no plot. First of all, I was not impressed with Halle Berry's performance. She drifted in her character too much - bouncing between poor &amp; ignorant to educated and unlucky. The big sex/nude scene was graphic but not erotic and really didn't add to the storyline.*Spoilers* The storyline itself was totally unbelievable and lacking. What made Thornton's character change? He watched his own child kill himself without any remorse and then suddenly he is in love with a black woman who he comforts because her child is killed? Especially when he is supposed to be a big racist? And you expect me to believe that Halle Berry's character loses her job because she is late to work due to her car dying and her husband being put to death that week, so walking home in the rain her son gets killed by a hit and run driver, and she is losing her home but instead of paying her bills she hocks her rings to buy a hat for Thornton. She has no family or friends either. According to SOME other viewers here, I am not intellectual because I simply don't buy this?The only saving grace to the movie is Heath Ledger's performance. He is on his way to becoming a true star</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I kept waiting for it to get better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film that received so much hype, I've got to say that this is one of the worst wastes of time I've ever sat the entire way through. I kept waiting for a character -- any character -- to utter a sentence longer than 4 words, but it only happens a half dozen times.Did the writer think that having rather graphic sex scenes would make up for the rather boring story? Everyone in the whole movie was a card board cutout. They had no depth at all. It's like everyone took downers before they started shooting. The only time we get to see any life is when Halle Berry is drunk and starts screaming for Billy Bob to make her feel good, and by then it was so over the top that it just got ridiculous.Unless you want to see Halle Berry naked in something other than Swordfish, don't waste your time with this movie. I'll give you the short version: Life sucks in Lousiana/Mississippi/Georgia/the South and racism still exists. He electrocutes her husband, lots of other people die, they get together and the movie doesn't end.The only movie I've EVER seen that's worse than this one is Before Sunrise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Monster With The Marshmallow Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loathe these "change-of-heart" movies. I really do. And Monster's Ball has got to be one of the most loathsome "change-of-heart" flicks that I've seen in a mighty long time.Take, for instance, the despicable main character in Monster's Ball - Georgia prison guard, Hank Grotowski. At present Hank is working execution detail on Death Row. What Hank is, is a really, really nasty, bitter, crybaby of an ex-cop. And if that side of Hank isn't detestable enough, then Hank's also one hell of a lousy drunk, and a mean, cussing, foul-mouthed, hateful racist, to boot. (These, of course, are all of Hank's good points.) With that firmly in mind - What bothers me here is that suddenly, like, overnight ("Presto! Change-O!") Hank does this complete about-face thing. Not only does Hank immediately stop hating Blacks, and begin treating them respectfully, but he also starts fornicating with a black woman named Leticia.And I don't care what anyone says - Nobody - I repeat - Nobody with such a deep-rooted hatred and animosity, as Hank had towards blacks, could ever possibly change so bloody fast as he did. It was a goddamn miracle. There would always be some remaining residue of hate and racism left smouldering under that cool, mild-mannered facade. It's impossible to be otherwise - We humans don't work in any other way. We don't.Now, please, don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't believe that people can change - People can and do - But this is something that takes a lot of time, many years, in fact. And, I'm sorry, but considering Hank's background; this change in him was too unrealistically abrupt for me to accept. It seemed so phony and pretentious. Since the overall essence of this flick's story was directed at "realism" Hank's instant "conversion" to black-lover ruined that effect completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My second favourite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first became interested in this movie because I am a Halle Berry fan. It was not at all what I expected when I first watched it, so I was unsure of it. But I watched it again and now I love this movie and own it on VHS. It is hard hitting and hard to watch in places. But also very tender in a subtle sort of way in others. It confronts all the issues laid out in the movie with gusto. It is what I would call a "no holds barred" movie. It follows the lives of two very different people and their families and the people that they meet in everyday life. After a series of unfortunate, and sometimes tragic events these two people's lives become intertwined. In every day life, there are issues of racism, the death penalty, abuse and loneliness for these people. Tragedy strikes the two main characters, Hank and Leticia, in different ways yet the tragedy is similar in that they both lose their sons. The fact that they have this in common brings them together in an ironic twist. Sex also plays a part in how this movie progresses. From signifying the loneliness of a man who has to depend on a prostitute for affection, to the need of two ordinary people to get a respite, even if temporary, from a lot of heartache. The movie pivots on the latter of these sex scenes. It gives Hank and Leticia hope that things may not be so bad from now on. It is a raw, emotional and explicit scene, but it works because it is essential to the plot. After this the movie explores the highs and lows of their relationship. But you want things to work out between them after all that has happened. Can they learn to overcome their personal tragedies? Can they learn to love again? What does the future hold? If you want to know the answers, watch this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is open minded about the issues dealt with in this movie. In my opinion Halle Berry deserved the Oscar. But Marc Forster and Billy Bob Thornton should have got one also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, engaging work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of gritty, fuzz-free reality drama that keeps you musing about it long past the ending credits. It is unsparing in its depiction of all the light and dark sides of the human psyche, from racism to passion to insularity and even corpulence, mounting these on a platform so stark and unambiguous that the audience is not left with many choices - the reactions evoked are exactly the ones intended to be evoked, oscillating between disgust, outrage, sympathy, tenderness and occasionally, even a surreptitious smile.Most of the characters in the movie suffer somewhat from a lack of complexity, which is compensated for by casting them into circumstantial conflict to create the dramatic tension (a husband is electrocuted, a child dies, another child sends a bullet through his heart and into the couch behind, and so on). This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially because the remarkable performances (particularly from Halle Berry) validate this ploy. The exception to this, however, is the character of Hank Grotowski, played by Billy Bob Thornton. Billy Bob succeeds in imparting a subtle gray shade to this seemingly cardboard-cutout poster-boy-for-the-old-bigoted-south character that makes you hesitate from accepting him at face value. Is this simply about a saturnine, jaded racist being transformed by true love? Well, yes, that's part of it - the obvious part. But something keeps nagging you, preventing you from accepting this linear, justifiable inference, making you want to probe deeper, discover the reasons he has turned out this way, and even, in a perverse way, rationalize them. Is it just the provincial social climate? Is it the long proximity to his bigoted dotard of a father (played admirably by Peter Boyle)? Is he really that way or is he simply going with the flow? No simple explanation seems satisfactory - and the credit for this questioning, this need for deconstruction, goes to Billy Bob's nuanced performance.All in all, beside the fact that some of the scenes may unsettle the squeamish, and that some promising characters like that of Grotowski's dispirited, conflicted son Sonny (played by Heath Ledger) were knocked off too early, the picture satisfies most norms for a good cinema experience - it makes you think, weep, squirm, analyze, rationalize, everything but walk out before it is over. In other words, it is what good cinema is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished seeing this movie for the first time. I'll begin by saying that it's been some time since a film got the reaction out of me this one did. For the first 45 minutes, I was convinced this movie was intent on trying to be the most depressing story ever told. For the next 45 minutes, I was still interested, but my overall opinion was hanging on the ending..of which I was very skeptical, as I knew what was left to be revealed. Then, it was over. Boy, they just don't make enough of 'em that good, folks.When you see a movie for the first time after it's already won mad Oscars, you end up judging performances based on that. Most times, it doesn't help their cause. Kim Basinger in LA Confidential (another movie I love) springs to mind. Up to the last 10 minutes of this movie, my opinion was that Halle had done a real nice job...it was an interesting character, and she certainly hadn't done anything to screw it up. Then, came that moment on the back steps...and that look...and that immediate realization that sometimes we're just along for the damn ride, and there ain't a whole lot anybody can do about it but try and hang on and not get run over. That five seconds defines this movie...if it doesn't work, the whole thing crashes. I applaud her craft--she totally nailed it.This is definitely Billy Bob's best performance since Sling Blade...a movie so good, it almost becomes cliche in your memory. There are times here when he carries himself with a beaten-down grace that is just brilliantly complex. Who knows where this character would end up in the hands of another actor, but I can't think of one that would have left me feeling the same way.For those of you who don't get this movie--be it for the lack of attention to certain strings of logic in what appears to be a real small town; or for its refusal to spell out for you what somebody may be thinking from moment to moment, let alone from day to day...well, I'm sure the next Matrix is gonna be real good, too. I'm just glad that there are still folks out there making movies that can totally exist on a back porch with a pint of ice cream.I give this film a 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shame. It's the feeling of being less than, of being flawed. It's the suspicion that, no matter how well you do, something's still lacking; that somewhere, somehow, you could'a-would'a-should'a done better. To be good or excellent isn't enough: the only valid measure is perfection, a frustrating standard that changes with every change of perspective. It's the feeling of being inadequate at some fundamental level. And that's why I think Monster's Ball is an outstanding film: it's an unusually bold excursion into the personal and social dynamics of shame, which are inherently intertwined.Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) plays a Mississippi `corrections' officer, who has the job of escorting death row inmates to the electric chair. His father, also a `corrections' officer before him, views his life of service as so just and honorable, as does Hank. Hank's son, Sonny, is dutifully carrying the torch to the third generation. Why, you'd be just brass statue proud to have the Grotowskis as neighbors, such upstanding pillars of the community. Inside, however, the Grotowskis are haunted by demons of self-doubt, and self-hatred.A Monster's Ball is a set of rituals that steady the death row officers's nerves, and sets up bulwarks against the shame they feel. There's the obligatory pre-execution prayer: `They are brought down and fallen,' they chant, `but we are risen upright.' And when they practice their chthonic craft, they can't allow themselves to be human, to feel, or display, emotion -- the ultimate sin. So when Sonny commits the blasphemy of forming an emotional connection with the sentenced man, he lets his feelings show, and receives the full force of his father's considerable ability to shame. Hank condemns him as `weak,' a `woman,' a `pussy,' and a `piece of s**t.' Hank might just as well have taken out a gun and shot him himself.Hank's redemption comes out of his personal tragedy. It's not sentimental or contrived. He makes mistakes, but he starts down the right path. It's tragic, but also very uplifting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hear a lot of people say how 'slow' the movie seems....I think they are missing out that this is intentional to show the deadness felt inside by the characters. I loved the scene where the horrible racist father is taken to the nursing home and handed over to the care of an all black staff- a fate worse than death to him. I didn't understand the sex scenes intensity until I read a review here- that said it was about emotion release. I realized then that it was another step in rejecting what his father stood for- at that point it was an act of defiance and he gave himself over entirely to it. I thought it was brilliant and made me think of how we perform sex for many different reasons. I think she also was finding some kind of defiance in that she wanted to 'live' again after the death of husband and son. Or some kind of punishment I haven't decided yet. Then the final scenes come..the newly fixed up house and the possibility that there will soon be laughter and love and caring within these same walls that housed so much hate. WHen she is sitting on the steps and looks over at the graves- to me it says she is tired of death and hate and she wants to live again. I think she realizes his entire journey and why he was with her...but that it was a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was enormously relieved that the end of this movie was... sort of... happy. I don't think I could take much more sorrow. Some might say the down-trodden feel this movie had was overdone, however I think every bit of the misery shown in this film is necessary. It is true to life. Anyone who watches the news can see that the world is full of sad stories like these, and to say it is "cliche" or "overdone" is a bit blind. The brutal reality is what really clinched me and kept me involved up until the end.Each character in this beautifully casted film had moments that wowed me, but Thorton and Berry by far stole the show. This was the first Billy Bob Thorton film I had seen, and one of the best. The transformation he undergoes is amazing. Going from such a stone-hearted man to a loving caretaker(/sex god) was not only impressive, but enjoyable. It really makes you believe that it's never too late to find happiness. I think that's really what this movie is about- finding happiness. Or rather, not being alone. It makes a lot of statements about racism, and the differences between generations, but at the root of it, it's simply about two lonely people coming together. Halle Berry as Leticia shows that sometimes it is a struggle to accept happiness when it is found. After being stripped of it for so long, it's a wonder she managed to accept it in the end. It was a risk, but obviously she made the right choice. The final scene stole my breath. When they sat beside each other on the back porch you couldn't help but feel this wonder... it was somewhat inconclusive and mysterious. We don't know what happens next, it seems their story continues... but we know that whatever happens next they will face together, in contrast to the desperate loneliness they both experienced in the start of the film.Ah I have more to say, but I'm kinda tired of typing. I'm sure you can find it in other reviews there's like fifty billion of them anyway.</fullReview>

He does a wonderful job in this wonderful movie portraying a death row inmate named Tyrell Musgrove, the husband of Leticia, played by Halle Berry. The film starts off dealing with the relationship between Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and his son Sonny (Heath Ledger) and Sonny's learning the ropes of becoming a prison guard like his dear old dad. Tyrell is a complicated character because we automatically sympathize with the enormity of his situation, trying to explain to his son in front of a prison guard why he's not going to be around anymore, but at the same time he accepts his fate because he has brought it upon himself. It is significant that this is a man who has committed a crime and doesn't fight against the system when the punishment is imposed, because he deserves it. In one of the most potent lines in the entire film, he tells his son, `I'm a bad man, you're the best of me.'Hank is also a very complicated character. This is an enormously racist man who chases a couple of young black kids off his property by shooting a shotgun into the air, even when the kids only came over to play with his son. He knew that they meant no harm, and he still fired into the air to scare him away. This is the movie's protagonist, and there is soon a scene with the father of those two boys where you want nothing more than to see Hank get dragged out of his car and smacked around for a little while. But the movie amazingly develops his character enough so that we are able to look deeper into who exactly he is and what kind of past he has had, and to forgive him for who he is and accept him as the protagonist.(spoilers) Several of the characters are portrayed in this way, with very conflicting characteristics that challenge you to develop a straightforward opinion of any of them (except for Hank's father, who is such a heavily racist redneck that there is no question from the very beginning that he's going to be nothing but trouble). The movie reminds us that the mark of an intelligent mind is the ability to hold conflicting opinions of the same thing and still be able to function, and we are able to do this because we get to know Hank so much better. His racism is a result of the way his father raised him, and even the way he handled (and, indeed, caused) the death of his son can be seen as having been caused by having been raised by a man who has implanted the idea that those who cannot be racist are `weak.'Halle Berry gives a powerful role as Leticia, whose life is spinning completely out of control. Her husband has been executed (which is a huge shock to her even though she is obviously so emotionally detached from him), she has lost her job, her landlord is evicting her by force of the law, and her son is hopelessly overweight. The majority of the narrative story comes from the interaction between Hank and Leticia, who are both going against their morals and beliefs, to a varied extent, in associating with each other, and each of their eventual realizations of who the other person is.It is significant that Hank learns that Leticia is the widow of the man he had recently put to death (and who's death indirectly lead to his own son's suicide) and that he reacts by trying to keep her from finding out that he had helped kill her husband. Their interaction with each other provides the redemption of each of their sins up to that point, especially his. He has overcome his racism to genuinely care about this woman, and he wants to hide who he is from her for her own protection and also because he is afraid to lose her. The movie reminds me a little bit of those old Babar books. You know, the ones with the big talking elephant from the jungle. In Babar books, characters actually die. This is a rarity in children's literature. Babar's own mother was shot by a poacher, but you always turn the page and move on with the story, which is a great metaphor for life. In Monster's Ball, there are plenty of tragic events, and the execution of Tyrell and Leticia getting fired and evicted are not even the worst of them. But as is evident in the closing scene in the film (which I didn't like at all until I stopped to think about it), she is moving on from her troubles, albeit with an unlikely companion, but at least one who seems more than willing to move on with her. He has defected from his racist past by putting his verbally abusive father into a retirement home, and has turned all of his efforts to Leticia in hopes of finding a better life with her. The movie ends rather suddenly, but it ends with the promise of better times to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb. All the elements of superior filmmaking are very much in evidence in Marc Forster's tale of racism and redemption in the Deep South, not the least of which is Forster's passionate yet understated direction. He's a foreigner (born in Germany and raised in Switzerland) but unlike other foreign directors making films in Hollywood (Sam Mendes being a prime example), he seems to have a clear insight into how Americans respond to their surroundings and has no interest in patronizing his audience by exploiting those responses. Forster's use of camera placement is impressive: many of the scenes are shot in a way that makes us feel we're eavesdropping on some very intimate moments; and the feeling that the characters are caged by their surroundings is evoked through his use of line. The spare and sophisticated screenplay (by Milo Addica and Will Rokas) is about institutionalized bigotry passed down in a womanless family of prison guards (father Peter Boyle, son Billy Bob Thornton and grandson Heath Ledger) and how extreme emotions come to resolve the ambiguity associated with such hatred--the characters, in their search for release from hatred's grip, become better men by taking the actions they take. The performances couldn't be better: Halle Berry gives the performance of a lifetime as the black woman who enters and fulfills Thornton's life; she acts with an intelligence and uncommon vulnerability that gives her character dignity in spite of her contradictions; and Thornton, for a change, refuses to mug it up for the camera. (Boyle, Ledger and Sean Combs in smaller roles, are equally fine.) The evocatively saturated camerawork is by Roberto Schaefer and the quietly effective score is by Asche and Spencer. It will be interesting to see where the careers of all associated with `Monster's Ball' go but this stands a powerful testament to their talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>United by common tragedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful, heartbreaking film about two people who are united by tragic circumstances, and who find small miracles in the power of love and inner change. Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton, who always does a great job) is a tired, unhappy prison guard (not sure what state, MS or AL???) who works death row. His kid Sonny (an absolutely searing, gorgeous performance by Heath Ledger) is following the career path, and his newness is not given any mercy by Hank. When Sonny makes mistakes, Hank is a beast, and to put it mildly, their relationship is based on quiet hatred of one another. Father Buck (Peter Boyle) doesn't make things any easier for anyone, because he is a racist of the highest order.The newest execution is of Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs). Even though nothing all that bad happens, Hank is so awful to Sonny that he pushes the kid over the brink and Sonny kills himself. Even though Hank overtly appears not to care at all (even having admitted to Sonny that he hates him) you can see the inner change happen immediately. Hank abruptly resigns his job at the prison and buys a gas station. He padlocks Sonny's room, and cannot have sex with the local hooker once she mentions Sonny's name. Yes, Hank is grieving the loss of Sonny, and perhaps he never really hated Sonny, perhaps he only hated himself, or at least the way his life was going.The other main character is Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry, who DID SO deserve this Oscar) the widow of Lawrence. She struggles with so much, a faulty car, possible eviction, financial problems, looming alcoholism, and an adorable, yet very overweight child, Tyrell, who is trying his best to cope alongside his mother. She smokes and drinks, he overeats, and of course, his mother is very hard on him about his imperfections. Hank and Leticia are very similar before they even share a scene together, and even more so after Tyrell is hit by a car and killed.Once Hank and Leticia find a bond and some healing with each other, they both finally experience some happiness. Hank learns that he doesn't have to worry about whether or not Buck approves of him. Late, but better late then never. Leticia learns that after all of the horrible things that have happened, her husband letting her down, her son's tragic death, the losses of her home and car, it's possible that someone will come along and lend their heart, give everything they have to you, and share their heartaches with you so that you won't feel so alone.Some have called MONSTER'S BALL a majorly depressing film, and yes, there is a lot of stuff that can depress you, but in my opinion, the ending is quite uplifting. To be honest, even the sex scene, which is gritty and graphic, cannot be described to me as "cheap" or "gratuitous". Rather, I found it to be so full of catharsis that it seemed like all their emotions, love, grief, hate, etc. were flying all over the room.A great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly Powerful!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From one our most promising younger directors, another masterpiece was born. Forster's subtly moving and deeply honest portrayal of two individuals from a small southern town is very real, and all the more powerful for it. Like the early 1960s, the early 2000s was a time of political turmoil, economic ambivalence, tragedy, and a chain of events that caused millions of us to reconsider and reflect the issues of human nature and human cruelty, and Monster's Ball was nothing short of a powerful projection of the times. Thorton and Berry were amazing as the two Central Characters and shared a surprisingly natural chemistry, not only empowering the realism of the narrative, but the authenticity of the complex emotions that accompany the best and worst of extremes, love and hate. As well as a more than believable concept, nuanced performances, the film itself is full of hidden meanings, motifs, and brilliant symbolisms. The symphonic score by Asche and Spencer accessed at the right moments, not to theatrically manipulate us into feeling prescribed emotions, but subtly hinting at the emotions of the Central characters as well as a thoughtful melodic reflection, coalescing into an enchantingly soft and melodious close. That year, the Oscar for best performance went to Halle Berry, and deservedly so. Overall, a great film, gently compelling it's viewers to question the way we treat ourselves and others into greater consideration. 8/10. Excellent Film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Harsh Realities of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a series of hardships Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) finds himself alone in the world, with his only son committing suicide and his ever-nagging father always riding him about every little thing. Hank is a prison guard that works on death row at a maximum-security prison where his son was also a guard. While at one of his favorite diners, he comes across a waitress whose luck is no better than his own. Leticia (Halle Berry) has also recently had to deal with the death of her husband who was on Hank's watch on death row. Leticia's son passed away shortly after his father when a car hit him as he was walking home from the diner with his mom. Hank helps her out the night he died and they form an emotional relationship. Director Mark Forster did a wonderful job showing us how in every situation some good can come out and to never give up when it seems all is lost. The character choice was great, Billy Bob Thornton is a passionate actor along with Halle Berry's flare. Tragedies like these happen every day and it was good to see some of the struggles each character faced and the positive that came from this. Monster's Ball had little suspense but all of the tragedy made up for that. Seeing outside of the box is what made this movie so interesting. Hank's father was racist toward the African American race which made the plot a little more suspenseful. The interest that I had in this movie was that it showed a person's will to move on even after a life shattering experience. The story line was catchy but for me the movie started off kind of slow. Once the plot got going, it seemed to hold me in my seat and I didn't find myself wanting to leave the room. All in all, this was a good movie. I wouldn't have given it a five out of five stars, but it earned a firm three. With this, I would definitely watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is real. It's more real than most movies, that claim to base on real life. It's more real than most dramas claiming to be real life drama. Nothing is over the top, all reactions feel natural and real.Hank (Billy Bob Thorton) is a man, shadowed by his ill father Buck (Peter Boyle), a racist and a tough man, who hasn't shown love for him or anyone else. This attitude has rubbed itself on Hank, who's son Sonny (Heath Ledger) suffers from it. Leticia (Halle Berry) is a mother of obese child Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) and a wife of death row convict Lawrence (Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs). It all might be just a coincidence, or faith, but Hank and Sonny are death row guards in the jail where Lawrence is executed. From that moment the ball starts to roll: Sonny's first execution, expectations of Hank, failure of the son and final accusation.By the act of faith Hank and Leticia end up together, Leticia not knowing the identity of Hank, and Hank trying to shake the shadow of his father from his shoulders, hating the man he was and hating the man who his father is.Without actors this movie wouldn't have worked. The movie doesn't rely on the special effects or clever camera tricks: it relays on the actors carrying on the plot. Wole cast does tremendously good work, especially I was surprised by P. Diddy, who didn't act like your typical gangsta rapper or gangsta wannabe. He acted a man on a death row.I suppose, that Monster's Ball is one of the movies which you like or think that they are boring. For me this was a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive, puzzling and possibly enlightening...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a while since I've last watched a movie filled with such overwhelming tension and that leaves you thinking about its contents amidst inevitable controversy. I've gone through a few other comments on the movie and, to my despair, a lot of people seem to have missed the whole point of the movie. I don't seem to be able to have an explanation for the title (the Portuguese one was much more explicit - Depois do dio = After Hatred, or In The Aftermath of Hatred in a more elaborate back translation). Maybe it refers to a local expression (by the way, what state does the action take place in - Alabama, maybe ?) but I feel that, somehow, it should account for the overall sensation or perception this movie should leave us with. I'd like to point out to whoever reads this comment that, being an european myself, I can't share the traditional conservative look some of the americans gave at the sex scenes. These were key points to the whole plot. I remember 4:1 - Sonny &amp; Vera (the prostitute) - where his tension in anticipation for the upcoming event is rapidly released in a flashy dogstyle intercourse (premature climax). Looking back, it becomes only natural that he kills himself once he realizes what he had always feared... 2 - Hank &amp; Vera (again, Vera) - where his tension &amp; grief mix up and lead him to a complete failure in his intention to have sex (impotence ?). Remember both son and father were to do it in the same style... 3 - Hank &amp; Leticia - where she releases the mounting tension between both on account of "feeling good" and he releases his tension upon realizing she is actually the widow of the man he helped executing. From my point of view, this is one the best sex scenes ever depicted in a contextual fashion and the "bird in cage" flashes provide it with the allegory that helps to state the case: They both need each other (then and from then on). 4 - Hank &amp; Leticia (again) - where Hank finally convinces Leticia he's on to her not just for the fun but also to really "please" (care for) her... the sometimes regarded as "submissive" act (oral sex on her) accounts for an unprejudiced attitude.Finally, a few words on the somewhat puzzling and disapointing (for some) ending:Are they really "going to be alright" ?On the one hand, Leticias's expression is... inexpressive and Hank's expression seems to be non-challante and reveals no awareness. On the other hand, the whole setting leads us to a bleak and morbid sensation: Graves of people that committed suicide (2 out 3 for sure); A pitch black sky before them.But, as the last frames of the movie are passing on screen, one can still envision a starry sky. Is this the element of hope ? In the Aftermath of Hatred for him ? In the Aftermath of Grief for both ?Can't you read the message ? Racism ! Hatred ! Grief ! Loneliness ! Despair !A final note: the director was born in Germany. Ring a bell ?</fullReview>

It is about common people who are trying to make a living, and about the harshness of life. Allahu akbar. The Lord gives and the Lord takes. This is about common people who have been struck by life. But they can't give up. Disturbinf however is how well the man and the woman cope with the loss of their children.

		<shortDescription>Just as many open questions real life offers to us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is outstanding and one of the best dramas i've ever seen.Some might ask why, because there seems to be nothing really happening at all during the whole movie. Some say the plot is predictable and flat, and the characters too. In my opinion this is just not true. Try to tell the story in one or two lines. Most of the movies can be told in just a short summary, but this does not work for "Monster's Ball" at all. E.g. : "A prison guard falls in love with the wife of a prisoner he just executed". This is a simple tagline, but if you think of what could have happened to this basic plot with other directors, actors or script writers, the feeling of the movie goes in ten thousand different directions. But none of them matches this version. And this is, what makes "Monster's Ball" extremely outstanding.This movie offers so many different plotlines, questions, and in-depth-characters you simply cannot describe the feeling of the movie and what is really happening here without telling every little bit of it. Yes, it's sad, and it's depressing, and it gives absolutely no answer to any problem at all (which we basically all want, while watching a movie). But in the end, despite all the drama, it's full of warmth and hope. And this is what it's all about. Just after the credits begin to appear, you sit there and think - about anything.Technically "Monster's Ball" is nearly perfect. There is not a single scene, which could be missed and everything is at it's right place. The excellent music goes with well played characters and the timing makes the whole athmosphere so intense you cannot escape and switch off, even if you know that there will be no "great solution" at all. Some might say it's boring, and yes, you're right - but in this case "Monster's Ball" is simply not the movie you expected.This one plays with anything we expect from a drama, and this is why most of the other dramas fail and "Monster's Ball" works. Other "so called drama" try to give us solutions, great feelings, great moments in life, and all the other rubbish. But "Monster's Ball" is so slow and intense and ignores all of the standard "drama issues" you have to think for yourselve what this is all about.For me it's about love, hate, hope, racism, father-son/mother-son relationships, escaping from your past life, death, depressions, failures and many other things. Everything is shown and nothing is really explained. Just like life basically is - full of complex problems we create for ourselves. Some of them can be solved in one or another way, most of them we just ignore, and life still goes on, because we are able to exist with a whole universe of lies around us.</fullReview>

The direction and execution is so dull and mechanical, there is nothing to hold the viewer's interest. For sure, there are some great ideas behind the camera, but what is the point if the film itself is aesthetically ugly and quite dull? There is nothing here to pique, let alone maintain interest, throughout. What we have is something that could better be served as a made-for-tv afternoon time waster. Yes, the ideas are important, and there is great human drama involved, but what indeed is the point to making a film that one must wade through like a mangrove swamp? Watching this film will not enlighten nor entertain. It could have been so much more. As it stands, there seems to be no reason for the existance, let alone the success, of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget what people say about this movie when they abuse it. It seems that many people can't associate with the underlying message this movie is offering. Put simply, this is a movie about realising you are on a dark path. A path that will lead you only to become bitter and lonely. The bitter and lonely character in this move is Hank's (Billy Bob's) father who is a decrepit and bitter racist with nobody in his life. Billy Bob Thornton puts in a fantastic performance as a man who went right to the edge, and managed to step back and put his life back onto the right path.It took him the loss of his son by suicide, which he sees was probably caused by him and the reaction of his father at the son's funeral ("He was weak"), to come to this realisation.From the perspective of Halle Berry's character, she also has a journey of her own. At the very final scene of the movie, you sense that she understands all that Hank has gone through and why he wants to treat somebody so well - and love someone for the first time, too.Get the movie. Chill out, sit back and don't dismiss this as some kind of "art house" film for the sake of it because it's not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet and acre as chocolate ice cream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(a late review that contains spoilers and talks about sex)Under the surface of events that takes place in Monster's Ball lies the heart of a deep melodrama. It is a film about the transformation of two completely different persons, gathered by a common sense of loss and an urge to start over.Harsh to his own son, subservient to his rude and prejudicious father, strict as a rock in his job as a prison guard, Hank is a man that has assumed a series of roles for himself in the course of his life. Grown in the codes of discipline and hatred, he is forced to face his growing emptiness after the tragic death of his son. Although insensitive to his own grief, Hank will find a strange and unpredictable attachment with Leticia, a black woman going through a much more painful process of mourning. Love comes as a redemption to Hank, and Leticia welcomes him in her life passionate and desperately.After a sweetly balanced approach their attraction comes together in what is an intense scene where the limits of love and sex are undistinguishable. It's certainly surprising to see a sex scene so deeply consequent to a film like the one in Monster's Ball. Controversies (childish to say the least) on the side, what this film shows is how the union of a man and a woman can change someone, and how sex can be the trigger to a process of breaking the barriers between people. And what this film, apparently simple but complex at the same time, has of brilliant, is that it expresses love in a way that is also profoundly physical. This is not your nineteenth century romantic, idealistic and dessexualized love. It is a truthful display of the mechanics of sexuality as something bigger and pure, and in that sense, it is a contemporary portray of love that is understandable far beyond the social context where it originates from. In that sense, there is nothing of fantastic in Hank's changes of attitude towards life and others. What changes in him is the very reference of an emotional relation that he never had or knew before.Deeply contemporary, this look at love that manifests itself as an inverted melodrama of two beings that find in one another the strength and dignity that was missing in their lives. This is a five star movie, sweet and acre as a chocolate ice cream...</fullReview>

There was not a moment I can feel that Billy was racist, it just seems like the actors are going through the motions but really can't connect emotionally. Bill is an excellent actor, I loved him in "Man who wasn't there", but I don't feel he got enough chance to perform here. Halle, well, she is famous for being beautiful and she got paid one extra milion for the sex scene, but can she really act? I don't know, the film didn't give her enough room to show that. I think the main problem with this film is the story. It doesn't flow very well. One second Hank's son die and the next Leticia 's son die and tension was not even being built for these supposed 'important scenes', I got the feeling that the director wanted to get these over and done with so that we can get to the main concern in the movie, that is the relationship between Leticia and Hank. It was way too easy for Hank to feel sorry Leticia if he is a racist. And what is up with Leticia's son being killed by a car? One second they were walking on the street and the next second he was on the ground with his mom by his side. If one just want to watch a film where a man who is extremely racial prejudice against a race and later learns to accept and ask for redemption, watch American History X. The acting in that is alittle bit more realistic.</fullReview>

They did themselves proud...I felt that the way Halle was dressed seemed too LA for Mississippi...Although her wardrobe was out of syn, Miss Berry gave the performance of her life. She was great...actually the entire cast was great...Peter Boyle and Heath Ledger deserve mentioning...so much conveyed with so few words.This was not an easy film to watch, but it was well worth the ride.</fullReview>

Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry (in her Oscar-winning performance), Heath Ledger, Peter Boyle, Sean Combs, and Mos Def all deliver magnificent performances.Credit must go to the director (Marc Foster)and writer's (Milo Addica &amp; Will Rokos) for their heartfelt work.Need I say more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to write only after reading other users comments on this movie. Some users complained that it was "too depressing", "not one smile", "like picking scabs". What? Maybe they can't understand what a tragedy piece is about. Shakespeare did plenty of them and, yes, lots of people died, there wasn't a happy moment, parents mourned the loss of a child. TRAGEDY. But, there was a happy moment. It was after Hank's father, Peter Boyle, makes his nasty, racist insults to Leticia and Hank finds out about it. The next scene is Hank dropping his father off at a nursing home! HA HA!Now that my rant is over... I thoroughly enjoyed the subtle change that Thornton's character goes through. He didn't announce that he was against racism and to prove it he was going to have an African-American girlfriend, Halle Berry's Leticia. They each saw something good in each other. Their personal tradegies opened them up to caring for each other. Even when they eventually found out about each other, each one silently bore the revelation of their connection and they ended up saying that they were going to be okay. It didn't get preachy.I enjoyed the directing, as well. Lingering shots of a burning cigarette in an empty room, reflections in windows, odd shots of someone's hand in a birdcage, and the magnifying mirror in different bathrooms set motifs that suggested different layers in this film of tragedy and acceptance. No real violence or gore, this movie moved through emotion. I even liked the way it ended. Quietly. You realize that they rescued each other.The characters were well acted but I'm happiest that Halle Berry won the Oscar for her performance. She has played a broad range of roles from confident (Swordfish), tragic (Monster's Ball), historical (Dorothy Dandridge), to comedic (BAPS) women with skill. Such a gracious attitude and love of acting is why I think that she'll always be a favorite. Congratulations, Halle!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling story of loss, love, and growth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that upon watching Monster's Ball the first time, I was not prepared for the shock value of the film. But upon viewing it a second time, I was able to see it for what it was. It's a journey about growth and change in life, and how bad times can actually make a person stronger in character. I thought that both Thornton and Berry's portrayls of their characters were uninhibited and as real as they come. The appearances by rappers Puff Daddy and Mos Def may have attracted out of genre audiences, but added to the messages behind the film. The characters were well developed and had great chemistry; the script was well-written and executed; and the message is lasting. Of course, I can't spoil what that message is, so those of you who have yet to catch this flick should by all means rent or pay per view it in order to understand what I mean. Caution: there are some graphic scenes reminiscent of American History X, so children are strongly cautioned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part of the reason this movie is so depressing is the absolute lack of any of the usual glitz and glamour American moviegoers tend to associate with their big-screen experiences. The movie is a no-frills-attached, no-holds-barred look at the worst turns life can take. The understated direction and the uniformly fantastic, subtle acting (even P-Diddy was so believable as Halle Berry's condemned husband that I had to check the credits twice to be sure it was him) seem to state, "this is life. life is awful." I left the movie too depressed to even cry.</fullReview>

Because of these lowered expectations, I ended up liking the work very much, completing a sort of self-psyche out. Anyway the acting was very impressive, as was the story (though you have to shelf the implusabilty of the plot and the overkill on tragedy). Unlike many I liked the upbeat ending and thought it a nice contrast to the ultra-depressing first act (when Berry is abusing her child I had was left chilled). Also the sex scenes were far from gratutious, they are the nexus that show the characters inner turmoil: The shallow prostitute tableus demonstrate the lonliness of their exhistance, the intital love scene between Berry and Thornton represents release and acceptance, and the oral-sex scene evinces Thorton's genuine intentions (as opposed to his father's harshness). A great film overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love truly conquers all in this wonderful, warm story of loss and redemption. Full of the Human Conflict - what is love, who is good, can ultimate sin be redeemed. A little too much information from Billy Bob as to sexual technique. Although well shot, sex scenes run a little long, adding an unneeded edge to Halle's Historical Oscar-winning performance. No complaints about the sexuality in general; it just seems like a whole different movie. Berry's best acting is in her subtle, yearning, silent reflection and grief. There are scenes too painful to watch but too touching to miss. Brutal and deadly racism takes on compassionate self-mending and gets a bloody thrashing. Peter Boyle represents the Old Ways and is put away for good. This sudden classic will shine through time as one of the most thought-provoking analyses of the human condition of its age. But what (where did I miss this?) is the Monster's Ball? I feel like an idiot about this. I mean really, What is it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compressed, But Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: One or two very minor spoilers.This is an excellent movie that portrays a large segment of American society without gratuitously "trashing" its members (as the Coen brothers are fond of doing). Oh sure, Billy Bob Thornton's character is a racist, but not because he lives in Louisiana, but because he and his family are warped, ignorant, morally bankrupt, and dumbed-down.The characters are not fully developed. That would have taken another two hours, at least. Halle Berry's relationship with Puff Daddy Combs is important, but it isn't clear to what extent it is important, or exactly how it shapes her relationship with Billy Bob Thornton. Billy Bob's reaction to the shooting in his living room is, I suppose, believable, considering how emotionally "numb" everyone in the household is, but it is still hard to fathom. But, the director did a masterful job given the time constraints of a two-hour movie and the incredible amount of material within the story.The torrid love scene near the end of the film was not offensive, but as a major turning point in the relationship between Billy and Halle, I think it was unnecessary. In fact, the two of them could have gently caressed, and the effect would have been the same. I thought Halle showed excellent range in her acting skills, and I think she earned her Oscar. I also think that Billy Bob has staked his claim to being one of the generation's finer actors.It's a good movie. It's all about forgiveness, redemption, and hope. Billy Bob is right: Things are going to be all right.  </fullReview>

This story told of the estrangement and despair that could result from generations of bigotry. I am not sure if I believe such a person would ever be capable of loving someone previously despised, but (Hank) Billy Bob Thorton managed to convince the audience of his devotion to (Leticia) Halle Berry. I was also impressed with Sean Combs' performance as Lawrence (dead man walking). I can see why this film received so many nominations and why Halle Berry won the Oscar. The portrayal of two far from perfect people turning to each other for comfort was very human. A tough subject, done brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent drama - ignore the controversy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a shame that Halle Berry's Oscar (TM) win created controversy that will prejudice so many viewers who will want to find her performance lacking. She is excellent in this film, as is Thornton and Boyle.Many negative reactions posted here call Thornton's character a racist. I wouldn't describe him that way. He is a product of his environment who needs to be prodded by his racist father to mis-behave. He appears to treat his black co-worker just like he treats his white ones, and the soon-to-be-executed prisoner's race is never an issue. Neither is he "poor white trash". He exudes blue-collar dignity in his work as a very senior uniformed prison guard. He mostly treats everyone he deals with politely, and with respect.My favorite things about this film include the intra-family dynamics of the 3 generations of single men. None of these men seems to have the capacity to form any worthwhile connection to a woman. Thornton's character's ability to leap THIS divide is as important as his ability to bridge the racial divide. The secret of this screenplay is that it really doesn't matter a bit that the Halle Berry character is black. Thornton falling in love with a white woman would have been just as dramatic a breakthrough for his character, who has apparently never loved ANYONE. The sex scene is graphic but absolutely central to the plot. For me, the heavy drinking beforehand made it quite credible. I don't think these two would have fallen into each other's arms if they had been sober. But the alcohol and their shared anguish led them to something that transformed their lives.I think this is an excellent drama, and I did NOT think it moved slowly, as some others here have complained. A lot of things happen in this movie, and the characters have a long way to go to reach each other.Doug Ellice</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo...but what a bummer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this one after "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back." Obviously two very different films, from entirely differing worlds.Now at the risk of sounding like an idiot, I have to say I definitely enjoyed foul mouthed Jay more than any characters in this film (short of Halle Berry and her hot body!) Ahem. Okay, point being, sometimes life sucks. Some films take a realistic, real-world view of who and what we are, our flaws and our dark side, and they tell a story from this point of view.Often, because these movies are grounded in the realism of existence versus Hollywood glitz and glam, they tend to be huge bummers and this was definitely no exception. This is why we go to the movies--to escape reality and the pain of life, not because we want to sit in some dung heap and wallow in mass, self-pitying depression. Well, at least this is why I dig the mindless action, sophomoric humor and the occasional lack of thought requirement much of Gollywood submits for our perusal.At other times, it's nice to see the solid realism acted to perfection, whether or not one chooses to analyze it all from some arrogant stance. Without analysis, because it is so often done to excess here, I might simply say I loved it. I hated it. Don't watch it if you're depressed, but give it a chance if it seems too slow or dismal for words, because, well sometimes it is...still doesn't take away from its perfection to garner four out of four stars...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art, pure and simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What, in a film context, is art? Art in a film means a combination of fine cinematography, (optional - c.f. Lynch: Blue Velvet) realism - preferably, but not necessarily, of the gritty variety - and above all else the highest class of acting. It doesn't necessarily require ensuing charisma, an ever-complicating plotline, or even a plotline that captivates at all. Monsters Ball, though, does captivate. The plot, compared to the other aspects of the piece, doesn't hit the same heights, but is nevertheless intriguing and enough to really suck in the viewer. The plot developments are predictable to the degree that they have something of an inevitability about them, and the 'salvation' of Thornton's character Hank is somewhat too smooth a process. But this doesn't matter. For long periods of the film, at times, the plot stayed static, the dialogue was everyday, and the whole ethos was remarkably unspectacular, and yet I was utterly enthralled. It is precisely the everyday, nondescript, nonprofound nature of the dialogue in particular that holds the attention in a way far more action-packed films fail to do. But what stands out most of all from this piece of pure film poetry is the top-level acting - the performances by Thornton and Berry are rightly acknowledged as two of the year's finest, but the supporting roles by Boyle as the vile, hate-filled father, and even by the surprisingly adept Sean 'Puff Daddy' Combs, also deserve comment. The film starts heavy, and you worry for a while that it will be too deep and emotion-ridden to last a full 111 minutes, but have no fear. It's no action movie, and certainly not for the young (indeed, the sex scenes make you wonder how it got away with as low as a 15 certificate in the UK), but for those who appreciate the finer things in life, films don't come much finer than Monsters Ball, a piece worth watching for the acting performances alone. To be honest, if the plot was that of 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes', I'd still want to see this piece. A real beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After avoiding this movie in the theaters I finally saw it on DVD. It is great! Heavy movie themes with racism, executions, prisons, and generic despair have zero appeal for me. Usually such films are so overloaded with "PC" tripe and b***s*** cliches that aside from turning me off, they also do great harm and a real disservice to the very folks they purport to help.Anyway--- "Monster's Ball" was surprisingly engaging, and surprisingly "meta race/class/death." That is, it was so far above the standard PC garbage that it was about human beings, and real-life issues. Not "South" issues, not "race issues," and not the issues of any particular class of any particular society. Note that it was directed by a German/Swiss guy. His concern is with people in general, as opposed to grinding out tired diatribes to trumpet the tired, self-serving propaganda regurgitated annually by such light-weights as rich-kid Spike Lee. And even, sadly, brought up occasionally by the brilliant actor, Halle Berry. She did a marvelous job and deserved her Oscar. But as her Oscar night fellow awardee Denzel Washington said, race simply was not the issue. Berry has embarrassed herself a bit here and there trying to "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.-itize" and preach to the audience. Her remarks, so very appropriate to 1968 (heck, even 1978, perhaps), sound childish, silly, even self-serving and somewhat petulant in 2002.Bottom line: Don't be scared off by the trailers, critics, and apparent themes of the movie. I ignored all of that for a DVD viewing, and was well rewarded by masterful writing, acting, and directing. All the thumbs I have access to are enthusiastically "up" in sincere and high praise for "Monster's Ball." It IS a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is an amazing film that encompasses racism, dysfunctional families, loss, grief, love, redemption, and hope. It is a bleak, realistic portrayal of people dealing with the cards that life has given them. It is a deeply affecting and honest film, and please don't see it if you want to be "entertained". On the other hand, if you want to catch a glimpse into the psychology of the everyperson who comes to grips with extraordinary events, go see it and enjoy.It's frustrating to have to talk about the sex scenes, but here goes anyway. It was refreshing to see real sex and not sugar coated Hollywood crap. I don't think it was exploitative or pornographic. To see oral sex being given to a female in a film without being stupid about it was surprising but appreciated.Billy Bob shows again what a fine actor he is, and he gives a performance equal to or surpassing previous ones in films like Sling Blade, and A Simple Plan. Halle Berry gives a strong performance as the dependent, grief-stricken mother. Health Ledger is going to be a huge actor, he has done some great work already (Two Hands). He doesn't spend much time on screen, but his character is memorable.This review cannot give justice to this film. It should have got the Oscar.</fullReview>

Billy Bob and Halle's performances were great, which I expected, but so was the screenplay. The writing and the acting are definitely the stars of this show.I imagine that the hoopla about there being too many coincidences in the movie is coming from people unfamiliar with the environment presented in the film. People in small towns run into each other. What a shocker! Perhaps this is because there are fewer prostitutes, restaurants and main highways in rural Southern counties than there are in L.A.Ultimately, whether or not Monster's Ball rings true depends mostly on the viewer but I think it's one of the most realistic depictions of love and redemption that I've ever seen.

		<fullReview>scratch that, i loved it. I suppose it helps to be a little more sensitive than the average person watching this movie, because I could see what the actors were trying to convey. I thought the acting was well done, and I thought Halle deserved her Oscar and then some. For ONCE, the Motion Picture Academy gave a person an oscar when they deserved it, instead of trying to catch up and give it the next year, like they had to do with Denzel.I thought the movie was just plain old real. Granted, normally no one going to the movies wants to see "real life" but the way Marc Forrester shot the film lent it a beautifully abstract quality, which lent it a comfortable sense of distance. I didn't think the plot was so uninteresting, or farfetched, it was genuine, and here's a shocker: a lot of people's lives ARE that crappy. Just watch the news once in a while. People are mad because they picked Halle Berry, apparently, instead of some other actress, but I don't think I would have believed that Whoopi or Angela could have come off as fragile, and Vivica and all them can't act, so there you have it. I thought the infamous sex scene was appropriate; you've got two very messed up people coming together, and that's never going to be pretty. It's not going to turn you on. Imagine David Gest and Liza having sex. Same thing.Billy Bob and Peter Boyle did very good jobs bringing humanity to what could have been two very unlikable characters, and surprise surprise, I didn't mind Heath Ledger that much, though really, he was pushing it with the prostitute scene. You cannot make me believe that someone looking the way he does has to pay for booty. Puffy was ok... he apparently studied acting at the same place Nicholas Cage did, because he maintained a rather annoying apologetic tone and look on his face til he was killed, which i found hard to believe. For someone who's supposed to be a "bad bad man," who's been in prison in the south for 11 years, and is about to die, he was awfully meek. I wonder why the director made that choice. The kid who played Halle Berry's son was absolutely precious, period. All in all, i thought it was a damn good movie, if not one you would want to see when you're PMSing. I felt that it in fact had been robbed by not being nominated in other categories at the oscars, but that's not anything new. Ignants won't like it because they don't understand, but that's how it always goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is a sloppy and raw film more truthful?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this flick last night at a local art house out in Fairfax, Northern Virginia. I was kind of troubled by it. As an anti-death penalty advocate, I thought the actors, screenplay, and direction very well handled the tense approach towards the execution. Jerry's tension towards his son's relationship with the inmate and subsequent fury make total sense in line with his devotion to the work.  (SPOILERS) The transformation of Jerry from the prison guard to the auto-shop owner was great to see, the little things like painting the sign, burning his uniform, and that montage of riding around the prison yard before handing in his resignation. The relationship between him and Peter Boyle is one of the most subtle and well-carried out father-son relationships I've seen in a while. Yet at the same time, the film feels sloppy and raw, like that sex scene we keep coming back to. What bothers me is not the scene itself but the approach to it - I felt like Berry was acting slutty and punch drunk, and the right thing for him to do would have been to give her a kiss goodnight and head home. Then again, maybe it would have been right for Leticia, after seeing those drawings, to have confronted Grotowski and asked why he hadn't let her know who he was after seeing Musgrove's picture. Maybe this film isn't ultimately about what's right but about what's real. However, the relationship between Grotowski and Leticia seemed so -- based on so little, besides a basic connection. The way Grotowski just stares at Leticia in the bed and then simply says, "I'm going to get some ice cream..." I mean, you feel like you're watching two people who don't have a clue what they're doing.  Perhaps it's just a tale of people going from really fragile and imperfect to stronger and still imperfect. I don't know. All I can say is the film is troubling, and the ending seemed far too abrupt. I mean, what is this relationship? They sit on the stoop feeding each other chocolate ice cream watching the stars -- simple, yet somehow childish. See, Sling Blade had a similar kind of simplicity to it, but it somehow felt far more honest than Monster's Ball, less focused on shock value. I must say that the chemistry between the two is wonderful, especially in that crucial scene where Thornton decides to go back and pick up her child. But I'm with the people who feel this is a short film stretched out to feature length, a poem that somebody tried to turn into a short story. Still worth seeing for some riveting performances, though definitely not for the writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racism can be erased in one generation if we try!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Halle Berry has waited for this role for a long time and it may well prove to be worth the wait. She creates a fragile and yet, proud human portrait that is impossible not to admire. Director Forster refuses to let the poor audience off the hook, staying instead on the end of a scene until you find yourself wriggling in your seat praying for a scene change. Thank goodness for the few moments of brevity he inserts so the audience doesn't get pressed more than four inches into the backs of their stadium chairs! Billy Bob Thornton resurrects the intensity he manifested in "The Apostle" but with so much more script to develop this character. I have never been more uncomfortable and yet, more impressed with a small tale told well.If this first effort by the writers is any indication, we have a lot to look forward to as their careers progress. I become more and more impressed with Mr. Ledger and Mr. Combs. The gratuitous T and A displayed by Ms. Berry in the past is forgotten as we experience a sexual catharsis that will push all her previous romps well into the background. I eagerly await this young teams next collaboration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad actors use their hands when they can't portray an emotion. Watch Barry in this movie for a lesson in what not to do. This is a short film painfully stretched to feature length. This is the type of cliche ridden claptrap which passes for independent cinema. Paste in a little everyday banter for color, and instant southern culture. Amazing how decades of cultural bias can be discarded in a brief moment of jungle fever. Don't waste your time on this inferior screenplay, because the concrete detail is bogus: if he orders the same thing every time at the diner, why doesn't he know the price?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is the wonderfully rare film that doesn't tackle issues it doesn't have to. As the movie opens we meet Sonny, a correctional reform worker with his father, Hank, a racist officer. Sonny is obviously depressed and its revealed that he and his father are not getting along to say the least.SPOILER WARNING:Sonny kills himself in an argument with Hank, but we never learn about the pair's history and how their relationship was strained to the point. Thats irrelevant to the movie. Enter Letitia, wife to a death-row convict awaiting execution, and mother to an obese but loving son. What was her husband's crime. We don't know, we don't care? Who runs over her son, or is he even run over at all? Again we don't know. This is a movie that does not look for explanations to unimportant questions. It simply displays the raw emotions of two characters whose lives, so terribly ruined, both in similar ways, can find a way to love each other. I cannot recall as moving a film in quite some time. And unlike so many other movies, when the moment of epiphany arrives, she does not run from her realization. Instead, the film beautifully ends, with the two characters together, for whatever reasons they need to be together, and with us not knowing what the future holds for them. All we know is all we saw, a beautiful journey of two characters who seemingly don't change, but desperately need each other anyway.By the way, both leading actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. Both act these very juicy roles brilliantly, letting their emotions flow naturally rather than indulging in the dramatic moments of the movie, and there are many of them. They both play the roles so effortlessly, I really did not feel I was watching a movie at times.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an emotionally complex, sometimes harsh movie to watch. The dialog and plot are true to the characters. The is no "lazy writing" here.Billy Bob Thorton turns in a good, albeit unamimated, performance. His acting is understated, much like the performances of Chris Cooper. The real treat is the acting of Halle Berry. I have been a fan of her exceptional beauty and it was clear that she had acting talent when watching her in movies such as "Losing Isaiah". However, she was more often found in forgettable movies as the "Flintstones" or "Racing the Sun". Her performance in "Monster's Ball" leaves no doubt that she can act. It's rare to see an actor convey complex emotion with such clarity with no dialog. That ability is seen in actresses such as Juliette Binoche. We get to see it here in Halle Berry as well.This is a fine movie on all counts. Acting, directing, plot; It's all here. This is a "must see" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just had the opportunity last night to see this movie. This was not a happy film. In fact there was so little sunshine in this story that I half expected to walk out of the theater into a driving thunderstorm!This picture is so good, but watching it is emotionally agonizing. Don't let that detract you from wanting to see it though, it really is an excellent film.It is well photographed and directed, but the real strength of this piece lies directly in the capable hands of the actors cast here. Each person brought gritty reality to their roles; the twisted, sad, pathetic and otherwise harrowing aspects of reality. The folks at the Oscars missed a beat by nominating only one of the actors (Halle Berry) for a 'best of' nod - Peter Boyle, Heath Ledger, BBT &amp; even Sean Combs all gave outstanding performances. I'm reminded of The Apostle in the approach to the telling of this story - it's as if you sit down in the theater and somehow find yourself inside these people's lives &amp; minds.This movie deserves nothing less than a 10. It is not fun, mindless, harmless entertainment; if you're looking for that don't even think of seeing this film. If you're into pictures that say something important and say it well, you will really enjoy this one.</fullReview>

Yet, I believe it took better acting to pull this movie off....Better directing for In the Bedroom.

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much...the only film I liked in the past year was "Lord of the Rings". This is now the second film that I liked without a single reservation or suggestion for improvement.By the time the film was over, the whole audience, including myself, was so exhausted from the emotional workout we could barely pull out of our chairs to exit and get our free mint at the door.It was a great film. Halle Berry was a fantastic performer. What I saw on the screen was human, unabashed reality. She was a composite of real people I have known and loved.Billy Bob Thornton did well too..although with his southern accent I kept seeing Carl from "Sling Blade", another favorite of mine.While the subject matter is ostensibly material we've dealt with over and over, the film deals with human issues in a fresh way, at least for me. For the first time I saw a film on race relations in the South that reflected things that _I_ saw when I lived there for a few months. It explained, without words, how it is that we reconcile life's contradictions and inconsistencies....or don't...and suffer the consequences.Go see Monster's Ball. It is worth the time, and the experience will stay with you for life.Thank goodness SOMETHING reminded me that we really are all in this together. We really are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Monster's Ball" works on so many levels so well that it's almost impossible to describe. This is one of those rare movies where you really want to know as little as possible going into the theater because the twists in its plot are so amazing that they will render you heartbroken several times if they are allowed to hit you with the full force of surprise. It also has one of the most perfect and beautiful endings i've seen in film. I and my date both sat back in our seats for a long while after the movie was over and talked about this one, because it was so perfect it was hard to want to get up and leave the theater and shatter the spell it put on us. Halle Berry is truly a fantastic actress. Her performance made me cry several times in the film without ever feeling like she was reaching for the emotion or forcing a five-hanky movie. Billy Bob does what he does best: playing a warmly human man with dreams that are simple but at least he strives to make them come true. A truly perfect film. See it!</fullReview>

Billy Bob Thorton is incredible, and I believe that Peter Boyle should deserve an oscar nomination for the racist that he acts like in the film.

		<fullReview>MONSTER'S BALL isn't a pretty picture, but it's powerfully moving and enlightening. (Actually the cinematography is beautiful, with its deep shadows and colors and frequent racking of focus to guide your attention.) The story of Hank's awakening (Billy Bob Thornton) from a family history of racism and suicide to a potential future of responsibility and love, thanks to a surprising turn of events &gt; involving a destitute widow (Halle Berry), plays like a train wreck in slow motion. Your foot's on the brake and you can't stop watching.The writing is unrelentingly bitter and honest, so painful it's hard to watch, so universal there's something of everyone in it. The lead performances are wonderful; Thornton and Berry have an amazing synergy. And Mos Def created such a deep and layered character in just a couple of spare scenes. Wow. (One gripe: hey, production designer/continuity: What state is this supposed to be in? Louisiana or Georgia? Pretty sloppy--so, yeah, if that's all I've got to gripe about . . .)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hollywood's More Sensitive Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Monster's Ball" stars Billy Bob Thornton as Hank, a death row prison guard at Georgia State Penitentiary, who's son Sonny (Heath Ledger) takes his own life away mainly due to his father's bigoted background. Hank suddenly meets a young black lady, Leticia (Halle Berry), who happens to be the wife of the previous death row victim. Hank tries to keep this dark secret to himself without any word going around about it.More woes come Leticia's way as her son, gets bumped by a speeding car. Hank, at the scene comes to aid the young boy and rushes him off to the hospital. Sadly, the boy didn't make it, but a sense of closeness emerges between Hank and Leticia. Though, not love a first, sight, but the philosophical "misery deserves company" as the two unite as an escape to come over each other and their grief. This movie is not a racist movie per say, (though the main character Hank and his ailing father Buck (Peter Boyle) are bigots), it more central issue is based on the trials and tribulations of overcoming grief and to try to eradicate all your bad deeds by doing something good. At first I assumed that it was just another overcooked two hour soap opera. But it had me stunned, from the moment the film began to the end credits I was electrified by the charm and sensitivity this film possesses. It comes a dime a dozen where Hollywood will conjure up a story will touch you, hold a special place in your heart, it will have you in tears, it will leave you stunned, but most of all it will inspire you. At best, I advise you to stay until the ultimate final scene. While Hank steps out to consume some ice-cream, Leticia soon discovers, that Hank is a death row prison guard who was instrumental in her husband's execution. She was shocked that Hank never said a word about it. Though frustrated and irate about it, we expect Leticia to walk away and go her own way. But this movie provides no shortcuts. When he returns home with the ice-cream and offers her some. Still with the long face, she gradually turns the other cheek and joins him in some ice-cream and the beginning of a blossoming long-time relationship. (Where's the tissues?)Sure he should have told her what happened, but we forgive Hank and if Leticia could forgive him, then we the audience should. With them as a couple, they successfully rectified each other from their heartbreak losses to be with each other, the wrap up of this movie could not get any sweeter than this.This movie took me off my chair. It came to no surprise that Halle Berry won the Oscar for her role. She was truly amazing in both her inner beauty and outer beauty and the chemistry between her and Thornton is simply magical. You can't miss this one. Go rent now! What are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is a 2001 drama film produced by Marc Forster. it stars Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry and Heath Ledger. its written by Milo Addica and Will Rokos. It was produced by Lions Gates films. The title comes from medieval era in England where prisoners awaiting execution were called monsters! The night before their execution, their jailers would hold a feast known as a monster's ball as their final farewell. Halle Berry won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Leticia Musgrove This was a wonderful non-fiction film with great acting.This is a fabulous film but it did not do very well at the box office. i believe this is because of how the movie was marketed prior to the movie being put out into theaters. The "lord of the rings: the fellowship of the rings" took most of the spotlight off Monsters Ball. this film i believe was such a great movie because i believed it opened a door into movies,directing and cast members on screen.monsters Ball won an Oscar,10 awards and was nominated 10 times. this movie shows racism, which is a big issue all over the world, not just the south. love and interracial relationships,African American men in prisons,friendship.its just an overall great movie. and it gives a real message...and i think everyone should at least give this movie a chance.The budget for this film was 4 million and the gross it took in: $600,000.00.i highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art is truth, truth is beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is art. It is a love poem. "Art should not mean, but be," to paraphrase Archibald MacLeish's poem. It is very courageous that the makers of this film found a way to tell the truth, to let their creation be. They found a way to unambiguously describe Hank's awakening , when Leticia's unleashed force of nature meets with his emptiness and need. Without depicting unabashedly Hank's experience of abandoned sex with Leticia, we couldn't comprehend his joy, his happiness, his emancipation at this moment of his life, and why he could change his whole life for this woman. He is like a new religious convert, so deeply is he changed, and Leticia is archetypal Woman, the Goddess of his new religion.The prisoners weren't the only ones who were imprisoned where Hank worked; so was Hank. The imagery of the prison cells (cages), was repeated in the lovemaking scene, when in Hank's imagination the bird in the cage is removed from its cage and set free. Those of us who have ever endured a long and loveless marriage recognize this symbol, know this movie is true, and know that truth is beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very sad and real movie that really, truly , got to me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, after seeing this movie for the 3rd time, I still cried. This movie is just one of the most depressing movies ever made(in my opinion.) Love it or hate it, I think this movie is real. First you have the incredibly talented Heath Ledger(Sonny) who seems real lonely, and somewhat broken inside. His father (Billy Bob Thortan) is a very strict and racist police guard at a jail. I think he forced Heath into going into the profession too, since Heath's character is truly not one for macabre situation. Billy Bob is always scolding Sonny, and Sonny just responds back like a wounded dog. Little phrases like "sorry, I'll do better next time." Heath's character, I fell sorry for the most. He has a a** hole father, that even, in a situation of such seriousness couldn't say That he loved Heath. P diddy does surprisingly well as Halle Berry's husband, who is locked up in the jail that Sonny and Billy Bob work. On the day of his execution, Sonny and his father are leading him to the chair, when Heath just can't take it, he falls to the side a vomits, its truly a understandable part. But not for Billy Bob, who, of course really attacked Heath after the execution was done with. Saying things like "You ruined his last walk!" All the time he is hitting sonny upside the head. The next morning Heath is sleeping, and he is awakened by his father and told to "ship out and Get out!" Heath pulls a gun on him, and in a heat of either pain or sadness, he asks the big question. "Do you Hate me?" he asks his father. Billy Bob says yes, and that he always did, and with all the love festering in his heart Sonny says "well I always loved you." Heath then pulls the trigger on himself, ending a sorrow filled life. Truly a sad movie, a great ensemble with a very outstanding performance by Halle, I didn't know she was capable of doing so well. A movie with a great score that ripes your heart out, a movie that will have you cry and think about being alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marc Forster's Masterpiece of Grief, Loss and Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the thousands of film I seen in the last 50 years, only two reached into the deepest depths of my heart. The two films are 'Leaving Las Vegas' and 'Monster's Ball'. I've watched 'Leaving Las Vegas' only once; I don't know if I could make it through again. However, I've watched 'Monster's Ball' twice and expect to watch it many times more. For, while 'Leaving Las Vegas' is about grief and loss, and how it can bring the most unlikely people together, 'Monster's Ball' has a third element, redemption. Billy Bob Thornton plays the head guard at a state penitentiary. One of his jobs is to prepare prisoners for execution. His son, played by Heath Ledger, is a new guard. He's never been through an execution. The two men are distant; Ledger's demeanor reminds Thornton of the wife that ran out on him. Their history has left both men almost incapable of a healthy relationship with a women. As a result, both even solicit the same prostitute for sexual gratification. Halle Berry plays the wife of a condemned man. His imprisonment has left her destitute and supporting a son with an eating disorder. She struggles working as a waitress, resenting the husband who has left her and their son in such a sorry state. Thornton is also a bigot, so racist he cannot stand even being touched by a black person. He cannot understand and resents his son's friendship with two black boys at a nearby farm. WARNING: SPOILERSAfter Halle Berry's husband finishes his final meal, the 'monster's ball,' Billy Bob and his team, including Ledger, lead the condemned man to the electric chair. Before that, however, Berry's husband, an artist, draws a sketch of Billy Bob. Ledger, sensing the remorse and fear felt by the condemned man, throws up during the walk to the electric chair.Billy Bob is furious. His father (Peter Boyle) was the chief guard and he'd wanted Ledger to succeed him. Now Ledger has disgraced the family because he's 'soft.' After the execution, Billy Bob goes home and confronts Ledger in front of Boyle. Ledger pulls a pistol and, after threatening Billy Bob and Boyle, shoots himself.Billy Bob appears unmoved by his son's death. Calmly, methodically, he cleans the bloody chair and patches the bullet hole. Boyle, a really mean bastard here, rants about how Ledger was too 'soft,' just like Billy Bob's mother, who also committed suicide.After losing her job, Berry finds a new one at the dinner Billy Bob frequents. Billy Bob pretty much ignores her, leaving her a tiny tip. But subtle changes are occurring in Billy Bob. He sees his pathetic, mean, bigoted father and sees himself a few years. Being the man he has always been has left him alone, isolated. He no longer finds mechanical sex satisfying. He makes peace with the black family who had befriended Thornton's dead son. Meanwhile Berry is coping with her loss by verbally abusing her overweight son. [Damn, this movie is making me cry just writing about it.] One day Berry and her son leave the diner together. Her car breaks down and she and her son are forced to walk down the highway in the pouring rain. Billy Bob passes them on the road and, suddenly hears Berry scream. Backing up he discovers Berry clutching her seriously injured son, who'd been hit by another car. Suddenly, nothing else matters to Billy Bob but helping this distraught women and her dieing child. He takes them to the hospital, then carries Berry home after the boy dies.All the bottled up grief and loss Billy Bob has experienced all his life bubbles to the surface. He can't do enough for this black woman who has suffered so much in so short a time. He knows she is the wife of the man he executed. She's black, and he hates blacks; but, she's sweet, she's sensitive and he can't help but notice she's also beautiful.Billy Bob quits his job at the penitentiary and buys a gas station. He spends his free time with Berry, partly out of empathy, partly out of loneliness. Berry happily shares time with Billy Bob, partly out of gratitude, partly out of loneliness. Two sad, lonely people, Thornton and Berry get drunk together. Suddenly, the pain is too much for Berry. She craves pleasure to kill her pain; her inhibitions, dulled by the alcohol, Berry comes on to Thornton. Partially from desire, partially from the need for emotional release, Thornton passionately makes love to Berry. All Berry wanted was for the pain to go away. For Billy Bob, however, the passionate sex gives him the intimacy he's never felt, and he loves it.Grateful for Billy Bob's help, Berry buys a hat to replace the one he lost the night of her son's accident. However, when she comes to Thornton's house, she meets Boyle, who makes lewd, racist comments. Not wanting to lose Berry and finally realizing his father is poisoning his life, Billy Bob ships Boyle off to a nursing home. Berry, meanwhile loses her home, and reluctantly accepts Thornton's invitation to move in with him. Thornton had Berry's son placed in his family gravesite behind the house. While Berry is moving in, she discovers the sketch of Thornton drawn by her late husband. She now realizes Billy Bob is the man who executed her husband. In the films last scene, Berry joins Billy Bob on the back porch. In this scene Berry gives the greatest acting performance I've ever experienced. Multiple emotions in perfect harmony, anger, deceit, gratitude, joy and, finally contentment all cross her face. Berry and Billy Bob sit together and look across their property as he tells her about their future together, a future he nor we could have imagined a few short weeks before. As he talks, we notice in one corner of the lot sits the small family gravesite, in which rest Thornton's mother, his son and Berry's son. Billy Bob has been redeemed through tragedy and the love he shares with Berry. END OF SPOILERS Director Marc Forster has presented an unlikely tale with a captivating rhythm and not one false note. Forster's work is punctuated by magnificent editing, photography and music. The musical score perfectly harmonizes with the film. 'Monster's Ball' is certainly one of the top 10 films I've ever seen. I give 'Monster's Ball' a '10'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've commented before, and after reading some more of the user comments, I just had to jump in again. The BBT character is not a racist. He was raised to be one, tried to be one, but never carried it off. Perhaps he hated his son for having the courage to repudiate the family racist tradition, a courage he himself did not have!Berry's Letitia draws the goodness out of this damaged man. The big sex scene (facing her and not sneaking up from behind) is his point of no return. Absolutely necessary to the metamorphosis of this man. And because some doubters might say, "Well yeah, but it WAS Halley Berry!", the act and its meaning is repeated, confirmed by a less traditional (and in some ways more giving) sex act. The end is fantastic! All pasts are discarded. A new day dawns!!!A marvelous movie for those who have the patience to look deeply into a film. Kudos to Hollywood for allowing it to go out in the form it did.</fullReview>

It has been over a year since I saw this film, and still, whenever I talk about movies, whenever I think about movies, this film comes rushing to my mind, like no film ever has.It's quiet, it's simple, and thoughtful, its most dramatic moments happen like sudden whispers that dissapear just as quickly, leaving its characters broken.It's as close to poetry as film making will ever get, and then you have a cast that rises above and beyond any cast I have ever seen.Halle Berry may have won the Oscar, and she deservedly did, for what is one of the toughest, best roles in cinematic history. (a critic said: I'm a man, and if I were an actor, I would want that role.) But it's all the performances, all the quiet stares, all the huge decisions that are made, without big bangs, but slowly evolving realizations that make this film more human than any film I have ever seen. Heath Ledger made such an impression, than when he committed suicide, I mourned for him, I felt his absence in the film, just as his father felt his absence in his life. This movie should have been nominated for best film. hell, it should have won and more. I truly believe that in cinematic terms, it will be talked about for much longer than any recent academy award winner. And screenwriters should study it, just to view it's character studies.Like in the final moment of the film, Monster's Ball left me speechless, and it is now, a year after that I'm able to put in words, how much this movie moved me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both Halle and BB Thornton put in some incredible acting in this story about 'what goes around comes around' and the awesome power of forgiveness. And how refreshing to see a sex scene that was not based on moviegoer voyeurism, but a true expression between conflicted characters needing to find their humanness and deliverance from their own worst enemies, themselves.I rarely feel this way about a movie, but there was so much meaning and texture in this film that I'm certain there's stuff I missed first time through.Simply wonderful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior movie that tackles issues with grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Monster's Ball' has what may appear a na?vely simple idea - a racist prison warden falls for the black wife of a man he helped to execute. To add to the mix there's the prison's racist father, and the son with whom he shares a poor relationship. The man in question is Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) and the woman he falls for is Leticia (Halle Berry). To add to the apparent melodrama possibilities Leticia has an obese son whom she mistreats, paralleling Hank's treatment of Sonny (Heath Ledger). However it's how all these plot elements are handled that makes `Monster's Ball' stand out from the rut of emotional and racial drama.Firstly the acting in this movie is outstanding. I've always been a fan of Billy Bob Thornton's abilities and this movie is no exception - his taciturn, stoic nature plays beautifully into the role of Hank, a man used to repressing his emotions under the harsh rule of his father (with whom he still lives). His whole life and views aren't shaped by his own experiences, but that which he was taught. Thus we get to see the juxtaposition between the repressed Hank, and the Hank who finds love with a woman. Some people find this turnaround jarring but I can't say it is so - the racism instilled in him was never so much deep rooted, as failed to be examined. Thornton's ability to play a try, reserved man, with the undercurrent of emotion, is great to hold as is the obvious passion and love that's awakened by events in the movie. Then we cannot forget Halle Berry, who won an Oscar for her role - and I can't really complain about the choice. She's great in this. Rather than just be the poor wife, she's a character with edge, one that's more realistic. She's far from the perfect mother - alternating between abusive behaviour towards her son, and over protection. She's quite lost as events in the movie overwhelm her, and Berry's performance acutely captures this just as well as the tender realisation that there can be love in the world, when she falls for Hank. This love theme is dealt with quite splendidly because there's a great caution to it. The way it is handled, particularly at the end, is superb - as many other reviewers have pointed out.Obviously the movie is not without faults. Although the issue of racism, and the way the characters interact, is handled very well, the dialog can be a bit cumbersome and unwieldy at times. The direction too suffers from some flaws - camera shots that try to look `different' end up being distracting and seemingly pointlessly arty. Nevertheless the acting and other good aspects of the movie - an intelligent script, a haunting score, realistic rounded characters - make these passable flaws. This is not a light movie, replete with often shocking moments, but it is a powerful and unforgettable one. It's not quite a classic but it's very close. Well worth seeing. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character Driven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot understand the negative reviews for this excellent film. The story is complex and slow because it tries to focus on character development and social interaction with people who are confused, sad and struggling with life. The graphic sex is used to illustrate this. For example when Sonny has sex with the prostitute at the beginning of the film - he is left feeling unloved and emotionally cold - the sex merely reinforced his loneliness as it was not intimate. The sex between Hank and Lucille was emotionally strong and intense. This breaks down Hank's racist opinions and begins to cloud his heartless view of the world.The fact the film is "slow" for some viewers does not mean its bad. This film is a big sigh of relief for those who appreciate a fine performance rather than one big bang after another.....!For my part the final sequence when Lucille, sitting on the porch, thinking intensely about where she is emotionally and what possible futures she may have with or without Hank is pure drama and an Oscar performance material.This film is powerful because it focuses on people rather than situations.Well done Marc Forster</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halle Berry gets paid X number of dollars to show off her breasts in `Swordfish', and trumpets the fact with glee (was it at the MTV awards?), and this personal barrier broken, in her very next movie, here she is getting on down to major raunchiness with Billy Bob Thornton. Of course, this is the tabloid view, forgetting the fact that this is a superior film, at the heart of which is a simple and beautiful love story.This is the best work that the aforementioned Ms. Berry has ever done, and her Oscar was well deserved. However, the sterling work of the rest of the cast should not be forgotten. Sean Combs (a man whose music I have never had much time for) gives a quiet dignity to his role as the death row inmate husband of Halle Berry's character, completely banishing from memory his enjoyable but predictable performance in Jon Favreau's `Made'. Heath Ledger, suspected by many to be simply a pretty boy actor (although `A Knight's Tale' was a brilliant piece of popcorn) was absolutely convincing as Billy Bob Thornton's tortured son. There was not enough of either actor in this film.There is nothing I can say about Peter Boyle and Billy Bob Thornton. Peter Boyle, a superior character actor for more years than I would care to remember, gives a superlative performance. Billy Bob Thornton, a complex, intense and almost schizophrenic actor, has never been better. I find it amazing that Billy Bob Thornton for this film, in the same year as his astounding performance in the Coen Brother's `The Man Who Wasn't There', was not even nominated for Best Actor. Politics, no doubt.Go and see this film? and wallow in the quality of the performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monster's Ball describes a felon's last meal before their execution. Monster's Ball is subtle, brutal and hopeful; a fine piece of film making.Billy Bob Thornton plays Hank who heads the killing team in a Georgian prison in early 1990's America. The prisoner is Lawrence, a self confessed `bad man'. Australian Heath Ledger plays Hank's son Sonny who is also on the team. Lawrence's former wife Leticia (Halle Berry) is struggling to keep house and home together for herself and her son. Tragic circumstances bring Leticia and Hank together. Halle Berry Won Best Actress for her performance. Billy Bob Thornton could easily have won the male version for his.Such a plot could easily follow the accepted conventions. Monster's Ball avoids this by allowing the characters to be molded by their circumstances. It's a study of compromise, desperation and maturation.Both Hank and Leticia experience hard won moments of revelation; life changing, fug clearing scenes where fundamental shifts happen in the way they view the world. And particularly in Hank's case, these moments aren't bellowed at us on the screen: we experience Hank's epiphany in retrospect, as we view his subsequent actions.Most films happily trot out type cast actors for type cast characters. Refreshingly Monster's Ball takes as a given that we humans are complex, contrary creatures, and slow learners to boot. It recognizes that most of us might only experience fundamental changes in attitude a few times in our life, and that a change will have many causes.Monster's Ball is a wonderful comment on racism and on absolute bigotry but it's much more besides. There's no room for flawless characters in a film that paints such a nasty picture of the worst of us, and also a hopeful painting of those desperate enough to treat others with less distrust and more dignity. And it treats chocolate ice cream with the dignity chocolate ice cream deserves. Such seemingly small matters as ice cream do often glue our lives together.A clever script, deft direction and stand out performances from all the major players make this Monster's Ball well worth attending.4 And A Half Flys Out Of Five</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A daring, shocking, amazing drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since "Leaving Las Vegas" has a film captured the theme of "through sorrow and loss comes unexpected love and compassion" like "Monster's Ball" does. Halle Berry is so amazing that when she sinks into her character's world, you have no choice but to follow along. She puts herself on the line both physically and emotionally and she deserves a date with Oscar because of it. Marc Forster's direction is expertly tuned, compounded with a sound script and stellar cinematography. Billy Bob Thornton is as good as he always is, but watch for a haunting performance from Heath Ledger and a powerful, anti-type spin from Peter Boyle. The power of this film is in its ability to shock the audience into a sudden state of disbelief moment after moment after moment, and when the pain rises to the surface, we feel it truthfully and unflinchingly. The only major misstep is the miscasting of Sean Combs as Berry's husband, and newcomer Coronji Calhoun's novice is evident, though ultimately forgivable. Overall, Lions Gate should be knighted for its decision to release a bold, daring motion picture that shines in this year of hyper-glossed, over-hyped, under-performing Hollywood fare. Audiences MUST take notice. I dare the Academy to do the right thing and honor Halle Berry in March.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, Halle Berry's appearance in this film is about the best of the year. It's difficult to conceive the part of Leticia played by any other actress. She's very convincing as this woman in rural Georgia where there are still so many prejudices against her for the mere fact that she's black. Frankly, this actress never impressed me before as she did with her work here.Billy Bob Thornton is one our best and most versatile actors around. He gives in this film another great performance. The only thing that's not very convincing is his changeover from being a bigot into an accepting individual when tragedy strikes him at home and on the road. He and Ms. Berry have a lot in common as tormented souls that finally find one another and they are both changed for the best.The sure direction by Marc Forster and the original screenplay by Milo Addica and Will Rokos, make this film very compelling to watch. They have been helped by the incredible cast they have making these people come true on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most films about "racism" actually perpetuate racial stereotypes ("The Defiant Ones", "Sayonara", "Color Purple", "Crash", "The Blind Side", "Precious", "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" etc), and "Monster's Ball" is no different.Here we have the typical Hollywood belief that racism has no institutional aspects but is rather caused by a few misguided, cantankerous people. In this case, the cantankerous person is actor Peter Boyle, Hollywood's poster boy for racism ever since his iconic performance in the 1970 film "Joe".Boyle, whose character is a shameless racist who spews the N word like a KKK water fountain, also plays the father of Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), who at first shares his father's racism, but after the death of his own son suddenly gets sensitive, renouncing racism and resigning from his job at a prison.Why does the son's death affect Billy Bob? Because Billy's son embodies a kind of caring, progressive attitude, a sharp contrast to his mean-spirited father and grandfather. Before he dies, the son even admitts that he loved his daddy unconditionally, despite his father's abusive nature. The kid's death thus "teaches" Billy a kind of "unconditional love".From here on, Billy Bob magically transforms from a prison worker (caging black men) to a friend of the black community (he befriends black actor Mos Def etc). What's more, he turns from the executioner of a black man called Lawrence, to the lover of this same black man's wife, played by Halle Berry.Seeing the grieving Halle Berry, Billy Bob immediately wants to comfort her. On the literal level, he realises that by sending her husband to the electric chair he caused her anguish. But the film's larger, quite condescending point, is that Billy Bob has seen the effects of racism and so wants to "make up" for this by giving Halle some finger lickin' white lovin'.The middle portion of the film then involves Billy Bob going to the caf at which Halle Berry works. He orders "black coffee" and "chocolate ice-cream" whilst he sizes up his sexy, ghetto waitress. You can tell by his hungry eyes that he'd love to sink his redneck teeth into Halle Berry's juicy chocolate cupcakes. His chocolate cravings, his salivating jungle fever, should be played as comedy (see Spike Lee's "She Hate Me"), but director Marc Forster instead plays things with ridiculous solemnity. This lends the film a tone which feels ignorant and borderline offensive, Forster quietly baiting his audience into wanting to see some hot, interracial, taboo busting sex.The character's themselves are oddly written. Billy Bob is a redneck Polish American with the surname Grotowski (see "Australia", where all racism is transplanted to similar Polish caricatures) and Halle Berry's character is written like some weird parody of blackness (eg- she tells her morbidly obese son that she'll "slap the blackness out of him!"), spewing silly jive dialogue and goofy black mannerisms. She's the typical bi-racial "tragic mulatto" stereotype, who is assumed to be sad and suicidal because she fails to assimilate into either the white or black world. A real, fully black character would scare white audiences, so we get instead a mixed race Beyonce/Obama hybrid, white and frail enough to not threaten the film's white audience, but black enough to instigate a guilt trip.Berry's character herself seems confused about race. Spew racist words to a black woman in rural Georgia and she'll give you a piece of her mind, whereas Berry is a meek, docile creature. Racism in this film isn't anything more than a personal defect. A psychological problem. A personality quirk which must be overcome by the commingling of white and black flesh, (see "Dances With Wolves", "Sayonara", "Lone Star", "Man Called Horse", "Heaven and Earth", "The Searchers", "Passage To India", "Avatar" etc, where sex becomes a clunky metaphor for the soothing of racial tensions). In other words, this is sex as racial therapy. The broken black woman can only be made whole again if the white man takes care of her in a benevolent, paternalistic way, her wounds healed by some white on black clitoral stimulation.As the film progresses, the camera, the white male gaze, systematically reduces Berry to an object of suffering and tragedy. Watch how she LITERALLY loses everything she has in the film and becomes an objectified victim. A symbol of failure, unable to support herself, having lost her son and husband, she then begs her white slave master to hump her in as violent a way as possible so that she can "feel good". Billy Bob acts hesitant. Acts like he's somewhat reluctant...but we know he's simply being polite. That he's leaving enough space for disavowal. In truth, he can't resist her. How often does a redneck get to bang a hot emo black woman (not too black, of course. Halle Berry is practically white, so as to guarantee maximum erections) without asking for permission? This is thus a typical male erotic fantasy, the hesitant white man dutifully tending to the jungle goddess because she's damaged and begging to be repaired. What the film really wants to do is titillate its audience with the prospect of hot black on white sex. Whilst the entire film is shot with economy, using very little coverage, its famous sex scene is shot from every possible angle (and more if you buy the director's cut). The director wants us to leer at Halle Berry's model quality flesh, the film treating the audience to delightful little snippets of Berry's berries and pert little butt. End result: white audience gets a slice of jungle fever, whilst passing it off as grief coping.7/10 ? How to win an Oscar? Have a privileged diva-actress lower herself to the dregs of humanity and recreate an ivory tower view of the downtrodden. Case in point, Theoron in "Monster", Berry in "Monster's Ball", Winslet in "The Reader" and Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry" and "Million Dollar Baby".</fullReview>

It could also be about keeping quite for the sake of a happy and peacefull life. Whatever your conclusion the overiding aspect of this film is the acting. Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry are fantastic as they keep the viewer mesmerised throughout a film that could be described a slow at the best of times. This movie looks superb which is great considering there are no flashy special affects. If your feeling low this is not the film to pep you up because it is quite dark and depressing but i urge you to watch this symply for the fantastic acting. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A carousel of depressed lives: a correctional officer--brought up in a racist household--has a romance with the African-American wife of the last man executed under his supervision, an incident which ultimately led to the suicide of the officer's own son, while the widow is still grieving the loss of her son in a hit-and-run accident. Heavy with irony, this piece almost withers under its weighty elements, but there are compensations: performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry are top-notch, and the director handles them just right; the dialogue is well-written throughout, with the conversational scenes very natural and overshadowing the more predictable mechanics of the plot. When Thornton paints the woman's name on the front of his new gasoline station and a friend comes up and reads it ("Leticia"), it's gratifying to hear Thornton say, "That's my girlfriend." It's little moments such as this which give "Monster's Ball" a haunting and tangible spin. The much-discussed love scene, with flickers of a hand trying to catch a bird in its cage, is both revealing and artistically surreal, a nice mix (and a surprising one). But the story passages are fairly rote; only the characters themselves--and how they relate to the circumstances involved--keep the movie strong. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated pile of trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, please allow me to start off by explaining to you that I am by no means a prude in terms of movies. I am a big fan of graphic realism in movies. However, only when necessary. Gritty movies like Requiem for a Dream and Boogie Nights provided us with vast quantities of nudity, sex and drug use. All for the good of the movie.So now then, onto the review.Monsters Ball is a story about an excecution guard who falls for the widow of a man he recently excecuted(P Diddy?? what the...?) Her son just recently died as well so we are supposed to feel sympathy for her when she indulges in gratuitous sex with Billy Bob.The movie is NOT that well acted. Halle Berry did not even deserve an Oscar nom for the movie. I seriously cannot believe she was nominated, let alone won. Even if I dont like a movie or a particular actor, I can acknowledge when they deserve recognition from the Academy(Chris Cooper). I have seen better acting from an actress in films like Earth Girls are Easy and Slumber Party '59(or maybe its just the Debra Winger fan in me talking). And after Halle Berry won the award over GOOD actresses like Renee Zellweger and Nicole Kidman, she further pushes the injustice by making such a racist speech, so swamped with tears that had we acknowledged this, we would be considered heartless.The sex in the movie is long and unnecessary. As I said before, I certainly do not mind this, when it is needed to further enhance the film. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Just a poor excuse to show Halle naked, further drawing buzz around the film. Acting on Billy Bobs part is good, but we have seen better in Sling Blade and A Simple Plan. If you are looking for high art, this is not it. This is truely a film wearing sheeps clothing. A bad, trashy hollywood product cleverly disguised as art. If you want to rent good, graphic art films, look to Darren Arronofsky, Paul Thomas Anderson or Stanley Kubrick. Stay away from this self-indulgent pile of garbage.</fullReview>

The politically correct moralising on racial hatred is a cheap vehicle to justify such shallow two-dimensional characters, and plot. The main character's transition from racial bigot and abusive father to all-round Mr. Nice Guy is laughable, and even the painfully slow pace of the plot cannot disguise it. The one ray of light is the warmth between the condemned man and his son, but as it played such a minor role it does not go nearly far enough to redeem this awful movie.

		<fullReview>I like all the actors in the cast and the movie sounded good, on paper. Froth with possibilities for drama, intrigue and interest, right?Well, forget it...this was a drag for the most part and I rarely understood any of the characters motivations, so I was questioning things that should be apparent. The movie felt a little patched together, and by a new director who was unsure of the waters in which he was wading.I would not read any of the rest of this if you intend to see the movie.I have a lot of questions about the whole things. Like, why did Hank (Thornton) hate Sonny (Ledger)? And if he didn't, why did he said he did? Why is Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs) on death row? Am I supposed to buy the fact that Leticia (Berry) went to visit Combs for 11 years and she didn't see Hank at the prison? This is not the NYPD, the entire police force is in one room at one point and I think there were eight people. Am I also supposed to believe that there was no investigation into Sonny's suicide, thereby leaving the fatal bullet dodged in the cheap living room furniture? How did Hank go from racist/sadist/lousy father to loving Leticia so much that he names his new gas station after her? Unfortunately, I don't think people change that quickly. If he was only acting out what he was taught his whole life, then I certainly understand, but it would have been nice if he discussed that or did something a little less sentimental first. Naming your new business after a girl you slept with six times seems a silly thing to do, especially when you've dedicated your life to hating blacks. There are more...I realize that some things in life do not come with an answer, but in a movie I need a little more conversation between the actors if the plot is not telling me what the hell is going on. Thornton seems to be sleepwalking. Halle is good, not great and not Oscar-worthy. But I like her and would like to see a woman of color win Best Actress before I am planted, so it would not be an egregious error in my book if she were to win. She nails some big dramatic moments and her last scene is really very good. Boyle is not given the chance to expose his soul, exactly, but it was great seeing the sorry state his feet are in. Heath is very good and there's more to him than is obvious. He gets the Southern accent right and sounds like David Keith in 'The Lords of Discipline'.My favorite characters were Sonny and Lawrence but they were gone within the first 30 minutes. I also liked the actor that played a neighbor of Hank's and the father of two of Sonny's friends. His name is Dante Beze and I hope to see more of him in the future. He was the most interesting character and didn't seem to have an agenda of hatred, thankfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monsters Ball or Playtime For Miniscule Minds...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the outset this appeared to have enough potential to be OK. By the mid-section however it becomes a little obvious the filmmakers were trying to turn it into the 2001 of racial hate movies. They start with a minimalist plot then stretch out every scene till the threadbare writing begins to show. This writer/co-producer duo (Milo Addica &amp; William Rokos) along with German director Marc Forster come across as perhaps having been victims of child abuse or worse. Ugliness seeps from the majority of scenes like puss from a festering sore. About every Character is totally unlikable (except maybe Heath Ledger playing Thornton's son with only a brief part).If anyone hasn't seen this by now, from here there could be a few plot spoilers: Billy thingy-ma-Bob Thornton is a bigoted, violent father who HATES his own son like no other before him. Thornton's father (Boyle) hates everyone except those who hate as equally as he does! A local young black woman (Hallie Berry) whose husband is on death row shows little more than contempt towards both her husband and their sad young son (her son compulsively eats chocolate bars to sooth his unhappiness with his home situation). At no time are we told why her seemingly intelligent, artistically talented negro husband has to be executed - did he murder somebody or simply upset some red-neck townsfolk?. Character establishment is treated as unimportant because the thin plot simply works towards stringing together a series of gratuitous sex scenes - and they don't get much sleazier. Lust simply replaces shared love for sake of sensationalism and this seems to have been the main selling point. Some say it's a tale of redemption but the redemption is treated as being simply 'tacked on' - occurring almost overnight and stemming from a shocking event the supposedly 'redeemed' bigot (Thornton) even more shockingly said he was pleased about!. None of this is very convincing. It would appear the average viewer of movies today may have been reduced to mulch - otherwise how could below par product like this receive more than a passing glance?. As for Berry, she 's reduced to a mere sex object - which seems to be enough for obsessed audiences to rave about. This brings us then to the also tacked on ending - looking like it was lifted strait out of "The Misfits"...the two 'redeemed' characters sit eating chocolate ice cream from a 'specifically' requested plastic spoon (plastic seems symbolic of this movie) and gaze up at the stars looking into their assured future. Disappointing and somewhat shameful. Seems also like it may have been a rather lean year - as predictably, the academy thought it just fine.

		<fullReview>Capital punishment, racism and abusive parents feature strongly in this story about the healing power of love and its great ability to grow in even the most unlikely circumstances. The mood is often sombre and the characters' feelings of despair, grief and regret are profound. Despite all of this, the hope and comfort that unexpected love can bring is ultimately shown as being able to point the way to hope and optimism for the future. In the wrong hands, a story like this could easily have developed into a melodramatic slush-fest but fortunately in this case, the movie was directed more intelligently with uncompromising depictions of its characters and the romantic developments being presented without sentimentality.Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is a Georgia prison Corrections Officer who's responsible for supervising the arrangements leading up to the execution of convicted cop-killer Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs). Hank's team includes his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger) and on the day of the execution, when the prisoner is being led to the electric chair, Sonny becomes overwhelmed by what's happening, starts vomiting and has to break off from the detail to recover. After the execution has been carried out, Hank violently attacks his son in front of the other men in his team and then when they return home, a second attack concludes with Sonny killing himself. Hank had always hated his son for being weak and after his suicide, swiftly buries him and then resigns from his job.Hank lives with his white racist father, Buck (Peter Boyle) who's a retired Corrections Officer and a wheelchair-bound invalid. His wife had committed suicide some years earlier.Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry) had worked hard to bring up her son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) during the eleven years that her husband Lawrence had been on death row awaiting the outcomes of various appeals but now, after his execution, had arrived at a real low-point facing the prospect of losing her car, her job and her house. Tyrell had inherited his father's talent for drawing but gets beaten and verbally abused by his mother because she's disgusted by his obesity. One night, Hank is driving along a stretch of road when he sees Leticia screaming for help and after discovering that Tyrell had been injured by a hit-and-run driver, takes the boy and his mother to the nearest hospital. A short time later, Tyrell dies and afterwards, Hank drives Leticia home not realising that this would lead to a relationship that would bring them both a great deal of comfort and start to make them feel human again."Monster's Ball" doesn't pull any punches in showing the pain that people in dysfunctional families can suffer or the damaging effects that a bigoted, bullying, patriarch can have on the lives of his offspring. Hank's experience of being brought up by Buck had naturally led to him becoming a racist and regarding anyone who's sensitive as being weak. The potential for this kind of attitude to continually be passed from father to son is extremely powerful and damaging and so, it's particularly ironic that in Hank's case, after suffering a dreadful tragedy in his life, he should find comfort in a relationship with a black woman whose life had also been blighted by tragedy.When Hank and Leticia meet for the first time, they don't know that they're connected by Lawrence's execution and the ways in which they both discover this information at different times and reconcile themselves to the situation, is both very powerful and brilliantly acted."Monster's Ball" is full of good performances with Peter Boyle and Heath Ledger standing out in their supporting roles. The casting of Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry in the leading roles is also perfect as they both make their characters believable as individuals as well as showing, in a very natural way, how well they get to appreciate each other's company. This movie is strong on simplicity and realism and it's these qualities that contribute so much to its incredible power and poignancy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ball is in Berry's Court.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball (2001): Dir: Marc Forster / Cast: Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry, Heath Ledger, Peter Boyle, Sean Combs: Powerful film about racism and redemption. Title regards lifestyle and attitudes of three generations of racial prison guards. Billy Bob Thornton portrays such a guard whose father was an even bigger racist. His son befriends a black inmate on death row and he wretches at the execution. Thornton assaults him in a washroom leading to a shocking sequence where he takes his own life. Halle Berry plays the widow of the inmate whose son is struck by a car. Thornton assists her and is soon drawn in attraction. It isn't known why Thornton helps her but judging from the amount of sex it was probably lust. Unsatisfactory conclusion aided by Marc Foster's directing and top notch acting. Thornton wrestles with his past and upbringing. Berry is flawless as a waitress who is harsh to her overweight son. Heath Ledger plays his son who shows compassion towards those whom he was raised to hate. This puts him in conflict with his family. Peter Boyle is icy as Thornton's crippled and hateful father whose nature is perhaps the darkest element of the film. Sean Combs is effectively in a brief role as a criminal who is executed early on. The film focuses on hopes that society will veer away from the immoral celebration of racism. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most beautiful and saddest movies I have ever seen. She loses her husband and son, only to find herself at peace again when shes all alone and confused in life. The only thing I had a hard time with in this film is their portrayal of Halle Berry's race and the resemblance of her son to his parents. Halle Berry is bi-racial and they portrayed her as being black and raised in the ghettos of the south. I know she has a brownish skin tone, but that doesn't make her fully black. She has both white and black ancestry and you cant deny that. I hate people that want to make mixed race people label themselves as black. The one drop rule doesn't make sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A monster's ball is a phrase to describe the dinner a death row inmate gets the night before the execution. This is a sad movie, and will be difficult to watch for some.In the deep south, this is a story of practical romance, profound loss, and systemic racism to make the dilemmas these characters face even more difficult. Both lead characters question their own beliefs and convictions after losing their son.Sometimes, the character's motives are contrived and some scenes could have been shot better. But at the end, the message of this movie is that life can be unforgiving, you have to accept reality and build new opportunities for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The awards committee were quite clearly allowing another part of their anatomy to do the thinking when they awarded Berry with the Oscar here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball begins promisingly where we begin to witness friction between father and son prison guards Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and Sonny (Heath Ledger). Sadly the issues between father and son are not particularly well explored - except that Dad is racist and son isn't. Then unexpectedly Hank's son shoots himself. Following her husband's execution and in an unfortunate coincidence, Leticia (Halle Berry) also finds herself dealing with the loss of her child. United in their grief, Hank and Leticia start to fall for each other.Screenwriters Milo Addica and Will Rokos are clearly plucking for a heart-rending drama here, but sadly Hank and Leticia aren't really developed well enough to be able to become fully swept up in their grief. Berry's character is better developed as her failings are much more apparent (poor timekeeping, money problems, a short fuse etc). Although her character wasn't entirely likable, I always got the impression that she was fairly well-intentioned. Sadly, the writers do nothing with Billy Bob Thornton's character and offer very little insight about him as a person. I suppose the anger and resentment that Hank shows to his son is merely a projection of the relationship that exists with Hank and his father. If we keep the focus on characters then let's move on to Peter Boyle's role as Hank's father Buck; he plays a grumpy old man but not an endearing or funny grumpy old man like Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino or Victor Meldrew in One Foot In The Grave, but instead he's an irritating, humourless miserable old git. To saddle Boyle with a role such as this is a criminal waste of his talents.Once Hank and Leticia begin a relationship following the deaths of their children the film takes on a very sleepy and ponderous turn. The chemistry was poor between Hank and Leticia and given the fact that the deaths of their children is ultimately what brought them together it's actually surprising how little focus their deaths seem to have on the plot. There was one scene where Leticia is talking to Hank about her son and how he used to hide candy bars etc - this was quite an effective scene which was cheapened a bit by the two of them 'getting it on' immediately after this touching and emotive moment. Aside from one or two moments, I found myself really bored in the second half of the film and just found it to be a rather dull, ponderous, film with some sex thrown in now and again and found myself just praying for it to end. In addition to this the film occasionally threw in absurd and irrelevant plot points like Hank becoming a Gas Station owner then ignoring this aspect all together after it's been mentioned??? Finally we'll come to Halle Berry and whilst her performance was good here I'd hardly consider it Oscar Worthy. There is a sex scene about halfway through the film where we get to see what Halle's 'got' and I can't help but wonder that after seeing this scene that the critics were thinking with a very different part of their anatomy when they decided to award her with the Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, deeply unsettling and absolutely great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow, deeply unsettling and absolutely great.*may contain spoilers*I got the DVD for my recent birthday. It's an older movie, but still relevant because of the timeless story of life &amp; death.Monster's Ball has the pace, and depressing qualities of a french drama, and is thusly loathed by the "colorful stuff exploding every minute"- crowd, hence the foaming-at-the-mouth reviews here &amp; there.Yes, well. If One watches it to get a glimpse of Berry's "assets", yes, it's there, but there's quite a bit more to that.The basic premise of Monster's Ball is "People that lost everything, trying to get their feeling back"Both Berry and Thornton lost close relatives to rather tragic events. Their lives seem to unravel around them, and struck numb by that, they seem to be walking around in a sort of auto-pilot haze, until they, through even mre tragic events, accidentally meet.The events in question, losing their sons, the one by suicide, the other by drunk driver, makes them connect on a deeper level. The odd thing is, that there hardly seems to be any love involved in that connection, but only desperation. Desperation unloading in a first and -by American standards- rather steamy sex-scene (A good observer cannot, by the life of it, call it a "love-making" scene).It's visceral, almost a hate-f**k, a desperate attempt to regain their feeling and humanity, and as such, deeply unsettling for the watcher. It's also deeply European.Where in America the "love-making" is -as a norm- the ultimate expression of love, it's not as such in many European movies. Especially the French seem to revel in showing love and sex in a rather unsettling way, close to some kind of insanity, and -more often than not- combined with violence and death.At first I couldn't understand the emphasis on sex as a rather distant affair, like the way Thornton and a hooker go at it, and later the steamy, visceral but loveless banging Thornton and Berry demonstrate. But, after a second watching, it suddenly dawned at me :It was an attempt to escape something inescapable, hence the inter-cuts of a caged bird..From that moment on, I started to watch for more symbology, and boy! is it chock-full of it.It starts with he way Thornton gets at his job. He has to take a ferry, crossing a river to his job as a correction officer. Crossing the Styx to a Hell that h has accepted, but that his son -Ledger- can no longer. Which, combined with the utter contempt that their racist Father and Grandfather (Boyle), has for his son nd even more so for his grandson, leads to a very tragic outcome.Then there's Thornton's regular nightly ice-cream, which he insist on to be chocolate with a white, plastic spoon, combined with hot, black coffee.And it goes on- and on, by times it's even a bit much tbh. And yet, it's all expertly cut-together to make an utterly compelling, but somewhat depressing cocktail of simple, "normal" people that deal with an almost insurmountable lot of grieving after their lives fall apart, and who's fate drives them in each other's arms, forcing them to accept a new reality, And all of that with an undercurrent of racism that seeps through everything in the world around them.It ends on a somewhat optimistic tone, but even there, a tragic undercurrent is still very much apparent.The acting of the cast is absolutely top-notch. They all flex their acting-muscles with gusto (even Berry. Remember that she once got a raspberry-award, and showed-up in person to collect it, thereby stealing the hearts of the crowd). Boyle's expert portrayal of Hank Grotowsky's shockingly racist Dad, even made me actively loathe a character. And, tbh, ll characters, except maybe for Ledger's Sonny Grotowski, are somewhat unpleasant by times. Which is a good thing! Daring too. The whole affair was shot for a meager $4,000,000.- $1,000,000.- of it for Berry to drop her undies (or so it's said. I dunno). The director, his hands tied by the tiny budget, was as such forced to use all kinds of locally available assets. No fancy sets, no fancy props, no nuttin' and as a collateral, it makes for an utterly believable "mise-en sc?ne" and authenticity, which -in turn- makes it look more like an unsettling documentary, in a way. The minimalist music also supports that feeling of "watching a slice of reality".All in all, I liked it very much. The calm pace gives the viewer ample time to ponder the things the director tries to tell. And after the end- credits One is left thinking about it all for quite some time.9/10 (-1 for the sometimes too thick layer of symbolism)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Complexity of Great Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title refers to a supposed tradition in England of holding a party for a condemned murderer, the "monster's ball", the night before his execution. This "tradition" appears to be an invention of the scriptwriters; the death penalty was abolished in Britain more than thirty years before the film was made, and I have never come across any reference to its existence before that.The film tells the story of a love affair between Leticia Musgrove, the widow of an executed murderer, and Hank Grotowski, a prison officer at the local jail. What Leticia does not realise is that Hank actually participated in her husband Lawrence's execution. Other plot lines include Leticia's attempt to bring up her son Tyrell after his father's death and Hank's complicated relationships with his son Sonny and with his own father Buck. Much of the tension in the Grotowski family arises from the fact that Sonny is himself a prison guard at the same jail and that Hank regards him as too "soft" to do the job. Leticia is black and Hank white, so this adds a certain racial tension to their relationship, especially as Buck is a confirmed racist and Hank seems to have inherited some of his father's attitudes. I won't set out any more of the plot, although I can say that it involves some very dark twists; Lawrence's execution is certainly not the last death. At times it almost seems too dark, as though tragedy were being piled upon tragedy.(I said that Leticia is black, but she is of course played by the mixed- race Halle Berry. Hollywood, however, has always treated mixed-race actors as black for casting purposes, hence the casting of the Scottish- Nigerian Carmen Ejogo as Coretta King in the recent "Selma". I doubt if in reality Berry would have had a son who looked like Tyrell).Whether Berry deserved her "Best Actress" Academy Award is something I am not sure of- personally I would incline more towards Judi Dench for her role in "Iris"- although this is probably the best of all Berry's performances which I have seen. The one really outstanding performance, however, comes from Billy Bob Thornton as the violently conflicted Hank. The late Heath Ledger is also very good as Sonny, desperately trying to live up to his father's unrealistic expectations of him.Roger Ebert said of "Monster's Ball" that "The movie has the complexity of great fiction" and considered it the best film of 2001. Not everyone agreed with Ebert- the film was not nominated for "Best Picture"- but in one way he was right; I can certainly imagine a great novel being written around this story. That does not, however, necessarily mean that it is a great film. In a novel the author would have more space to do justice to all the many themes and characters which here are rather swept under the carpet. He would have had room to examine in more detail the relationship between Lawrence and Leticia, the crime for which he was sentenced and the American justice system which sentenced him. He could have paid more attention to the obviously troubled history of the Grotowski family- we learn, for instance, that Buck's wife committed suicide without learning why- and to the toxic father-son relationships between Buck and Hank and between Hank and Sonny. Sonny in particular seems a tragic, haunted figure, so it seemed a pity to me that he died early on and that his death was treated mostly as a prelude to the main event, the affair between Hank and Leticia. Trying to deal with all these matters in the scope of a normal two-hour film results in a claustrophobic, over-intense piece of hothouse film- making. Despite its shortcomings as a piece of story-telling, however, the film nevertheless gives scope for some good acting. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interracial relationships are often more risqu and bear a greater magnitude because you likely have to go an extra mile to make it work, or have some member of your family overcome assumptions or opposition to the other race so the person can have a healthy without worrying about senseless judgments on their being. It's because of this, and the ridiculous controversy that surrounds such a practice, that, I believe, the amount of interracial relationships in Hollywood are shockingly little and the idea is so frequently underexplored that, if it were just given a bit more exposure, could free us from the shackles bestowed upon us by lame and incredulous romance dramas. With the right marketing, proper writing, and strong acting, a film about interracial relationships could be defining for a large, underserved demographic.Marc Forster's Monster's Ball is an efficient and substantial film concerning interracial relationships and how grief can transcend even the biggest boundaries in our lives, especially those built by our own parents and relatives. It concerns Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), a quietly racist widower who works with his son Sonny (Heath Ledger) in a corrections office and takes care of his ailing, openly racist father (Peter Boyle). Hank often oversees executions that occur in his corrections department, and often doesn't appreciate the hard work and dependency of his son, criticizing him that he's too soft and too weak-hearted to handle his job. After a confrontation at their home, Sonny proceeds to kill himself right in front of his father. Hank moves on with his life by burying Sonny in the backyard and quitting his job at the corrections office.Early in the film we also find ourselves meeting Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), a woman who has been struggling while raising her overweight, artistic son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) while her husband Lawrence (Sean Combs) was in prison and subsequently executed by Hank. Hank sees Leticia in a local diner quite frequently, but one day on his travels home, sees Leticia crying while holding Tyrell in her arms after he is struck by a car. Despite prompt efforts by Hank and Leticia, Tyrell dies in the hospital, leaving Leticia distraught and without two of the biggest people in her life.A heartwrenching scene takes place between Leticia and Tyrell early in the film. Leticia has been concerned about Tyrell's weight for a while, and finds that he keeps eating chocolate and not trying to stick to any kind of diet. She is so frustrated about his disobedience that she winds up physically abusing him, forcing him onto a scale and slapping him around repeatedly. The scene is devastating because not only do we know that Leticia is just acting out on momentary stress, but we see that Tyrell, who already seems to have very few friends and opportunities to exercise his artistic passion, is simply confined to physical abuse and upsetting, emotionally scarring treatment. One wonders if the real life story of Calhoun was similar to the one he conveys on screen (I say "was" because Calhoun was listed as "missing" following the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and there have been no subsequent reports of him being found, leading me to believe he's missing and presumed dead as of 2014).It almost goes without saying that the performances are spectacular all across the board, from two low-key, beautifully nuanced performances by Thornton and Berry to a wonderfully tender and often saddening performance by Calhoun. And together, they make the somber and often tonally-rich screenplay of Milo Addica and Will Rokos work, by carefully constructing the right scenes and never overplaying others for emotional manipulation. Both Addica and Rokos do a beautiful job at showing how in a time of grave uncertainty and untold sadness that even two people with nothing remotely in common, bearing two separate views on life, can come together and miraculously find solace in each other - even the way the film handles sex is in a deeply human, respectful way. Monster's Ball shows that without overplaying its core emotions nor turning into a pile of clich-ridden drivel; it's a carefully-crafted, somber film concerning heavy topics explored in a mannered way.Starring: Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry, Heath Ledger, Coronji Calhoun, Peter Boyle, and Sean Combs. Directed by: Marc Forster.</fullReview>

People get into bed to-gether.That's life. But we do not need every last intimate detail and each protracted orgasmic moan. What otherwise is a fine and powerful film is reduced to the level of a skin flick. Usually death row films end with the execution. This one begins with it.

		<fullReview>I think that an important aspect of this story is the fact that two ordinary characters, Hank and Leticia, who went through dramatic and tragic life experiences, and who live in a place where racism get apart persons of different ethnicities, are capable of developing a true love between them. Hank is a guy who worked all his life as a prison guard. His son who was also a prison guard is murdered. Leticia is a woman who works as a waiter in a caf. Her husband was executed in the prison where Hank worked and her beloved son dies in consequence of having being hit by a car. They live in a place where racism is alive and where Hank's father is an example of this nasty culture. I would say that this film is much stronger and human than "Un Homme Et Une Femme" of Claude Lelouch. So much stronger, that there was no need of a musical sound track like that beautiful song of Francis Lai. In time, I don't know if the sex scenes were really necessary, or if they could have been filmed in a different way, less explicit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grotowski family are prison guards. Grandfather Buck (Peter Boyle), an invalid, is retired, but father Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and son Sonny (Heath Ledger) both work in the same prison, on Death Row. Buck is a poisonous old racist: Hank less so, and Sonny (who is a disappointment to his father) much more modern in his attitudes. Hank has struck up a talking acquaintance with attractive (but coloured)Leticia, a waitress at a caf he frequents, without realising that he and Sonny assisted at her husband's recent execution. Sonny kills himself in reaction to his father's disappointment, and Leticia's son dies. Hank and Leticia are drawn together by their mutual losses, but Buck is not a factor to be overlooked.This challenging, but ultimately rewarding film, is excellent. As it tells its story of one man's growth and redemption, it leads the viewer through the lives of damaged people and the effects they have on each other.Halle Berry's Best Actress Oscar is deserved, not least for the infamous sex scene: what could have been tasteless turns out to be harrowing and heartbreaking and, notwithstanding the nudity and sexual activity, one of the least erotic moments on screen ever. However, the whole cast is first rate.It is not a film one would want to watch often, but it is a film which should be watched at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human guilt, Remorse, Redemption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very serious drama. I suppose it is for only the serious audience, due to the movie's mature story. In a way it's like one of those movies like 'No Country For Old Men', because when I was very young, a simple kid, and saw that movie, I was actually bored by it. But now I look at them with great awe and wonder, how the hell was I not moved by this back then? So my strict opinion, is that kids and superficial/immature people will not enjoy 'Monster's Ball'. But as for the people who will enjoy it, this is truly one of thee greatest human drama's ever. Ideas of grief, remorse, redemption, moving on/letting go and choices and their consequences are presented here in a simple story of one man and one woman, who both had lost someone very dear to them and afterwards, they both connect in a way, that only people who have experienced a great loss can. The performance of the three lead actors(Billy Bob Tornton, Heath Ledger and Halle Berry) are really moving. Especially Halle Berry, who is amazing beyond words here. It was obvious that she would at least win the Academy Award for best actress for this role, and she did among many other awards. And even though Heath Ledger was on screen for a very short time, it was really fascinating to see him in action, perfect as always. Definitely recommended for drama fans and mature audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great film and well desrving of an Oscar. I was very happy for Halle the night she won an Oscar for this film. She was the first black actress to win an Oscar for a leading role. The film takes your emotions on a roller coaster as we watch Halle deal with her overweight and depressed son, the trials of being less fortunate, and an unexpected bi-racial love affair. It teaches that love knows no boundaries colors and anybody can fall in love with anyone. ALl the actors were great and it was a pleasant surprise to see Sean Combs (P.Diddy). Great Film and well deserving of this award! This film opened many doors for Halle including her role in Catwoman and one of the first black super heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very honest, confronting and powerful piece of work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies in which you either will get drawn in or be emotionally dis attached to the characters. But I don't see how you can't be drawn in with such honest and terrific performances by both Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry in particular. I did speculate as to whether she deserved her Oscar, but after seeing this, my speculation is now at rest.Billy Bob Thornton plays Hank, who works in a prison as a Corrections Officer, helping in the execution of criminals. He is a racist, having being influenced heavily by his father at home and has a limited view of the world.Halle Berry plays Laticia, who is struggling with daily life. She is trying to deal with raising an obese son alone while her husband is soon to be executed by the state prison.Ultimately, Hank ends up helping Laticia, in a scenario which I won't reveal here, and slowly becomes a bit more human. They form a relationship that is almost unconventional but something we understand from the audiences' perspective.What I got most out of this story was that need to hold onto something in order to cope with life. The battles that keep getting thrown at us can often challenge our strength, and this is what we see in these two characters. You can feel their anguish, pain, sadness, anger in almost every scene and you just feel this raw honesty in their performances.The sex scene between the two characters has been talked about a lot. This isn't just a scene in which they both just want pleasure, but they want pleasure in order to forget the pain they are going through. Laticia keeps saying 'make me feel good' after having a painful thought about her son. It's the attachment to another soul, another human that the characters want in order for them to be able to wake up the next morning with a purpose in life.What makes this movie work, is that it is real. It doesn't try to hide the things that we may not want to talk about; it confronts them with a reality that is often depressing but true.****Possible minor spoiler******** (only if you can read between the lines) There may be just one little thing I have a problem with, but it is not a big deal. I won't talk about it here, but it involves the scene with her son in which she is confronted with a horrible situation. I felt that her character was very quick to move on, but I can understand her pain and her determination to simply get on with life.This is a very powerful film and should defiintely be viewed by a large audience, though I do understand because of its mood that it may be for some who want something a bit more cheerful. But the ending certainly gives a feeling of hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy is not the end of hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not a favorite with audiences so I knew there had to be something meaningful in it that the shallow public could not see or was not able to see or perhaps refused to see. It has one of the loveliest soundtracks I've ever heard which clings to the soul with a lingering and misty melancholy. A movie for for those who have known suffering. The Monster's Ball is a very bleak film yet it's also quite rare in that it's truly unpredictable. You won't find Hollywood trappings here. This is an Indy film, thoughtful with symbolism and a profound message. This movie caused a knee jerk reaction in parts of the black community, causing calls for boycotting and some racial tension. Simply put, a white racist death row prison guard, through a set of tragic and complex circumstances, begins to fall in love with the black wife of an inmate that he recently executed, of which she is totally unaware. Their anguished bond is the fact that they both have lost young sons. There is some blunt sexual content, however it's mainly queasy and uncomfortably painful rather than erotic. Still, this motion picture is not intended for children. This movie somehow captures the mood of yearning reconciliation between two devastated souls who discover they have absolutely nowhere else left to turn, except to each other. This is a startling "feel bad" movie that is able to say: tragedy will not be permitted to become the end of all hope. Rather it states: When you're at the end of your rope, letting go can be the best thing you can do. Ultimately consoling in a way that seeks to unlock a warm, rainy night in your heart where abandoned innocence is finally given a chance to be regained. Atmospheric and moody with a poetic and mystical resolution that leaves you with a mesmerizing shimmer of hope. In the final scene, Halle Berry unlocked something deep within herself. Her eyes spoke of a suffocated bleeding which magically suspended both time and space. "The title comes from a custom in medieval England where prisoners awaiting execution were called monsters. The night before their execution, their jailers would hold a feast known as a monster's ball as their final farewell." (Wikipedia)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marc Foster's 'Monster's Ball' is an excellent film in all respects. Be it the direction, the acting, the editing, the screenplay -- everything is so neat &amp; powerful. Such films are to be cherished and remembered!'Monster's Ball' is tragic tale of lonely people who embark on a dark and depressing journey. It takes courage to make a film, that even talks about racism and talks about it bluntly. And more than that it takes the courage, to let it go. The end might leave you wondering what happened next, and it's left it up-to you to give it a end. Marc Foster's direction is excellent, Milo Addica &amp; Will Rokos's screenplay is mind-blowing. Matt Chesse's editing is razor-sharp. Halle Berry's performance in 'Monster's Ball' is ememplary. Words fail to justify her portrayal. Billy Bob is very good. in fact, this is amongst his best works. Peter Boyle &amp; Heath Ledger are two talents we'll never forget. Both of the late actors pack in bravura performances in here. On the whole 'Monster's Ball' is a winner all the way... an excellent watch! Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Halle Berry deserved the Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that this film has more going for it than the sex scenes and seeing Halle Berry naked although it was the highlight of the film, but it is just generic and not thought provoking at all but just narrow. I however liked how it doesn't go to a political correctness direction which would not have been a good direction for a film like this. To be honest I think the film got a lot of spotlight cause of the sex scene in here with Billy Bob and Halle Berry that was quite the talk when the film was released although it had some other stuff to offer like the decent drama for instance and was also impressed by Halle Berry's acting. Although this film was a bit too hyped for what it is Halle Berry definitely deserved to win an Oscar.6.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We may think we've had bad hair days but we've gone through nothing like what Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton go through in this very well-executed but extremely melancholy movie.Let me see. Halle Berry is the wife of a man on death row and the mother of his child. The man gets fried by the authorities, which include Billy Bob Thornton or whatever his three names are. Billy Joe Thornton, Bobby Ray Thornton, Clarence Earl Barefoot, whatever it is -- how come everybody suddenly has to have three names? Edgar Allan Poe, okay. Even John Stewart Mill, or James Stewart Mill. But Billy Bob Thornton and Joe Don Baker? Let's get off that particular trolley, guys, and leave it to the likes of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sandra Day O'Connor and Tiffany Amber Thieson. No more three names for men, okay? Yes. Okay. Agreed.Now Halle Berry's husband is electrocuted by -- by -- Thornton. She doesn't know he's involved. Then her child is hit by a car and dies. Meanwhile, Thornton has his own problems. His invalid Dad, Peter Boyle, is an unregenerate racist who's physical frame is so debilitated he keeps falling down and puffing on an oxygen tank. Thornton's brother is a fellow corrections officer who keeps screwing things up and whom Thornton has hated since childhood. He shoots himself.Berry and Thornton, not knowing who the other is, meet by accident, literally, when he picks her and her stricken child up at the side of the road and drives them to the hospital. Thornton is uncomfortable and tries to get away but soon enough Berry sucks down enough whiskey to come on to the awkward Thornton, begging him, "Make me feel happy." Her idea of forgetting about her husband and son is getting her brains balled out on the floor by Thornton who, one way or another, by some devious mental device, manages to overcome his recalcitrance.I'm kind of making fun of it but I shouldn't. The script may be full of what I'd consider weaknesses -- the elaborate preparations for the execution, the coincidental meetings, and all that. But the fact is that they're quite well done. Halle Berry won an Academy Award for her performance and it's fine all the way through, with the exception of the drunk scene. (Some actors can do drunks, others can't.) Very low-key stuff with authentic-sounding dialog. We can just about believe that these characters are feeling what the script has adumbrated. Except that embarrassing "make-me-happy" business. If one's mate dies, one doesn't immediately look for succor in the arms of another, although this has become a movie convention.In a way, though, I'm glad that scene is in there, as wrong as it is. At least we get to see Halle Berry nude, and she IS splendid. Her facial features are supernally cute and her frame delicate but fully blown. Her performance is believable enough, but then everyone's is. Peter Boyle has never been better, and Billy Thornton is up to his usual standard, which is very good indeed. The performances are perhaps the best feature of the movie, along with the evocation of the character of the locale -- the late-night burger joints, the shabby and unpainted houses of the poor, the desperate neon of bowling alleys and other vernacular entertainments.It all winds up in a way satisfying to the two leads, even if it can't be called a "happy ending." I'm glad it wasn't a Hollywood wrap-up. Nothing could have been more divorced from the tenor of everything that's gone before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: "Monster's Ball"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Halle Berry took home Oscar gold for her performance in this film, that's been half of the reason many people have chosen to see the movie. The other half, of course, also involves Berry but not her clothes. However, Monster's Ball definitely offers more than just one fine performance and a rather iconic sex scene. In reality, it's more character-driven than plot-driven. Yes, the storyline helps to shape the characters, but the viewer is supposed to see just how certain circumstances change each individual and the life they live. Thornton, although not at the top of his game, plays a great leading part opposite Berry, and their interaction is wonderful. Heath Ledger's small role in the beginning of the film is good and rather indicative of his makings as a dramatic actor for later in his career. I believe that Boyle was slightly mis-cast, but he still pulled off his part as Thornton's father very well. My biggest problem in terms of acting performance (and because this is a character-driven piece, it's essential to the film) came from Sean "Diddy" Combs who played the inmate set to be executed. His character, doomed to an event that would change the lives of so many others, was rather flat and emotionless despite being placed against death's door. Perhaps that's what the filmmakers wanted, but I just feel like there would be a little bit of emotion when someone reaches that point. Still, although the film is a little clich in terms of certain plot devices, it's still a great character drama and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and dramatic film surrounding characters going from one crisis to another.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final few shots of Monster's Ball include a relatively long take of a large, clear, brilliant night sky complete with stars as two characters sit underneath it gazing up. It's a wonderful way to finish the film on such a large but silent object like the night sky as we pause to catch our breath and take in what has just happened, particularly the events from the final few minutes. Monster's Ball takes us on a journey and we feel as if we have travelled a fair distance by the end of it all with the most impressive thing being that several characters have just about been an even amount of screen time between them all and have been developed to the best of the film's ability.At its heart Monster's Ball is a very simplistic drama but all the more for it. The film does not teeter over that line that makes something wholeheartedly forced and nor does it ever feel fake or melodramatic, constantly keeping in check with what it establishes it will be and maintaining a juxtaposed air of hatred and love in the form of racism and inter-racial relationships. The film works primarily on a dramatic level, I think, because it is a tale of potentially fatale love or a tale of a potentially fatal relationship. The twist on the idea is to do with us, the audience, knowing that one half of the relationship is responsible for the death of the other half's other half. Incidentally, the diegetic knowledge the characters possess to do with potential relationships is entwined with one's race and one character's racist father who has issues with his son seeing a black woman.But the genius is, and I will use the word genius, that the white male half of the relationship doesn't realise he has bigger fish to fry on the horizon when he'll come to realise he was present for the black woman's prior partner's death. It acts as an event on the backburner for the audience to soak up as these two get to know each other in the film's first half exchanges. The characters in question are Hank Grotowski (Thornton) and Leticia Musgrove (Berry), two people who have enough happen to them throughout the course of this narrative to create individual films about them on their own.Hank is a prison guard on death row who resigns after Leticia's prior husband is executed under his watch. Working with him is his own son, Sonny (Ledger), who himself will be a victim of his own guilt and that distinct feeling that you're unloved. Completing the Grotowski family is Buck (Boyle), the wheelchair bound and in need of breathing apparatus racist father who lives on his own in one of those big houses you get in the Southern states of America and only know exist if you're not American and see them via the movies. Leticia, apart from having lost her partner, lives with her overweight son she carries a certain amount of antagonism toward to due to his obesity and eating habits.The dramatic question Hank's son poses to him at one point is along the lines of "You hate me, don't you"? before adding "Well, I always loved you" perhaps echoes Leticia's own son's thought process when a similar fate bestows him as to what happens to Sonny. It is these little connections revolving around big events and the people involved in them that force Hank and Leticia to connect in the manner they do. At its core, the film is a character driven drama set on everyday locations and shot in an unspectacular fashion but it really works in atmosphere. The study of Hank and Leticia works through its focus on the everyday and of the chance interactions they go through, be it at the diner she works or especially when she is in her hour of need by the roadside and Hank willingly pulls over.Director Marc Forster shoots his film with bizarre high angles looking down at most things, giving off a sense of God-like perspective as we leech on these people's lives and the tragic events that befall them; it's almost as if we have no right to see what's going on. Prior to an execution scene, Forster keeps the attention concentrated on Leticia and her death row ex-partner by cutting off the police officers at the shoulders and neck maintaining a sensitive aura in the foreground as these two interact for the last time but maintains menace in the background as these authoritarian figures loom ominously and anonymously.Monster's Ball is rewarding for those wanting a touching and drawn out dramatic experience. The final shots feel poignant in the sense it is one of the few occasions the characters, and indeed the camera, get to look up. They have covered such vast ground that they get time to stop and think ? for the whole film we have been up there where we're all looking in the sky, observing and absorbing and now for the finale we are on the ground level as everything slots into place and a new order threatens to break through despite people knowing certain things it would be better if they perhaps didn't. It is, annoyingly, a new order we do not get to see any of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a series of hardships Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) finds himself alone in the world, with his only son committing suicide and his ever-nagging father always riding him about every little thing. Hank is a prison guard that works on death row at a maximum-security prison where his son was also a guard. While at one of his favorite diners, he comes across a waitress whose luck is no better than his own. Leticia (Halle Berry) has also recently had to deal with the death of her husband who was on Hank's watch on death row. Leticia's son passed away shortly after his father when a car hit him as he was walking home from the diner with his mom. Hank helps her out the night he died and they form an emotional relationship. Director Mark Forster did a wonderful job showing us how in every situation some good can come out and to never give up when it seems all is lost. The character choice was great, Billy Bob Thornton is a passionate actor along with Halle Berry's flare. Tragedies like these happen every day and it was good to see some of the struggles each character faced and the positive that came from this. Monster's Ball had little suspense but all of the tragedy made up for that. Seeing outside of the box is what made this movie so interesting. Hank's father was racist toward the African American race which made the plot a little more suspenseful. The interest that I had in this movie was that it showed a person's will to move on even after a life shattering experience. The story line was catchy but for me the movie started off kind of slow. Once the plot got going, it seemed to hold me in my seat and I didn't find myself wanting to leave the room. All in all, this was a good movie. I wouldn't have given it a five out of five stars, but it earned a firm three. With this, I would definitely watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping, intense and brilliantly performed - Berry's finest hour by a mile - 82%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Oscar season finally passes by and the red carpet is rolled up for another year, it's natural to compare current Oscar winners with those that won before. I have my doubts that the majority of cinema-goers will have seen Marion Cotillard in "La Vie En Rose" but then again, not many people had seen Halle Berry in "Monster's Ball" before she blubbed her way into the history books. Compared to Renee Zellweger in "Bridget Jones' Diary" who was also up for Best Actress that year (though Lord alone knows how), Berry was a shoe-in for the award in a movie that not only showcases her talents but provides a powerful lesson in the art of acting from everyone else on screen.Billy Bob Thorton plays Hank, a hate-fuelled and deeply prejudiced Corrections Officers in America's Deep South working alongside his son Sonny (the late Heath Ledger) and living with his racist elderly father Buck (Peter Boyle). After the execution of inmate Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs, otherwise known as P Diddy), Hank's world begins to fall apart - a tragic parallel with that of Lawrence's widow Leticia (Berry) who struggles to pay the rent working as a waitress in Hank's favourite caf. Unwittingly, the pair of them start a torrid affair, each of them unaware of the roles and impact they have already have in the other's life so far.Like the similarly-praised "Training Day", this is one film that provides the viewer with an dazzling display of powerhouse acting. Berry is faultless, lurching from grieving mother to a strong survivor in a heartbeat and holds your attention in a vice-like grip. But Thorton and Boyle hold their own brilliantly - Boyle's previous comic persona in "Everybody Loves Raymond" is shattered here and Thorton brings his trade-mark world weariness into a role he was born to play. The supporting cast, led by Ledger and Coronji Calhoun as Berry's obese son Tyrell, also supply powerful and evocative performances and there is nobody on the cast you could criticise. However, the story takes a while to get going and is plausible, to a point. Personally, I thought the scene that defied logic the most was the one everybody talks about and for what this film will probably be remembered for: the explicit and brutal love scene. It's a real shame that the collection of outstanding performances in this film will be forgotten in the minds of most (male) viewers and replaced with something crude and unnecessarily graphic.But overlooking the hype and cutting through the crap, "Monster's Ball" is an exceptional film and one that no serious film fan should miss. The pop-corn munchers and blockbuster junkies won't take too kindly to its slow pace and lack of explosions but you don't need that to make a film of real quality. Berry shows us that for once, she is a legitimate actress and not just eye-candy - perhaps "Gothika" was a one-off after all! But this is a classic Southern romantic drama, filled with all the heat and passion of the Deep South alongside the dark racial undertones that flow through society. It's engaging and provocative all the way to the final reel, if a little ponderous for my tastes. But nothing can steal the limelight from Berry and say what you want but she was one Oscar winner who thoroughly deserved to win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a film for everybody; it's not a mainstream thing. And secondly, you have to be in the right mindset. Don't expect to see the usual romance or love at first sight. Nothing even close. This is a powerful stuff.This is a movie about a woman with no future and a man with no past, and there they meet. The man happens to be around when her both husband and son meat their creator. And she happens to around when he loses his son. Fate. Halle Berry pulls the performance of her life. And the notorious sex scene is one of a kind (which reminds me of what was that with showing her breasts in that stupid "Sword Fish", something like $200 000). Talking about taking sex scenes to a higher level. This is a good example not Diane Lane in "Unfaithful." And sure the final scene: it was all about Berry and she didn?ft disappoint. What was in her head: hate, love, despair, impassibility, hope or she was just too tired to think. Who knows, but those few minutes made me think about her like very few other movie character I can remember.Billy Bob Thornton throws also a very good performance. Good camera work and great soundtrack. Overall, this movie won?ft disappoint. Give it a try, you might even learn something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting American Period Piece of the Last Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A powerful work. It struck me while watching, that despite a few cultural references (mostly automobiles, their years and models giving away the time period of this setting) the drama of this film is wonderfully atemporal. It is happening in the present day, but could just as easily taken place 5, 10, even 50 years ago. This then is a revealing view into society's relatively stable prejudices and ideologies and of the few who use love to splinter these same frameworks. Halle Berry is achingly great but Thornton's the one who ends up capturing the awful complexity that each of these characters is made up of. True to life, none of these fellas is flawless and quite a few are critically flawed. But this doesn't stop them from living and coping with each others drawbacks together.An inspiring if not haunting American period piece for the entire last century and who knows how far into the future.</fullReview>

I have to also that although he is the only Southerner in the cast, everyone does a pretty good jobs w/the accent. If you haven't seen it, you should. And you'll love the deleted scene on the DVD were Billy Bob Thornton brings back his "Carl" character from "Sling Blade" one last time while beating up his son Sonny in the bathroom.

One white family that has some form of a racist attitude, lose a son who is a disappointment to his father and Grandfather because is sensitive, so he is thought of as weak. They then encounter through mutual grief a poor black woman, who loses both her husband and son.Most of the story and personalities of the main actors is implied through actions and not through the dialog. Lots of long pauses and a dour soundtrack, convey the rather miserable and depressing situation these people are in.There isn't a clear message or moral to the film, which is good. In the hands of a Spielberg a message would have been rammed down you throat. In this it is left up to the opinion of the viewer. The relationship between Billy Bob and his son is really the key to the film. His son, I believe, represented a young version of himself, sensitive and na?ve. His father was what he had started to become, racist and bitter. It's not clear whether he deliberately chose to change this viewpoint or whether it was through circumstance. He certainly started the change by resigning from his job, so there is more than a degree of evidence that this renaissance was something intentional.I admire the fact that this film isn't that patronising. The problem is the story is fairly uninteresting, there's nothing new. It's hard to believe that we are in the 21st Century and still racism exists to this point in the U.S. Although Halle won the Oscar and her performance is certainly a good one, she is very miscast. The problem is, she is gorgeous even with no makeup. It's hard to believe that she couldn't find a good man or more realistically a queue of men willing to help her.Overall, good that's it non-patronising, and good that it's not a typical Hollywood movie, but fails, as inherently the story is an uninteresting one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An apology to Miss Berry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoa. Okay, I admit, as happy as I was for Halle Berry to win the Best Actress Oscar, without having seen the movie for which she was nominated, I was under the impression that Berry was an extremely overrated and unnatural actress in need of some skills. Don't get me wrong I really do like her but without seeing "Monster's Ball," I actually thought she was a no-talent. Shame on me. She gives one of, if not the best performances of her career in this film. She was natural and not only am I happy that she won the Oscar, she deserved it as well. I owe a heartfelt apology to Ms. Berry for doubting her abilities. I now take a negative attitude to those ignorant fools who say that her Oscar win was little more that Hollywood Affirmative Action. The woman has talent, as evidenced here. Billy Bob Thorton, Heath Ledger and, believe it or not, Sean "P Diddy" Combs also turn in exceptional performances. Anyone who watches this film simply to see the notorious sex scene is watching a good movie with good performances for the wrong reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was...Halle Berry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for three reasons: Halle Berry,the sex scene, and Halle Berry.So did everone else. I am very proud of the work she represents as an Africa American Woman. She was bold, confident, and determined in taking on such a controversial and challenging role. Anybody but not everybody could have done this role. Its what Halle Berry represents. She is young, beautiful, different, and has a slightly favorable audience out there who is accepting to indifference.I can't stress beauty enough. It also has to do with marketing,timing, media and reputation. You get the point. For example who gets more coverage and awards? India Arie or Alicia Keys. Now back to my comment. The movie itself was boring but it was partially saved by the acting. This movie was about the perfomances. Check P. Diddy's performance. Didn't know he had it in him. All performances were both real and excellent.Billy Bob has already proved his acting ability and Halle took on a non-glam role to show her versitility and talent. But the most impressive show-stealing role was Heath Ledgers. But then he wasted it in the "Four Feathers". Oh well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice drama, but a little too unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you may have read in other reviews, this is a love story between a white prison guard, Hank (Billy Bob) and a black waitress, Leticia (Halle). What seems unrealistic too me is not that they fall in love after some very hard losses, but that Hank's personality changes so rapidly during the movie. Is feels hard to believe that he goes from being a bitter and hateful racist to an understanding and sensible lover to a black woman in just a couple of weeks (or is it days). It just goes too fast too really make it feel realistic.Otherwise, this is a different and touching drama. Billy Bob and Halle really shows how good they are at acting. By the way, how come so many complain about the sex scene? I really liked it, since the director made it feel authentic and not like porn. It also really shows that it's just two persons that are in desperate need of someone to love rather than true attraction. I think the part of Sonny was miscast though, Heath Ledger didn't seem fragile to me at all (he's more like the typical hunk, I understand if girls like him :-). But I agree to those who think that the sons to Leticia and Hank should've survived, since they're interesting characters.Finally, I think P.Diddy must've wanted this role to show what a really nice guy he is. He obviously seems desperate to let us know that he didn't shoot anybody at that nightclub! A nice little cameo, though.</fullReview>

Berry got the Oscar nod for two reasons: she showed her boobs, and didn't wear makeup. WOW! The characters are so unrealistic and undergo such sudden changes for no reason. They say things that NO ONE would ever say. This was like watching the local middle school do an improv version of "Of Mice and Men". Mos Def does his best to show that rappers can be actors, but Puffy eliminates any validity to that argument in seconds. Just because a movie tries to be dark doesn't mean it's deep. The actors are fresh out of a 1950s detective B-movie, hammy and over the top. If you don't believe me that this is a terribly written film, read the "Memorable Quotes" section--those are the BEST lines in the movie...</fullReview>

First, she is so light skinned she doesn't even look black. Second, she is absolutely drop dead gorgeous. How could Hank not fall for her, she is a knockout. IMHO this would have been a much more effective film if they would have had an ordinary looking black woman playing the part of Letica. I don't really think Berry deserved the Oscar for this, unless the judges were giving it to her for Best Simulated Sex Act. I wasn't aware that any state still used the electric chair, but there's a pretty realistic depiction of it's use in this movie.Contains violence, despicable behavior and graphic sex. Not a film for kids or even conservative adults. And I can't imagine anyone actually buying this DVD. Who would want to watch it more than once?

Why did they choose an actor (her son) that did not look like he was a product of Leticia or her husband? Why did Billy Bob Thorton's character all of a sudden change his racist attitude; it sure wasn't because of his son's demise or did I miss it? Why didn't he give his father the old heave-ho long before? Why did Billy Bob's character hate his son so much? I could come up with some answers to the questions myself, but I would have liked to see a change in facial expression from time to time to signal the characters change of heart. It could have been a great movie, but unfortunately for me, it was just OK. Perhaps P.Diddy should have gotten the nomination...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a surprise! Applauded for Halle Berry's performance (she deservingly won the Oscar) Monster's Ball crept onto screens in Australia during 2002 without much other fanfare. Featuring another solid performance from Billy Bob Thornton and the best performance by Heath Ledger in his short career as well as a find in Coronji Calhoun, Monster's Ball features some of the most strikingly honest scenes in an American film in the past ten years. Sex is rarely shown this honestly in American cinema and both Berry and Thornton should be applauded for their bravery during those painfully sad scenes. Perhaps a little unevenly paced and slightly repetitive and with a miscast Sean Combs, Monster's Ball is slightly less than what it could have been but that does not stop it from being one of the best releases of 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where to start on this movie. I will admit first though, the acting was superb. Billy Bob Thornton is one of my favorite actors, and he did a phenomenal job of portraying Hank Grotowski in this film. Heath Ledger plays his son "Sonny", and acts out an extremely emotional early movie sequence that sets the tone for much of the film. Halle Berry and Peter Boyle both gave outstanding performances as well, Berry shows her diversity and capabilities as an actress playing "Leticia Musgrove", waitress and wife of a death row inmate in this movie. In short- this film was simply well acted and powerful.Unfortunately, I did not walk away from this film with a feeling of satisfaction. I was not dissatisfied with the sheer fact that the movie was filled with emotional, tear-jerking scenes. Instead, I was dissatisfied with the movie in general, from small peaves with the directing of the film, to the biggest letdown that the film simply doesn't have much, if anything to offer the viewer a chance to smile. Another big turn off to me were the extremely explicit and drawn out sex scenes throughout the movie. I can see no reason why the director decided to make these scenes so lengthy, beside maybe making the viewing audience sit in an uncomfortable silence for a rather long period of time.I would give this film one thumb up, that's for the acting. Nice work actors... The thumbs down goes to the never-one-smile-throughout-the-entire-movie script and those wretched sex scenes. Totally unnecessary</fullReview>

At one point Billy Bob's Hank, who couldn't take care of his own son or wife, tells Halle's Letitia he wants to take care of her. She coos, "Good, cuz I need taking care of." I couldn't have agreed more. Taken care of like a horse with a bad leg.Billy Bob and Heath Ledger were fabulous. Here are a couple of actors who know how to say volumes with a single look. Every performance was great, and while the movie struck me as a painful examination of ugliness and weakness, there were bits and pieces I did really enjoy. Such as Combs' character, and the family that neighbored Hank's. The screen time was limited for all of those people, but the dialogue was so well written that they endeared themselves to me after only a couple of words.I wouldn't want to see this one again. I can look at my own life if I feel like picking scabs. Anybody who wants reality to slap them silly will enjoy this film, and we escapists can run off to Lord of the Rings and pretend there is good and there is evil and a nice clean line in between.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monster's Ball, to me, was not as depressing as the other comments suggest. Rather, it is a sublimely melancholic exploration of one man's fight to free himself from his past.The acting was as excellent as the ambiance was overwhelming. The only thing that stopped this movie from being a masterpiece in my books was the slow pace, which did a great deal to set the mood, but got tedious as the film went on.From a formal point of view, the film is visually stunning in its simplicity, usually trading in flashy, gimmicky, visual effects for minimalist lighting and sober editing. A soft, echoey aural leitmotif further accompanies and develops the film's mood and texture, although I found that some of the music used got repetitive as the movie progressed.All-in-all, a stunning achievement. I must say that it is quite rare to see such melancholy outside of an urban setting, which is what makes Monster's Ball that much more unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Acting without a hint of a moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monsters Ball, a depressing examination of two humans that find love through sadness, was a good film, but not a great one. Granted, I saw this film with the highest of expectations. I was expecting great directing, a great plot, great dialogue, great cinematography, great acting, and once the movie was finished I was left dissatisfied in some, not all, respects. I did find the cinematography very good. There was a high attention to detail with camera shots, lighting, etc. The camera always stayed there to simply show you what was happening, and there were no stylistic camera moves, and no special effects...the cinematography just served as a way to give perspective on a tragic southern story. I thought the acting was solid, but not fantastic. Billy Bob Thornton was perfect as a character who is somber and drained of emotion, a character which doesn't require the greatest acting range, but didnt need to. He did a good job, but compared to his genius performances in Sling Blade and A Simple Plan, this role wasnt over the top, but I suppose it never needed to be. On the other side, I found Halle Berrys performance exaggerated. She cries and screams and groans, and I almost found it annoying and overdone. I also couldnt get drawn into the film, or the characters, or the plot, all because of horrible casting. Halle Berry is so light skinned, shes almost white, not to mention drop dead gorgeous, so she didnt seem rightly cast as the tragic figure she played. I also found Hanks (Billy Bob Thornton) change from racism to falling in love with a semi black woman to be way too simple and quick. There was no character examination about this life change. The only reason these two people ever came together is because Latisha (Berry), had hit rock bottom in life and she desperately needed someone, anyone, to take care of her. Because shes so beautiful, and because shes not the type of African American woman where you notice the darkness of her skin, of course Hank would quickly change his racist opinions and fall in love with her. Shes gorgeous and he probably just feels like a lucky man. If she was an actress that wasnt so beautiful, and was more noticeably black, that may have added so much more meaning to the film. I do recommend Monsters Ball, but I dont feel it lived up to its promise. Did Berry deserve that Academy Award, now that's the question. I forget who was nominated in the first place as competitors, but based on other films this year I would say probably not, although one can see the work she put into making this film, an effort thats not to be overlooked. I previously believed Halle Berry and Heath Ledger to be overrated in the movie business, but I now respect Halle Berry and Heath Ledger more as actors. Thornton has been much better though. Anyway, I give this film about a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, but no plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has very strong performances from all of the cast, but is lacking in story structure. This movie is supposed to be about how a racist man, in love, can still love a woman of a different race, but they do not demonstrate that Billy Bob Thornton's character is actually very racist. His father is a racist, but they get rid of him in the middle of the movie, leaving no story at all except all of the tragedies that occur to the two main characters, which is not at all a plot. So, all this movie is are a handful very powerful individual scenes and a good cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard some mixed things about this movie so I went into it a little skeptical. What can I say? This movie left me completely jolted. My stomach hurt, I couldn't concentrate. It was unreal. I've not had that experience with a film in some time. Saying "I liked Monster's Ball" is a strange statement because I'm not sure I was supposed to. It definetly affected me, though. It grabs you right away and just keeps snow balling. Incredible character development, a smart script, and a nice eye for detail make this a truly stand out movie. The always reliable Billy Bob Thorton is great as expected. This guy really knows how to choose roles. You hate him, you tolerate him, you learn to like him. These filmmakers have you right where they want you and don't let go. I'm still not sure how I feel about Halle Berry in this movie. I think I would have enjoyed it more if her role had been played by someone not quite as attractive. It wasn't hard to imagine any man falling for her. It would have been a more significant event had she been a little less appealing. Peter Boyle is wonderfully vile as Hank's father. All I've really seen of him is his role on Everybody Loves Raymond so this was a real shock to say the least! Like I said, I loved it but have talked to others who didn't think it was all that it was made out to be. Rent it and see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in subtle acting and direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie different than many you see nowadays. This is the type of story that is character driven and the director realizes this. He simply places the camera in front of the actors and lets them act.And act they do.The amazing thing about the performances in this movie is how much of the story is told with their facial expressions and their body languages, as well as their voices. The final scene of the movie is a perfect example(don't worry, no spoiler): Halle Berry's Leticia does not speak a single word in the final scene, yet you can see exactly what is going through her mind simply through her subtle facial expressions.A warning: while I do consider this a good movie, it is most definitely NOT a happy movie. Many bad things happen, some quite unexpextedly. Oh, and for those of you who went ga-ga over Halle showing her "berries" in Swordfish, that was nothing compared to what you get in this flick!If you like good acting and a story well-told in it's simplicity, give this one a look see. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow beginning, but stick with it for fascinating love story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is a very classy independent film. The love that all involved in the production comes through loud and clear. The beginning of the movie dwells on giving us so much details and brutality that it challenges the viewer to stick with it. Some of the violence is presented more graphically and angrily than necessary IMHO. Peter Boyle does a marvelous job as Thornton's miserable, sadistic, and thoroughly bigoted father. Overcoming the hatred and intolerance that he learned from his father supplies the essence of Thornton's character transition. I had not been a fan of Thornton's work prior to Monster's Ball, and in the first 40 minutes, I figured, "Same old Billy Bob." His completely believable and palpable growth, inspired by his wish that his son not die in vain, made me eat my words. He gives a marvelous performance in this movie -- on a par with Berry's magnificent work in letting us feel the pain she feels under the skin, and barely resisting the urge to surrender to the fates. The last hour of this film is very heartfelt and special. It is loving and romantic without ever being sentimental. The chemistry between Thornton and Berry is truly special, and their inherent abilities to communicate and fight to learn to love and trust each other are amazing to behold without ever striking a false note. The climactic scene after she moves into his house is poignant, brilliant, and memorable.So, although you might have the urge to give up on Monsters' Ball during its hard-to-take set-up sequence, stick with it and you shall be amply rewarded. Overall, I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done although extremely bleak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very well done in terms of acting, writing and directing. It was also incredibly bleak. Despite what could be considered a `positive' ending, you have to go through so much despair to get there, I'm inclined to think a lot of movie goers just won't be in the mood to put up with so much despair. Billy Bob Thornton as Hank Grotowski is excellent, as always. Halle Berry puts in a performance of which I honestly didn't think she was capable. She was quite impressive. Peter Boyle played Buck Grotowski, Hank's hateful, racist pig father, well enough to make me hate him almost instantly. Several problems exist however. We don't every really find out why Hank hated his son so much (which is one of the most surprisingly abrupt scenes I've seen in a movie). We don't know what was with Hank's mother who was thoroughly berated by Buck. Lots of angst and depression but not a lot of support given for it. I suppose the filmmakers decided this was not important, but I think it would have helped to establish the main characters' motivations. Good film but again, quite bleak and dreary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grossly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball fails to live up to the hype generated by the glowing critical reviews and multiple Oscar nominations. Of course the acting is well done. With a talented cast that includes top gun professionals like Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry and Peter Boyle, how could it not be well done? But the appeal of the film ends there. Despite the fine performances, the story is slow-moving and surprisingly boring. Yes, the sex scenes are definitely hot, but most other scenes found me beginning to nod off to dreamland.So, what's the moral of this supposedly sensitive tale? It seems to be: 'even the most bigoted southern white man can learn to love black folks if they are young, beautiful, seductive and horny.' That's not a very attractive commentary on modern race relations, is it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SpoilerI felt as if I were watching an American film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni ('member him?) with its take-your-time pacing and hard-to hear dialogue. But the subtlety worked for me. I got to know the characters and grew to like them. Specifically Billy Bob's and Halle's. Halle's gut-wrenching recollection about her poor fat son as Billy Bob sits next to her on the sofa was, I think, the clincher for her Oscar. It was so real and so sad. It came from an emotional depth stored up in her and she just let go. My one prob is with Heath Ledger's suicide: (By the way, for a Brit, his cracker accent was superb) Why would such a strapping stud like him off himself just because his dad had to correct him? And why exactly does Billy Bob HATE HIM ? "I've hated you all my life." he tells his ONLY SON! Wow. Where's that coming from? (But that would've been another movie) All in all, a strange, yet life-affirming film with a happy ending.</fullReview>

I was surprised that so many comments focused on racism, when it seemed to be only a minor punctuation in the theme of the film. I would agree with Doug that Hank (Thornton) was not racist, he treated everyone with equal coldness. Only after a tragic event does he begin to examine his life and understand what is wrong. His job required him to be unemotional and unattached, so he quit and began a transformation. To me, the point of this film had nothing to do with race or economic class or regional stereotypes, that was just the setting. The point of the film is the lyric of an old Barbara Streisand song: "People ... people who need people ... are the luckiest people in the world." I think they made their point.</fullReview>

Sean Combs proved that he belongs in the acting world in just his first on-screen role. His portrayal of Lawrence, a man on Death Row, is understated and powerful. Heath Ledger's portrayal of Sonny is also brilliant. The only fault lies in the writing--neither Lawrence nor Sonny are fully developed.

		<shortDescription>Outstanding emotional drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monsters Ball 9/10(contains minor spoilers don't worry knowing what happens won't spoil your enjoyment)I went to see this at the cinema a second time just to verify that it is indeed one of the finest emotional dramas to be made for several years. Halle Berry walked away with best actress Oscar on this one. I jumped in exactly the same places either because her performance is so powerful that it knocked me off my seat or because the script dragged my guts out with a pitchfork and smacked me across the face. Berry plays the widow of a black Georgia man who we see electrocuted for murdering a policeman. Eventually she realises that the man she later falls in love with (played by Billy Bob Thornton) is also the prison guard who took part in her husband's execution. Her son has been killed in a road accident. She has been kicked out of her house for non-payment of rent. The executioner (played by Billy Bob Thornton) loses his son through suicide. His racist father nearly ruins his relationship with Letitia (Halle Berry) with whom he has fallen in love. This is not an easy-ride film. There is enough well-played tragedy to affect the most cynical of viewers. It is not for the feint hearted. There are explicit sex scenes that are very integral to the plot (the characters bottled up sexual problems seem linked to the history of family violence). The execution is filmed not on a set but at a real prison and it is not watered down at all.Ultimately this is a film that people really wanted to see made because it has some real value. Not just about racism or capital punishment, it looks at breaking the cycle of violence and aggression. Berry and Bob Thornton took deferment on their paychecks to enable it to be made on a minuscule budget and it was shot in 25 days. The casting is superb, and the acting throughout is world class (look at some of the long scenes that Berry probably clinches her Oscar in and which would have needed to be made in a continuous take). The screenplay is worked to bring the audience into touch with their innermost dreads you struggle with the characters to work out what the hell you would do in such a situation with that family or those circumstances. If you only go and see one film this year, make it Monster's Ball.</fullReview>

Not just the obvious racial elements but other things like love, family, frustration and depression, how we can hurt the ones we love and be hurt by them.I especially enjoyed Sean Comb's relationship with his son.

Sean Combs is quite convincing as Berry's death row husband and is the initial character to creep into your mind and never leave.

		<fullReview>***contains spoilers***This movie received critical acclaim...but for what? The plot is rather silly. This is a movie about a racist white man and a black woman who end up falling in love (more like lust). The movie itself is not really boring or bad, but at the same time, there is nothing outstanding about this movie. This film was lacking intensity. I do not think that the director of this movie handled the subject matter of the movie well enough. The story did not move me. And, for its running time of 112 minutes, everything in the movie just happened too quickly. Too quickly! Had this been a longer movie, more screen time would've given us the chance to get to know these characters better, and to know what drove them to make the choices/changes that they made in their lives. For example, Billy Bob Thorton's character, Hank, is a racist. He despises black people. Then all of a sudden he stops being racist, in just a matter of days. How does a person go from being a racist to not being a racist in such a short period of time? And how did Hank and Leticia (Halle Berry's character) end up falling in love within that time frame...or why did they? These two characters, Hank and Leticia, have things in common: he has a son, she has a son...Hank is abusive to his son, Leticia is abusive to her son....his son dies, her son dies. Was the point of this movie to make us think that the deaths of their sons made these people needy, and that their need is what brought them together? The sex scene made them appear as needy, affection-starved people. That sex scene was unintentionally funny. I laughed during the whole scene. I remember reading a review of this film that was written by a movie critic, in a magazine. That review described Halle Berry's performance as "astonishing". Well, after seeing this movie, I was not astonished. Her performance did not impress me. Her tear-ridden speech at the Academy Awards ceremony was much more worthy of an acting award than her performance in this movie. In my opinion, her character changed throughout the movie. At first Leticia seemed aggressive...then later she came across as a passive person. It seemed as if she was playing two characters rather than just one. And what was the meaning of the expression on her face after she discovers that there was a link between Hank and her late husband? Was it resignation, because she had no one else in her life other than Hank to help her out and because she had nowhere else to go? Who knows. This movie left me guessing a lot of things. I will point out that I liked Billy Bob Thorton's performance. I especially liked Peter Boyle's performance as his bitter racist father. Overall, this could've been a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read pages of user comments here before I watched this film last night, so I had an open mind. I must say though, I did enjoy it. It certainly isn't crap, as some viewers have described it. It is definitely NOT a film for everyone, and I can see how people will have conflicting and strong viewpoints all over the place about this film. That's not a bad thing...any film that has the power to make us feel strongly AT ALL about anything these days is a testament in itself.Not a big fan of Halle's,but I thought she did an excellent job. Like others though, I wonder why they chose her instead of Alfre Woodard or Angela Bassett. Too 'black'? Hmmm... And BBT, well I'm a big fan, so enough said. Peter Boyle as the father...did he win any awards/get nominated for this performance? I can't remember. If he didn't, shame on the Academy!If you live in one of the southern midwest/south/southeastern states (as I do) you might get more from this movie, as there are things about it that you'll be able to relate to, or understand easier. Unfortunately, I know many people like these characters (I live in a small town of 500). I found myself thinking, jesus what's going to happen next to these poor bastards???Things that may seem unbelievable in this film....well, people, American Gothic DOES exist in this part of the country. It was invented here. You DO run into the same people over and over again. The suicide scene - well, that happened around where I live - in almost the same fashion, last year.I agree with tidbits of almost all of the previous review's I've read here...I can see why some people might hate this film. But it IS quite well done! Some excellent scenes, some not-so-excellent....judge for yourself. Either way, you're bound to feel strongly one way or another.

		<shortDescription>Not your typical Hollywood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not your typical Hollywood movie, and that's a good thing.For those here who have commented that they found the movie dull, slow, or boring, all I can say is go rent a Joel Schumacher film and leave movies like this to the rest of us.It was refreshing to see a movie portray its characters with shades of grey, instead of black and white.As much as Hollywood likes to concoct characters whose depth is often simplistic, for the sake of pushing the audience's buttons, this film goes the other route.Billy Bob portrays a "racist" southern prison guard. But is he? To call him racist is to reduce his character to the liner notes on a video box.Like most people Billy Bob's character is much more complex.He clearly is a man dealing with internal conflicts. While, in moments of tension, he does reveal a glaringly racist side, at other times he reveals that he understands the equality of human life. He is drawn into conflict with his son, a fellow guard, for breaking down during the execution walk of a black prisoner. If Thornton's character were truly racist he wouldn't care, but instead berates his son for destroying "a man's last moments" as much as he does for bringing shame to the job he holds, as did Thornton's father (Peter Boyle) before them. Does this sound racist? Hmmmm....Simlarly, Hale Berry's character is equally complex. At times she treats her overweight son with abject derision. Yet, as the movie reveals, she behaves in this midguided fashion out of love and fear for what the future might hold for him.More than individual racism, this film deals with individuals struggling to throw off or overcome society's prejudices, and those handed down by our parents.It features strong performances all around, from Billy Bob, to Hale Berry, to yet another rapper-turned-actor Sean "Puff Daddy" Coombs who, for the time he is on screen, turns in a surprisingly accomplished and mature performance as a prisoner in his last days leading up to his execution.Two quote Roeper and Ebert, I give this film two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing about all the Oscar nominations and rave reviews I was expecting a great movie. I guess I wasn't prepared for the movie's overall depressing feeling. It must have taken a lot of courage to tackle such tough subject matter, but I only wish the movie was a little more upbeat. I think in order to be a successful movie you must have a certain level of entertainment value, otherwise its just not fun to watch. I am a big Indy fan and dislike the standard action movie Hollywood cranks out, so it's strange for me to complain that a movie is too slow and depressing. The movie presents a very disturbing view of life, death, sex, family, and relationships.The acting is quite good, but I think people who are not film aficionados will not be impressed because they are accustomed to over dramatize acting that are in most movies. So people looking for Halley Barry to do some sort of dramatic Shakespearean speech will be disappointed.</fullReview>

Son: You hate me don't you? Dad: yeah I hate you: always have. Son: I always loved you? then he shoots himself, sorry and all but this is very very funny. Admittedly I was the only one laughing in the cinema, but that's irrelevant, isn't it? Woman loses husband in electric chair, fat son gets run over (he's fat therefore lets mock him, fat kids great for comedy: not a good idea though) and then he dies and Halle Berry cries a lot; and with lots of crying comes an Oscar; if she were retarded in some way too then well she'd probably be acclaimed as the greatest actor ever to live. And Billy Bob, well he's okay as ever, though in this one it's like he's still in The Man Who Wasn't There Mode; which should be a good thing but it's just dull: just not the Coen's I suppose. Plus and this bit really amused me but you know he can't be that racist since he likes chocolate ice cream and black coffee. Please shoot me now if this is acclaimed as the best film of the year. For me this was a not very good continuation of Dancer in the Dark.Anyway, I can't be bothered saying anything more about this film, disappointing in the end, (and the middle and beginning too) but hey it doesn't really matter, does it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good, some not so good, but generally a solid effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope I am not alone when I proclaim that I enjoy movies like Monster's Ball. I don't mean small independent films (although I do enjoy many of them) or films of the "race relations" genre (although I do enjoy many of them, too). I enjoy films that are effective as art, and this one is. Now, understand that it has some significant problems. But despite those problems, it offers a unique and provocative look at its subject, which is perpetuated through all its component parts: acting, directing, screenwriting, cinematography and score. Moreover, the film's effect has inspired considerable debate and discussion, and that always makes a film more enjoyable, right?Unlike Roger Ebert, I cannot claim that I believe that Monster's Ball was THE best film of 2001. I can think of at least six films that were better. But it is a compelling piece of work nonetheless, and is well-worth the price of admission or rental.The film's strongest component is its directing. Marc Forster's choice of shots, angles, coverage and the like add significantly to the film's presentation of subject. The story's presentation is enhanced by Forster's effective usage of both rapid coverage (closeup, point-of-view changes, like during two-person dialogue scenes), while at other times he holds a wider shot from one camera angle. Consider this example: When we first see Hank in the cafe, the entire scene is filmed in one or two very wide shots. However, in the scene's with Leticia in the cafe, there is much more coverage, demonstrating the contrast of Hank's feelings from act to act in the film. Also interesting is the coverage that Forster gives to the love scenes. When Hank or Sonny are with the prostitute, the shot is wider, as is the first scene with Hank and Leticia. But the later love scene with Hank and Leticia is shot closer with more coverage. This difference significantly adds to the film's power to convey its plot and character development.The cinematography is truely amazing. I am surprised that it did not get nominated for an Oscar in this catagory. The angles, focus (particularly in car scenes) and lighting are riveting, and give the film a curious and compelling feel. Similarly, the score was very well-done, and subtly undertones the changing mood of particular scenes.The screenplay is less commendable. As described below, it lacks plot and character development in some very critical ways.The acting is something else all together. At times, it was extraordinary, and at times it was not. Perhaps it was suspect casting that injured the film in this respect. Sean Combs' performance was dreadful. A host of other African-American actors could have elevated that role to something far more useful to the film. Peter Boyle's performance was interesting, but perhaps not the most effective. Rod Stager in that role would have been electrifying. The two sons in the film (Heath Ledger and Coronji Calhoun) have good supportive performances.Halle Berry. Who doesn't like to watch Halle Berry. I remember watching "Bulworth" and swooning each time she came on screen. She has a similar effect here. She is a great movie star, but then so is Jennifer Lopez. Is she a great actress? Well, before this film, I thought "No." After this film? "Maybe." She definitely has some fantastic moments in this movie. Her toned down look is perfect throughout. And she generates some real pathos in a few critical scenes, such as her grieving in the hospital, her meeting with Hank's father, and her first scene in her apartment with Hank. In these scenes, she makes good choices, and draws out the full impact of the screenplay. However, she makes bad choices, or no choices, in other scenes. Her scene in the prison visiting room is flat and/or confused. In contrast, her scene with Tyrell in the living room and his bedroom is over the top and unconvincing. The popular question seems to be "Did she 'deserve' the Oscar?" Well, depending on what "deserving an Oscar" means, yeah, I suppose she did. It was not the greatest performance by an actress, nor was it the greatest performance by an actress in 2001. But it was an Oscar-caliber performance in that she did an very professional job of transforming herself into this role, and used her craft to reach a touching degree of empathy. Perhaps her bigness drawback in this role is the fact that you cannot NOT notice that Halle Berry is on screen. Her star-power prevents her from blending into the fabric of the film.But the big issue in this film is Billy Bob Thornton. His performance was both better at times and worse at times then Berry's. In truth, the screenplay let Thornton down. Hank's graduation from racist redneck to broad-minded romantic was not adequately slow and gradual. Hank's character transformation was too stilted, too jumpy, not smooth enough to meet the film's needs. While he did not go from one extreme to the middle overnight, it did happen in about 15 minutes of film time. I got the distinct impression that Thorton was trying his hardest to smooth over these wrinkle. But despite his considerable talent, the screenplay was too rabid in its portrayal of Hank's character progression. It sets him up as a bad man, and it sets him up as a good man, but it flew between the two sides too quickly.All and all, a very good effort, and a film worth viewing for its subtle treatment of race. In recent years, only Spike Lee's treatment of the subject has been better (ala "Do the Right Thing"). And, like Spike, who doesn't like to watch Halle Berry?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotive film with strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film quite moving at times. Billy Bob Thornton &amp; Halle Berry's performances were excellent. Mos Def (the hip hop star) showed real potential in a small role in the film with Sean Combs doing what he has to do as Halle's screen husband. At times this film was almost shocking with some scenes of sex and violence which were quite unexpected. I found the sex scenes in particular very hard to swallow. The most interesting aspects of the film were to do with race and age. Billy Bob's character is an avowed Southern racist who has an "epiphany" on meeting Halle Berry's "poor black trash" character. I found it difficult to believe their relationship due to the different backgrounds that they had. The generational ties between Billy Bob Thornton's family in the film were interesting and well conceived giving the film a resonance about how times change but things stay the same. All in all a film more for contemplation than upliftment or excitement but well worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tour de Force acting in a future Sundance Channel Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today, June 11,2002 Monster's Ball was just released on video for rental and I was waiting for the day I could watch this movie since the night Halle Berry won as the first black woman to receive a Best Actress Oscar in a leading role. You see, Im an african american male and the rush of black pride overwelmed me that night. But Im not going to get into the "black" thing over this...thats not what this review is about. Now about the movie... Monster's Ball... Do not expect a crowd-pleasing, fast moving box-office hit. Ohhh it is SO much more than that: this is a morose, sometimes mundane, ultimately satisfying 'Sundance Channel' type of movie that prides itself on pure character development and story line. If you find it moving slow at first, you MUST stay with it.. the acting (especially by Halle Berry) is spellbinding and you will be drawn into it. She deservedly won the Oscar for her portrayal as Letica. It was good seeing P-Diddy aka Puff Daddy aka Sean Puffy Combs in a role as Letica's doomed husband. The screenplay should have won an Oscar too, as well as the haunting original score of the movie. Its just a shame that the small, sleepy racist town that Letica lives in still exists today in middle America and the deep south. Not that the movie portrayed the people in it as racists, Im not saying that --- its just that the storyline was very original, and it said something about how powerful the human spirit is. You must watch it for its symbolism, irony and basically how life unfolds before your very eyes. When the movie is over, you'll be saying to yourself "wow, what a kick-ass flick!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to escape the monumental fact that Halle berry is the first African American actress to be awarded a Best Actress Oscar for her performance in Monster's Ball therefore forcing your curiosity to go and see this film. I sat through nearly two hours of a lack lustre film, which left you unmoved and with a keen desire to slap yourself awake out of a boorish slumber. The script lacked depth and tried to survive on it's own bloated self-importance. The main characters were poorly written while those characters of interest like Sunny and Tyrell Musgrove were killed off too quickly to add to the wholly predictable and coincidental plot. I suppose the film demonstrates how the need to make this small film with name actors like Thornton and Berry meant that the good things had to be sacrificed for the sake of budget and time and that it was left to post-production to bring some sort of coherence to the story. Sadly, the movie veered away from making a very exciting and powerful drama since there was a lot more to be explored with the story and characters and settled for the most boring characters in a very boring tale. Did Halle Berry deserve an Oscar? Based on what I saw, no. There was nothing in the performance to justify her deserving this Oscar. My excitement of March 24th, on seeing a non-Caucasian female walk away with the highest award, was murdered on seeing Monster's Ball. Is it possible that the Oscar was given to Halle Berry as token appeasement to the African American population or was it given to make sure that the urban audiences decide that the establishment is not racist hence they, the Urban audience, make more effort to see all kinds of Hollywood movies and not just movies starring African American actors, comedians and rap-artists. One has to question the Denzel Washington Oscar since his performance in Training Day was totally over the top and one long theatrical rant offering you nothing but ?Look at me, I am Denzel Washington and I am the best actor even better than James Earl Jones.' Sorry Denzel but James Earl Jones could act you off the screen any day of the week and twice on Sunday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed, but all the better for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize that this film has received seriously divergent reviews from different parties, but I, for one, thought that it was excellent. Flawed, yes, but anything that seemed "wrong" with the film (i.e. an implausible line of dialogue, a questionable plot development, melodrama, messy shots, etc.) almost always seemed to work somehow, given that it was a film about desperate people in desperate situations, that boldly (and I think, successfully) tried to leave viewers with a sense of hope. I would agree with some other reviewers that the screenplay was the film's greatest weakness, some of the dialogue in particular (for example, early on in the film, when visiting her husband in prison, Halle Berry's character, Leticia, uses the phrase, "the theme was solitude" in describing her son's school project, hitting a wrong note in the flow of the conversation). But still, the writing is what gave the actors the opportunity to create what turned out to be incredibly believable and even likeable characters, and to really show their talent onscreen (when all's said and done, powerful acting is really what this film is really all about). Given that, I'm not sure how I feel about the film's screenplay nomination at the Oscars. I have a feeling that it didn't really have much to do with the writing; rather, the writers' branch of the academy was probably showing their support for the film as a whole. Halle Berry's nomination, however - and subsequent win - were well deserved. I was not a huge fan of hers before this, but her performance here is a standout, and she more than deserves her historic Lead Actress Oscar. Also terrific are her costars Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger, and Peter Boyle, as the three generations of southern men - one blatantly racist, one compassionate, and one at at a crossroads in his thinking (Sean Combs, in my opinion, is passable, but doesn't really add anything to the picture). Comparing this film to "In The Bedroom," the other acclaimed domestic drama released this year, I'd say that while it's nowhere near "Bedroom" in terms of that film's triumph with pure craft, "Monster's Ball" drips with atmosphere and its acting is just as powerful, and it's uplifting to boot. And yes, Halle Berry WAS better than Sissy Spacek. See "Monster's Ball." See Halle Berry. When it's over, you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the first issue that needs to be accounted for is whether Halle Berry deserved the oscar she got or was it just a "discriminatory correction" for years of ignoring those great black actors who watched their white o.k. actors get golden statues (samuel l. jackson in pulp fiction and denzel washington in Philadelphia are the first examples that pop in my head). my answer to this issue is well, probably not. halle is a great actress but she deserve the oscar for girl 6 rather than this movie.billy bob thornton is accused by many of the imdb bored-out-of-their-minds-wannabe-critics as being sleepy. i would define his acting as quiet power. you can deduct the state of mind of his character, not just accept it by extreme gestures (like glenn close in reversal of fortune). the movie itself is less balanced, it consists of extreme tragedies to the characters (not just loss of life but in the most brutal ways possible) followed by a sleepy pace of a inter-racial couple that seem to be going for the guinness book of world records for love making. the sex scenes, aside from their frequency, lack any grace and sometimes appear as a national geographic special of "mating among the Neanderthals". and that was the censored version. it's a good movie, i'm just being plain mean, but it's not a masterpiece and it's not a mortal sin to wait until it's on video (but it's likely to be a sin if you watch it alone at night...)7.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best film of the year *corrected review*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a movie about race with no preaching. Monster's Ball is the best film of the year and one of the best films of our decade. Halle Berry delivers the best performance of 2001 and deserved her Oscar. Billy Bob Thornton's performance isn't as great as his performance was in "The Man who wasn't There" but it's worth talking about. The directing was hypnotic and scary.THE PLOTThe first scene of the film shows Hank (Billy Bob Thornton)who chases off two young black kids with his shotgun, while his father(Peter Boyle) and son (Heath Ledger) look on. This is a sick family. Then the film cuts to a young black woman Leticia (Halle Berry) who has a husband on death row and a morbidly obese son. He gets hurled by a car and dies in front of his mother.These two people look like they're about to commit suicide, then they find each other and begin a courtship. Leticia then has a revelation about Hank.THE CHARACTERS Billy Bob plays Hank, a man corrupted by his father and unable to escape. Halle Berry plays Leticia, a woman whose life is in shambles with the death of her husband and the demise of her son. Albert Brooks plays Hank's father, a crazy, racist, and lonely old man. Heath ledger plays Hanks son, a young man trying unsucessfully to be like his father. I love this film because it attempts to show that it doesn't matter if people are of different races, love is possible. In the scene when Halle Berry is talking to Billy Bob Thornton in the restaurant, he looks at her just as he would any other white woman.When you fall in love with someone of a different race, you don't see them as black, white, yellow, or red, you just see them as a person. People may not understand the message, all I know is that I understand.I recommend this film to anyone who just wants to see a good film. I give this film a 15 out of 10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Suited For the Porn Rack Than the Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the movie has a tone of gravity about it, the transformation of the protagonist, Hank, from a racist corrections officer to a kinder, more tolerant man, is not apparent. The movie does not adequately demonstrate the impact of Hank's son's suicide on him. The audience sees that he is gradually a changed man, but the logic of his reasoning and the gradations of his transformation remain vague. I had watched the movie "American History X" right before "Monster's Ball", and the contrast is striking. Whereas in "American History X", the transformation of the main character, a reformed Neo-Nazi, is clearly demonstrated by his attempts to navigate through the racial politics of prison life, "Monster's Ball" provides a weak glimpse into the interior psyche of the racist white Southerner.If anything, this movie was created to showcase Halle Berry's impressive breasts and overall figure. In this respect the film has outdone itself. But to use a serious and weighty subject, like the contentious racial divide of the South, to display not only Berry's acting prowess but perky body as well, insults the importance of the social problems that the film inadequately probes. A movie inordinately preoccupied with situating Berry's character in sexual positions is more suited for the porn rack than the Oscars.</fullReview>

She is definitely in the same league as Angela Bassett, folks.The actors in this film were outstanding as well.

		<shortDescription>Incredible emotional ride without cheap drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some spoilers.If this were the usual Hollywood production, then this film would revolve around one central point: if, when and how Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry) finds out that Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) was the man who strapped her husband to the electric chair. Instead, this movie handles this question in a surprisingly mature way, avoiding cheap drama in favour of sticking to the characters and their needs. I was very impressed by the final development of the movie in that aspect. I have heard some people complain about the 180 degree change of Hank Grotowski in the short amount of time elapsed in the film; those people were clearly not paying attention. The journey, so to speak, from racist to human being is considerably shorter than what some might believe. This is made obvious from the beginning, when Hank uses the rifle to scare the black kids away, and afterwards in the confrontation with their father: He acts as an automaton, remote-controlled by his father, repeating over and over the same line because he does not only have no real arguments, he doesn't have the necessary deep-seated hatred, either. The scene in the prison bathroom on the other hand is just redirected anger at what he perceives as the weakest link in that environment. On a similar note, and considering the stellar performance of Halle Berry, it is insulting to imply that Leticia gets over the death of both her husband and her son in too short a time. Halle's portrayal of Leticia makes the underlying fragility and open wounds palpable at all times.One of the strongest scenes goes to Heath Ledger, though. All by himself, in the prison's bathroom, his face shows the whole plethora of emotions that runs through Sonny in this instant. A great acting achievement.Last but not least, there's the argument about the film's authenticity. And, frankly, I don?t care whether this movie reflects reality in the southern US of A. What makes a story true is not its connection to The World As We Know It, but its capacity to create a reality that holds up under scrutiny in its own universe, with characters who belong to and interact in a coherent and engaging way with that environment. Monster's Ball is all that; its emotional impact would have been no less had it been set on Mars, in the year 1600. So get over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was confused about why the film was set vaguely "In the South" if it was commenting on racism in the US in general. why not set the movie in a particular place and then show thru the narrative how that place is representative of "the South" or "America"? I first thought it was set near the Angola correctional facility in Louisiana because of the officer's uniforms (bearing the LA state flag) and references to "Jackson," a nearby town. Then i saw Leticia in the Bud's Broiler in Midtown New Orleans that I used to patronize every other week. And then everyone's car had Georgia plates and everyone georgia driver's licenses. Was this ambiguity supposed to elevate the film to some sort of allegory? Because the generalized setting and the generalized characters are what made this film unbelievable.

		<fullReview>I would like to see in this film two worthy things: a) How a husk of a man found his humanity, b) How the racial divide was bridged in the way which it inevitably must. Both these elements were represented, and the cast skilled. I am sorry MONSTERS' BALL was a hodge-podge.There was the inevitable rock-em sock-em sex scene for Generations X and Y. To make a movie "realistic" (transl: box office) ya gotta have it. The hyper-obese son was a vehicle to get the two principals together, but why the very big deal about his eating, the social commentary about how a fat black man has a problem in America? So does a white one. Rather too politically correct. The capital punishment angle: was this movie trying to capitalise on THE GREEN MILE? We spend a lot of time on the incarcerated man to find his only long term contribution is a couple of conveniently found portraits which do not -- as reasonably expected -- change the outcome of the story in spite of the agonised tears. Oh yes, the fancying chocolate ice cream. Yessir, I get it.Finally, the title. The term was explained as part of Death Row ritual, but had only the most fleeting relationship to the story. I think the movie was given that title as a come-on; the story ultimately had little to do with the "culture" of capital punishment even if, on the off chance, the patron was familiar with it. See above comment re box office. For Thornton, this was an unworthy follow-up to THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE Billy Bob Thornton, but have never been crazy about Halle Berry. However I was still interested in seeing this film. Plot seems intriguing and I was curious to see if Halle deserved her Oscar. I can honestly say that I was SUPER impressed with Halle's performance and she did not overact and over dramatize like I thought she would. BBT was wonderful, as usual, and he made his character so believable. You hate him at first but then you actually start to sympathize with what he has been through. I loved the character development throughout the whole film. The film is somewhat depressing as one tragedy after another happens on both sides but I thought the unlikely love story between Halle and Billy's characters unfolded quite nicely. The only people who I can see that would not like this film are the people who are heavily into action/special effects flicks with alot of blood and guts. If you want an unusual love-story with some terrific acting, this is the movie for you. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dont even bother to waste your time or money on this trash.Curious, only AFTER they award Halle with the Oscar do all these people come out here in praise of the film trying to sound intelligent and artsy, talking the usual existentialist BS of 'deeper meanings' and 'social commentary'. I will admit, however that Halle performs two things very well in this movie; Screaming and F'ing. Billy Bob plays his usual annoying redneck hick self. His whole 'aw-shucks' style is so tired and withered up. This is not even to delve into the completely implausible storyline or casting. You'll never see three completely different looking members of the same family, or a father and son who look almost the same age. Then the avowed racist does a full about face in such a short span? even eventually going downtown on miss Laticia? This from the same guy who didnt break a sweat when his son blew his brains out on the Lazy-Boy? And those awkward squirmy "love" scenes between Laticia and Hank can make you lose your lunch - not unlike many of the characters in this movie whose first reaction is to toss their cookies the instant they're overwhelmed by their own emotions. I've seen better chemistry between two rabbits mating. Also, the characters ability to put major crises behind them in 5 minutes, even when they happen in quick succession is quite amazing - this only serves to sink the already low "believableness" of the movie even further down the depths. Save your money and stay away! :) Have a nice day...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Before I went to see it I checked out some comments. The subject of racism attracted me to see this movie. The actors and the director brought this story very well I think. First of all it isn't an easy subject to make a different kind of movie. Normally if you see a movie that deals with racism, there are always more easy things to put in your movie. But with this movie you get the problem of racism in Southern USA, a nice but not common love story. The first half an hour I had to adjust to the way the movie was brought. The actors are perfectly chosen for these characters. Halle Berry really convinced me. It's a bit strange. I saw her on tv with the Oscars and I thought, why is she melodramatic? I knew it was the first black woman who won an Oscar, but still... It was one of the first movies I saw with Halle Berry and she really deserves that Oscar. Billy Bob Thornton also made an excellent performance. He should of got best male support act. The movie is a must for all people who like these actors or are intrested in the subject of love or racism. Fans will also recognize P. Diddy and Mos Def in the movie. They were also convincing in their role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tragedy of America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From my experience of living in the States for a good part of my life I feel that I can comment on Monster's Ball from a point of view that is hard to grasp for the people that reside there and are so close to the reality of what America has become [ it's always been as it is depicted in the film-just not seen that often].The inescapable patina through which I viewed what was a very difficult film was one of horror that reality could be so terribly uncompromising. I have lived in a country that has made many different decisions about the way things should be and I was terribly shocked to see such a macabre reality-the underbelly of the world's leader. This reality was so bleak because it was set against the reality that I have lived with and to which I have become accustomed; it was, however, a reality that existed in fact in the small town world of my childhood.Trust me on this- the movie was terribly accurate and to those who have derided the screen play I can only say to them that what you saw was what is. I wish that I could say the script was exaggerated and inaccurate but as I sat through the film all that I saw was the reality of the horror of contemporary America with all of its many petty fetishes.See Monster's Ball an weep for the people caught in American societies dregs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be fooled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a fraud and easily recognizable by anyone who prefers not to be manipulated by soapy contrivances. Things happen, people exist, that are so preposterous that it's impossible to suspend disbelief and be engaged in any way. Let's look at the Musgroves: the only way a family could possibly more dissimilar is if one or another member was from another planet. It's always completely obvious that it's actors we're seeing. I'm having trouble imagining a black single mother in rural Georgia, who's husband has been on death row for 11 years, can be as impeccably turned out and well kept as Halle Berry. I can certainly see one being as histrionic, but to me her performance was more of the same as we saw Oscar night, desperate, flailing, overwrought, like a Joan Crawford caricature at her most mawkish. Sean Combs, chosen for this role clearly because of his familiarity with the inside of a penitentiary (what else could it be?), recites his lines as if he's up in front of class. He and Halle, both beautiful hardbodies, beget a son who looks like Jabba the Hutt. Then, the lifelong violent racist Thornton becomes a caring loving person the moment his son, whom he hates and has always hated, kills himself. I don't get it. I can't get involved in it.This is one of those movies that's made in utter contempt for what happened five minutes ago. In a way it's like Memento, except that here the film plays as if it's we who have no memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What "A Beautiful Mind" wanted to be and wasn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes two similar movies come out at the same time, and the contrast throws the strengths and weaknesses of each film into relief. "A Beautiful Mind" and "Monster's Ball" are such a pair, and the comparison leads me to believe that "Monster's Ball" will be remembered while "A Beautiful Mind" is forgotten.The plot, for those who don't know, concerns a racist Southern prison guard who starts a releationship with the black wife of a man he oversees the execution of. But the plot is secondary to the character study, and the close observation of how and why these characters do things. This is the first major difference with "A Beautiful Mind," which instead is concerned with the mechanics of its plot--what happened next.Howard Hawks once said that a good movie has one great scene in it and no bad ones, and that a great movie has two great scenes in it and no bad ones. Well, "A Beautiful Mind," has no bad ones--but it has no great scenes in it, either.The aspect of "Beautiful Mind" that cripples it is that it's too decorous, too unwilling to confront the truly unpleasant details of John Nash's life. By avoiding these truths, Ron Howard and Akiva Goldman also avoided making the more deeply moving film that they wanted to. "Monster's Ball," on the other hand, embraces the messiness of life, and shows how moving a drama can be.Both films are meant as tales, eventually, of redemption. But "A Beautiful Mind" is too easy about it, and I never lost the sense of watching Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly in a movie. With "Monster's Ball," you quickly stop thinking about Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry, and start thinking about the characters.Because you are drawn into the story, as opposed to skimming its surface, "Monster's Ball" is far more moving, and, I believe, memorable, though that is something only time will tell.But going back to the Howard Hawks definition, there are two truly great, memorable scenes in "Monster's Ball." I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enormously sensitive film about human beings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERSAmong the many virtues of Monster's Ball is its amazingly well structured narrative. It begins with a slew of tragedies, and the first half climaxes with a stunning sex scene that people are going to be talking about, whether in shock or criticism, for years. After that, the drama is very level. Nothing all that dramatically weighty happens, at least compared to the first half. But all the little things that do happen are moments of beauty and humanity. The film even avoids a melodramatic denouement that I thought was sure to come. The setup is there, but the screenplay allows the film to end in a way more perfect than was imaginable moments beforehand. The screenplay represents something extremely original, and, although people have certainly responded to the writing (it was nominated for an Oscar), I think people might overlook how well written it is.Of course, people are going to go see this because of Halle Berry's Oscar. She deserved it. I think her acceptance speech was curious, almost racist itself, as if The Man were secretly pulling strings to keep her down. I think it's unfortunate that she implied what she implied in that speech, because the film is about acceptance and togetherness. This is her first good role, at least that I've seen. I've definitely seen her in several bad roles, and you could always tell she was acting far below her ability. This is the kind of role every actress wants, and I'm glad that she did come into her own. Now let's just hope she doesn't go back to doing bad films! Hint: Halle, whatever you do, turn down B.A.P.S. 2! What's painful about the Oscar success is that Berry's co-star in the film, Billy-Bob Thornton, was not honored with a nomination. That's an insult. His performance is at least is strong. Thornton's acting ability is no secret - he's been nominated before, one for Best Actor and one for Best Supporting (for A Simple Plan, for which he really deserved the award). But why would they turn him down? He does a lot of garbage, too, but he's generally had a good career, both as actor and director. The supporting cast is also excellent here. Though their roles are small, Sean Combs (yes, Puff Daddy) and Heath Ledger (you know, the guy whom David Manning called "this year's hottest new actor" or something like that) give award-worthy performances. Also, Peter Boyle, best known as the monster from Young Frankenstein or as Grandpa Munster, or maybe even as Raymond's dad in Everybody Loves Raymond, is excellent as the bitter and dying patriarch.That sex scene is going to be argued over forever, I think. I've heard some refer to it as pornography, and some as a very dramatically effective scene. I say that it is impossible to deny that that scene is not awkward. However, I think that its awkwardness is part of the point. The film really doesn't idealize any of its characters or situations. What one should notice about that sex scene is how it changes midstream from screwing to lovemaking. The second sex scene is very adult. I think it embarrasses some men because it depicts oral sex on a female. Usually when that sex act is performed on screen it is treated as a joke. I just think that men, who really do control the entire industry, find that act less erotic because they don't want to see themselves as a submissive sexual partner on film.Monster's Ball is not a perfect film, but any little flaws along the way don't harm much. It's certainly a film that must be seen, and I hope others love it as much as I did. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Choppy but Real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many reviews on this site and have seen a lot of people complaining that the movie was too "choppy" and that they weren't able to get into the characters because of lack of dialogue and whatnot. The characters weren't "believable" because we did not know their motivation. That is a valid complaint, I suppose, but only because you people are used to normal Hollywood scripts with unrealistic dialogue.Did you ever think that in real life you don't always know exactly what a person is thinking, because they don't always tell you in 2 page monologues? The writer of this movie obviously understood this fact and wanted to make this movie as real as possible, and that is why I enjoyed it so much. Yes, the main characters' luck is incredibly and coincidentally bad, and the circumstances are quite contrived, but do you honestly believe that there are NO people in this world as unfortunate as Billy Bob and Halle are in this movie? I assure you they exist.If you think that I am just full of sh*t, all you have to do to see proof of my claim that this movie is the ultimate in reality is look at the sex scene: it is about as real as it gets with no glamour whatsoever. I can honestly say I was not aroused by Halle Berry's naked body at all during this scene, and it boggles my mind because she is incredibly gorgeous. In fact, I think this scene was as awkward and unsexy as some of the sex I've had in real life! I can't say that about any other movie sex scenes off-hand, because they are always "spiced up" with unrealistic groans and gropes and looks of ecstasy and whatnot. Rarely do you see anything so real, and that goes for the whole movie.</fullReview>

This film is an interesting character study of how people react and deal with the worst of the worst situations that happen in their lives. Of course it is very dreary and depressing, but what do you expect-this is a film about pain. There were also some very good, creative, effective camera shots and editing throughout the film. The acting is stand-out, not a bad performance throughout the movie. Everyone gives their all and puts their heart into their performances. Halle Berry got her well-deserved Oscar, and Billy Bob and Peter Boyle were surely deserving of a nod as well. I give this film a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halle Berry should never ever! play a prostitute, crack whore or a "plain" "black" chick from the South as she attempted here. There is nothing plain about her. She has a sophisticated, fine featured, polished look to her that can never be mistaken for "raw". I think "Boomerang" suited her just fine. Why wasn't Angela Basset cast here? Whoopi? I guess because Frank Grotowski wouldn't be as turned on then. Why did they pick a very light skin black actress? If we're talking racial relations, let's pick a fine African lady with full lips and big booty. Can you smell the stereotypes here? A "pretty" black girl is okay. She is a good girl. Her husband was a bad bad boy and a criminal to the highest degree. Did I mention he was black? I'm sure you can come up with a list of at least 20 stereotypical facts on your own and that's without thinking too hard. I still would like to know why Whoopi wasn't playing this role? I bet she turned it down. Oh, Berry's performance is just okay, very overplayed, overexagerated and overhyped by the media. 2 out of 10 for Billy Bob.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two things must be said right away. Do not see this movie if you are feeling "emotional" and do not see this movie without tissues. That said, this is a wonderful movie, filled with the flaws of human nature. And much like our human flaws this movie's flaws are in the vagueness and unpredictable nature of the characters. In essence a very good slice of a life I hope none of us ever have to experience. It begins with the odd and very strained relationship between father and son, Peter Boyle and Billy Bob Thornton. Then moves to the heartbreaking relationship between another father and son, Billy Bob and Heath Ledger. We follow one painful relationship after another, and when we meet Halle Berry, the pain begins all over again. Her husband is about to be executed (played very calmly and not too badly by Puff Daddy) and her overweight son compensates for his lack of a father and a mother constantly on the edge of poverty by binge eating on candy he keeps hidden in his room. Okay with out giving away actual plot points that sums up the basic characters of the story. As for performance, all four main characters were riveting. Peter Boyle is so very good at being nasty, Heath Ledger is painful in this very unglamorous role, but very very good. Billy Bob is amazing in his confusion over his son, and his love for a black woman when he has spent his life under his father's shadow, as a racist. And miss Halle Berry... wow, she made me cry at least three times, she was wonderful. She does not deserve the Oscar because she is the first black woman to be nominated for best actress, she deserves it because she earned it. Denzil Washington said it best, (paraphrasing) "well I hope we three (Will Smith, Halle Berry, and Washington) are nominated because we deserve it, not 'cause we're black" and as far as I can see, the media can press the black issue all they want, but all three deserved the nominations they received for their performances. so in a new rating system I will give it four out of a possible five stars, and this simple warning, yep the sex is explicit so if you are uncomfortable with that, wait for video and then "run to the bathroom" during that scene. It is very obvious when it is about to happen. But don't expect glamour, this scene is not about how beautiful Halle Berry is, this is not sex with hollywood style, it is about the pain and devastating loss of love and what we do to get a small amount of relief from a very painful reality. Very well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The simple beauty of "Monster's Ball" is that it gets everything right. It's hard to believe how little screen time is actually occupied by the magnificent supporting performances as each one balances tremendous emotional weight and nuanced touch. Add Billy Bob Thornton's ex-corrections officer, ex-father/husband/son, and ex-bigot who finds worldview-altering depth in every gesture. And Halle Berry delivers the most unforgettably powerful performance of all, triumphing over her devastating life circumstances and embodying the thematic core of the film: truth. It isn't exactly about racism, the breadth of which is often ignored or over-simplified in film. "Monster's Ball" simplifies its truths in a refreshing way by allowing its characters to deal with their humanity and emotions, reach out to each other, and find room to grow beyond the scope of a two hour drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story about two opposites drawn together by need</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to disagree with Roger Ebert that this is the best film of 2001, however I will agree that it was a love story unlike any other told. The film opens with deliberations of the execution of a cop-killer (played by Sean Combs) who finds worth in the last days of his life drawing death row guards (which become a key point at the end, but I won't say how.) After his widow (Halle Berry) also loses her son by an accident, she befriends the man who tried to help both of them before the kid died, a man who was actually the guard present at her husband's execution. The hardship of the guard (Billy Bob Thornton) is caused by the suicide of his son and the rotting morale attributable to the unhealthy relationship with his ailing father (Peter Boyle). Sounds implausible until you find out that this is all set in a small, rural town. A sad film, which advances mainly by the development of the characters and excellent performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fine character-driven drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year full of fine character driven dramas, Monster's Ball is among the best. Hallie Berry gives everything she has to a gut-wrenching drama of pain, guilt and loss Billy-Bob Thornton gives an intelligent performance as a man trying to escape the racism and stoicism of his family. Particularly touching and intelligent is the final scene, where you expect a huge argument to develop but it doesn't because the characters have come to realize that they need each other to survive and must forgive.People are comparing this to "In the Bedroom" because they both involve a family's grief over the loss of a child and take place in small towns, (these would have been very different stories, I think, in a city). I'll take "In the Bedroom" by a nose. Somehow it resonated with me a little more. Hallie and Billy Bob are survivors in a storm of human misery. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are a happy couple who flounder and reach depths they never thought they'd sink to. Somehow, even thought that was more downbeat, it stayed with me longer. I'm hope Hallie Berry and Jennifer Connelly win the best actress and supporting actress oscars. Both are glamour girls who refused to be typed as glamour girls. They knew they had more. Each has already been showing the depth of their talent for some time, Barry as far back as "Losing Isaiah", (1995) and Connelly in last year's "Requiem for a Dream".On a humorous note, the theater I saw this film at had a title on the marquee said it was called "Monster Balls". I hope the help at the theater you see it at can pay a little better attention to their work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe this film was voted 8 out of 10! To begin with the movie is very s l o w . This movie heaped one depressing cliched event on the other with no redeeming motive.spoiler (like anything could make it worse)First a poor black guy gets executed (this is long and drawn out, yawn yawn). His poor, poor, poor black (young beautiful) wife is distraught. She has a poor miserable waitress job and is mean to her poor, fat son. Billy Bob Thornton is the executing warden who is made mean by his miserable, nasty, prejudiced father. In fact, practically everyone is mean and either gets killed or commits suicide, or some other depressing thing until Billy Bob ends up in bed with the beautiful, young black widow, when he suddenly finds redemption through hot hot sex. Oh joy.Anyway, I guess we are supposed to be really happy that ol Billy Bod is no longer prejudiced, etc. The whole thing is one giant downer.On top of everything, the movie expects us to believe that the poor, poor beautiful black waitress widow is just so lucky that Billy Bob takes her in. Meanwhile the whole issue of a very young (20?) girl ending up living with a not very good looking man who is about 30 years older than she is, with no benefit of any type of commitment, is completely ignored. Try reversing the sexes and you'll wretch.I'm starting to get a little tired of looking at Billy Bob. I guess he things if Angela thinks he's hot, the world should see how desirable he is to the young chickies.If you really want to be depressed, go to the pound and watch the poor animals that are going to be euthenized. At least it will be free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A finely understated movie about the way human pain can be expressed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected the movie to be about racism, but it wasn't. It's about the expression of pain into anger and the projection of anger onto identifiable objects; such as race and expression of sensitivity. Billy Bob is an up-tight correctional officer overseeing an execution, as is his son (Heath Ledger). The son, however is showing signs of weakness, such as being friendly with the Black neighbors children, and - worst of all - by letting his feelings towards his job show. Both are portrayed as emotionally stunted in two harsh, like father like son, prostitute scenes. Both are chips off the old block of Jim Crowing, misogynistic grandpa Peter Boyle, and both wish silently they weren't.Into this family comes Hale Berry as the widow of the man they execute. Billy Bob reluctantly helps her out with her grief while struggling with his own, and the two become lovers. The movie now asks us to believe that the relationship allows Billy Bob to shrug off his imbedded hatreds, which we accept mostly due to the movies subtlety of letting things just be.Berry has received an Oscar nomination. Although I liked her performance, and was not surprised by it, I can't help but think she's getting an all too common Hollywood "wow we did not know this person can act!" award, such as the one doled out to Cher for "Moonstruck". To be frank Berry's presence in this movie does her career much more good than it helps the movie. Hollywood just can't allow us to see average people being played by the average looking. There is absolutely no surprise in Billy Bob having the hots for her (hell Hitler would have the hots for her!) and so his transformation doesn't affect the Richter scale. We know in real life she'll end up as another woman who Billy Bob won't be able to love for the duration.I did like the pace of the movie and it's willingness to let the scenes speak for themselves. The death row scene is inevitable but not over dramatized as it was in "The Green Mile", although it too shows how inhumane the whole ritualized process is, simply in it's rituality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A running theme of death in this film is obvious to anyone who has seen it. It is not the type of meaningless death that runs rampant in many of the Hollywood films that are released. Monster's Ball presents the product of death and how it causes us to either grow or recede. Billy Bob Thornton plays a racist correctional facilities employee who lives with his troublesome son (Heath Ledger) and invalid father (Peter Boyle). Halle Berry plays the wife of a death row inmate (Sean Combs). A series of events ensues as a direct result of her husband's execution that brings Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton together. They seem to share the pain of loss in their lives, and it allows them to bond on a different level. It puts aside race and social class allowing two human beings to come together. The film also lends the message that as long as we have eachother to help us when times are at their worst, life will be alright. I give the film 4 and half stars, out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Halle Berry should get the oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really hate it when I agree with Roger Ebert, but this is the best film of the year. It's such a powerful portrait of these two people that it's stuck with me for days after seeing it. At first, I didn't want to write anything here for it because I couldn't find the words to express my admiration for this fine film. But then I started thinking about the oscars, and how Sissy Spacek is going to win for 'In the Bedroom.' I have to say something about that.In the Bedroom is also a very good film. And Sissy Spacek turns in a wonderful performance. But it's a supporting role...nothing more. That film is about the relationship between a man and his wife told mainly from his perspective. And Tom Wilkinson should win the oscar for his part. But Sissy Spacek should not have even been nominated for lead actress. Halle Berry's role is not only a leading one, she nailed it perfectly.I can't really get into what kinds of things she does in the movie without giving away too much of the plot, but she runs through an enormous variety of emotions in this film to create a very believable character who we end up sympathizing for. In the beginning of the film, we get to know both Hank and Leticia. And we find out that they aren't very good people. But through them finding eachother and what they do for eachother, we end up hoping for the best for the two of them.And as for the sex scene that everyone is talking about; I admit that, normally, when a director says that the nudity is important to the film and the characters, I'm very skeptical. But, in this case, it was completely necessary to show how both of them were simply trying to drown out all their other emotions.Unfortunately, Sissy Spacek is almost as much of a lock for the oscar this year as Julia was last year. It's really sad that the oscar for best actress is going to go to the completely wrong person two years in a row. (It went to Julia Roberts last year over Ellen Burstyn who gave the best performance by an actor or actress in the past ten years) It's clear that the people who vote for these awards haven't even seen all the films nominated when such large mistakes are made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something I noticed right away during this movie that nobody else has commented on. (No, this is not a spoiler, just an observation.) The director consistently obscured the faces of the female characters, while leaving the male characters clear to our view. In a movie full of irritating director's tricks, this was the most irritating to me, as a female and a feminist. The women were always introduced body first, sometimes fully naked body first, then eventually, maybe, they'd be granted a face, and, if they were really special, even a name. The male characters never suffered from this blurring, this lack of having their own identity.Even without a face, the most interesting character in this movie was the prostitute, and that's pretty sad. But she was the most grounded, least uptight person, and she had the best sense of humor.This movie had the same effect on me that watching daytime talk shows often has: My life may be screwed up, but at least I'm better off than THEY are!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why do I see movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admired almost every moment of this film. Foster has such respect for the story and the characters, so he takes his time in letting the story unfold. And in keeping with the tone, this movie is very quiet-when the characters aren't talking, we get to watch them act without a blaring soundtrack.This film also affected me on a different level. It showed alot of sadness and pain, much more extreme than most of us have felt. But it then went on to show how it's the love and compassion of other people that helps us get through it all, and ultimately survive. The last 60 seconds of this film are beautifully realized, and I sat through the credits in a state of sorrow and joy.I want a movie to appeal to my humanness and be crafted smartly and emotionally real. MB did both. That's why I see movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Modern Day Racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball was a standout film in a year that has too few of those films, and that alone would make it Oscar worthy. With a story that at parts appears to rival a Greek tragedy and performances that dive deep into the character's thoughts and emotion, it is not to be passed over for viewing. I remained thinking it was a tragedy up until writing this review. Looking back on it, I realize it was more of a salvation for them. It is a distinct tale of modern day racism that could only be comparable to American History X, yet it is presented differently. In agreement it has torn a family apart, but the story goes in a different direction. Billy Bob Thorton's performance is a very believable look at how a man's life is changed by an event with no apparent impact at first. It takes you by surprise and it appears to affect the transformation you find is occuring throughout. The character development is fascinating in a man so set in his ways that he places the same order at the same diner at the same time of day to the same waitress everyday. But one day change finally becomes inevitable and is forced into his life as that waitress is sick and the first step in altering his life is taken. Halle Berry's performance manages to tackle the whole spectrum of emotions and is believable as her character is vulnerable and strongly contrasts Thorton's own hardened emotions. This review might seem ambiguous, but I am attempting not to spoil anything which might take away from this powerful movie. I hope with my summary I am not giving the impression that racism is a rarity in modern times because that is not true. The rarity is having it shown in such a compelling and moving way in which Monster's Ball succeeds in doing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Monster's Ball' is a very good movie that tells the story of two people that need each other. Billy Bob Thornton plays Hank, a corrections officer that has a rebirth during the movie. He lives with his sickly father, Buck (Peter Boyle), who is a retired corrections officer, and his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), who is a new corrections officer that works for Hank. Hank comes to realize that he has been living the life his father, Buck, has wanted for him. It takes a tragedy to open his eyes, however, with the help of Leticia (Halle Berry) he comes alive as a compassionate man. Hank is the hero of the movie. Thornton is excellent in this role.Berry plays the wife of a man (Sean ?Puffy' Combs) that is executed. Her life is devastated through a series of unfortunate events. When she is at her weakest moment, Hank comes to her rescue. Hank becomes her savior. Berry gives all that she has in this dramatic role and delivers with an excellent performance befitting of her Oscar nomination. There are many dramatic scenes that Leticia must endure. The product is very good acting. My only problem with her performance was that she has perfect teeth. Her character would not have had that ?Hollywood' smile, which is slight overlook by Marc Forster, the director.Ledger is also very good in his role. However, his character was not in the movie very much. I would have liked to see more about him.Bottom line is that `Monster's Ball' is a good movie that is hard to watch at times but is also funny at times. Berry's performance really is the surprise of the movie. I loved the final scene in this movie. It is a great accomplishment for Forster, directing his first major movie.8 out of 10</fullReview>

That's style. As for content: content is darkness growing slightly less dark. Human reality. Good luck. Bad luck. Which possibility will play out? Humor balances pain in the great theatrical tradition. The players are all fully committed, give us subtleties and wholly stated passions. The theme of reflection is not simple--it sticks with me and offers a mystery about existence. I'm going back to the theatre first opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The monsters in this film are real. Rascism, hatred, poverty, execution. But at the heart of all that is ugly and destructive lies some decency. This film by Marc Forster, doesn't pull any punches, but somehow he allows us glimpses of the kindness that draws us together.  Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) is a man of strength and that strength comes from his rascist upbringing his belief in the rules at all costs. He is a corrections officer like his sick (in more ways than one) father (Peter Boyle). His son, (Heath Ledger)is carrying on the family tradition but his heart isn't in it. He is compassionate and caring, and his father's lessons in manhood are too much for him. The weight of the misery in this film is palpable.  Leticia (Halle Berry) is an executioner's widow and by the time she meets Hank she is just about out of rope. When her son is hit by a car, Hank comes to her aid and theirs is a relationship born out of despair and hopelessness. Their desires are in check until one night when they find themselves alone and a bit drunk. Their animal instincts take over in a scene that is rather unpleasant to watch but displays their desperation all too clearly.  Billy Bob Thornton is superb here. His treatment of his own son levels so much disdain for him that his redemption seems impossibly difficult. But Thornton pulls it off, and by the end of the film, we are able to see the man he should have been, if his diseased father hadn't poisoned him. Halle Berry is without makeup and pretense here and she is stunning. She is completely unaware of her beauty, although it is hard to disguise. Her poignant portrayal of a woman who loses everything, and ironically finds something else because of the losses, is wonderfully done.  If I had one complaint it would be that there was perhaps one too many sad coincidences in the film. It was a bit hard to swallow, but that aside, the acting was first rate, and the subtleties of the performances and the writing make this a riveting and lasting film. One more thing - Peter Boyle is so chillingly despicable that I feel that I should apologize to him for wanting him to die. The line between actor and character are blurred and it was hard to appreciate a terrific performance through the disgust. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Postmodern Parable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MONSTER'S BALL is a beautifully painful movie. On one level it seems to be a story of emergences from a confluence of tragedies that end in lives worth living. Taken this way, it's a well done but simplistic film that challenged me to stay in my seat and wait for resolution instead of following my impulse to flee into the more inviting damp chill of a February Saturday in Rochester. The effort paid off, but I still felt the return was more slight than the investment.Later that evening, the "truth" of the movie dawned on me and MONSTER'S BALL took on far greater artistic proportions. It is, in fact, a kind of parable(the OED suggests allegory as a synonym, but I don't think that would apply)transformed. It merges classic pieces of parable-stories with inversions and modern adaptations to create a real story of redemption and, maybe, apotheosis. Without recognizing the parable, it's a tale with unrealistic resolutions. Seeing the point of the narrative, however, allows mythic truths that "teach" through universals. Billy Bob becomes the man who is there and is totally believable. Hallie Berry's beauty is certainly not profane. And Peter Boyle would impress Dante as the prototypical occupant of the last circle of Hell.</fullReview>

I thought the two main characters had a lot of chemistry together, and were actually a very believable pair. I liked the dialog (or lack thereof) in most of the movie. I liked it that no one gave big Hollywood speeches about what they had learned and how they felt - we were left to figure out how they probably felt. I am now completely convinced that Billy Bob Thornton, as psycho and neurotic and obsessive as he may be in real life, is one hell of an actor.I will see this again, definitely.</fullReview>

Two emotionally drained and distraught people come together out of necessity by seemingly coincidental circumstances, that for the most part do not seem too unbelievable or hard to swallow. Instead the plot engulfs the audience from start to finish as you watch wondering how this pair of completely opposite souls seem to be entwined together by some unseeing yet powerful force.

They just happen to end up in the same places at the same times.For those who say that this was a "reach" for Berry must not have seen "Loosing Isaiah" or "Dorothy Dandridge."Lastly, I don't see how a drunken stupor equals a "Powerful and Passionate Love Scene."See for yourself (if you must), but wait for T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a depressing film - can come through feeling hopeful. Appreciate the heart and sensibility this film offers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swiss-born director Marc Foster sure takes on challenging subjects. His first film "Everything Put Together" 2000, I was lucky enough to catch during its one week run. It's about a new mother facing unexpected SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) and the circumstance she and her husband face - managing loss and grief, dealing with friends and neighbors who once were. Radha Mitchell ("High Art" with Ally Sheedy) delivered a sustained sensitive performance. It's a poignantly directed small film (87 mins) worthy of wider recognition. Monster's Ball, Foster's second film, equally deals with subjects hard to swallow. But it's by no means a depressing film as one might led to believe. In a string of recent films with the theme about loss of a child and grief, "Monster's Ball" is by far the most emotionally complex and hopeful. It's a thought-provoking film, much to the credit of director Foster's integrity in telling the story. In both of his films, he is genuine and simple in depicting human emotions. Halle Berry's Leticia lost her husband long before the day of his death by electric chair arrived - Sean 'Puffy' Combs delivered a quiet worthy performance. Director Foster shows us the humanity in his character: the tenderness shown towards the son, the things he say - no profanity or anger. He is resigned. There's sensitive attention to detail. For instance, the reflective overlapping telling imagery of the viewing audience and Combs in the chair is just one of the film's powerful moments. The scenes of Combs with Heath Ledger, the guard on death watch, gave a hint of mutual respect. In his brief portrayal as Sonny, Hank's son, Ledger showed us his serious acting side beyond being the eldest to Mel Gibson in "The Patriot" 2000, and his comedic tempo in "A Knight's Tale" 2001. (Clint Eastwood's "True Crime" 1999, also showed humanity in a man on death row interacting with family and wardens - a quiet sensitive delivery from Isaiah Washington). While Todd Field's "In the Bedroom" may raise controversial viewpoints, here in "Monster's Ball," the film unabashedly delivers truth without challenge. There's no shades of grey in grief. Yet somehow joy blossoms. For Billy Bob Thornton's Hank, meeting Leticia helped him to appreciate himself, which he has not done in a long while - being domineered by his father (veteran actor Peter Boyle), oxygen tank or not. The good thing coming out of the sudden loss of a loved one could be the shock that shapes you up and somehow gives you the ability to rise from the crumblings. Hank and Leticia both are experiencing loss. They needed each other at the time as fate struck. To be able to affect and help one another is a lift in itself.For Leticia, who has been numbed for so long, meeting Hank is gradually helping her to regain vigor in life. Berry's face towards the end, so much is embraced on that seemingly blank expression - shocked, surprised, puzzled, don't know what and how to take the discovery she arrived at. Yes, let's just sit down quietly and appreciate the present with the dear person next to you. Marc Foster is truly in the Best Director category in my book. Young as he is, it's a tall order as we await for his third outing to come. Keeping up his integrity in film delivery, he can do no wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers:Monster's Ball asks us to believe that Billy Bob Thornton's character, a life-long vitriolic bigot and hater of his own kindly child, undergoes a complete reversal of personality and alteration of his belief system following a pair of tragedies. This romantic notion is appealing as a general proposition, but unfortunately never takes flight in this film, where the reversal remains unsupported by any character or plot development that would render it believable. Directors take note: it is not reasonable to require audiences to infer not only what is going on in a character's mind, but all the rationales and justifications for it. Somewhere, we need to see an overt expression from the character himself as to WHY he is changing. Here, the "why" is simply missing, making Thornton's character's motivation impenetrable and thoroughly unconvincing.</fullReview>

That's funny, 'cause I clearly remember him reviewing GhostWorld, Memento, Moulin Rouge, Fellowship of the Ring, BlackHawkDown, Monsters Inc., and many other vastly superior films...M.B. = ok story = ok cinematography = two or three good performances = some of the stupidest dialogue I've ever heard (red drapes, anyone!) = a strong 6 or a very weak 7 out of 10. Let's be serious here people, this so-called important film will not be remembered, and for good reason. Not since the supposedly "witty" or "charming" or "spectacular" GosfordPark has a half-ass arthouse film been so highly overrated by the big name critics...**Strongest redeeming feature and the reason I'm giving this otherwise SIX a weak SEVEN = the wonderful performance from Mos Def of Blackstar-fame. Mos is indeed "mos def" in this otherwise disappointing film and will undoubtedly rock the mic...er...celluloid in future films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Don't read if you haven't seen this film!I really liked this film. It seemed like a throwback to that style of movie making I like so much from the 60s and 70s where the audience is allowed to think for themselves and not everything is clearly explained. It was another one of those "sins of the father" stories, but I think done with an unusual sensibility that was very effective. Halle Berry indeed gave the best performance I've seen all year as Leticia. Emotionally, physically and vocally, she was completely convincing and likable in spite of her faults. I'd love to see her get the Academy Award. The love making scene between Leticia and Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) goes on too long, however, but the thing I didn't like the most about it were those quick shots of the hand grabbing for the bird in the cage. None of the rest of the film had that sort of thing in it and it seemed out of place. It didn't connect with anything else and as for symbolism, it was too obvious. But that was one weak moment out of many great ones. People have criticised the transformation of Hank, saying it was unbelievable how he changed from a hardened racist to a gentle soul who wanted to take care of a black woman. I think this is the point of the film. Was he a racist? There were a number of suggestions that he was just trying to get his own racist father to love him and his actions were motivated by that. His blasting off his shot gun to scare off the two black friends of his own son was all for show. The film made a point of showing the father staring out the window and approving. That scene certainly showed the rebellious nature of Hank's son, Sonny, by choosing to have black friends in spite of what his grandfather probably thought. Also, Billy Bob's character cared more about having the condemned black man end his life with dignity than expressing any love he had for his own son, who ended up committing suicide. That suicide of course was the turning point in the story, and the script made a point of suicide being a common element in that family, even suggesting more at the end of the film with Halle Berry staring at the three grave stones. Who was in the third grave? Clearly it was Billy Bob's wife who more than likely committed suicide as well, but who was not even mentioned as far as I can remember. The nature of how racism permeates families and society was handled believably well, I thought, and the theme of the film was in one regard a template to suggest how to break the cycle of hatred. The sins of the father was the sin to break. This was reinforced a number of times, including the scene in the prison where Puffy Combs says to his fat son, "You're not me."</fullReview>

The scenes are very simple and the dialogues are limited where a look is worth a thousand words. But what brings them together can also tear them apart.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Acting, Directing and Story...but lacks in filling...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I heard about this movie, I wanted to see it. I knew that both Thorton and Berry were supposed to be excellent as their portrayal of a lost retired executioner and a grief-stricken black woman finding each other in rural Georgia. Their acting was great as expected and Berry as a good chance of being nominated for an Academy Award. The direction was also excellent. The story itself was put together perfectly and pulled the right number of heart strings to give the movie a sense of despair, but not too many to make the movie feel false. However, there are many loose ends that are not tied up at the end of the film and leaves you with many questions. However, the film itself is a masterpiece but really only intended for mature audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed the MonstersBall. As a fan of Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton it was treat to see them together. The film depicted an accurate portrayal of a woman under a considerable amount of stress and of a man who is also conflicted. The racial tones that are a part of the movie are honest and sometimes painful to watch. The tenderness of Billy Bob with Halle is evident as he wrestles with his own demons. I appreciate the way the director appeared to make the film move in "real time". The lovemaking scenes were real and raw and seeing Halle in this light only endeared me to her more. She's proves in this movie that she is an actress and not just "eye candy". Well worth the $8.25!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of basic human need</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of people I went to see this movie because it promised to be raw, unflinching, sexy. And it certainly delivers. As I drove home I found myself bawling like a baby. So it wasn't the sentimental cry that one gets with a good love story but one that came from a gut level. I realized that while the plot was a little hard to believe, the movie succeeds because I believe that my gut-level, non-intellectual reaction was its intention. It spoke to the need I believe all of us have to be touched at his or her core level. And it spoke to the extremes we go to when we don't get it(Heath Ledger) and what we find ourselves doing to get it.(Halle("make me feel good") Berry). If it weren't for the difficult to believe tragedies that led up to their sexual encounter, Halle Berry's character would have been little more than some "nigger juice". But as it happened the hard defensive shells that many of us carry around(particularly men) cracked open for Halle Berry's and Billy Bob Thorton's characters. Though many cast doubt on Billy Bob's sudden shift from stanch racist to loving human being, I can see how such an epiphany can happen in an instant. So ultimately, in my mind, it was a story of two souls, and then of two "races" healing who still in the 21st century all to often see themselves as polar opposites of humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done even if Thorton's performance is a bit wooden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball tells the story of two dysfunctional families in the South. One, a white family consisting of correction officers, (Peter Boyle, Billy Bob Thorton, Heath Ledger) the other of a soon to be single black poor mother raising a son (Halle Berry) who's husband is going to be executed on death row. In a strange turn of events the 2 meet up, and with the tragedies in their lives, somehow manage to fall in love with each other. This film is very well acted and directed and is a good portrait of family dysfunctionality (both black and white) and racist attitudes. Thorton and Boyle are both hard core rednecks, but with a tragedy of Thorton's son Thorton tries to fix his old ways, even though his father won't change his.This movie would have been spectacular if it allowed this conflict to explode but it doesn't happen. I kept waiting for this serious transformation and/or confrontation between Boyle and Thorton but it doesn't happen (not even when Berry shows up unannounced at his home walking in on his unexpected father). Thorton's performance is just too wooden in the film for the character he is playing. You understand that he needs someone like Berry (and she needs him) but you never really feel it. In 'The Man Who Wasn't There' Thorton's wooden performance is great cause it fits the character he is playing [a sap], but here he needs to do more to make us believe what we are seeing [a hard core redneck who then renounces his ways]. There is really no difference in his performance and demeanor from his racist past, to his new acceptance and love he now has for someone like Berry. That is the films biggest fault.Luckily there are great performances by everyone else in the picture from Heath Ledger as the unloved son, and of course from Berry who steals the show in this picture (this is truly her film and shining moment). Also a lot of the cinematography reminded me of another great film 'Drug Store Cowboy' and it is perfectly paced.Certainly a good film but could have been so much more.Rating 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect cap to a poor movie year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001 will certainly go down as one of the worst years for movies in recent memory (at least for this would-be critic). Monster's Ball is a good final entry. I had many problems with this movie, despite its message. First, the setting. I know this is splitting hairs, but was it supposed to be Louisiana or Georgia? The uniforms had the Louisiana state badge on them, but the license plates said Georgia. This gaff bothered me throughout the movie, but it wasn't the only problem. Second, the guy buys a gas station, for no apparent reason, but spends no time there. What was the point of this? What did it have to do with the story? Finally, the transformation of Billy Bob Thornton from nasty, racist, hot-tempered redneck to subdued, down home "nice guy" Southerner was too sudden and unbelievable. And the business with the motel hooker; again, I ask, the point? To top it all off, the sex scenes were too intense. And Halle Berry's acting goes from restrained to fists pounding on the bed. She seems to be screaming "OSCAR." I don't know what the director was trying to accomplish, but he sure succeeded if he meant to make a nearly unwatchable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two movies for the price of one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball refuses to soften some of the ugliest material on screen this season, then it turns to mush. The actors are outstanding - and they need to be outstanding to carry the film, which has major credibility problems. SPOILERS. It shows us the family from hell. The old man is failing and full of rage. He is a gleeful racist who despises women, especially his "quitter" of a wife who killed herself (Boyle, a great performance). His middle aged son goes along with the mad-dog macho ethic. He uses his fists and unlimited contempt to drum any tendency toward kindness out of his own son. The son and grandson are prison guards, of a real prison plus the prison they inherited. It's over the top, especially the suicide of the grandson. The two older men give the young `pussy' a hasty burial. The father quits his job, but is it remorse or does he feel he lost face? The only hint of remorse is that he can't get it on with his usual whore. You stare at the screen thinking "Am I watching an American movie?" It gets points for ruthlessness. The other family in the film is more comprehensible. A murderer on death row is made to seem more sympathetic than the guards who execute him (not difficult considering what we've seen of them and Sean Coombs does a good job). His artistic son loves him and is eating himself to death. The wife he mistreated is furious and going under financially (Halle Berry gives a multi-dimensional performance). After the execution the poor fat kid is run over by a car and killed instead of undergoing the Hollywood treatment. The middle-aged racist prison guard who stopped his car and took the mother and son to the hospital takes the mother home. They get drunk and desperate and have sex. End of Monster's Ball part one.What could they do for an encore? Monster's Ball part two is an about face. Suddenly the ex-prison guard is a tender and considerate lover. Enter Love, exit racism! The grandfather is off to a nursing home the minute he gets ugly. They move in together and he names his new business, a gas station, after her. `I just want to take care of you!' She finds out he helped execute her former husband and cries a bit, but Happiness Calls.The two parts of the movie don't fit together. Sure, people reverse their beliefs, but it isn't simple, easy or painless. I have to confess I was relieved though. If the two halves had fit together he'd have reverted to type and driven her to suicide and their child to a life of crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, the movie is well acted and the possibly inflammatory subject matter of domestic violence, inter-racial relationships, onscreen sex, and bigotry may garner added media attention. However, I found I could not withstand much over the first 40 minutes of this profoundly depressing film before walking out of the theatre. From what I saw, none of the characters are appealing; they are all victims with little redeeming qualities who we watch move across the screen in brutal and confused desperation. Society provides us all with enough exposure to this kind of dysfunction. "Art" of this ilk would best be absent on the $8 to $10 screens and instead remain on nighttime cable soaps.</fullReview>

I had a stomach ache and felt a very omnious feeling that things were going to go from bad to worse. I was pleasently surprised. Thank you again Mr. Thornton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised how powerful this film was and how emotional I became watching it. I hardly ever cry or tear up at any kind of performance: theatre, opera, dance, film, etc. But there was a moment when Halle Berry's character is crying out in pain and grief and I was overwhelmed by the moment and by her acting. I have never thought much of her as an actress, but she gives an Oscar caliber performance. Billy Bob Thornton continues to be one of the best working American film actors out there. He, too, has moments of clarity and realism that are stunning. The film is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. It meanders at points, it is a bit slow, but there are so many true moments, so many scenes of rich humor that come out of character interaction and not jokes that is very real and refreshing. It is a pleasure to see such a multi-layered, important film get made nowadays. The supporting cast all give strong performances, including Sean "Puffy" Combs, Heath Ledger and the young Calhoun as Berry and Comb's obese son. It would be a shame if Thronton and Berry are overlooked come Oscar time. I do UNDERSTAND the title, but I still think it hurts the picture. I've overheard people at the cineplex confusing it with Monsters, Inc or wondering if it's a lame horror flick. Hell, just call it LETICIA after Berry's character. A somewhat flawed, but incredibly moving film. I look forward to the young director's future work. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It truly takes a human being to really see a human being".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, the film makes a powerful statement about racial relations and how a person can overcome life long prejudices if one is willing to see things from the other person's point of view. Both lead characters, Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) and Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry) make this transition through horrific personal tragedies, initially finding each other through desperation, then building their relationship through mutual respect and understanding. It would be a toss up as to which one had the harder time of it, but both take the leap of faith that all interracial couples must come to grips with eventually.To be sure, there are simplistic elements in the picture that distract, and plot flaws that take away from the picture's impact. Why for example, would Hank be able to remove the bullet from the chair in which Sonny (Heath Ledger) shot and killed himself? This is a two part question. A proper crime scene investigation would have accomplished that already for one, and secondly, how would the bullet completely pass through Sonny's body? Another thing that bothered me was the uneven editing of the love scenes between Hank and Leticia. The first time I saw this picture was on a VHS screener copy, so I chalked it up to a poor print. But watching a DVD version today did not resolve that issue. The quick jump cuts to the bird cage while Hank and Leticia succumbed to their passion seemed disjointed, particularly since there was no prior reference to that prop. I get the symbolism of a caged bird trying to break free, so that's not the issue. While watching you either have to figure that out quickly, or wind up scratching your head for a few minutes, thereby losing your focus on what follows.I think what I liked best about the development of Thornton's character was the way he came around to approach the black neighbor with the two boys who liked Sonny. It was done gradually and realistically, first initiated by the boys who wanted to express their regret over Sonny's death. Then, as time went by, Hank brings Sonny's truck to the father to have it readied for Leticia to drive. The transition is done without the confrontation one might expect, and without questioning underlying motives for Hank's sudden change of temperament. You can sense the black man's apprehension, but he goes with Hank's flow to further reduce those racial barriers between the two.The finale, well I'm actually somewhat puzzled by it. Leticia's sudden discovery of Hank's identity in relation to her husband's execution was undeniably gut wrenching. So what happened during the interlude in which Hank went to buy some ice cream? It ended just a little too feel good to come off successfully. That revelation probably should have occurred in place of Buck's (Peter Boyle) racist sentiments, giving Hank and Leticia time to come to grips with the anomaly their lives were presented. It's not likely that they wouldn't have broached the subject after the closing credits rolled, so letting in the viewer on that discussion would have answered any lingering questions about their relationship.Be that as it may, I thought the film was generally well done. It makes one examine one's own prejudices and elicits a reaction to the events as they unfold on screen. Above all it makes you think about what it takes to see a human being, and that can only be a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monsters Ball A Weird Solid Drama With Good Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monsters Ball is a weird solid drama with good performances from director Marc Foster whose the man behind films like the recent Quantum of Solace and Stay. Foster continues to show his talent as a filmmaker with this one despite its flaws. The two leads Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry deliver believable performances in a story about two very different people who fall in love after having a steamy one night stand. Sean Combs, Mos Def, and Peter Boyle provide good supporting performances in their small roles. The late Heath Ledger also has a brief role as Thorton's estranged son but his part in the movie is cut rather short. The pacing of the movie was a little slow at times and some of the characters especially Ledgers could've had more screen time but the good outweighs the bad. The few sex scenes in the movie are very explicit and they really push the R rating especially the one between Thorton and Berry. Overall though despite it's few problems Monsters Ball is a decent enough for anyone looking for a different movie to watch with impressive performances by the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about hope and redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film packs a considerable punch and I'm glad I was feeling optimistic about my own life when I watched it. Otherwise, it might cause the viewer to feel very depressed about the real suffering in the world, which is out there. This film showed the downward spiral of loss and poverty that Halle Berry's character suffered, and Billy Bob Thornton's character also suffered, and he appeared to learn from what happened to him. Serving as a corrections officer on death row must brutalise anyone, and as an opponent of the death penalty, I was pleased that this message was clear. However, he managed to disengage himself and quit that profession, and move on. The film is about hope and the possibility of redemption for everyone - not in a religious sense, but in terms of making choices and changing your life for the better before it is too late.The stark nature of the production was essential to the message that this could be real - a series of tragic events can destroy someone, and that happens in reality. This story is told boldly and without pity, but then things get better, and although we don't know what the future holds, showing human kindness is demonstrated to be a way of saving yourself and others - that truth still holds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching it twice may have been a mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over a month after reviewing 2004's "Catwoman", which Halle Berry received a Razzie for Worst Actress for her performance in, I am reviewing the film that lead to her Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role three years earlier! Before watching this, I wasn't quite sure what I was in for, or if renting it was a good idea. During my first viewing, I found quite a bit of tension in it, so it seemed worth it for a while, but by the end, it seemed like sort of a blur. I felt I had to see it again in order to judge it, but it seemed to wear a bit thin with the second viewing.Hank Grotowski is a racist white prison guard. He is a widower who lives with his firmly racist father, Buck, who is physically senile, and also widowed. Hank also has a son named Sonny, who works with him. Lawrence Musgrove, a black man with a wife and son, has been convicted of murder, and has been sentenced to the electric chair. Hank and Sonny are both involved in his execution, and afterwards, conflict between the two soon leads to Sonny's suicide! Hank then resigns from his job. Meanwhile, Lawrence's widow, Leticia, has been a struggling mother since her husband's imprisonment, and due to financial problems, she might soon be evicted from her home! One rainy night, she is out walking with her morbidly obese son, Tyrell, and he is hit by a car! As Hank drives by, he sees Leticia with her injured son, calling for help, and decides to take them to the hospital, where Tyrell soon dies. After this, Hank and Leticia fall in love, but they don't know very much about each other, and more trouble is bound to arise.I have no complaints about the acting in the film. Halle Berry puts on a good performance as Leticia Musgrove, so I can't say she didn't deserve her Oscar. Billy Bob Thornton's performance as Hank Grotowski is also a highlight. However, despite the impressive acting, "Monster's Ball" certainly does have its problems. I was not too impressed with the camera work, at least not around the beginning. For example, what's the point in showing a view of Hank's feet from underneath the bed? The camera work may also be a bit hard on the eyes at times. So, the cinematography is one thing that makes this movie lose some points. The heavy sex scenes don't add much to the film, especially the one with Leticia and Hank in the bedroom, which is a bit too long. As you can tell by the plot, several tragedies take place in the story. Some viewers may think the film overdoes the tragedies, and I can understand that. If there was one more tragic death in the story than there is, I think that would have been the last straw for me, I probably would have lost all sentiment! Lastly, there were definitely parts I found tense the first time, but not so much the second time, when I knew what would happen, though I still did find SOME tense or moving scenes the second time.After the first viewing, I thought it was worth it, and thought maybe it would improve with another viewing, but I was wrong. Like I said, it seemed to wear a bit thin this time. "Monster's Ball" is a dark, heavy story, but one which has impressed many people, and since so much of it didn't fail to move me the first time, I'm not surprised. However, I'm also not surprised with the criticism, as I've definitely seen better dramas. For some people, the film's flaws have overshadowed the merits. So, if you want a moving drama/romance film, I would say this one is probably worthwhile, at least for one viewing, but I don't suggest you expect Top 250 material. You also might not want to watch it more than once, since I feel that may have been somewhat of a mistake on my part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more overrated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, by no means do I think Monster's Ball is a bad movie. But it is far too problematic to be considered great, and is, I feel, one of the more overrated movies of recent years. I do have to concede that there are some very good performances, particularly from Billy Bob Thornton and the late Heath Ledger. The late, great Peter Boyle is also excellent, as is young Coronji Calhoun. And Oscar winner Halle Berry does give the performance of her career, although based on other roles such as Catwoman and the Flinstones, that's a rather dubious statement. I certainly don't think her work in this film was Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is above average, as is the dialog, but the story frequently stretches believability. More than anything, I feel this film is a fairly manipulative tearjerker, with moments, MOMENTS of greatness. By far the most distracting thing in the movie is the highly graphic sex scene between Berry and Thornton (which is even more graphic in the unrated director's cut). Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed seeing the beautiful Halle Berry in the buff, but I also felt it cheapened the movie as it is completely over the top and gratuitous. Many a couple in many a movie has had sex, and it can certainly be an important plot point, but it has never been necessary to be as graphic as this scene because we all know what happens when people have sex. The scene is near-porn with art-house pretensions, and makes the film feel like the whole thing was just an excuse to get Halle naked and (very realistically) simulating sex. It is my biggest problem with this movie. It is also a guilty pleasure to watch, with the end result being me questioning why I watch the film. Overall, I still recommend the movie, it has its moments, as I've said. I also think the director is a big ol' perv.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sombre love story cloaked in heavy racism shroud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewing this film for the first time in an age that is post Crash (2004/I) begs the question of just what is the right formula when making a racial drama ?, we see here on this site that Crash is rated above 8 whilst Monsters Ball ranks at just above 7, now as much as I liked Crash, I firmly believe that it beats you over the head with its message far more than Monsters Ball evidently does, so what is the marker where the viewer deems it an important film before it becomes too much ?.Monsters Ball triumphs over some heavy handed approaches because of it's multifaceted themes, it manages to fuse a love story with fractured family threads, the racism heartbeat is merely a strand to this wonderfully written piece of work. The central plot is basically of two people who happen to be of different color hurtling towards each other by way of an horrendous set of circumstances, it involves death, hatred, bigotry and inherent bile, but chiefly it is a love story that I feel some initial viewers have failed to grasp.Maybe that's just me ? The film is not without problems tho, the main characters are rushed in a short space of time, and there are gaping holes where development was crucially needed, a major plot point involving Heath Ledger's Sonny Grotowski and his Father just doesn't impact the way it should because we aren't wise to just how fractured the relationship is. Another scene asks us to believe that the police take as gospel what had happened during a death scene without investigation !, it's poor and doesn't sit well in an otherwise great film.The cast are tremendous, Halle Berry is a deserved Oscar winner, her performance drags the viewer into her desperate state and it's as good an emotive performance from a Female lead that I have seen in the 00s. Billy Bob Thornton was criminally ignored come Oscar nomination time because here he turns a devilish character into a heartfelt stripped bare man, and we believe it's possible such is his layered twist . The rest are great as well, Heath Ledger, Peter Boyle, Mos Def &amp; Sean Coombs perfectly play it the way it should be played, no overstating, no ham sandwich, just sedately perfect for the story unfolding. I applaud the two writers of this piece { Milo Addica &amp; Will Rokosfor} for holding out 6 years to see the film realised on the screen, nobody would touch the story unless it was watered down, but they stuck to their guns and the final result maybe flawed to a degree, but it stands up as a very special and deep emotional film for this particular day and age, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Academy Award Nominee -- Good, but Hardly the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seems typical of Academy Award winners -- really, pretty good, but not nearly as good as they seemed at award time. Perhaps this film gave hope to all the aging white men of Hollywood by demonstrating that if a man changes his vile racist ways, and is really really sorry, he can end up having hot sofa and floor sex with Halle Berry. The problem is that this film really demonstrates the miserable racism and sexism of Hollywood. Because what does Halle Berry get, after seeing family members die in rather extreme ways? A troubled love affair with Billy Bob Thorton.Seriously, this film begs to be treated seriously as an examination of race and capital punishment, and as a character study (with a really hot sex scene). It succeeds best as a character study, as the acting of Billy Bob Thorton and Heath Ledger is excellent. Halle Berry's acting isn't Oscar caliber -- but that is as much a fault of the way the role is written, as any flaw in her performance. Thornton is giving the unenviable task of playing a racist, tightly wound and angry man, who finds redemption in his grief following his son's suicide. The redemption is really hard to buy -- you can't find any reason this particular character would do a 180. But it is well-acted. Heath ledger, playing the son, does a ton with his small role.The plot is full of holes -- some probably deliberate. (If we knew why Halle's husband was being executed, we might be less sympathetic towards him and Halle, which would destroy the mood the movie attempts to establish in its first hour.) But there are moments of brilliance, too. This may be the first movie to get someone to cheer for sending a declining old gentleman to the nursing home. And, despite the downbeat nature of the plot, there is a sly wit at work in some of the scenes and in the screenplay.Don't think so? Take the movie's title. Then think about the movie's characters. And recall what this movie's most famous scene is.As I said -- a sly wit at work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arduous Viewing That Requires Viewer Refection and Compassion. "Monster's Ball" Distinguishes Human Behaviour Through Emotional Torment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember when Halle Berry won her Oscar? Well, it is impossible not to forget, for more reasons than one. I for one, agreed with the win, being that in my eyes, an Oscar was considerably deserved for a woman who was able to gracefully execute such a demanding role. I am not one to pretend that Halle Berry is customarily known to pull off an excellent performance, being that she is usually inept at portraying practically every character she gets cast as. Nevertheless, her performance in Monster's Ball ranks among the finest showcases of female acting released inside the 21st century and deserves all the credit it can muster, taking into account that it is an accomplishment in every sense of the word.Monster's Ball is a narrative assembled through its characters relating back to one-an-other. Formed around a Southern American prison, Billy Bob Thornton stars as Hank Grotowski, a racist prison guard who works with his son, Sonny Grotowski, played by Heath Ledger. Sonny does not follow the same beliefs as his father (nor grandfather for that matter) and seems to regret the life he leads while moving up the ranks of the prison, eventually working on death-row with his father. Coincidentally, an unexpected relationship sparks between a black woman named Leticia Musgrove (performed by Halle Berry) and Sonny, neither of them are aware of it, but their lives are knitted together by their recently tragic events. The title refers to an old tradition whereby people on death-row were known as "monsters" and the night before their execution they were held a final "party" as such, hence it being a "ball", ultimately producing the film's somewhat ironic title.The fundamental element of Monster's Ball is the acting, which is the driving force of the film's complexity and emotional dominance, but it is by no means manipulative. The acting is entirely convincing and human that it becomes apparent that the actors are not merely "reading their lines" and "doing actions", but rather that they have obtained and grasped a comprehension of their characters. For the most part, the characters are dislikeable, particularly that of Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle's accurately disturbing, prejudice-driven characters. The complexity behind the characters is largely concealed behind lines and mannerisms. It is within the subtext of Billy Bob Thornton's gestures and distant replies that you understand that he has become overpowered by his father, played by Peter Boyle. All this and much more can be found behind all the key performances of Monster's Ball conveying what is an emotionally shattering and psychologically harrowing masterwork.German director Marc Forster genuinely illustrates his talent for film with his note-worthy direction of Monster's Ball, he later proved his talent consecutively with 2004's Finding Neverland. What Marc Forster succeeds in achieving is the ability to make Monster's Ball (a narrative that on paper might seem fairly unoriginal) into a daring, distinct and audacious example of the best in modern cinema. The film uses perceived-notions and metaphysical imagery to suggest implications of characters and the lives they lead. The cinematography gives the film a rough look of torn emotions and moralistic ambiguity. I do not feel it is necessary for me to spell-out all my interpretations and opinions of the themes Monster's Ball contains, seeing that this is a film which is exposed for thought and should be discussed, at length, after viewing. You see, I consider the protagonists to be in "self-inflicted prisons of the mind", yet Monster's Ball offers no right or wrong interpretation, but only one's opinion of what is an unforgettable experience.Monster's Ball is a laudable feat for American cinema, accomplishing things that most films cannot and carrying sincere intelligence. The film takes along with it a moralistic integrity, openness and a stirring ease of hope which deserves to be admired. This is drama in its rawest form and most provocative sensitivity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I racist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have found over the years that when someone has to ask if they are racist they generally are or you wouldn't be asking! I came to this forum to find out about the movie but find a debate on what as humans we are attracted to and what it means. Silly when you think about it. I am white and female, I have dated more outside my race then in it. Some of the men were gorgeous some were just OK. When it really gets down to it if we are only attracted to the "outer package" it doesn't matter what race anyone is, it's not going to be a positive union. I'm at a stage in my life where content matters more than packaging, granted I have to at least be able to look at him easily without grimace. :o) And I have found that great content comes in many shades. It's 2007 lets just all get along, let people have their freedom of choice without being criticized or told that it is wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Monster's Ball" is a wonderful drama, made without any big budget or tricks. It's a movie with a heart and soul. In other words film-making at its very best.To me it's a movie that is all about second chances in life. The two main characters, played by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry, both went to some dreadful things that changed their lives. After that have to pick things up again and have to chance to do the things in their lives differently now and also look differently upon certain matters now. During this process the two are drawn towards each other but their relationship is more born out of desperateness than love. The fact that Thornton's character is the prison guard on Death Row who executed Halle Berry's husband (played by Sean Combs), makes the love even more complicated.The movie is truly carried by the two main character played by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry. Both give some powerful performances and make all the dramatic and love elements of the movie work. There also is a very strong supporting cast. Mos Def is a great actor and so is Heath Ledger. It's too bad Ledger's career never really got of the ground. After "The Patriot" everybody expected some great things from this young actor but so far he has only played in some semi-successful but not so well by the press received movies, ("The Four Feathers", "A Knight's Tale", "The Brothers Grimm".) with the exception of this movie of course."Monster's Ball" is a great little drama by director Marc Forster and fans of the genre must definitely watch this movie. I was impressed by this movie and had a great time watching it. Great movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, But Not For The Faint-Hearted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a great film. The acting is superb. Billy Bob Thornton's character, Hank, is reborn right in front of your eyes, going from an emotionally unavailable racist to someone who can love what he fears the most.Heath Ledger gives a short but poignant performance in the beginning of the film that haunts the rest of the movie with it's chilling regret.Halle Berry. What can I say. I think this is her best performance. Her character has depth, in fact, I wasn't totally sympathetic with the character, which just gives her more realism. An abusive, alcoholic mother, whose child's father is on death row, she's hard-edged but vulnerable at the core.This movie is definitely not for people who dislike violence or sexual content. I personally thought that the sex scene bordered on exploitative, but on the other hand, it portrays the sense of longing and release from spiritual/psychological bondage of the two characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitter, Intense Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ere has been considerable negative criticism of this film, and I think it arises from the simple fact that it is not in the least what most viewers expect it to be. Although it sports two well-known stars and expensive production values, Marc Forster's MONSTER'S BALL is essentially an art film that is unlikely to appeal to the mainstream audiences that rushed to see in the wake of Halle Berry's historic Oscar win.The story is Southern Gothic to the max, playing with grotesque plot devices worthy of Flannery O'Connor and twisted characters that might have stepped out of a Tennessee Williams play. Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is a correctional officer with the Georgia prison system, where he works with a team that executes prisoners condemned to the electric chair. During the course of his duties, he participates in the execution of Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs)--an execution that, in the most unexpected way imaginable, leads to the violent death of his son (Heath Ledger.) He subsequently becomes acquainted with Lawrence's widow Leticia (Halle Berry), and when she too loses her only son (Coronji Calhoun) to violent death the two embark on a passionate affair fueled by their grief and bitterness.The film plays with a number of ideas and issues, chief among them racism, but at core it is about the emotional sterility and shallow lives of its characters, and none of them are greatly likable. This is particularly true of the two leads, who are abusive, frustrated, and bitter--until their unexpected affair forces them to evolve in new directions. Even so, their motives remain problematic, and the conclusion of the film offers little in the way of closure.While the plot relies on several improbable coincidences, director Forster and his actors make the most of it, and the result is a film that is truly painful in its intensity. While Halle Berry's performance has been justly celebrated, it is equaled by Billy Bob Thornton--and the supporting cast is equally remarkable. The cinematography and music is at once understated and extremely memorable, and the film as a whole has a desperate darkness that few others in recent memory have equaled.This is not a film that a great many people will like, for it creates a brooding quality that is deliberately left unresolved. But it is a haunting film, one that lingers in the mind long after the final credits have rolled. Recommended to viewers who appreciate bitter drama at its most intense.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is an outstanding film that explores very important, yet very difficult issues. It is ambiguous as to the time period and location, and I think it is intentional to show that discrimination and racism has always been a problem and continues to be a problem. All the actors were brilliant in their portrayals and inhabited their characters wonderfully. Halle Berry showed a character who was both troubled and confused, pulled in many directions. She then found herself falling in love with an unlikely type of person. Her character has many dimensions and her Oscar Winning performance will not disappoint. Billy Bob Thornton's character struggles with going against what he's been taught his entire life and having the courage to stand up for what is right. Heath Ledger's character represents someone who has always done what is right, and what can happen when someone doesn't prescribe to what is expected of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marc Forster is a mature director to watch out for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marc Forster, the director, is the most notable facet of the movie. He has brought to USA a breath of fresh air with his low-key powerful direction (resembling John Sayles' "Limbo", at times). Take the final scene--in my opinion the finest part of a well thought-out film. The camera captures three graves (son, wife, mother?). Leticia's face subtly changes from repulsion/fear to love/respect. Hank's offers the ice cream with a sense of fulfillment, of redemption, an exorcism of all the ills of the past. If I were Marc Forster my instinct would have been to end the film with a mid-shot of the two faces looking at the camera. But surprise, surprise! Forster chooses to take a reverse angle shot with the camera going behind the two heads, capturing the dark sky of the night they are savouring.Decades ago films from Hollywood ended with lovers riding into the sunset with grandoise music. For Forster, the dark, silent finale says it all--a new life order, a sense of reconciliation (at a level higher than two races, an executioner turning redeemer), a toast to three individuals (buried in the garden) who died fighting dark forces around them, a life where income (an important undercurrent in the film) comes from providing fuel and not from keeping people behind bars. The end of the film is powerful in its simplicity and understatements.Another strength of the film is its European feel in the taut script and editing. A lot is said without words spoken--choice of Hank's seats in the restaurant, with his back to other customers but yet near to them, the sale of the wedding ring, the photograph of the executed prisoner in Leticia's bathroom after the sex sequence, the allegory of the caged bird, painting Leticia's name over the gas station, cleaning the blood off the handbag, the red curtains bought on credit, etc.Forster is one of the few directors who have used the sex encounters (all four in the movie) to flesh out the characters. The sexual preferences of father and son (and grandfather?) do not seem to be very different, while externally the older generations seem to be less adapted to changes--or is it a comment on the contribution of the two wives never shown alive in the film.The slow transformation of Hank--from the son who listens to the father to the son who forces his father to live in an old age home--is more a contribution of Forster than Thornton. Of course, Thornton was great to watch on screen.Similarly, Leticia's slow uptake on Hank's role in her husband's death and her relationship with money (gathering fallen coins while paying the cab, the growing tips at the restaurant, to the purchase of the expensive hat when she has to pay her bills) are built up with care by Forster and wonderfully executed by the actors.Bruce Beresford's "Tender Mercies" attempted a similar essay in American cinema, but Forster has proved his mettle in this wonderful movie experience. Even though most people only seem to have noticed the performances of the actors in this lovely movie, evidently directors like Forster and Julie Taymor can provide good American cinema for discerning, mature audiences in the near future. Forster and Taymor represent the new mature Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MONSTER'S BALL eventually becomes a pretty good film. I say eventually because it takes nearly an hour for the film to get to the point where the characters rise above clichs and their lives become compelling. That is when the two main characters finally meet and their romance -- such as it is -- begins. It is a strange romance and often strains credibility. Billy Bob Thornton is an executioner at an unspecified Southern prison, who, by chance, meets and begins a relationship with Hallie Berry as the wife of one of his executions. The added twist is that he is white and raised in an extremely racist atmosphere and she is black, That is complication enough to carry any film, but director Marc Foster and screenwriters Milo Addica and Will Rokos provide the film with a lot of other baggage, most of which is stacked high at the front end of the film.It is not that the first 45 minutes of the story aren't important, only that it is all so badly handled. The opening sequences all seem trite, awkwardly staged, simplistic and just plain poorly written, especially when compared to most of the rest of the film. Yes, these scenes set up the subsequent story, but they come off as embarrassingly unrealistic and melodramatic. The characters are introduced as clichs (especially Peter Boyle as Thornton's racist father) and one key scene, a suicide, is laughable in its ineptitude.Nothing in these scenes could not have been handled much better as flashbacks or explained in poignant monologues. Indeed, letting the audience learn about the two main characters slowly and haphazardly as the characters themselves learn about each other would have made more sense and been much more effective,But what does eventually develop is a touching story about two people who have haunted pasts and have literally seen their futures die before their eyes. They meet at a place where neither have much to look forward to and little to lose. They subsequently build a romance and a shaky future based on fear, pity, guilt and dependency. But, the film suggests, that may be enough on which to build actual love. Maybe.Berry's Oscar-winning performance is certainly well done, but Thornton surpasses her with quietly somber work that relies on a fraction of the hysterics. Together, they have chemistry. Together they overcome a poorly written script and sloppy direction. One can quibble about the lame beginning and other matters (Thornton's change from bigot to liberal is a stretch and there is an extended, unnecessary and extremely tacky sex scene that flirts with being little more than gratuitous soft-core porn), but get past that and you get a story of depth and insight and human compassion. You just have to be patient. Very patient.</fullReview>

This is a very downbeat movie. I doubt I have ever seen such a pile-on-the-agony plot in all my life. Talk about things going wrong! The writers have taken the whole soap opera textbook of cliches and problems and then dumped them all on two people like a sack of rubbish.This is really a low budget movie with a plot that wouldn't be out of place in a Hallmark TV feature. Indeed only the sex scenes makes it clear it is not! The kind of project that would sink like a stone without solid pro's infront and behind the camera. Did Berry - third choice according to the producers and this site - really have to cry at the Oscars? Is this really that great a performance technically? We see black women endorsing products, walking down catwalks and even being the richest people on TV, is this really a breakthrough?I am sure she has cried, screwed, shouted and got drunk in real life - as we all have - so what is so difficult here? Maybe her "sponsors" prevented her from waiting tables in real life, but I am sure even that wasn't a stretch.Thorton's performance is just as good as Berry's, although it is rather Kevin Cosner like in being over-the-top polite and attentive after he has fallen in love. Amazing how quickly people can change habits of a lifetime in movies.(If screenwriters wrote about Hitler surviving the war they would have him seeing the error of his ways and helping build the Israeli state. Probably having been done a good turn by a blind Jew or something!)I am glad I saw this movie, but I was left with a feeling of so-what? Too many people are dead that I didn't know well enough to feel anything about. The principle characters haven't done anything that warrants my respect other than surviving a whole pile of problems. What happens next - is this a happy ever after story? Couldn't tell you and - quite frankly my dear - I couldn't give a damn...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that digs deeper and deeper... (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a preliminar advice for you: this is not a film you can watch with an eye on the screen, another on the beautiful boy/girl on your side, while eating popcorns and talking to your friend three seats far. Because it is made up of emotions, feelings and little movements, so you must enter the characters' mind and think with it if you want to get involved. And believe me, there are occasions to be involved in this disturbing, desperate yet sometimes tender story.The passion between the two main characters, Halle Berry's Leticia and Billy Bob Thornton's Hank, is only a part of this movie where other lifes are shown: an Afro-American "dead man walking", Leticia's husband, whose crime remains almost unknown; Hank's despised and deeply unhappy son, Sonny; Leticia's obese son, who suffers for the lack of a father; Hank's father, a kind of racist and full of fake bravery, but prisoner of his illness. Of course, the attraction between two desperate people who have lost everything is the climax, and how could it be different with a sex scene like this? (by the way, I agree with other commentators saying it was necessary: watch it with your brain, not with your hormons), but there's a lot to discover in this movie. An European comment: it's strange that Halle Berry got the Oscar for it. Not because of her performance, which is great, but because usually Hollywood doesn't like films that show the dark side of America, like this one does. Racism, flaws in the attribution of capital punishment, obesity, poverty... this is a postcard from U.S. that isn't exactly what the Academy wants to show. Far better, gladiators, tigers, the good hero, the beautiful woman and the bad king...How in the hell did they give an Oscar to "Gladiator"? But this is another story, and as regards "Monster's Ball"...I highly recommend it. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some might find this film depressing, I found it quite uplifting. Halle Berry's Letitia doesn't seem to realize that she's a stunner, or at least never considers taking advantage of that fact to get out of obvious distress and poverty. She loves her son while hating his fatness, only because she knows what it will do to him and how it will limit him. BBT is great! No, he doesn't convince us that he's a real racist. He's not. He just needs events to show him that he is neither the redneck his father was, nor must he resist being the liberal his son is just because of his hate for the boy. The only drawback is that Hank's hatred for the likable Sonnie is never explained.The controversial sex scene was not only tastefully done, but was absolutely necessary to free these two beaten down and injured people. Spoiler Alert!The ending was very strange and very gratifying. We are allowed to feel good. Letitia's initial shock and then stunned acceptance of Hank's peculiar role in her past is allowed to evolve into acceptance of his presumed role in her future.Miss Berry shows her wonderful talent in a role in which she actually sometimes makes us overlook her physical beauty and see the fragile and hurt insides of her character. A resounding 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Here's what this movie doesn't address: 1.Why is Hally Berry's son obese? Could it have something to do with the fact that his old man is on death row and his mama is a chain-smoking, child-abusing, shot-swilling uneducated deadbeat who'd rather buy gifts for her boyfriend than pay the rent? Just a thought. 2.How can a man raised in a proud tradition of bigotry do a complete turnaround which makes him fix up the house, banish his ailing father to a home, hand over the carkeys of the son he tormented to death to someone he's known for a few weeks, and let the black children he previously despised onto his property?  3.Why is his freaky, stomach-turning encounter with the town's dead-eyed hooker identical to his son's? Do they watch each other? Well, it's nice to know they did have some things in common.  I could go enumerating the absurdities of this foolish, dirty movie, but it's been done before. All I'll add is that I wonder what would have happened to Billy Bob if that woman screeching over her dead son had been 55 and fat...would he have had the same epiphany and started to love black people if he hadn't been doing gymnastics on Hally's blow-up doll body? Food for thought. And the fact that this travesty won Miss Berry a best actress award just goes to show that in the great lottery of the academy awards, when it's your turn, it's your turn. I guess by 2005 they'll decide to get sensitive to Asians, and Lucy Liu will win for her riveting turn in Charlie's Angels IV.  This movie sickened me. Don't watch it unless you have a very strong stomach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*possible spoiler*"Monster's Ball" is about two human beings--a man and a woman--thrown together by personal tragedy. They are drawn together out of pure desperation, by an aching need to feel some emotion through their numbing grief. She is a black woman whose husband has been executed for murder--sadly, this is not the first loss she is destined to suffer. He is a racist prison guard responsible for supervising said execution, having been in charge of death row, and is still dealing with his son's recent suicide. An unlikely match, to be sure, but they turn to each other not out of love, but because of circumstance. They are, of course, unaware of their connection, but it is inevitable that they will discover this fact. Who will be the first to know, and what will come of it? The screenplay refuses to settle the issue with easy, formulaic Hollywood solutions. It is a compelling drama intertwining the issues of racism, loss, and the relationships between generations. The dependable Billy Bob Thornton turns in some solid, low-key work here. He plays a complex character, a man who has had racist attitudes forced upon him from day one. He is unexpectedly thrust into a situation where his old ways are obsolete--in the past, he did not hesitate to aim a gun at black children who ventured onto his property, but now he is in a sexual union with a black woman. This would have been absolutely unimaginable before, yet it has happened. Fate has dealt him an unexpected hand. This character could have been mishandled in any number of ways, but Thornton makes the transition believable. Of course, the best performance comes from Halle Berry as the ill-fated woman who has suffered more personal loss than she can be reasonably expected to cope with. She gives us moments that are genuinely painful and emotionally shattering. These are raw, honest scenes that she never had the opportunity to work with in her big-studio films. Surely, her future work will be anticipated. There is also an excellent supporting performance from Peter Boyle, as Thornton's ailing father. The character is a despicable, pathetic racist who will never have a chance to transcend his attitudes as his son did. This aspect of the film shows that racism is something we learn--and can only be unlearned with great difficulty. Unfortunately, Heath Ledger is underused as the son--one wonders how this guy's attitudes would have progressed under other circumstances."Monster's Ball" is a worthwhile film, but certain factors do prevent it from completely hitting the bull's-eye. Certain plot points seem rather contrived, though perhaps the filmmakers intended for coincidence to play a thematic role in the story. The direction may seem a bit stagy, but the actors are compelling enough to make this a relatively minor point. The film could also be accused of being somewhat overbaked and melodramatic at times. Nonetheless, the film's strong points shine through more often than not. Its emotional honesty, compelling social themes, and powerful performances make this a winner. There has been some criticism of Halle Berry winning an Oscar for her role, but I suspect that her detractors have not even seen this film. It is an award well-earned.*** (out of ****)Released by Lions Gate Films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long dull story, poorly shot and edited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS A mediocre piece redeemed by okay -- but definitely not great -- performances by Berry and Thornton.MONSTER'S BALL is shockingly bad not only as storytelling, but on a technical filmmaking level. I expect bad writing in high-budget commercial films. But repeated shots where everybody's head is deliberately cut off? Tricky compositions where reflections obscure all relevant action? Weird camera angles which impede the story and confuse the viewer? The opening credits are unreadable, a pretty embarassing foul-up for a major motion picture. I thought my DVD player was broken!Maybe the director, cinematographer and editor think these incompetencies constitute a style. Their heavy-handed, clumsy amateurism keeps the plot clunking along. The story while slow, still manages to be confusing.Monotonous music drowns out muffled dialogue of already-inarticulate characters. What'd prison guard Thornton say as he pulled the other guard, his son, away from the condemned man's cell? The condemned man's wife (Berry) changes hurriedly into her waitress uniform in the back room of a restaurant. A man comes in. A friend? Boyfriend? Her boss? What'd he say? What'd he mean by that? Has she just been fired or what? End of scene. A head-scratching moment.Peter Boyle, the Thornton character's Dad, trowels in bricks of heavy exposition. Mom killed herself. She was no good. "She quit on me." He spits it out like a man whose car just stalled. How do the makers intend us to take this moment? Funny haha? Can't tell. Funny-peculiar? Another head-scratching moment.On the way to the execution, the Thornton character's son breaks away from the other guards to puke. In the prison bathroom, Thornton beats him up for being a pussy. At home, son pulls a gun on Dad. An over the top confrontation consisting of ludicrous epigrams and then bam! the boy shoots himself. Action is bald, flat, arbitrary, undermotivated; character development nonexistent.Thornton quits the prison. Because of his son's death? We're never given the least feeling of connection between them. He frequents coffee shops, always the sole customer. Because the makers were too cheap to hire extras? Or to make it inevitable he gets his next cup of coffee from Halle Berry?She walks home, he follows in his car, and passes her with her dying son in her arms. Hit by a car. He looks more stunned than hurt, but after Thornton drives them to the hospital the fat boy of course expires instantly. Why? So they can have one dead son each. Mechanical! Unbelievable.All these highly dramatic events left this viewer feeling shotful of novocaine. Couldn't care less. Who ARE these people?After an interminable time, the romance commences, a little bit of mood builds, the characters finally become halfway-likable. Letitia's encounter with her boyfriend's racist Dad provides some of the most memorable, believable moments.But the wind-up brings a return to mystification. Letitia finally figures out her boyfriend and his son were two of the guards who executed her husband. (You wonder, could anyone really be this SLOW?) Her reaction is unreadable. Billy Bob's due back, and you're not sure if she's gonna kiss him or kill him. First real suspense in the entire story. The scene built in such a way I was sure she was gonna pull a knife on him. Instead, they go out on the porch to look out at the stars. Camera pans up to the sky. The end. Say what? No irony intended? None taken.The people who made this definitely didn't know what they hell they were doing. This film did not deserve to win any awards in any category from any institution anywhere.The hoopla over this film doesn't surprise me. It sounds daring in the abstract. As if it tackles racial issues -- it doesn't; it sidesteps them. Billy Bob's a racist, then suddenly, magically, he's not. Painful self-examination doesn't enter into it -- or logic, either. Capital punishment? The makers don't have a thought in their heads about it. Don't care to tell us what the condemned man's supposed to have done. Is he a career criminal or a one-time offender? Is he guilty? They're not expecting us to think about it; after all, they didn't.The Academy has celebrated many meritless movies and I'd be disappointed if it didn't continue to do so. It's a weird institution that rewards greatness only by sheer accident.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that separates movie lovers from movie goers; art lovers from action lovers; intelligent analysis from drivel. First, this movie (like many) is not meant to be watched on the TV screen. It is a big-screen movie. If you missed it on the big screen, you missed a lot. This film was not nominated for Best Picture by the Academy of Motionless Pictures, Arduous and Sizable (let's face it--if it's not long and boring like Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Titanic or A Beautiful Mind or it hasn't made its box office goals, it won't get many nominations.) However, the screenwriters who nominate the screenplays got it right and nominated this masterpiece. (Note: the same nominating group ignored Titanic which gives further insight into their superior intellect.)Enough cannot be said about the perfection that this film achieves. The story is perfectly executed and filled with so much insight that it is eerie. Every detail adds to the character development and the development of plot. This movie is not for movie-goers who "just want to be entertained." They should stick to Rush Hour or A Beautiful Mind. There is no trite formula in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stronger in tone than performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Monster's Ball" is one of the rare films that I have seen where the sensibility of the film is greater than the actual story or the performances of the actors.With the film's execution (not the story), there are quite a few problems. The first that I will mention is the conflicting character motivation. Thornton's character is known and seen to brandish a shotgun at two black children in the beginning, but fall in love with Berry towards the end, which seems to be a surprising breach of character. While one might argue that the loss of his son may have changed him, it must be realized that he himself has admitted that he never loved him in the first place. Secondly, the details in the performances are lacking severely. Thornton seems to do well enough with the subtle facial expressions (indicating a man tormented by his own self), but aside from his attack on Ledger, he is bland and unconvincing, even for naturalistic style. Peter Boyle's character is an ancient Good Ole' Boy monster, yet his malice and hatred are underplayed; he reads his epithets as though they were stream-of-consciousness prose rather than actual convictions.I know that Halle Berry received the Academy Award for her performance, but I see nothing here that warrants even a nomination. She too often overplays her character's rants and grievous breakdowns to the point of being irritating rather than convincing: most notable is the pre-coital ranting on the couch about her late son's weight problem, where she continues to make the same hand gestures over and over again, ad nauseum. She is simply not a convincing actress for this particular role.I know that the film has drawn controversy for the explicit sex scene between Thronton and Berry; causing many to label it pornographic. These are comments by people who have probably never seen real pornographic material or who cannot distinguish content without broad parameters. The scene may be surprising to most people, but only in this country, where remnants of the Puritanical condemnation of sexual content still persists. The controversy is ludicrous and pertinent only to American puritanical traits that do not know they are obsolete. I would also argue that the continuous cutting of the scene draws more attention to itself than a long, continuous take. I cannot say for certain, but the rapid cutting (surely done to avoid an NC-17 rating) seems to make it more comical than emotional.The best part about the film, however, is the dark and almost nihilistic sensibility that dominates the direction of the characters. While the racist dialogue was weak and watered down, and the violence ineffective (I have seen better belt whippings in "Goodfellas"), the feeling of the script is very, very harsh. All the principals lose their families, their jobs, and one of them even loses their home, and they receive no relief from their pain. This is the truly admirable quality of the film, where the characters are almost broken by tragedy without pity. Contemporary audiences have become so accustomed to upbeat films that water-down their inherent bleakness that it is a welcome development to see a story like this.This can best be summarized in the last scene of the film. Berry has fallen in love with Thornton and vice versa. She is happily adjusting to her surroundings when she finds her late husbands pictures and realizes that Thornton knew him and was also part of his demise. But when Thornton returns, there is no screaming or yelling or dramatic repentance. She simply joins him outside for ice cream and simply looks at him. He says "I think we're happy enough." and she nods in assent before stargazing with him. She, like the other characters, has accepted the situation and Thornton is oblivious. A lack of emotional closure that is quite welcome in this day of pap and sentimentality.</fullReview>

Spellbinding with shattering performances and haunting situations. The film does lose some steam in the second half and drags a bit toward the end.

		<shortDescription>Provocative lack of concern. Biased and mournful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dark and mournful tale of racism and failing families. Billy Bob Thornton was snubbed by the Academy for his portrayal of a Louisiana Corrections guard in charge of executions. He lives with his almost bedridden father(Peter Boyle),a retired prison guard as well as his own son(Heath Ledger)also a prison guard less racist than his father and grandfather. Totally out of character Thorton finds compassion and falls in love with the African American wife(Halle Berry)of the last man he executed(Sean "Puffy" Combs). Thornton's son feels he has failed his father and commits suicide. Thornton then puts his dad away in a nursing home after resigning his job and buying a gas station. Subtle symbolism with "white" paint, "black" coffee and "chocolate" ice cream. And talk about flirting with the X rating!(Not that I am complaining. I used the stop/rewind button three times). Miss Berry and Thornton couple for the most realistic simulated sex I have ever seen. This is designed for mature audiences only. Maybe too down to earth; but the best damn drama I've seen all summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-designed tool. Does that mean a good movie? You decide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what it's supposed to do, Monster's Ball may be one of the best-focused movies produced in years. For better or for worse, that means for any endeavor lying outside of its intended purpose, there is no achievement and no effort. This may be a problem, because there is a great deal that lies outside of its intended purpose.It does two things: Within Hollywood, it generates Oscar nominations, and outside of Hollywood, it removes panties. Outside of those two things, the film has no reason for being. As a rental, it's over in 112 minutes and you will not be inclined to start the movie again even to look at scenes you missed. If you're going to the video store to celebrate the arrival of another Friday, being able to stay up late, you should pick up something else.Those who want to be intellectually stimulated by their movies, won't get much satisfaction here. There's really not much going on with the story. The first 28 movies are pure torture because there are no significant events and not even very many lines. I have to wonder what it was like when the script was tossed on someone's desk: "You call this a script? It's 38 pages!"I'm still inclined to give it three stars out of four, because I did get a little bit of entertainment out of it and I do think the product succeeded at the concept chosen for it. I just can't agree with the concept. Movies shouldn't be made just to showcase the talents of the actors, and if they are, the actors being showcased should have something to prove. Unfortunately, the four biggest stars in this piece were selected from those actors who could "afford" to take on an unorthodox project, therefore, they were already known to be talented in their chosen craft before this rolled out. So this is an effort to prove something that has already been proven.One final comment: When is a head-shrinker, pen and notebook in hand, going to stretch Hollywood out on a couch and explore this deep-seated hatred of the South? Yeah Hollywood, we get it, it's chock full of racist rednecks. There are also quite a few nice folks who live there. There are places to live that cultivate atmospheres of deep thinking and tolerance, and for that matter Hollywood itself can be loaded up with prejudices of its own. Get over yourselves already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie only to see what the hype was about. All I can say is it was just your typical average movie about suburban Southern people, where the antogonist is an abusive racist father, and some mother has to work two dead end low mininum wage odd jobs to make ends meet. I must say Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry were in rare form in this flick. Seeing Halle Berry carry her dying son into the Billy Bob's car like that it's no wonder she won the Oscar! Heath Ledger was good in this as well as the sensitive son, even though his role was cut short. The only thing that sets this movie apart from your other typical 'Southern people' movie was that Billy Bob's character starts off as a racist and Halle Berry's character changes him! In other words, they both fall in love. Monster's Ball was an okay movie, though it wasn't all too great as the critics say. But Billy Bob Thorton's and Halle Berry's performances were superb and the only thing really worth seeing. I give Monster's Ball 2 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember back in the day all the fuss about the interracial romance of Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. And of course there were some who said that this could only happen with a daughter with liberal parents and a black man who was nothing less than a saint. No one will confuse Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry as candidates for sainthood. Thornton comes from a racist southern tradition and is the second in a three generation line of corrections officers for the state of Louisiana. Halle Berry is married to Sean P. Combs who is sitting on Death Row in the state of Louisiana and it turns out that Thornton and his son Heath Ledger are assigned to that cell block.The thing I like about Monster's Ball is that the leads and those around them are very human and very flawed. It would have been so easy to make Berry and even more Thornton caricatures, but they are very real and very human.Thornton lives in an all male household with invalid father Peter Boyle and son Heath Ledger. Ledger in his eyes might not just have the right stuff to make it in Thornton's profession and his world. Definitely not in Boyle's where the civil rights revolution just hasn't arrived.Berry is a working mother with a pre-teen son who is terribly overweight and she just doesn't see him as a fitting son for Combs. Mind you even though Combs is on Death Row and we never learn why, he's her ideal man and her fat son just isn't in that image. The son is played by Corinja Calhoun in his one and only film and it's a very touching performance and Berry's best scenes are with him.After Combs dies, both Berry and Thornton lose their children and a chance meeting with Thornton on the road who takes Berry and Calhoun to the hospital. Their separate tragedies underscore a need each other has for supporting companionship and a little sex thrown in as well.38 years after Sidney Poitier became the first black man to win an Oscar for Best Actor, Halle Berry became the first black woman to win in the Best Actress category. And Poitier was in the audience that night when Denzel Washington became the second black actor to win in the Best Actor category for Training Day. Berry blew away the competition that night, my only problem was why wasn't Billy Bob Thornton nominated as well? Monter's Ball got another nomination for Best Original Screenplay.Monster's Ball is about real three dimensional people finding each other and helping each other work their way through horrific tragedy. They learn to need and care for each other so much that things like race just lose their importance. When broadcast, Monster's Ball shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not a single thing to complain about when it comes to technicalities in Monster's Ball. Every shot is well-thought out, supremely acted(on the verge of that magic "real" feeling) and well-made in every other way. The directing, in short, is great.But there is no point. The redemption in the end is not nearly enough to make you feel all the suffering in the movie before was worth it. That's not always bad, but when practically EVERYTHING happens to Halle Berry's character in the movie, you'd at least hope she'll be, well, a bit happy. Same goes for Billy-Bob, although his character isn't as exposed as Halle's.The story is well-written, but lacks in certain parts. It's like the opposite of Crash. In Crash, everyone is way too racist. In Monster's Ball, people are not racist enough to evoke the right feelings. In Crash, coincidences ruin the movie. In Monster's Ball, coincidences creates it. It's a fine balance(though frankly, Crash wasn't close to balance), and Monster's Ball never feels contrived.In the end, however, the feeling of reward isn't good enough. The moral lessons aren't strong enough. You are moved, you feel for the characters, but something's lacking from an otherwise great movie. One of the better movies about racism since American History X, not that says too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breakthrough of director Marc Forster, who directed "Finding Neverland" three years after he did this "Monster's Ball". I'm not going to tell much about the story here, because the people who saw the movie, know the story and the others will find out when they see this movie. Because "Monster's Ball" is certainly worth your time. Don't expect to get a typical Hollywood-drama about racism, family values and romance, because you might be disappointed afterwards. Expect something to think about, to feel with the characters. Prepare to be moved, because you will. The story is compelling and heartbreaking, it's moving and chocking.Something more about the performance. I'll be honest. I'm not Billy Bob Thornton's biggest fan. I like him, but I don't see him as an impressive actor. That's why I think he didn't deserve his Academy Award Nomination for "Sling Blade" either. But in "Monster's Ball" he was amazing! An intense and sober, but yet very powerful performance. Personally, I think he was the star of the movie. Halle Berry was great as well, but it's hard to believe that this was the best female performance of 2001. Anyway, it doesn't matter. They were both great, although Thornton's performance was highly underrated.I really look forward to see more of Forster's movies, especially "Finding Neverland". It think his new movie will be great too. I think "Finding Neverland" will be a more conventional Hollywood-drama, but that doens't matter. It will be great anyway. "Monster's Ball" is a compelling and intense drama, which combines several difficult subjects. 8,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting but a Teetering Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, like Mystic River, had some of the best acting I have seen as of late. But also like Mystic River, the ending felt a bit far-fetched or shaky. The teetering premise behind the film revolves around how the death of a son can change a person.Billy Bob Thorton plays Hank Grotowski. His father is a bigot and his son (played by Heath Ledger) is a confused young man whose desperate attempts to make his father proud always fall short. The son commits suicide during an altercation he has with his father. This event, while deniably so at first, creates a change in Thorton's character that alters his life. He soon begins a romance with Halle Berry that challenges and confronts his dictated way of life. But the common bond they share in losing a son brings them both together and gives them something to lean on.I don't wish to give the movie away for those who haven't seen it because it is a good film. But I must warn you that the sex scenes are a bit gratuitous and display some of the most explicit and intense material I have seen in mainstream cinema. I have to admit though, it is easy to see how one of those scenes deserved Halle Berry the award for best actress. Director Marc Forster does a good job in using subtlety and unspoken understanding, especially at the end. Billy Bob Thorton gives a tremendous performance with the transformation of a cruel and reclusive guy into a person deserving of admiration. While the idea that losing a child can alter a person and change beliefs they were brought up by, is a bit of a stretch, it still makes for a good ending and movie in general. 7/10</fullReview>

So much so, that I had to keep turning the volume up or freezing a scene and going back, something I've never done before. The dialogue by and large is performed in monosyllables. Halle Berry is - uhm - how can I put this? The best way is to say I really don't know why she got the award. She certainly does not do emotion well and for a film that sets out to portray emotion - not a good start! It's only saving grace for me was the fact that it is beautifully shot with stunning photography But I realise I am probably on my own here. Remember the story of the Emperor's New Clothes and you don't have to like something just because everyone tells you how marvellous it is If you want to see a film that portrays loss grief and emotion rent 'In the Bedroom' - it is far superior to this self-indulgent narcissistic piece of Oscar award P.R.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I tried very hard to find some good point in this film, but I really couldnt. Hollywood anti-art propaganda works hard in transforming such a low-life-meaningless characters into important pieces of American culture. What culture? If movies like this receive constantly all kinds of awards, that means that even people who do know something about movies consider miserable projects like this an art? That only means one thing: almost none of american critics really have no idea what art really is. They probably never seen master-pieces like Tarkovskys STALKER, Ingmar Bergmans FANNY &amp; ALEXANDER, Fellinis AMARCORD, Fassbinders BERLIN ALEXANDERPLATZ, Rennaiss HIROSHIMA,MON AMOUR, etc. But if they did, they probably think that those are just some boring meaningless European films. Of course they think that, but thats just because they dont know any better. It is a real shock to see some true artist like David Lynch receiving full attention in pulp factory called Hollywood. But you realize that they can percept art only if they transform it in some kind of game. For example: the viewer that guessed what "MULLHOLLAND DRIVE" is all about will receive award. So, its a quiz game, right? You just wonder how low they can go? But lets get back to actual movie, which means MONSTERS BALL. First twenty minutes even showed some character development and then it all crashed. I have no idea why did Halle Berry won an Oscar for this. I think all you have to do is to cry an ocean of tears and look like you have some "problems" on your mind and thats it. One advice: please stop carring about an Oscar, cause its useless ceremony and got nothing to do with promoting 7th art called cinema. Otherwise how could more than mediocre pictures like The Beautiful Mind, An American Beauty, Gladiator, Shakespeare in Love win all the best prices. This is all laughable. Why would anyone care about such miserable characters presented in MONSTERS BALL, if they not represent anything? This is not true social drama (and director Forster is not Mike Leigh or Ken Loach). This is just a Hollywood scenography for a lot of tears and ordinary peoples tragedy, which means winning an Oscar for "best performances". Ridicolous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is the prison guard in charge of the executions. His son Sonny Grotowski (Heath Ledger) works with him but vomits while escorting Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs) on his final walk. Hank is angry and confronts Sonny. Sonny kills himself. Hank decides to leave the prison and ends up dating Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry) who is the wife of the executed Lawrence. He has to deal with conflicted feelings especially those handed down by his racist father Buck Grotowski (Peter Boyle).This movie is filled with great performances. Even Sean Combs delivers a workable performance. Ledger has a short and tough role. Halle Berry has one scene that is shockingly haunting. Her berating her chubby son is unforgettable. All of it is held together by Billy Bob.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too weird and pathetic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just caught the last half of this movie and then read about the beginning. The underlying emotions and behavior were just too weird. On one level, the characters seemed to be portraying "real" ordinary folks going through some tough challenges. But, in the end, everything just came across as very strange. After I read about the first half, I was glad I hadn't seen it. It's just horrible and then to see how the main character had some how magically changed into a different person was just too WEIRD!!! As in not likely to have happened. Real people, whose characters make sense, would not have gone through all this in these ways. Many people do and can change their attitudes as they age and encounter new experiences, but it's a slow and unpredictable process. The only thing slow here was the pace of the movie and pace of the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to the film's official synopsis, "'Monster's Ball' is a hard hitting southern drama tempered by a story of powerful, life changing love. It is the story of Hank (Billy Bob Thornton), an embittered prison guard working on Death Row who begins an unlikely, but emotionally charged affair with Leticia (Halle Berry) the wife of a man under his watch on the Row." There are lovely performances by Mr. Thornton and Ms. Berry, with the latter winning several "Best Actress" awards.Director Marc Forster and cinematographer and Roberto Schaefer beautifully frame the movie screen, and avoid the temptation to shake the camera too wildly, for dramatic effect. You'll expect the film to be about Dixie-fried racism, but it's really more of a romance between two individuals with a lot in common - especially difficult relationships with sacrificial lamb sons, heartbreakingly portrayed by Heath Ledger (as Sonny Grotowski) and Coronji Calhoun (as Tyrell Musgrove).Thornton, firing a rifle to scare two "porch monkeys" off his property, is racist in the shadow of his dying father, played by veteran Peter Boyle. As the story's intrinsic villain, Mr. Boyle is courageously effective. The prerequisite "rapper to actor" roles are nicely filled by Sean Combs and Mos Def. The stars' rough sex scene is overrated. But, each character, created by writers Milo Addica and Will Rokos, was easy to understand; never was too much information given, and nothing more was needed.******** Monster's Ball (11/11/01) Marc Forster ~ Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry, Heath Ledger, Peter Boyle</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful low-budget drama with strong race message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another anti-racist movie from the deep South, in this case small-town Georgia, where black chain-gangs still labour in the fields under the eye of armed prison guards on horses. The tag-line for this movie is "A lifetime of change can happen in a single moment", and indeed we are asked to believe that a dyed-in-the-wool racist can overnight transform into a gentle soul ready to get along with everyone.Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) is such a racist that he fires off his shotgun (twice) to scare a black neighbour's kids off his property, and badly beats up his own son (Heath Ledger) when he understandably breaks down and vomits while escorting a cop-killer to the electric chair. In a hate-filled encounter, his son meets his death before his eyes. This is supposed to open Hank up to the feelings of others, enabling his relationship with the electrocuted man's dark-skinned widow Leticia (Halle Berry). In fact, this is the weakest link in the film, as well as the central motivational driver, and we have to hold director Marc Forster responsible for not examining Hank's feelings better. Instead, Hank remains inscrutable during the transition.It is a surprisingly explicit sex scene between Hank and Leticia that is the trigger. Grieving and drunk, Leticia pulls out a mammary and thrusts it into Hank's hand. They tussle for several screen minutes, thereby perhaps tending to reinforce an old sexual stereotype of the Afro-woman as peculiarly highly-sexed --- an offensive overtone that the director apparently missed. Moreover, in the morning, Leticia is glowing and contented, instead of wretched and guilt-ridden.However, the ending (which I shall not reveal) requires Leticia to achieve her own emotional breakthrough, and this is nicely handled in a wordless way that lets the audience go along with her realisation.The "chill" musical score, by three composers working together in a digital studio, packs its own punch, and the bass line nearly blew out our speakers at one point, so be warned!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers* Racist prison corrections officer Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) oversees the execution of Lawrence Musgrove (an African American) and then, through a chance meeting, falls in with Musgrove's wife Leticia (Halle Berry). The more that I have thought about this film the less I like it. There are too many coincidences and improbabilities - the unlikely encounter between Hank and Leticia was a little hard to digest, but then we are asked to accept the suicide of Hank's son (in an implausible scene), the death of Liticia's son, which is there primarily as a plot device to get Hank and Leticia together, and the ultimate union of Hank and Letitia. And there are Lawrence's drawings through which Hank and Leticia individually discover the prior link between them - another phony plot device. All of this seems to come from a screenwriter's imagination rather than real events.So many scenes did not ring true for me, like Hank running the black kids off his yard with a shotgun. Knowning what a racist Hank was, these kids would long ago have known not to come near his yard.The initial scenes of Lawrence's death in the electric chair are indeed realistic and harrowing. But I have seen enough of such scenes (starting with the 1958, "I Want to Live!") so that one more is one more than I need or desire to see.Billy Bob Thornton is good at playing Billy Bob Thornton, which he does here without breaking a sweat. I am not as impressed with Halle Berry's performance as are others, including the AMPAS. She was good in some scenes and great in others (like the final scene), but sometimes weak elsewhere. She played the part of an intoxicated woman like she thought such a woman would behave rather than what would seem real, but this could have been the director's call. Heath Ledger's brief appearance convinces one of what was lost when he died. The real standout performance was Peter Boyle as Hank's father. It would take courage to play such a disgusting super racist so convincingly.It was important for us to know that Hank and Leticia were having sexual relations, but was it necessary to be so explicit? And if explicit was necessary, was there a need for more than one such scene? What purpose did that serve beyond titillation? I felt manipulated rather than involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtlety is Strength</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I really liked about Monster's Ball is it's subtlety. Almost everything about it is subtle. The screenplay relies on subtle hints. The humour in it is subtle (e.g. the scene where after throwing up in her bathroom, Billy Bob tells Halle that him being sick was not her fault). The performance relies on the subtle non-verbal behaviour of the actors. The background score is used to a minimum. Even the settings and props are underused. Because of the subtlety, the director manages to tell the story beautifully. However, the only unsubtle part of the movie was the sex scene. I thought it was a little overdone. People were talking more about the scene than the movie itself.Performances are outstanding. Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry share a wonderful on-screen chemistry and they convey their pain with non-verbal expressions delivering excellent performances. Peter Boyle brilliantly makes his character hateful and pitiable at the same time. Caronji Calhone and Heath Ledger leave a mark with their brief appearances.Those who have been avoiding this movie, I advise them to give it a chance. It's certainly worth a watch and something you can easily relate to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long trip. From a graphic insight into state sanctioned murder to the depths of despair and failure and somehow things are going to be all right.One movie that can't do much for the Georgia Board of Tourism. Georgia where everything is peachy and a bowl of synthetic chocolate ice cream should be eaten with a plastic spoon.The movie's upbeat but more can't be said for fear of ruining it for those who haven't seen it. Hats off once again to dear old Thomas Edison who invented the electric chair as a way of scaring people out of using the alternating current his competitor Westinghouse were marketing. Gee that worked really well.One movie that can't do much for the US Board of Tourism either. Capital punishment - in effect a kind of systematic genocide if one is to believe all the reports. Lovely stuff.You can't get much lower than this and yet the two protagonists somehow deal with their situations, bond together, and decide they're going to come out all right.Is it good? Is it a great movie? Hard to say. Were there Oscar performances here? Without Oscar material the answer has to be 'no'. Were they good? Oh yes they were good. The camera work was at times silly and sophomoric and if you're thinking of watching this one for the sex scenes - get a grip and get a life. So they had sex - so what? Even the editing for the sex scenes was ramshackle.And the movie sort of ruins your appetite for chocolate ice cream and any thoughts you might have had to visit the peachy state or the US too for that matter. You feel fortunate to make it to the closing credits and still feel we're going to be all right.</fullReview>

Financial failure, dysfunctional children, the state lowering itself to the barbarity it is said to remedy, dehumanizing the human beings who are the cogs in the machine - a sickening poison that needs to be eradicated from this society!So many of the moral, Christian people commenting on the movie had their feathers ruffled by the sex scenes with absolutely no comment on state sanctioned, politically motivated murder. You "moral" people, check yourselves!A sublime, beautiful movie, not what I was expecting. The psychological truths in this movie are rendered in a credible way - Ms. Berry's depiction of the mother's grief had me crying too - very empathetic, coming from a real place. All actors did a splendid job; I have met the Peter Boyle character, Def, superb, Combs, splendid - I just can't say enough. The only character I had a bit of a problem with was the mother's little boy, though I have met him too.I think there is a lot of sublimated and overt race rage in the critiques I have read on this blog and elsewhere, from both sides of the racial divide. I pray you all work it out and feel better soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Racism is a theme, not the main theme. Loneliness and the human need to love and be loved is the ultimate exclamation point. Racism is a legacy that Hank has to come to terms with. But this is an interior struggle and not the only one he has to contend with. His son's death is the immediate tragedy. Instead of grand scenes of torment, calm actions signal Hank's inner upheavals (quitting his job, buying a business) and indicate that he is going through a transition.Letitia's unrelenting crises arise naturally as they do in life when one diaster follows another. It was engrossing to watch each unfold, and how Letitia responds to them. She represented every woman who soldiers on no matter how difficult things get.The raw sex scene, I think, is misunderstood. Hank's transition (from coldly methodical 'racist' guard at the start of the film) is nearly complete by the time they have sex. He was on a journey to regain his humanity. Connecting with Letitia unlocked buried emotions. Letitia has demonstrated her independence by surviving 11 years as a single parent. Yet, by the time she invites Hank into her home, she is a widow and has buried a child, she needs someone to care, even briefly. Alcohol was a convenient catalyst, but the outcome wasn't something either Letitia or Hank expected.In taking time to let events unfold, the writer and director allowed their audience to connect with the main characters. These two people needed each other--but not a relationship of equals. More than Letitia realized, Hank understood that he needed her in his life, and he would do whatever he had to in order to hold onto her (sending his father away). Without a single word of purple prose, or an "I love you." Hank's devotion was a clear as a billboard.To the end, Letitia remained conflicted, and in mourning. That conflict played across Berry's face despite Thornton's tenderness.If the ending was ambivalent, the stars symbolized the endurance of hope and the promise of a future. There were fine performances from everyone involved. This was a thoughtful and emotionally involving film and a refreshing take on the love story genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gut-wrenching emotional rollercoaster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor spoilers.Monster's Ball tells the tale of two very fragile and needy people who come together under the saddest of circumstances.Berry's character Leticia gives Thornton's Hank someone to love and take care of, someone to 'redeem himself' with, and this fulfills her very great need to be loved and taken care of. The film treats the very powerful subject matters of racism and the death penalty in a mature and 'non-Hollywood' way. I think that if this had been your mainstream Hollywood movie, then the film would have hinged on the moment that Leticia found out that Hank had taken part in her husband's execution. And this film left that moment until right at the end, and then treat it in a very 'grown-up' way.Thornton's performance as Hank, the prison guard who goes from racist to human being, spurred by his son's suicide, is powerful. But Halle Berry steals the film with her portrayal of Leticia. Her range is tremendous, and the fact that many of the most powerful scenes must have been shot in only one take makes her performance more outstanding.I must say, though, that I thought one of best-acted scenes was Heath Ledger's scene when all alone in the prison bathroom. His face managed to show all of the pain and emotions running through Sonny's mind in that instant.Oh, and I thought it a nice touch that the Hank's horrible racist father was to end his days in a nursing home run by black people...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I liked from this film is the way it shows the changes a person may have in his life. From being a terrible racist and a person with low level of tolerance, the man of the film, Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) felt in love with a nice young black woman (Halle Berry), and this compelled him to think and to see his life differently. The scenes of the execution of a black man in the electric chair and before it there were really cruel and very close to the reality. It also had scenes of sex, which also were very near to be considered real. In sexual scenes, in particular, Halle Berry showed herself as well as any experienced actress. The end of the film is as it should be. We have sometime to accept facts, which we do not like at all, but life does never goes in one way, and that's what the final part of the film shows us. I consider better to comment on parts of the film instead of telling the story. The film is in general very good, it seems to go slowly but showing each time the facts and unexpected coincidences.</fullReview>

It also gives new meaning to the word gross but I'll get into that in a minute. Masterful acting by all involved. Peter Boyle, Heath Ledger, Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton. Even Sean "P.

Lots of shots of the beautiful Ms. Berry's body. Lots of shots of the not so beautiful Billy Bob. She really deserved that Oscar let me tell ya. Talk about taking one for the team. I wonder if to keep the mood light Billy lapsed into his Slingblade character. "Halle you smell just like fried taters mmm hmmm."

		<fullReview>In Hong Kong, the movie falls into category III: symbol of violence and sex, 18 under should not be admitted. Well, if it is not for the sex scene, MB should be labeled IIB only. (Frankly speaking, the VCD shop was on sale and it only cost US$1.4 a copy, what more can you ask for, right?) Why are people so alarmed about the lengthy sex scene of this movie? It's not a porno, it's a film about communication and understanding. Some still find the scene titillating or unnecessary, but if you watch it with cerebrum but not hormone, you can see the beauty of human kindness.Hank at first did a doggie with Leticia like what he always does to the blonde call-girl. When she turned her head to look at him, swiftly he moved her to face himself and practiced missionary, a position that the two can see each other face to face and hugs are involved. Hugging is a sign of acceptance and care. While Hank was coming to end, Leticia did her ride on Hank, and both fell onto the floor. Her act somehow was a resonance to Hank's feeling. I especially like the last shot that Hank said something like, 'I got it, I've never got that feeling before.'They were a wounded couple communicating with each other, comforting each other's souls and soothing the pain of their loss. Their sexual encounter is a metamorphosis from sadness to relief and release. Fantastically, the no background music treatment of the scene confesses the sheer, mere emotions without the smug musical seasoning. Billy and Halle just wonderfully exhibited the physical nudity as well as the emotional nakedness of two hurtful beings.The inserts of a hand prodding inside the birdcage (metaphor of imprisonment), trying to free the confined souls (the bird), to release the pain, the hurts, though is appropriate, with good from, but unsatisfactorily interpreted. If it was not a hand probing inside the birdcage but a hand opening it while the bird was fanatically flying or banging around the cage, grasping every chance to escape, that would be far better.It is altogether a power scene, necessary and warm. Hormonal drive may turn your horniness on when you see this few minutes, but cerebral vitality may touch the untouched of your heart. Well, again, it's a matter of sense and sensibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***Monster's Ball is not a total waste of a movie. I thought the characters, plot, and theme were there, but I have some problems with it.Monster's Ball is a good movie that tries to be like real life, and you have to give it credit for that. These are working class people with real problems. Scenes with Billy Bob doing mundane tasks like painting his house or driving in his car are realistic touches that point out the routine nature of real life, but the scenes also often make the film feel slow and boring. Also, melodramatic moments take away some of that realness.A lot of details seem to be missing, too. Was Halle Berry's husband innocent? What was his crime? It's never explained. In the first of the movie, Berry is clearly not in love with her husband, but later on she seems to still love him. Also, what happened to Billy Bob Thorton's first wife? And, of course, the ending--do Berry and Thorton ever resolve that he was the prison guard who executed her husband? The music seems to suggest that something tragic is going to happen. The ending is left up to the viewer--for good or bad--but it's very unsatisfying to the viewer even for a movie that aims to have a cryptic ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At its end I felt that the movie was some white man's (Addica, Roccos) wet dream. Soft porn with poorly fleshed out characters and a comical pre-sex scene (Berry wasn't just drinking for her character, but to numb herself for the following sex act). And how insulting to murder (execute) a woman's husband and then take the spoils too? How criminal can the writers be. The racist undercurrent here is deep...don't miss it.Hollywood consistently delivers movies that reflect the margins of Black life and character. With the exception of Mos Def's character, everyone in this film is humble, tragic and passive...almost straight out of some Jim Crow era minstrel show.And how is it that a life-long racist, becomes soft and enlightened in one change of scene? Insulting.Too little explanation, poor acting on the part of most characters, and an unrealistic, vacuum-like setting (in a small town in Louisiana, all of the black people, including Ms. Musgrove, would know who the prison guards at the state penitentiary are, especially since most of the folks on any death row are black. The characters are a bit too insulated in this little town where its likely that everyone knows your name.)Halle Berry got an oscar for fulfilling the boards fantasies about her body. I wish she had received it for her acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An actors' film, no question but IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT it ain't!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Bob, back in familiar territory - Karl Childers cannot be too far out of camera range here - is undeniably passionate about his work. Here, as mega-racist Correctional Chief Hank Grotowski he hands us the image of a sad, embittered and tragic man, doubtless racially corrupted by his bed-ridden father (Boyle) also a retired prison officer. His son Sonny (extremely well played by Ledger) was condemned by his birthright to know less happiness than Sonny Liston. So starved of affection and respect by his father, he performs a highly unexpected act way too early in the film....and we're talking of a flick that "seems" to run close to twelve hours! After Grotowski walks his own little GREEN MILE one more time to fry (literally) Sean "Puffy" Combs, he leaves, unbeknowns to him at that stage, the deadbeat's Afro-American wife and grossly overweight son bereft of a husband and father respectively. Played inarguably brilliantly by Halle Berry she continues to ply her trade at the local diner where Grotowski, a regular, spoons down his blatantly obvious racially symbolic bowl of chocolate ice-cream. It's THAT sort of film. Undeniably Oscar-striving as everyone is, where the flick comes totally unstuck is in the carefully layered depression and the implausibility of Thornton's character having a total lightning-bolt type makeover, where he sees the error of his ways (much like Scrooge) and becomes Mr Nice Guy. It don't gel!You have to give recognition where recognition's due though! THAT scene where Thornton and a panting Miss Berry get it on, following a close encounter with a glass or three of "JD" is nothing short of awesome. You gotta ask yourself was that simulated sex or "stimulated?" Ledger wasn't too far behind (forgive the pun) either with his brief moment of sexual indulgence.Excellent as the film ultimately appears however, it has a curious veneer to it. "Don't look too closely - you might see the shading" seems to be the message.In terms of racial prejudice, powerhouse performances and true southern inhospitality though, this ultimately cannot hold a candle to Steiger's IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unhappy characters in a powerful drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers: `Monster's Ball' is about racism. Sonny is a person who's respectful toward black people; but his father (played by Billy Bob Thorton) hates them as much as you can imagine. His son is sad and frustrated because of his father's behavior. On the other hand, we see Halle Berry's character with her fat child. She's also frustrated and wants the best for her child, and she sometimes beats him because he keeps on eating snacks.The quarrel between the father and the son is somewhat disturbing and unpredictable (I never thought Sonny would shoot himself with the gun he had to kill his father). This was a heart-wrenching scene. He commits suicide just after his father tells him he hates him with his whole being. It was also very unpredictable that the fat kid would get run over by a car causing his death. After the two main characters of this story lose their family, they meet in the restaurant where Leticia works and become friends. Then they become more than that. After the tragic events Bob doesn't hate black people and wants to go out with Leticia, but finally his father finds out about it and strife between Bob and Leticia is carried out. Then they make up, and while alone in their bedroom Leticia sees a portrait that her former husband made. She's scared at first, but she finally laughs and realizes along with Bob that life has to go on! There are some scenes that could offend people such as the son having a sex scene with a woman at the beginning and also some profanity. The Swiss director Marc Foster has made a joyless, harsh film full of blood, sweat, and tears that concerns characters who have never been happy and probably never shall be. The characters of `Monster's Ball' are unhappy, they all live daily in pain, racism, anger, despair, solitude, misery and death. These characters are miserable; they don't know what happiness means. And when they know it's near them, they are not capable of identifying, accepting, enjoying or sharing it.  The main character is named Hank Grotowsky and he works in a Georgia town as a sergeant who takes care of condemned prisoners. One of these is a black man, condemned for the murder of a policeman. He's been 11 years in jail waiting for good news and every week he's visited by his wife and his child who is terribly fat and addicted to candies. He paints as well as his father does. Grotowsky is lonely and joyless. He never smiles, he never jokes or takes vacation, or practices sports. His only entertainment is to eat a chocolate ice cream with a little plastic spoon after having some soup. He lives with his invalid father who was also a sergeant; his father is as racist and intolerant as he is. Plus, a child who follows his steps, hating black people whom they shoot at to drive them off their property. To Grotowsky the execution of a black man in the electric chair is a normal act which he calls a `Monster's Ball,' a ball that doesn't admit the participation of others. This man is very miserable. His mother committed suicide, and his wife has left him. He hates his father because he made him a bitter person and he can't stand to take care of him. Over the course of the story we see him having his father admitted to an asylum. He hates his own son, because he reminds him of his wife, and in one of the saddest and wildest scenes, he beats him in front of his partners and when he tries to attack him in his house, he beats him, insults him and threats him with a gun. Leticia is also unhappy because she can't afford anything, and is a waitress in a restaurant. She's always watching TV for a long time smoking, and drinking half-naked because of the hot weather, while her husband is being executed and the son is eating a lot of candies behind her back.In this primitive atmosphere, where black people are hated, the viewer feels moved by the many tragic events that happen to the characters and the way innocent people die violently. The two characters recognize each other while suffering, because death is also manifested in the agony of sex and the characters of Thornton and Berry have one of the most unpredictable, exciting and violent love scenes on a sofa in all positions. At first the Swiss director didn't want to cast Berry as the main character of this story, because she was too beautiful and not so dark; however, he finally accepted her for the role and he's achieved a sad, and joyless movie, that shows that the characters can't be happy, not even with the ambiguous ending in which they apparently seem to be, since sex has achieved the miracle of putting a smile on their faces. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good low-budget flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was uncertain about renting this at first (due to Halle Berry's Oscar acceptance speech) but the fact that Billy Bob Thornton and Heath Ledger were main characters persuaded me to go with it (plus a quote from Roger Ebert saying "best movie of the year" on the cover). Monster's Ball is original and tells an interesting enough story well, I thought maybe best supporting actress would have been a more appropriate award for Halle Berry's effort in this film.It makes you think about the nature of a progressive western country like the Unites States sending people to their deaths, their lives ending in a series of holding cells and eventually a hospital-like room, containing an electric chair in this case. And about how people's lives go on no matter what's just recently happened, good or bad, who disappeared in their lives, or what they did for a living (death row guard in Hanks case).It's interesting to see how the worlds of Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and Leticia (Halle Berry) mix once they meet up and *possible spoiler* the ending, although inconclusive offers a positive outlook of letting bygones be bygones.</fullReview>

I found myself pausing the DVD andconfirming anachronisms, such as the new-style 20-dollar bill that Berryreceived for her ring. Spoiler ahead ... probably the thing that amazed me most about this dark movie was the ending. I was awaiting a final tragedy and wassurprised that everyone apparently lives happily ever after. Peter Boylerecreated a Southern-style role from his character Joe in the movie of the same name. Boyle and Billy Bob Thorton complemented the fine performancedelivered by Berry.

		<fullReview>As usual, the hype and ballyhoo of Hollywood cons us into watching pictures we would normally do without. I got taken in by Berry's Academy Award, and wanted to see a performance that would show me why she was selected. &lt;p&gt;Well, let me tell you why she was selected. It had nothing to do with a major performance in a motion picture. She got the award because years ago the academy nominated Dorothy Dandridge for a great role in "Carmen Jones". Guess who won the award that year? Grace Kelly, for "The Country Girl", a movie in which she did a lot of standing around while delivering no emotion whatsoever. They weren't ready to give the top prize to a black actress. &lt;p&gt;The very same thing happened with John Wayne, when they realized his star power, they gave him the award for "True Grit", hardly a "moving" performance. It was just that he was "due". That's what happened here. There was a lot of pressure to honor a black actress. Halle clearly did not deliver one of the strongest female roles of the past year by a long shot.&lt;p&gt;When you watch this mess, and you will, see if you can spot "greatness" in any sense of the word. In some scenes, she is downright ridiculous in her line delivery.&lt;p&gt;I never thought I'd see the day that Billy Bob was the best part of any motion picture, but there it is. Let's hope you really enjoy your movie snack when you watch this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots has been said about this film, so I won't recount it all.I just want to say what the fatal flaw was in this film that kept me from engaging it as the masterpiece it's supposed to be. that flaw is the lack of convincing change in Hank's character. A film like this is far more deep and nuanced than most Hollywood nonsense, so I would expect it to work harder at character development. That's all this film is: character development. So where is it? If the instant change was intended, it was a big risk, and I think it failed. If we're just supposed to infer or understand the change in the character because of the tragic preceding events, then OK, what's the movie about then? I don't complain about lack of plot when there's something deeper there. This tried to be that movie, with something deeper. But without demonstrating the development, I'm left wondering why I should care about this character at all. Oh yeah, and Halley Berry was great. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still think Nicole Kidman should have won the oscar for Moulin Rouge in 2001. I thought the scenes with Halle yelling insults at her overweight son were very good. One negative for Halle is she really didn't seem drunk in that one scene. And I thought it seemed like she was auditioning with Billy Bob for a porn movie. The sex scene is just too over-the-top for a mainstream film. Also, just because Halle doesn't wear makeup, it doesn't make her back woods trailor trash. She still looks beautiful, not like some poor waitress who doesn't have much going on in life.The plot was good, although it could have been a little shorter. All the actors are good in this, except Heath Ledger's accent was an awful attempt for a southern drawl.FINAL VERDICT: If you can get over the gratitious sex scene, then this is a good film.</fullReview>

When I viewed the movie I was a little confused, probably because of the "pornographic" sex scene between Halle Berry and Billy Bob which just looses your train of thought. But when the movie was over and I thought of it I figured out the whole point of the movie.The point: These two people are SO messed up that the only pleasure they get from each other is sex. And when Halle discovers that Billy Bob was one of the officers at death row when her husband got killed. She didn't bother to say anything because basically she and him had nothing to loose or didn't want to loose the amazing sex. So the film just ended with them sitting in the porch eating chocolate ice cream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of Transformation and the Reason for Optimism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its difficult to label this movie as good or bad. Some parts worked for us and some maybe not. We enjoyed the performances of Halle, Billy Bob, Peter Boyle and Heath. The story took a long time to develop. Up to the time Leticia met Hank, one wondered yawningly what was the point of everything that had slowly unfolded thus far.**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**Then our interest was aroused with the development of a relationship (finally) in the movie. Up to this point there was only destruction and avoidance of relationships between people. The mumbling of Billy Bob and a few other actors and the lack of subtitles on the DVD made it very difficult to fathom what was going verbally on especially in the opening 3/4 hour. Consequently we missed the point of what the "Monsters Ball" was. I'd be grateful if someone could explain it to us.I thoroughly enjoyed the sex scene as a highly erotic one particularly on Leticia's part and a suitably stilted attempt from Hank. His performance was as limited, loveless and mechanical as his experience allowed - with prostitutes. I found the transformation of his performance in this scene as Leticia gave him the opportunity to express himself through sex, very stimulating and real. We were not embarrassed by the scene at all and watched it with our 13-year old daughter and 17-year old son. It was a statement of sex transformed into making love, a good lesson for us all.The other transformation of Hank from would-be racist to lover of a black woman in a seemingly short time asked a lot from the audience, though I know it to be possible. particularly if you consider that Hank may not have been a true racist and rather only stirred up by his father.The rest of the movie was fine and engrossing and it ended appropriately, I thought. I'm glad I saw it.If you can endure the slow build-up its worth watching as an example of transformation and the reason for optimism. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie was 25 years past due. Cheers to Billy Bob and Berry for the great performances. This movie is about a back woods oaf with no sense of permanence, his less than loved son, and his right out and openly abusive father. This movie does have some violent and permanent scenes. The grandfather is openly abusive to Berry, his son and grandson. The father (Thorton) is emotionally abusive to himself and Berry. There is an unexpected twist from Thorton's son pretty early on in the film. This film is a deep look at family sociology and tragedy. Perhaps someone who saw this film thought twice before they told a family member they didn't love them. I give this film an 8 out of 10 for concept and a 7 out of ten for finished product. The acting was fantastic and heart felt. The sex scene on the couch is close to the MPAA rating. It's worth renting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A "monsters' ball" it is; note the position of the apostrophe. Actually it's more like a catalogue of bad parents, and if "honesty" and "rawness" amounts to having the same nasty traits demonstrated in exactly the same unimaginative way again and again, then, yeah, whatever, I guess this is honest and raw. But you did notice, didn't you, that this is essentially a made-for-TV movie? That there might as well be ad breaks? That ad breaks would probably even help, given the way the film's segments dissociate from one another - for instance, the way we're never sure whether or not Leticia has guessed that Hank was one of her husband's executioners, until she "dramatically" finds out that he was - and then nothing comes of the moment, anyway. Insert ad breaks before and after that scene and it makes a good deal more sense. And you did also notice, didn't you, how unremarkable and uncharged all the images are? You might as well lop the ends off to fit them on a TV screen; it makes no difference. Something's wrong when something this ordinary gets noticed at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many coincidences, not enough character development.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******SPOILERS****** What makes an independent film good more times than not is the story, then the characters. You have to believe in the story to truly enjoy the film. I have no problem suspending belief for movies like, Signs, and XXX, but Monster's Ball is supposed to be a character driven film revolving around the realities of every day life. But they would have us believe that all within a week's time 1) Leticia, the female lead's (Halle Berry) cop-killing husband is executed in an electric chair by the male lead, Hank, (Billy Bob Thornton), 2) Hank's son (Heath Ledger) who works as a prison guard with Hank shoots himself over not being treated nice by his father, 3) Leticia loses a waitressing job and gets a new one at Hank's favorite diner, 4) Hank resigns from the prison just before meeting Leticia for the first time at the diner, 5) Leticia's 11 year old son is the victim of a hit and run and dies but not before 6) Hank drives by and sees her and the son on the side of the road after the accident and drives them both to the hospital. As though that's not implausible enough, Leticia is black and Hank is raised to be a racist by his cracker, father (Peter Boyle) who is retired prison guard himself but now an invalid. Naturally, they fall in love after a night of needy sex and now we're supposed to be kept in suspense to see when Leticia finds out about Hank's racist upbringing and that he was the one who executed her husband. On a scale of 1 to 10 on the eye-rolling meter, this movie's a 12. Wouldn't it have been more natural for Leticia to know Hank and the son through visiting her husband at the prison. Then you wouldn't need to have all of the coincidences, and they still could have the racism issue. IMHO I think the the two sons that die were more interesting characters than the two leads and I kept wishing they were alive to see how they would react to their parent's relationship. The fact that both of these character's are killed off tells me that the screenwriters Addica and Rokos, wanted them out of the way so as to not complicate the story. On a final note, as I watched the movie I couldn't believe the amount of praise it's received from the critics. I think it must be that they feel obligated to look favorable on the film because of the subject matter, and that's too bad. And while I thought Berry's acting was servicable, I found that it paled in comparison to Sissy Spacek's performance in 'In the Bedroom' as a mother dealing with the death of a child. Obviously, the Academy had an agenda with last years awards, probably in light of 9/11.</fullReview>

It's high school psychology letting Halle Berry (who's performance is good but not the best of last year) fall in love in that way and be comforted immediately after her son's death.Billy Bob Thornton is sensational however and its not his fault that the script lets his racism just fall off because of what he goes through. Thornton turns up to be one of the best American actors right now.

The story of a white ex-jailer and executioner, and the black wife of one of his 'victims', in which both lose almost everything and everybody around, and fall one into the arms of another due to a Hollywood-made twist does not succeed to be either true or really emotional.The social atmosphere is quite well caught. Acting is decent, Hally Berry is beautiful, looks too young for the role, acts fairly as the rest. Why an Oscar? That is to the Academy to answer.What saves the film is the end. I expected a melodramatic and false end, as the rest. I was surprised by the low tome and very true ending, which says more in my opinion about the characters, and maybe even about racial relations in America than the whole rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is one of those films that is purposely quiet, so that the actors can really step to the forefront. Billy Bob Thorton does this much better, in my opinion, than does Halle Berry. When he cuts loose (for example, when he punches out his son in the bathroom), it seems more realistic than the hystrionics of Halle Berry (who gets my award for the worst portrayal of someone who is drunk this year.)The plot seems quite far-fetched, with Billy Bob playing a correctional guard in charge of the execution of P. Diddy, who just happens to be the husband of Halle Berry. The payoff when each person discovers their macabre connection just doesn't work. Billy Bob's initial reaction is almost non-existent, while Halle goes ballistic, and then calms down into some Zen-like trance. I guess the way they played it out was better than having her find out half way through the movie and then have Billy Bob spend the rest of the movie seeking her forgiveness for just doing his job.Finally, I must comment on the steamiest sex scene I have seen in a mainstream film in quite some time. There was some serious bumping and grinding going there! I guess if I were Billy Bob, I would feel the same intensity knowing I was banging the wife of a guy I just fried, and if I were Halle, I would be really hard up after spending the last eleven years with a husband on Death Row and a grossly overweight kid in the house.Rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

But when tragedy strikes, he overcomes his prejudices, after years of hating blacks, and suddenly begins to befriend them and dumps Pop in the nursing home.

		<fullReview>i just didn't get the ending. no spoiler alert here, i dont even know how to spoil it for myself. well, bbt has had some really bad movies since slingblade(which i thought was a great movie) anyway this movie was intense and had some really graphic scenes of tragedy. the son(played by the guy in knight's tale), i thought didnt get enough time in this movie. he is a very good actor and deserves a similar role that places him in a rural setting as this one did. overall this was a good movie, i just didn't get the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing sexploitation film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone really believe that Leticia, the character played by Halle Berry, would throw herself at a white man she hardly knows, a man who's at least 25 years older than she is, a man who lives in the same small town where she does, where Black-white relations are so tense and hateful? (When Leticia's son is in the car "accident," she knows the police are not going to investigate.) This movie is a sexploitation of both Leticia and Halle Berry herself, turning a beautiful, complex, conflicted Black woman into the objectifed, graphically displayed embodiment of the white man's physical and emotional salvation. Aren't people getting tired of this bleak, historically predictable plotline by now? And why does the director need to present the white prostitute as if she isn't even human, as if she doesn't have any feelings about her defilement by countless men like Hank, the character played by Thornton? The entire movie shows Leticia's character and Halle Berry herself being manipulated by the director in the fulfillment of a white man's fantasy of how to save his life by "taking care" of a Black woman, who (in the logic of this dream) can't save herself and isn't ever going to find a Black man who could help her. It's a shame that the first Oscar for Best Actress given to a Black woman had to be for this shallow movie. Why did Hank hate his son, his wife and possibly his own mother? Why did his father rule his life until nearly his dying day? It doesn't matter to the director because Hank isn't meant to do much more than stand in for men who would like to think their cruelties and barbarities can be forgiven without them ever having to do more than become the caretakers of Black women's bodies and dreams == even if they have helped to put these women's husbands on death row. This movie could have been a scathing social commentary on Black-white relations, but the director chose to evade the very issues that are central to the story. The cast is talented, but they can't go far with the script. One last note: with so many negative comments on this movie, why is it getting almost an 8 out of 10 on the imd voting chart?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monster's Ball: A lesson in how to NOT do a contemporary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a great movie is betrayed by its director, as is the case with Monster's Ball. Whilst the performances are superb, even Sean "Puffy" Combs, and the cinematography appropriate and good, they are left behind by the director. The film does an amazing job with presenting its many symbols, comparable to a classical writer, even, but the director seems to have concentrated so much on the abstract, contemporary parts of this film that its essence is forgotten. The script is wondrously stark and realistic, albeit the forgivably unbelievable coincidences. However, these wondrous performances and symbols cloud the movie, so that the entire film seems wholly unnatural. Not necessarily forced, but contrived, as if there was only about three takes done for each scene of acting. By this the huge movements in the plot are entirely unbelievable. I watched this movie and thanked jesus that Requiem for a Dream did not make its heinous mistakes, for this is one of the worst presentations of contemporary art in film that i have ever seen, absolutely forgetting the essence that has always made film so wonderful--the escape by really believing these characters are the ones presented on the screen, ruined by totally unnatural direction. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as advertised.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too much went unexplained and unexamined here. I didn't so much feel sympathy for the characters, as I felt they were two incredibly selfish people who happened to stumble on each other. It was very hard for me to feel forgiveness for Thornton's character after his son's suicide. It was very hard to feel much sympathy for his character, or care about where his life was going. Later in the movie, he admits he was a lousy father, and his son was a good kid. Well, great, but your son is dead, by his own hand, right in front of you. Where are the feelings for that? What is going on emotionally around that? Nothing? Halle Berry's character basically couldn't stand her young, overweight son, and was selfishly lonely with a husband in jail. So, now your son is gone. You're pursuing your own needs, with little feeling for a dead child.I thought the direction was quite good, and understated. The movie had a pace that fit well with the subject matter. The acting was very good, although Halle Berry did not come close to an Oscar-winning performance.I just wish there had been a bit more explored here....I just didn't care what happened to these people. What happiness were they entitled to? Why should I care?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been more powerful, but still a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Monster's Ball" is a slightly overrated film, and I was slightly disappointed, but overall it's an effective drama with great performances. Now, Halle Berry's performance is great, but did she deserve an Oscar? Not exactly. I found Sissy Spacek's performance in "In the Bedroom" to be more subtle and powerful. But I still have to give Halle lots of credit. Her not deserving an Oscar is no way slanderous towards her--winning an Oscar is not about being great, it's being the best. However, Billy Bob Thornton deserved at least a nomination. His performance has so many subtle nuances that I'm surprised the Academy didn't even seem to consider him. I found his performance to be more powerful than Halle's, but that's just my opinion. Peter Boyle is on my list of the best underrated actors, and he totally immerses himself into the character of Billy Bob's racist father. I was also very impressed by Heath Ledger as Billy's neglected son. His Southern accent is perfect and I really got a sense of his pain, despite the fact that he's only in a few scenes. Heath came a long way since "10 Things I Hate About You." He also deserved an Oscar nomination. And rapper Mos Def gives a fine, natural performance and I can tell he got into his character, unlike other rapper-turned-actors...and I will now segue into Sean "P. Diddy" Combs' performance. In a word: miscast. Sean proved he didn't have the acting chops in Jon Favreau's "Made" and he proves it yet again. Why the director decided to cast him, among an array of talented actors--I do not know. He could've cast a Don Cheadle or Denzel Washington, but he decided to go with Sean "Don't-Quit-Your-Day-Job" Combs. He has the intensity of a piece of cardboard, and that was a bad move, being that he was about to get executed, and you want the audience to feel sympathy for the man being executed. I appreciated the subtleties of this film, but at times it's just too low-key for its own good. I wasn't as riveted as I expected to be. I guess the characters could've been more well-defined. We get a great idea of how Billy Bob's character is like, but I think the others could've been more developed more and I wanted to get a better feeling of the relationships involving the supporting characters, aside from the one between Billy Bob and his son which I felt was defined well in a few intimate scenes. I wanted to get a little more insight into Peter Boyle's character, and why he was a racist. ***********POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**********There were a few scenes I found very effective. One was the final argument between Billy Bob and his son. And when the son ends up killing himself, it completely took me by surprise. It wasn't one of those operatic death scenes you often see in films; it had a great sense of realism. Another scene was the one in which Halle Berry and Peter Boyle first meet. You can feel the tension between them, yet he insults her in a subconscious way. In a more heavy-handed film, he--being a racist--would've called her by the "n" word repeatedly and asked her the get the hell out of his house. Instead, he asks her for a cigarette and talks about how he used to have a thing for black women (though those aren't his exact words). The only scene I felt was over-the-top was the sex scene. I know when filmmakers shoot a sex scene, they always come up with a detailed argument as to why it is crucial to the asthetics of the film, but every time I see an explicit sex scene like this I keep thinking back to that scene from "Witness" in which Harrison Ford stares across the room at Kelly McGillis, who's sponge-bathing herself. You can just feel the eroticism between the 2 characters, without them even laying a finger on each other. And when we cut to the next day, you know exactly what happened between them the other night. In "Monster's Ball" we see Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton screwing each other in every possible sexual position. I'm not being hypocritical. Seeing Halle Berry naked is never an unpleasant sight. I just felt it didn't belong in the film. I can't regard "Monster's Ball" as anything close to a bad film, but don't go into watching this movie assuming it's gonna be one of the best films of the year. Maybe it just depends on your point of view. Experiencing a film is a subjective process, and some films just happen to have a better impact on some than others. This simply didn't have a huge" impact on me. My score: 7 (out of 10) </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep South discrepancies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: This review may spoil your enjoyment of the film if you have not seen it.There is clear irony in a sign outside a gas station in ?Monster's Ball' that reads ?Georgia is just peachy.' The Georgia of Marc Forster's bleak and disturbing picture is anything but. It is a desperate and empty place inhabited by desperate and empty people.The story concerns the build up to and aftermath of a state execution. We follow the life of Hank (Billy Bob Thornton), a prejudiced prison officer who is responsible for terminating the life of the condemned man. A potentially tricky but intriguing scenario arises when a tragic coincidence brings him together with Leticia (a sensational Halle Berry), the shattered widow whom the deceased criminal has left behind.It is puzzling that the title indicates just one monster, as the film presents us with many characters who could arguably be labelled so. This is not only on account of their behaviour towards one another, which could often be described as inhuman interaction, but also because of the manner in which Forster chooses to frame them. In one memorable shot the female face is distorted by mirrors, giving it a warped, mutant-like appearance.Indeed many scenes are permeated by weird and wonderful camera angles, which, whilst providing an aesthetic interest, often serve only to alienate the spectator. Forster, it seems, is in no rush to tell his story. Slow camera movements and long zoom-ins and zoom-outs characterise the film, or often a static frame will see people enter and exit the action. Racking focus is also employed frequently so that the viewer's gaze can be directed with the minimal amount of movement.Whilst this is all fairly unexciting stuff, it is perhaps an attempt (and arguably a successful one) to capture the mundanity, boredom and feeling of insignificance that seem to pervade the lives of the film's characters.Alienating, though, is a word that could not be used to describe the film's execution sequence, which arguably emulates the intensity of the equivalent scene in Lars Von Trier's ?Dancer In The Dark'. Never, in my mind, has the point of view shot been used so poignantly as when we see the condemned man's final image of people behind a screen attending his demise. When a hood comes down to obscure his, and our, vision, only his terrified breathing provides the soundtrack to an entirely black screen until electricity is pumped through his body. It is a harrowing, disturbing, but breathtaking moment.This is the high point (or low point, depending on your perspective) of a first act in which an atmosphere of misery successfully prevails. Almost perversely then, it is perhaps the ultimate failure of ?Monster's Ball' that this atmosphere is not maintained. After an absolute bombardment of bleakness, the film does not quite have the guts to carry it through, and instead opts for a tone of optimism and hope that, frankly, is without any real foundation. The tone shifts with the unaccountable change in the attitude of Hank, who, from a bitter, hatred-fuelled racist suddenly becomes a sensitive humanitarian who will happily engage in a sexual relationship with a black woman. Of course, some reasons are implied, but they do not carry a lot of weight. It is a contrived and convenient transformation that only the foolish and na?ve viewer will readily accept.?Monster's Ball' is ultimately a film of extreme contradictions. It is engaging yet alienating, daring yet contrived, bleak yet optimistic; a paradox that is perfectly demonstrated in the film's final scene.As the two star-crossed lovers gaze at the nighttime Georgia sky, the heroic male remarks, ?I think we're gonna be alright.' Straight out of the Hollywood textbook it seems. For all of this ideal optimism, however, ambiguity remains. We are left with an intriguing and unanswerable question: how does this woman feel that her husband's executioner is now her lover?</fullReview>

I sware Billy Bob Thornton never said more than 5 words in a row. I kept waiting for an ending, but it was just not happening in the alloted time. It was very obvious that she was going to find his panting of Billy Bob, but I was waiting for confrontation. I honestly couldnt take another 45 minutes of waiting if the ending was different and she did confront him. I heard about the story and thought it would be a good film, but the plotline summaries do not really serve this movie well. Its built up to be a confrontation between black and white, and between wife/lover and executioner/lover, but nothing ever happened. Complete B.S. that "Memento" or "Made" was not recognized and this was.</fullReview>

The coincidences are just too much, and the predictability in the second half was disappointing. I wanted to care for this deeply sad story, but I just couldn't, because it was so convoluted. The acting overall was very good, but if you want to see Billy Bob at his stoic best, go for "The Man Who Wasn't There". The old guy was great, and Halle Berry's performance succeeded in not really being able to understand what she was thinking, if that was the goal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been about 24 hours since I first saw this movie, and I think I've finally had enough time to fully digest it. Last night I was very confused about my opinion of this film, but a subsequent viewing, along with a little help from the two commentaries on the DVD, have cleared things up a bit.I wanted to like this movie. The effort put forth by all parties involved and the sensitive nature of the plot lead you to really want to like this movie. The problem is that it's just not that good. The camera work was done well, though their desire to not overdo anything sometimes goes too far. And the music is really good, but it was also a bit understated at times.Overall, the whole movie just seemed understated. It's very clear that that's what their goal was, I just don't think that it's appropriate given the story and characters.It's kind of like dating a girl who sings or dances or something, and then realizing that she's not that good the first time you see her perform. You want to be supportive, but you really just can't find anything good to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone awaken a sleeping Billy Bob Thornton and let just one character escape from being a victim!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wouldn't you love to walk a day in Halle Berry's shoes? Not only does her first break-out performance give her an Academy Award, but she finds herself in a role that becomes easy when you consider that she's asked to play a victim and her real-life is all about being the victim. That said, "Monster's Ball" is a film where you think it just can't get any worse for all the characters and over and over again it does. When Leticia is met with tragedy once again, it truly seems unnecessary. This is not to say that the film is not one of the best this year. Puff Daddy proves that he can act (he may have been forced to learn so he could lie during his recent real-life trial), and the beginning is quite poignant particularly when Leticia shares a few small but important moments with her son. When Billy Bob Thornton arrived on the scene, things changed because he seemed asleep at the wheel throughout the role. Halle Berry was completely naked and Billy Bob STILL seemed to be sleepwalking. Perhaps making Bandits, The Man Who Wasn't There, and Monster's Ball all in one year was too much for the antique-furniture phobe? Once certain characters in the film are off-screen and Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton are on their own, the film falls apart on some level. The Billy Bob character hates his son but we don't know why. The Halle Berry character doesn't seem to remember the tragic events that came before and she doesn't seem to care that Billy Bob has hid information from her. Luckily, Halle Berry is above the material and can act out the words that the script doesn't give her the ability to say. Monster's Ball is a must-see for those Americans who can't seem to get passed the racial divide but do remember to bring your kleenex. No character escapes victimhood and the script is relentless in hitting you over and over again with tragedies.8/10 (Thanks to Halle Berry's performance alone).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well "Monster's Ball" will live forever due to the fact that it was the "break-through" film as Halle Berry became the first African-American to take home the Best Actress Oscar. Her win was well-deserved and she was the best performer of the field hands down. "Monster's Ball" is not a pleasant or really entertaining film to watch. It is graphic, at times ugly and almost always difficult to watch. With all that said, the movie is an excellent edition to the cinema due to dynamite performances, an out-of-this-world screenplay and second-to-none direction. Halle Berry's husband (Sean "Puffy" Combs in an amazingly well-calculated and smart role) will be executed in the electric chair. Enter corrections officer Billy Bob Thornton and co-worker/son Heath Ledger who are the last ones to guard Combs as he awaits his death. Combs' death is something that will directly and indirectly affect all the key players in "Monster's Ball". Tragedy has already struck Berry, tragedy will strike Thornton and yet another tragedy will bring the two opposites together. "Monster's Ball" is one of those films that is a love story, albeit unconventional, it is a love story. Berry and Thornton are best for each other and although both suffer devastating heartaches during the course of the film, it is made clear that both need one another. Peter Boyle is priceless as Thornton's unfeeling father and newcomer Coronji Calhoun makes a lasting impression as Berry's young, over-weight son. Berry and Thornton are simply amazing together and their chemistry carries "Monster's Ball" more than anything else. History will always remember this film and that is the way it should be. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

The performance of most actors was mediocre, with the exception of Billy Bob's dad, who put up a solid performance playing his racist father.The movie offers nothing new, exciting or worth spending 2 hours for....it's just a recycling of stuff we already know. Its main themes, execution of a prisoner, cross racial love and the hardships of parenting have all been portrayed many a time and really don't justify spending your time and money, not in the way this movie was made anyway.The only really good things about this movies are the music and cinematography.

The film is about a romance between a desperate black mother and the white correctional officer who worked her husband's execution. The film does have the balls to display a very affectionate interracial romance without any limits. There are monster performances from stars Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry. I found a thrill in Halle Berry Hill. It is definitely the bravest female performance of the year!!!!! As for homeboy Billy Bob, he once again proves why he is one of the best actors around. But most importantly, I am sure he has a ball each night with that monster of a wife he has. Also, Peter Boyle was menacingly powerful as the racist father. These actors should all be invited to that big festive award ball in late March that gets monster ratings. Nevertheless, don't forget to crash `Monster's Ball'. *****Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. It has been a rough week. I saw "Monster's Ball" and "In the Bedroom" in a 5 day span. I consider myself fully educated on how to conduct a doomed relationship. "Monster's Ball" is exceedingly well acted. Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry and Peter Boyle are all at the top of their game. I didn't even realize Halle Berry had a game to be on top of! Much more than a great body and beautiful face, she brings her character to life ... at least what little life it has. Peter Boyle does a wonderful job of capturing the hateful bigotry of an unforgiving b**tard. Many young viewers may be surprised at the ability of Boyle to do anything except deliver one liners in stupid sitcoms, but he was one of the best character actors of the 70's and 80's. The problem with the movie is the story is delivered in a chopped up manner and it does not really give us a reason to get close to the characters. It just kind of expects us to. Billy Bob's obstacles for a normal life seem to be at the heart of the story, but a couple of scenes are not enough for us to muster empathy. Same with Halle's character. Superb brief role for Puff Daddy as the soon to be executed father to Halle's son. Many will have a difficult time recognizing Heath Ledger in his first down and dirty role. This is a teen heart-throb? Maybe ... but he is showing flashes of becoming a real actor. Overall, a masterpiece of acting, but a tough movie to watch due to the subject matter and the choppy direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Bob Thornton and especially Halle Berry give astonishing performances as two troubled people who cling to each other for understanding as misery loves company. As troubled as these characters are, their situations are a little too bizarre to believe they would occur in such a short time. Namely, three deaths, as members of their respective families pass away. Still, this is adult material at its very best and as film making, it impresses, as social commentary it stimulates and as a memorable experience, it doesn't disappoint. Peter Boyle give a mean spirited performance as Thornton's father that re-defines what racism is and Heath Ledger gives a good but short lived performance as Thornton's son who isn't up to the task he is asked to perform. Don't see this movie if you've experienced any family tragedies involving death. It may too painful to watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in modern-day Georgia, Monster's Ball tackles racism, inter-generational machismo, and the death penalty -- a flammable triad familiar to most Americans (with graphic portrayals of these unpleasant topics, it should go without saying that this film is not for everyone). Billy Bob Thornton and Heath Ledger play father and son prison guards (Hank and Sonny) who work on death row and live with grandpa Buck -- a retired prison guard. Thornton masterfully portrays Hank as a decent guy who internalized his father's toughness and race-hatred, while Ledger plays a conflicted soul who works in the family business but refuses to dehumanize himself in deference to patriarchal expectations. The other side of the race card features the Musgrave family -- condemned husband Lawrence (Sean Combs), his lovely wife Leticia (Halle Berry), and obese son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun). The film eventually boils down to Hank and Leticia attempting to break out of the prisons of their ancestry and circumstances in order to create a more promising future. It's all about adults of both races attempting to escape the sins of their aging fathers. The events that make up Monster's Ball come together far too neatly to be believed, but the dialogue is entertaining enough, the acting is good enough, and the subject material is important enough that I was more than willing to suspend disbelief for a couple hours. Hard to believe Thornton didn't receive a Best Actor nomination in 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert! After a night of passionate, drunken sex, a racist man changes his whole out look on life. Berry's character's name should have been Sunshine! Good performances but the story is slow and {atleast to me} unbelieveable. Casting was a little off as well. What I mean by that is that Berry's husband is slim and dark and she is slim and light skinned and they have a dark heavy kid. Also it is made known in the movie that Berry's husband has been in jail 10 years but Berry looks like she is only about twenty five or so. I think a older heavier actor should have been used as Berry's husband to support why the kid was so big and a darker actress than Berry would at least by sight would have been a more powerful obstacle for a racist middle aged man to overcome and find love with. Any man, even a racist one, would not mind a hot night with Halle but put Whoppie Goldberg in the role and lets see if things work out the same. People around me after the movie were really disappointed and I heard one couple tell another that Roger Ebert was crazy and Beautiful mind was better. Peter Boyle is really good as the racist dad. In everyone of his scenes you are on edge with every word not knowing what he going to say. At the end of the movie I wished something worse would have happened to him like in the movie Affliction. Overall 5 out of 10 mostly because of pacing, casting and the director trying to be clever with camera angles and editing which did not work more than it did.</fullReview>

It is very well demonstrated in this movie, how hard it is for real people to "adequately" cope with these huge life events, how to react "in a normal way". Some things are funny, some are beyond sadness. Sometimes, we are more in silent shock than talking a lot, simply because we never learned how to address the issues properly - and that comes across in this move astonishingly well. That's where the movie lands a huge, huge, huge blunt impact on the audience in its first half.Then, the relationship between black and white. It's as much a point as you want to make out of it, and the way the people in the movie go about it makes sense. Hank sells his father to the retirement village at the right moment. Shoot, if I had someone at home like that, I'd get rid of that person too. Commitment is commitment, priorities are priorities, many people think that way, and it's surprising and refreshing to see that Hank simply works that way too, particularly after such a screwed up coincidence that had happened beforehand. I think it's fair enough that people jump over prejudices; it's probably the only way to do it in certain life situations. And I think it is fair enough to assume people can develop, change their opinions, learn, give stuff a second thought. It happens day by day, in an increasingly complex and quickly moving world. In this sense, Hank is an extremely modern person, and Leticia as well. They are just not advertised as such so everyone can read "modern person", and the industrial hallmarks of modernness are not abundant, but I am sure the true modernness, the reason why this movie had to wait until the year 2001 to be made in this atmospheric depth, lies in its modernness.The actor Billy Bob Thornton may not even need an award. He's up there to begin with. But he needs more roles to show different sides of his character. The acting was perfect, and there is certainly no one who could have done it better, or in a better style, or with a better mood. The actress Halle Berry does not deserve one either, even though she also played her role like she was, well, Mrs Musgrove herself. I disagree with people who say that "she is too good looking". For real life comparison: first there is an awful lot of good looking women on this planet, and second, beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway. I am not a particular fan of Halle Berry's looks, but I really liked what she did with that role. Both actors, however, did what I would expect from someone growing up in the American south: they acted "normal". The true achievement to me lies in putting this together, in combining these people, and in coming up with the script and their lines.That is the thing: the closeness of the characters and the script to normal American life. It shows how poor people, black people, old people, smokers with lung disease, mums without cars, overweight kids, and people in small communities don't live lives with double floors. Not in the slightest way. I think this movie is for people who live without double floors, who know it's just for once, and it's for real - and how that knowledge allows them to quickly reconsider. They decide differently from the double buffered lives lived in other worlds. It's a great contemporary movie, that is certainly much closer to being a documentary than one would think. These days, everyone's double floors are shrinking, constantly. So even though the characters and the story are fictional, they could be real. Increasingly real. They just could. And that is also quite surprising once you think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton do an outstanding job in this opulently photographed chronicle of generational hatred. The entire supporting cast is rock solid, including Peter Boyle as the bilious, crumbling paterfamilias who gets his just desserts. If there is anything wrong with the movie it is in its lack of foundation for the rapid shelving of entrenched attitudes, as well as instant intoxication from a nip of Jack Daniels and its almost overdone cleverness. A little suspension of disbelief is needed, but this film is merciful salvation from the endless procession of sappy or exploding car movies. The viewer is rewarded with a realistic and honest ending.</fullReview>

I was also pleasantly surprised to see that Sean Combs has some acting talent, playing the brief role of Berry's condemned husband.

		<fullReview>'Monster's Ball' was a well done movie (while poorly advertised) that didn't really seem to have a lot to say. I felt both Halle Berry's and Billy-Bob Thorton's performances were outstanding, but the script left them out to dry a little bit at parts. There were many moments that I felt were drawn out too long, and I left the theatre as almost exactly the same person that entered it (I like movies that make me take a look at the way I think or feel about things). I had no major quams with the movie, and if you're heading to the movie theatre it wouldn't be a bad one to check out. (minor spoiler alert!) Oh, and if 'post-movie-melancholy' is a worry for you (as it rightfully should be with the depressing endings of a lot of the 'dramatic' movies) this is a good drama to check out, cause it ends on quite a nice note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's compelling. It's different. It's forcefully acted, especially by Halle Berry -- who knew? But I don't believe it.This script evidently had been kicking around Hollywood for years, and it does have a jerrybuilt quality. Aside from its contrivances and plot coincidences, it charts its character development haphazardly. The characters seem to have changes of heart about one another offstage, between scenes. The movie's trying to make valid points about overcoming external prejudices, inward loathing, and destructive life choices, but you have to accept both farfetched plot points and unsubstantiated emotional journeys to make it work. Not to enter a spoiler, but I really do wonder about that ending. And they lived...?Still, it has atmosphere and mood for days, and there's nary a car blowup or special effect. These are not small virtues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth About Monster's Ball. And Julia Roberts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is far from being a perfect film; it has many flaws. So many, in fact, that I don't want to analyze it. But one flaw that it does not have is acting on the part of Halle Berry. She's one of the best out there, always more sincere than your mother and never annoying, like Julia Roberts can be. Or your mother. No, seriously, her portrayal is very, very truthful and very, very sincere. If you are looking for a great film, watch American Beauty again. This film is not great, but if you enjoy seeing nearly-perfect acting, then you, unlike Eric "sex-addict-but-somehow-still-gay" Benet, will love Halle Berry. She was so REAL in one particular part ("..can you make me feel GOOD?") that it instantly became one of those moments on film where the acting was so insightful and electric that you can watch that one snippet repeatedly; actors should study it. I was **cking AMAZED when I saw that part. One of the realest pieces of acting in film history. Guaranteed. So maybe you should watch the movie, anyway, just because of that. But don't expect great writing, cinematography, etc...just one of the best snippets of film acting ever and one one of the better overall performances by a single actor/actress in recent years.On a side note...I know you know what I'm talking about about Julia Roberts...you know, the thing she does when she's on screen that makes you go "Oh, no, it's Julia Roberts again, and this time she's acting lke...Julia Roberts..." It's like Julia Roberts is the character in every Julia Roberts film, no acting necessary. Just add water.Halle Berry is living proof that you can still be a beautiful leading lady vaunted for her looks but who can undisputedly act her ass off. Not to pick on Roberts because I like her too, but you can't pick a Julia Roberts role where, upon picturing Halle Berry in it, you don't see her doing it with ease or even better than Roberts. Most people, whether they like Julia Roberts or not, will agree that Halle Berry is a much better actress than Julia Roberts. High quality dramatic actress, few can compare. And the overwhelming majority of men will agree that Halle Berry is a lot more attractive than the very pretty Roberts, too. Berry is blessed; genetically, no one can say "she could use a little more this" or a little more "that." So with highly developed dramatic acting skills in hand and apparently an infinite amount of even more dramatic potential concealed beneath the surface, and a genetic phenotype which just happens to be as perfect as humans get, like some man dreamed her right into existence, why do I know that they'll never pay her 20 million dollars per film? If you have any ideas about this, post them on the message board. It's weird. One thing she shouldn't have done, though is "Catwoman." I haven't seen it yet, because it hasn't been released, but I already know she shouldn't have done it. Maybe the one thing Miss Berry IS missing is an agent who is as competent at his trade as she at hers. Anyway, the movie "Monster's Ball" is not that good. But Berry left something of note on the cellulite, and this is why the movie is widely spoken of. Well, that, and the (gratuitous?) sex. Her moment was so damned good that it made the movie worth watching, and that's special. Gotta respect anyone who's that good at what she does.</fullReview>

Regarding the 'Oscar winning' performance of Berry, I have said the same thing about Denzel Washington's 'Training Day' performance, how on earth did that (the performance) ever win an Oscar. It was only an average performance and could have been better interpreted by numerous actresses. I am not an American but for DW and HB to both win Oscars for weak at best performances really makes me question the decision and whether or not there was some other 'motive' behind it. I believe that both have performed far better in previous movies (on more than one occasion) and not been rewarded as much. I really respect most of the work these two do, but in this case they should be embarrassed.Enough said. The movie was terrible and the actor's were seriously under used. I gave it a 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to rent this movie just to see what it was that caused Halle Berry to get the Best Actress Oscar. Unfortunately, it was not her performance in this film. She was simply a supporting actor to Billy Bob Thornton who is the real star in the movie. Her acting skills were not demonstrated as they were in the Dorothy Dandridge portrayal for which she was appropriately rewarded.There is no way she deserved the award over Nicole Kidman who has a range of accomplishments that dwarfs Halle's meager films. In 2001 Nicole proved it in The Others and the stunning Moulin Rouge. In both of these she was the star and a great one at that.No, I suppose the Academy Awards are and will be forever mostly politics. This was obviously a case of appease the African-Americans and exile the Aussies, even though clearly Kidman and Crowe turned in performances that made this movie a sham by comparison.Pure garbage, but that's just my opinion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on 2/3/2002. The story concerns three generations of white men in the Grotowski family (Buck, Hank, and Sonny, played by Peter Boyle, Billy Bob Thornton, and Heath Ledger, respectively and in decreasing age). They live together but don't like each other very much, and all are or have been corrections officers at the local prison, although Sonny doesn't have the stomach for executions. The older two generations are also blatant racists. The intersecting story is of Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), a black woman whose ex-husband is on death row, who battles with her son over his eating, and who is in the process of being evicted. Of course Hank and Leticia get together for a well-publicized sex scene or two.The main problem with this film is the script: what motivates Hank's 180? change from racist to lover? There are some vaguely possible explanations, but they really don't make enough sense.The cinematography is, perhaps intentionally, gritty. The direction seems a bit erratic. But what really surprised me is that the performances, while quite good, did not live up to what I had expected based on other reviews. And speaking of other reviews, I should note that Roger Ebert named this the best film of 2001, but others have had much less kind words to say about it.</fullReview>

Billy Bob Thornton plays a officer on Death Row who executes a man who was once married to a woman (Halle Berry) who is now a single mother with little money, a crummy job and 30 days to leave the house. Through chance, among other deep elements, she meets Thornton and then the film goes on from there examining how they find some small comfort in each other. Not for the weak, but it's worth the journey, with Thornton, Berry, Peter Boyle as Thornton's bitter father, and even Puff Daddy (here as Sean Combs) in a small role, delivering deep and moving performances, and the best cinematography of the year by Roberto Schafer.

		<fullReview>There are a few powerful moments of high drama in this film, but in general they are too few and far between to really save this rather weak story that gets surprisingly good ratings.There are decent performances from Halle Berry as Leticia, whose husband has just been executed in prison and Billy Bob Thornton as Hank, the head guard at the prison. I stress the word "decent" though. I have trouble figuring out what it was in this performance that earned Berry an Oscar for Best Actress. She put on a good performance; nothing more than that in my opinion. The story has too many add-ons to it. Why did Leticia's son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) have to be so overweight? His obesity added nothing to the story unless one enjoyed seeing Berry abuse him both emotionally and physically because of it. Why did we need all the "drama" (rather ridiculous I thought) about Hank and his son Sonny (Heath Ledger)? Again, just to let us enjoy seeing the two of them abuse each other? OK, it establishes a connection between Hank and Leticia (both have children who die and who they were not proud of for different reasons,) but in my opinion we could have done without them. Finally, the story revolves around the growing romance between Hank and Leticia - a romance that I thought was just too contrived to be taken seriously.The movie is rather crude in places and it features a significant amount of nudity so those who are squeamish about that will want to avoid this. As I said, there are some good points to it. There just aren't enough of them to make this really worthwhile.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on tape, after the Oscars, and was reminded of a sketch in George Wolfe's play, "The Colored Museum", which satirized the trend (twenty years ago) for theatrical offerings like "The Last Mama-On-The-Couch Play" to win acclaim and awards. I have no doubts about Ms. Berry's acting gifts, but I thought she played a more believable human in, for example, "Swordfish."The film was obviously set in Louisiana, despite half-hearted attempts to avoid specific geography, such as references to "Jackson" (MS) and "Georgia is peachy." Is the film set in a small town? Must be a small town that houses the state prison, if guards live there. And presumably the murderer came from the same community, since his family also lives there. Small world, isn't it?That's just the beginning of the contrivances. Is there any believable character in this film? The two or three partially-credible characters met their fate early. I gave up trying to figure out "why," and instead savored the comic moments such as pops (Peter Boyle) getting institutional care. For close to the same reason Christina Crawford got sent to boarding school in Mommie Dearest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too many "social commentaries" degenerate into preachy, mind-numbing treacle; "Monster's Ball" never does. It feels like an axe in the throat. Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is a death row guard raised in a racist society. His father Buck (Peter Boyle) is particularly bigoted and just hates to see white people and black people hanging out together. Then, a series of gut-wrenching events gets Hank involved with Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), whose husband he recently executed.This is definitely not a movie for people who want sugar-coated fairy tales. It stings you the way that "Apocalypse Now" and "Mystic River" do. Berry won a well deserved Oscar for her performance as a woman whose life gets horribly changed through two occurrences that would freeze anyone's blood. I had never heard of director Marc Forster when the movie came out, but I could see that he was a great director; indeed, this was not a studio movie by any stretch. Forster would make another masterpiece with "Finding Neverland". I recommend "Monster's Ball" to everyone, but you may want to avoid it if you get upset easily.</fullReview>

His labored breathing and compulsive eating binges were very believable. Truly, the best characters in this movie were played by Heath Leger and Peter Boyle. Up to the point where Leger's character blows his brains out I was really thinking this movie had potential. That scene was fantastic. The scenes that led up to that moment where well done. Peter Boyle's cold reaction to this event is some of the best acting in the movie. Sadly, the best parts of this movie are over in the first quarter or third.A 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

And for a real laugh check her out trying to act like an actual southern struggling black woman in the drunk/first-time-with-Billy-Boy scene. And Billy Bob isn't much better. The sex-scenes are gratuitous and not even hot (even with Halle's body or the hooker). I can only assume Hollywood was on crack for even considering awards for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having experienced tragedy first hand, Hank decides to quit his prison guard job and look for something better. Leticia is mourning her husband, killed on death row, but more important to her is the potential loss of her home as she struggles to pay her bills. The two come together when another tragedy strikes and soon they are both using each other as physical and emotional crutches. As their relationship grows it only seems a matter of time before secrets and lurking tragedy will strike again.It is hard to really put the plot of this film into a few sentences without having to just spell out what happens from start to finish because really the film follows two characters as one depressingly bad thing happens to them after another. As stories go it is not great and, although I can see it serving as a realer reality than Hollywood often serves up, the fact that it is so bleak means that you pretty much end up just waiting for the next bad thing to happen rather than getting into the narrative. This is not to say it is dull because it is still engaging as a story but it is often a bit of hard work and it would have been better to scale the tragedy back a little and provide more balance within the story; as it is it moves swiftly from one bad thing to another and it can be a bit overwhelming at times.The direction is good and matches the narrative's sense of a slow collapse; it is dark, patient and very professional. The cast are perhaps the main reason to stick with it because they are roundly good. Thornton could be seen as just walking through the film but I thought he got the tired life of Hank pretty much spot on. Berry's Oscar may have had a bit of politics about it but that should not be taken to mean that she is not any good, because she really is. She does look downbeaten, even if she is still, well, Halle Berry. Emotionally she is spot on and I was surprised by how strong she was. Ledger only has a small role but is solid enough; Boyle though is tremendous and totally convincing in his small role ? he brings a lot to it. The contrast between Mos Def and Diddy/Daddy/Puffy/Whatever could not be greater in terms of their music but both of them are actually pretty good here and shun the usual clichs that come with rappers slash actors.Overall this is not a fun film or a film that has a story that flows and surprises. It is a bit too bleak to be a genuinely strong story but it does still engage and the direction and fine performances more than cover the weaknesses and make it worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a trite, weak story of unjustified redemption, as a vehicle for soft porn. The writing and acting reveal the corruption of the Academy. If you love mirrors, mumbling and love from behind, then see this movie. When you get bored, you can count the number of scenes with overwrought and pointless camera work. Scenes shot through drinking glass or in reflection: 25! Random quick cut to heavy handed symbolism: 8! Billy Bob's Briefs: 4!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie feels so unnecessary. None of the themes, like racism, social alienation and family drama, are treated in the compelling way they were meant to be treated. Nowhere do you get involved in this story, foremost because of it's having been told more naturally, more honestly and more clearly in scores of other movies. Actually, this is not a story about racism, I feel. It is more the story of a screen writer who fell short of material and felt that racial prejudice would still hold that sting which could inject some much-needed drama into his lifeless listing of human misery. The acting is the second domain where the film doesn't deliver. Billy Bob Thornton is his usual charismatic, smug, and somewhat uninvolved self. Halle Berry did nothing that would change my judgment after seeing her in Die Another Day. She has a very forgettable screen presence and I fear any appearance alongside one of her more energetic (female) colleagues would put a premature end to her career. Also, Miss Berry was hopelessly miscast for this role. She is much too clean and well-groomed to make us believe she is the wife of a criminal on death row and waiting to be expelled from her apartment for want of money. Look, if this was Alfre Woodward, the Oscar would be fully justified. But now it looks like a misplaced political gesture.All in all, Monster's Ball will probably be long forgotten when people will still view the likes of In The Heat Of The Night as an important document on racism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Bob is his usual self: depressed, brooding and confused. He hates his son for no apparent reason. Why his son commits suicide is a mystery to the viewer because human behaviour and motivations are nonsensical in this picture. Am I to believe a fully grown man with a job kills himself over his father's disapproval and hatred of him? Maybe if he was a 5-year-old, then again kids that age don't kill themselves, they cry or misbehave.Racism and racial tensions are overdone in film, it's an old thing now and focusing a movie around it is beating a dead horse.Here I would like to make something clear for people because no one seems to grasp the notion of a mixed-race person. The character of Halle Berry is not, I repeat NOT a black person. She could as well be called a half white person. This fact completely negates the main plot of the movie: the redneck white guy, who looks Middle Eastern himself, falling for the supposed "black" woman! I guess the casting director didn't check how Ms. Barry was conceived, and thus miscast her in the role of a black female. A white guy has a change of heart due to his attraction to the supposed black woman (more likely to the white in her) because of the supposed black woman's looks -this plot is beyond preposterous.No need to mention Heath Ledger was a great actor and was splendid in his role here. Halle Barry is annoying with her very stupid "make me feel good" line; this scene alone ruined anything positive she may have done up to that point. Lastly, eating habits run in the family, therefor you cannot find a healthy person with an obese child. That's unrealistic, as is everything else in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Monstrous Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attraction, usually called "chemistry", is what makes a relationship snap, crackle, and pop. In Monster's Ball, this chemistry seems hopelessly out of proportion---Halle Berry plays Leticia Muskgrove, a woman who is scalded by life's torments. After her son is killed and her husband is executed, she simply pulls all the stops out of the meaning of Drama Queen. Playing her opposite in this odd duet is Billy Bob Thorton, as Hank Grotowski, who's beginning to make a habit (typecasting, anyone?) of choosing roles that require minimal effort - er, sorry---"subtle" tones.Billy Bob plays a sorry sort of mope, who's emotional range is stuck somewhere between less and non-existent. This man's response to his son's self-inflicted demise becomes stuffed into a saran-wrapped vacuum of denial and weary acceptance.The fulcrum (emphasis on "crum!) is Billy Bob's father---Peter Boyle gives a sneering portrayal of a man who's emotional range teeters between his matter-of-fact contempt for African-Americans and his contempt for his son, because he chooses to live life in a comfort zone of numbing boredom.By the time these two polar opposites trade sweat I was more interested in Halles' butt tattoo than this story of two tired people unable to care and unwilling to emotionally commit.But the end of this frustrating flick is the emotional payoff for the viewer; and I'm glad I endured the hour + to finally "get the point". We're left with a scene that speaks volumes about what lies ahead for these two emotionally caged sweethearts.Sitting on the steps, enjoying the nighttime symphony of stars, and sharing ice cream (I know, could the writer have been a little more, uh?subtle?) it's clear that Halle and Billy have been playing stereotypes---the angry black woman with an attitude and the constipated white man with a polite grimace.And their self-contained happy ending is really a challenge for us, because the starry sky holds a universe of choices?and it's up to us how we want to go through life?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange transformations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Halle Berry won an Oscar for her performance in 'Monster's Ball', and in some ways, the film is typical Oscar fare: liberal, worthy and not a little dull. It tells the story of a racist prison guard who finds redemption through a sexual relationship with the wife of a man he has executed. Personally, I found the transformation the characters go through not completely convincing, and Berry's Bond girl body a bit incongruous in this tale of life near the bottom of American society. Indeed, the story could even be described as creepy, except that director Marc Forster chooses not to emphasise this angle, preferring to stress the inherent goodness lurking beneath the surface of the characters. I also found the emphasis on the sexual a little odd in what is otherwise a story of moral recovery. It's not a terrible film; but the narrative arc seems somewhat constructed, set against the backdrop of a strangely stilted world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had quite high expectations of this film which is maybe the reason in my opinion it fell flat on it's face.Quite simply i thought it was awful. I hated the story , it was mega depressing and to be honest it just lacked everything needed to keep me hooked.Watching it i felt at times i just wanted to turn it off but in the back of my mind hoping maybe this will pick up but it never did.The performances are actually quite good definitely above average. Heath , Thorton and Berry all shine through but Berry's performance WAS NOT Oscar worthy i genuinely didn't believe her character.It felt over played and worst of all both pointless and a waste of time.The sex scene was probably the most griping scene of the whole film and that's saying something.The crappy dialogue like the painful scene with Berry's character cursing her son over his weight?! what the hell were they thinking.Everything event in this film felt like it happened way too fast. It was quick off the mark in a bad way!. It all felt too overdone like they had crammed ideas that should have stretched over the film into the 30 minutes in the middle of it. It was all too co-incidental. Like i said before the only thing that pushed me to give this a four was the good performances from the actors involved but that alone is not enough to save a film this bad.All in the all there was serious potential but it didn't get used and this film didn't work.But hey! that's just my opinion check it out for yourself you could love it.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good story and acting, but bad stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gave me mixed feelings. The acting was very good and there is no doubt about that. I was very disappointed with Halle Berry though. She played a completely stereotypical role. She is a low-class woman with no money. She wears skimpy clothing (tank tops without a bra) and can't afford to make payments on her home. Halle considers herself to be "black" and yet I don't see her playing empowering roles, which make black woman look positive. The first scene where she has sex with Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) is disturbing. Not only does it look like soft porn, but what exactly was the purpose? The quick clips of a hand in the cage made it all the more confusing, and I couldn't figure out the connection. Even so, I really enjoyed seeing a story in which a man was able to rediscover himself and recognize his faults after the death of his son. To see him grow as a person and go from racist to falling in love with a black woman sent a powerful message. Overall, the movie had a good story that was filmed rather well. Although there was an unnecessary scene, the message was clear. I just hope that Halle Berry starts playing in some better roles where she doesn't have to get naked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And this won an Oscar!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With her fabulous portrayal Halle Berry won an Oscar for her role in this movie.Well I guess Mrs Berry's performance is good but I rather think that Peter Boyle and especially Sean (Puff Daddy) Combs performance is way better, actually Peter Boyle performance isn't exactly Oscar material, it's just a typical Boyle performance but one can't help to like it (the sarcastic and somewhat flat tone that he delivers his lines in is just so like his character Frank Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond).Spoilers here after.The plot in this movie is really missing some parts, for some reason the producers has left out the story or at least some explanation to why Lawrence Musgrove (Puff Daddy) is sentenced to death by the chair and why Leticia (Halle Berry) is having trouble scraping together enough money (she gets fired from her job because she has been late several times but this dosn't explain enough even with her giving the reason for it due to her car being broke, there's something more to it but we're never told) and in the end we don't get to see what happens to the main characters after Leticia finds out that Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) worked at the facility where Lawrence was executed, it just ends with them sitting on the poach.While this movie shows with some correctness the difficulties of integration of the afro-American people it deals with the fact in a strange way. On one side we have this racist family (Hank and his father, played by Mr. Boyle) and on the other an afro-American family trying to make enough to stay above (again we don't know why Lawrence is in jail and as such dosn't have enough to discren any obvious reason for this other than he's is indeed in jail) Hank gets tired or worn out by the fact that he has to execute this prisoner that seems to us to be a good enough man, and in part also in sadness that his own son kills himself because of this, so he resigns himself from the prison service and by some lucky happenstance he gets entangled with Leticia when she's struck by another tragedy. From here on Hank dose everything he can to make her happy but for some reason he dosn't know her last name or dosn't connect the dots.The audience is just thrown into this movie as some random passerby and just as suddenly thrown out again. We don't get much in the way of explanation in regards to why things are as they are.I wasn't entertained much by this movie and while I can make some assumptions towards the missing parts I was just left with being very bored for 108min.Only bright points where as mentioned Peter Boyle and Puff Daddy.A 4 out of 10 due to Boyle and Combs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muddled, uneven film redeemed somewhat by Thornton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unfortunate that this is one of the only films of the past few years about moder race-relations in the American South, since the majority of recent films about race deal with more with the urban black experience than the unhealed psychic wounds south of the mason-Dixon line. Too bad, then, that all we get is this sloppy, overly schematic piece of liberal claptrap.Full of wildly contrived plot points, bizarre tonal shifts and cheap melodramatics, this film seems the work of a supremely unassured, confused filmmaker. One might make the case that the odd unpredictability of the film is its chief virtue, but that would be to ignore the gaping story holes and utterly nonsensical character motivations.A mere description of the plot--in which a black woman falls in love with the white executioner of her husband--should have given any script reader serious pause before giving it the green light, but Forster has enough subtlety to make almost seem like a truthful exploration of race in America. Almost.Oscar or no, Halle Berry is utterly grating as the main character. Surely I am not the only one who is growing tired of hysterical, one-note cry-fests garnering trophies year after year. I refuse to take any actor seriously who is weeping for more than three minutes in an entire film. Crying should be an actor's absolute last resort--instead it has become the first destination of every Hollywood hack.The rest of the cast is quite good, a fact which has probably blinded many moviegoers from noticing the sheer silliness of the storyline. Billy Bob Thornton, as always, gives a subtly shaded performance as the ambivalent main character, and he almost justifies the absurdity of the film around him. Peter Boyle is creepy and believable as Thornton's virulently racist father. Heath Ledger probably gives his best performance as Thornton's confused, bitter son.Most of the time, however, I merely cocked my head at the screen with an internal "Huh?" What's the point of a pair of scenes in which Thornton and his son have sex with a cheap whore? How are we supposed to believe the coincidence which brings Thornton closer to Berry in the first place? What in God's name is the purpose of the much-discussed, wholly unnecessary sex scene in the middle of the film? I suppose the director might answer all of these questions with "because I felt like it." Which would make sense if Forster had a laser-sharp artistic instinct. But he doesn't. This is a perfect example of an artist going out of his way to create something "original" and just making a mess instead.</fullReview>

However, when a completely dreadful movie goes so far as to win an Academy Award, then I wonder about the panel that decides these awards. Monster's Ball is three hours of my life that I can never get back. It's crude, vulgar, racist, ugly, dark, filthy and despicable all in the first thirty minutes. And just when you think the movie is over, it's not. Instead, it's another scene in which Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry have sex. In fact, Halle Berry naked was the only good part about this movie...and if I want to see her naked, I'll just watch Swordfish -- it is, at least, a good movie. Absolutely horrible.1*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing about it is the script, but the rest of it, though rough around the edges, isn't too shabby either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FEEL FREE TO SKIM THIS: IT'S QUITE LONG. ALSO, THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, SO IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM DON'T READ MY REVIEW. Summary: The death of his son awakens intense feelings of love, suffering, and humanity in the previously hate-filled Hank Grotowski. Hank meets Leticia, whose son has also died, and the two of them save each others lives from going down the same despair-filled, hate-filled path. THOUGHTS/COMMENTS: Well, I suppose I should start with the sex scene. It's what you're all reading this for, isn't it? The sex scene. All right then, let me see... It wasn't too graphic. It was very graphic, but these two people have been locking up their emotions for a very long time and to tidy up the graphicness would be to tidy up the emotion. So my problem with the sex scene wasn't the graphicness. No, my problem with the sex scene was the acting. It was mainly Berry's fault. Her elaborate hand gestures were too fancy, too choreographed, and they threw the entire scene off kilter. It wasn't that she didn't capture ANY of the emotion of that scene, but she didn't capture most of it. Thornton wasn't very good either in that scene, but I think that's because, in that scene, his character is following Berry's character very closely, and Berry made it difficult (though not impossible) for him to do that by her bad acting. The second sex scene, near the end, was much more well acted, very powerful and moving. The sex scenes near the beginning seemed gratuitous at first; then when you saw the cold impersonality of that sex scene, in contrast to the emotion and spirituality of Hank's sex with Leticia, you understood why the filmmaker had put the earlier sex scenes there. Now for the rest of the film. Well, the script, as I said, was wonderful. It's a truly great script. The detail each line is laden with, the interesting ways the events interconnect, and the profound themes of love, death, hate and forgiveness create an excellent script. Some people say that the script is too incident-based and doesn't have enough flow, but I feel that the script's incident-based quality captures something about the stark lack of communication in Hank's and Leticia's lives. The camera-work is very good, as well. It's a bit too downright, a bit too direct, which causes it to have little room for complexity, but sometimes (for example, when we learn that Leticia's son has died) the downright, direct quality is quite effective and appropriate. I also like how, often, we are unable to see the faces of the characters: it conveys the closed-off lives the characters lead. The music and cinematography are good as well, providing a subtle, melancholic mood for the film. The lighting was maybe a bit too staged, though--I'll have to watch again. The acting...Well, let's see. Puff Daddy is abominable: we feel no emotion coming from him at all, only dull dreary nothingness. Thornton is very good. Though he never reaches the emotional intensity of Berry's best scene, he sustains a higher level of acting throughout the film, and for that I'd probably say his performance is the best in the film. Berry is unconvincing at majorly crucial moments, but in the scene where she learns of her son's death she's...I just can't describe how good she is, you'll have to see for yourself. Her acting in that scene will make you proud to be a member of humanity...and make you feel a lot of other things. Calhoun, Boyle, and Ledger are good as well. Ledger occasionally becomes too shrill, but mainly does a very good job. The more I watch him, the better he gets. Calhoun and Boyle are very good as well--not Oscar-nod caliber as many are saying, but they are very good. Calhoun's acting has a mature air of elegance which all the adults' acting (especially Berry's and Boyle's) seems to lack. Overall, I liked this film. At first I felt it needed more energy, but by the end of it I realized that it had been slowly building energy for its seemingly quiet but really tremendously powerful climax. I think it had a lot of flaws, but many of the flaws could have been overlooked if Puff Daddy hadn't given such a bad performance. I don't know how to rate it numerically. I'll just rate it "very good."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transformation and acceptance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no gratuitous sex in this film. On the contrary, every scene illustrates to a thoughtful, mature audience, the true psychic state of the characters better than a thousand words; whether a barren, meaningless existence, or the mutual gift redemption possible only through the out of body experience of sexual bliss. There is no false note to be found here. The actors seem quite involved with the story and at pains to be understood. This makes for an involved audience who must leave affected. Halle Berry is a revelation and the journey to acceptance on her face at the end of the film is wordlessly eloquent; probably the clincher for many who voted her best actress.Joe Boyle is convincing as a racist in a wheelchair with a tube of oxygen in his nose, a man who has successfully infected his son, played by Billy Bob, with the lifelong sickness of racism. Trying to break this chain of hatred and self ruin is Billy Bob's son, Heath Ledger. The act of violence which frees him slowly transforms his father and dooms his grandfather to the reward of a lifetime of hatred.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell was this? You're bored for like a good hour and then Thorton and Berry are having sex for what seems like FOREVER! My bf and I fast forwarded it and it was still taking long. Why the hell did she connect with this character? I gues it's, "I'm not naked enough in my movies. I'll do a softcore porn". Is there a dearth of good stories out there? Ok this is the story: Leticia Musgrove is a struggling single mother cuz Puffy's in jail (how true to life) and he's on death row. Thorton is his executioner or officer who walks him to it and he ends up banging Puffy's wife in the end. Throw in Heath Ledger boinking a local prostitute and that's your film. Apparently, there's a story in there somewhere about the two characters having a connection despite the racial climate of their environment. I guess I missed it from all the sex being had that I had to fast forward through. The first black woman to win an Oscar gets it for playing a proto-typical role of Black women in cinema since the beginning of film. Thanks Halle...yea you opened doors all right. More like opened...anyway. I'm upset that a black woman gets an Oscar for doing a grotesque and gratuitous sex scene. Highly unappreciated there council. I just didn't get this film. I haven't met one person who could tell me what it was about aside from the major point of fascination for most people. The movie was boring as it chronicled their story and I wanted the fat kid to sit on them till they suffocated. There was no development of character, no explanations, just seediness. Maybe that was the point, but as a director, your point needs to come across to your audience. This movie failed to do that. In this day and age, you can't have a movie with a bunch of sex in it and claim it as art because you filmed scenery along with naked bodies and have classier music. To the mass populace, you got a high class porn. Just like romance novels are girl porn, this is soft-core porn. It's diluted, but it's still there. I'll give it the cinematography. The camera was smooth and the picture clear. Still doesn't save this monster at his ball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought "Monster's Ball" was a very good movie. I loved all the performances. Although some scenes did make me angry I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a particular fan of Billy Bob Thornton, but he is a very good actor. I didn't like his character at first because of how racist he was and how he caused his son's suicide but once he hooked up with Halle Berry's character all his old ways changed. Halle Berry deserved that Oscar. I liked her character because of how lonely she was. Her husband has been killed in the electric chair and her son has been killed in a car accident. Although I didn't like how she treated her son because of his eating habits, she truly loved him and his death just tore her apart. I think if she hadn't met Billy Bob, then she probably would have killed herself. She just didn't have anything to live for after her family died. I can see why some people would be upset by the sex scene between Billy Bob and Halle but it was necessary. Hank and Leticia needed each other. And I loved the fact that she helped him get over his prejudice ways. And I was so glad when he put his father in the nursing home. What an ass! Saying that rude comment in front Leticia. She didn't deserve that. I did think it was a little sad when Hank puked after having sex with Leticia but that didn't stop him from wanting to be with her. Heath Ledger's small part was good. I felt so sorry for him because of his father telling him that he never loved him. That would make someone commit suicide! P. Diddy had a great role as well. It's always sad to see someone die in the electric chair. I can't imagine how horrible that must be to experience. I thought the ending of this movie was somewhat disappointing but it didn't make me hate the movie. I really liked this movie and all the actors gave great performances. And Halle Berry is the proud winner of a well-deserved Oscar. Well, thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

There's a rule of thumb about books that pertains to movies as well: The first read is for plot (because plot is the easiest and most accessible form of reception), but it's the second read that actually provides meaning. The summary, thus, is that if you've only seen it once, you have to see it again. ;)</fullReview>

The latter category can sometimes be included in every good wine guide, where small mortgages would have to be taken out to aquire same. My point ...the exact same analogy can be applied to film, this film I loved, I thought a well deserved Oscar (academy members were in agreement with me also)for Ms Berry, not for her being black, or not for the sex scene, but maybe alone for the scene leading up to the sex scene, in which I felt she acted 'out of the box' and drew incredible believable emotions from somewhere, she was drunk, distraught, lonely, giddy, etc. All these confusing emotions then culminated in 'that' scene, it was as if it were a natural progression of confusing emotions, ultimately ending in release and contentment. The entire cast were excellent, and my compliments to the casting director. From reading other comments seemingly there were a lot of inaccuracies evident, but I missed them, then again I was not looking for them either ( Not my style you see ) but in liking this film, I'm probably in the minority here, but who cares, I dont, and neither should you.

		<fullReview>This is a good dramatic movie. I haven't seen a drama like this in a long, long time. I've liked Billy Bob Thornton since "Sling Blade". He is superb. He works as a prison guard with his son, following the footsteps of his father. He puts a man to death in the electric chair and that man's wife becomes down on her luck. With the husband gone, she soon loses her only son. Halle Berry deserved her Oscar for this role. I've never seen such raw emotion as Berry did since (i lost the name of the movie...). In any case, I recommend this movie to anyone with an openmind and a thirst for good drama and acting. I give it 9 out of 10 stars because some small parts tended to be draggy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great only for the first hour; overall bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts very promising. The story of two families with very disturbed relations looks very intriguing. Billy Bob produces some extraordinary acting as well as Heath Ledger and Halle Berry. But this is true only for the first hour (till the sex scene). It's very intense drama, not too optimistic but incredibly "emotional-packed" and true in some strange at the beginning. After the first hour it slows and changes into silly romance story which is totally unbelievable. All the drama, all the emotion, all the hidden truths about relationship within the family based on hate and lack of love disappears and we're stuck with empty story. I felt cheated when the movie ended. This sentimental stuff was so wrong it killed any fun I had watching Monster's Ball. Pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers).....I bumped into this movie on starz, watched it and was pretty pleased with it. I'm not a huge fan of romances as i am with comedies and thrillers, but this movie kept my interest and made me realize that at anytime of your life when you think you have everything figured out you can change your mind as quick as lighting. Billy Bob in this movie was a prime example; he was a racist and not too big in the heart. Once he met the devastated halley barey due to losing her son in a hit and run and losing her husband who was electricuted by Billy ( pretty ironic )...He was sympathetic and quickly fell in love with her, and was there for her whenever she needed him. I also thought that Billy being there for Hally, that kind of symbolized his regret of not being there for his son. Good movie...i give it a 6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie for the first time. Both Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thorton were excellent in this film. While the first half of the movie was just average, the second half really took off. Watch carefully and you will see the dichotomy between Billy's life and Halle's life. On a different note, some of the sex scenes between Billy and Halle are like a mini-porno. You see Halle like you have never seen her before. It makes her scene in Swordfish look like Disneyland. 8.5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hi. My Name's Frank, and This Movie's Name is Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's drop all pretentions for a moment. Monster's Ball had one selling point: Thornton doggy-styling Berry. The critics raved over this scene: "...it shows their humanity." and "...portrays their weakness." and "...this movie will fly over the heads of some." Whatever. I've seen enough "I spit on your grave" movies to understand one basic tenet of life: I understand the stark reality that sex doesn't equal love or emotion of any kind. It equals sex. Get over yourselves. Ask yourself this question: WOULD THIS MOVIE HAVE BEEN AS GOOD WITHOUT 'THAT SCENE?' Your answer will determine where you will always stand on this movie. The acting is pretty good, but there's little or no character development for Berry's character (Spacek was screwed!!!). I get it: two screwed up people lead screwed up lives and then, by freak, screwed up chance, find each other. There's no happy ending, only the reality of their screwed up lives going on, most likely with each other. I've seen it before. So have you. If not, then look around. It was good, but it wasn't all this and that.</fullReview>

The movie is a real downer, and pretty much shot down my hopes for any post cinematic action. I was not even uplifted by the tacked on "Hollywood ending" that was probably put in place after test audiences hated the original ending. Halle Berry is great in the movie, but it is far from a fun film, or performance, to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film plays out like a high-art porno with a series of explicit sex-scenes punctuated by harsh comments and actions from some of the most hateful people in movie history.Berry's performance doesn't hold a candle to Tilda Swinton's in the same year's "The Deep End" and yet she somehow managed a Best Actress award for a role that was essentially in support when Swinton (onscreen 90 %) didn't even rate a nomination. Berry isn't terrible but her performance truly isn't much better than the average woman-in-peril in a Lifetime flick. Thornton, on the other hand, completely carries the picture. He really is the only reason to see it, altho a shocking early scene featuring Ledger as his son and a humorous later one involving his vile father (Boyle) parenthesise the story to good effect. The leads are simply two pathetic people drawn together by convoluted tragedies.</fullReview>

Director Marc Forster did a good job to limit the running time of the movie. Strong performance from Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton. Anyway, the Oscar to Hally Berry is too exaggerated but she won it because there were no competitive movies this year.It is not a must see but rent it at least. If you liked this one I recommend another death row film "The Green Mile" or "The Hurricane" that are much better.Final vote: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well-intentioned film with great acting, especially by Heath Ledger who communicates internal anguish without the usual verbal explications. But the film ultimately doesn't work. The two protagonists (Thornton and Berry) suffer incredible personal losses, yet their grief lasts about half a second. Thornton's character metamorphoses from about forty years of ingrained history to profound insight in the space of a movie second. And Berry's supposed grief over the loss of a child (not to mention a husband as well) melts away with one shot of Jack Daniels. Nice try -- but it rings hollow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like father like son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about Hank, played by Billy Bob Thorton, who caused the suicide of the son that he never loved, all because his son did not live to his standard, set for him by his father when he grew up. Even though he was indifferent to the killing, his eventual probe into his son's death causes him to look into himself and eventual realization that it was his whole self that was at fault. He then goes on to purge every aspect of his life which caused him to be that person he now despises. On the way, he meets up with Leticia, played by Halle Berry, who is also in a state emptiness. Their gradual reliance on each other eventually leads to something more, in which they encounter obstacles they have to overcome.Billy Bob Thorton does a pretty good job in his role as Hank, showing his redemption from this closet bigoted misogynist to someone completely opposite. Halle Berry is decent, nothing Oscar worthy though. The emotions conveyed are raw, with nothing sentimentalized.I somehow feel that the script did not delve deep enough into Hank's inner self and emotions in order for him to take upon his quest to purge out the devils within him. Even though his encounter with Leticia was accidental and the buildup of the relationship was gradual. A person with that kind of attitude towards blacks and women will take a bit more to overcome than what was shown on the screen. Billy Bob Thorton could mope all he wants, but that will not convince us that he became a changed person. Somehow, it is as if the middle third of the film has been edited out or something.In all, still an OK film, just not a totally convincing one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just say that I'm a HUGE fan of Halle's. Now, while this was indeed an interesting movie with a captivating storyline, and the actors were great, I definitely have seen her do better. Don't get me wrong, she is well deserved for the Oscar that she won, but I really think that she has done better films than this to deserve it. Losing Isiah was one of them, as well as Alex Ailey's "Queen". I think she is a phenomenal actress, but she should have won this award for some of her past movies, not this one. I'm starting to believe that she won it for the sex scene-lol. Also, I know there was some startling controversy due to this scene, however, I don't agree with this simply because of the race issue, I just thought that she was too good of an actress to have to bare her T &amp; A like she did. I mean, it's Halle Berry for Godsakes! She not some B rated actress like Carmen Electra or one of these other fake Hollywood puffs! Anyway, check the movie out, it is worth seeing despite my criticisms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is overall just fair. I think it's main problem is that there's not really a story. Not really. The acting is good but there's just no story to support the acting. Halle Berry is a stunningly beautiful woman, and a fine actress, although her acting in the part just before the "sex scene" where she's supposed to be a little drunk just seems a little wooden. Billy Bob Thornton is a great actor but doesn't really shine in this. Peter Boyle does a great job as the racist father. Heath Ledger isn't in the film very much, but does an OK job too. But where is the story? I've seen a lot of comments about the "sex scene" and I think I have to agree that it's the best part of the film; a sad commentary indeed. The acting is good, but even that can't save a film with no substance to the story. I think it's a good one to get if the film you REALLY went to the video store to get isn't available. But send the kiddies away before you watch it - the sexual scenes are very graphic! Overall, a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

One hour into the movie I was hoping I had watched 'Joy Ride' for the second time. I didn't like or dislike any of the characters, this is a movie that with the exception of a couple of moments arouses no feelings. I didn't care about these people one way or another, and the shame is that the basis of the story is loaded with potential, except they didn't know how to exploit it. Halle Berry is OK but and Oscar for this, C'mon ! Every character in this movie moves as if they were underwater, I felt like I should have watched this with my snorkel on.

		<fullReview>While there is a lot more that happens in this movie, there are some possible spoilers discussed below.Halle Berry is a beautiful woman, which becomes clear in the main sex scene. But how she got there in the first place is beyond belief.The jumps in the story, the incredible coincidences, the unexplained anger toward family members: they are all too much to stomach. The movie was 112 minutes long, and would have to be 180 to cover the plot holes left. I was hoping that it might be saved by a "Crying Game" revelation that Peter Boyle was the grandfather of Halle Berry, but it unfortunately didn't materialize.The movie starts slowly and seemingly disjointedly. These connections are quickly made, but others are then revealed. Why did Boyle's wife commit suicide? What happened to Thornton's wife? Why did Thornton hate his son so much? Why did Berry not smoke (any cigarettes) in the last 80 minutes? How did a black child in a racist town whose family was about to be evicted acquire dozens (or, by inference, thousands)of candy bars? Why did Berry go THAT balistic on her overweight son...after all, it's not like his weight suddenly quadrupled. And despite another review, *I* can't understand through her facial expressions why she would resignedly stay with Thornton after discovering that he was her (hated) husband's executioner. Besides, if she hated her husband, as introduced in the jail scene, why would she have been angry with Thornton as shown by her destruction of the drawings at the end of the movie?And for this, Berry became the first black woman to win an Oscar? Well, it's a beautiful statue, and she IS a beautiful woman...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, the acting was not more than I expected. Halle and Billy do a "good" job acting in this movie. I might even say they did a great job. But, was it Oscar worthy? Halle delivers her usual acting excellence, but this movie did not grip me the way an Oscar movie should.The movie is about two bad parents who make decisions that damage their son's lives. They both need redemption in more way than one, and end up finding it together.For some reason the sex scenes were presented with elaborate detail. I did not expect the scenes to be that graphic, and was puzzled as to why they were so long and "in your face". Shoot me, but personally I think Halle went too far. Yes, her body is the epitome of female perfection! But, were the intensity of the scenes needed? Late night premium cable channels have nothing on Monster's Ball in that category, and that surprised me.I am an adamant Halle supporter and fan. However, this performance was somewhat short of deserving the Oscar for best female performance. Other females performances that year were better. Perhaps Halle was rewarded for taking such risk with sexually strong content. Yet, I would rather Halle get the award for powerful acting not for risk taking and fulfilling male fantasies worldwide.-- DP.</fullReview>

Her raw acting in the sex scenes are surprisingly very believable, and she manages to portray a character that is conflictingly real. Billy Bob is also up to par, but for a better picture all together see "The Man Who Wasn't There". Don't think for a second though, that Berry should or will win the Oscar over Spacek's riveting performance in "In the Bedroom".The director was unfortunately not able to capitalize on these performances and stumbles from scene to scene, never really showing the depth and motivation of his characters and not able to adequately pace the action and the events of the movie. The only moment he shines is during the execution scene, which he did brilliantly.Best Original Screenplay? The story is somewhat weak, with too much death, not enough depth, but the director could have brough it back up, which he didn't. As a whole though, there is definitely something vibrant or poignant missing from the script. Finally, if it had intended to be otherwise, I could understand, but the two main characters are suppose to fall in love, which they don't. They are simply together by comfort and convenience. This is fine, and it happens often in real life. The only problem I have with it: Don't call it Love!!Halle, better luck next time.</fullReview>

Billy Bob Thorton also gave a great performance, worthy of his Golden Globe Nomination. Peter Boyle, Sean Combs, and Heath Ledger each did quite well for their small roles. The acting was great all-around. However, the plot was too thin. It was too simple. And the movie was too long. It felt as if two guys wrote a five-page short story over their morning coffee and it was made into a movie. It should have been about half an hour shorter. The cinematography was both great and not that good. The Execution scenes in the opening of the movie were done better than any other I have seen (though I have not seen that many). I rated this movie with a six because the potential for greatness was not used in the plot. If not for the fabulous acting, this would have gotten a 4 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does contain spoilers:I am often amused when certain films are released and are lionized by the critics and ignored by the public. These are the kinds of films that critics see that make them feel they are kings of their own castles. These are the kinds of films that make them feel as though they are the wise in a land filled with commoners that know little or nothing at all about film. But ask yourself this question, is a film made to become a critical success or is it made to appease an audience? I have always believed that the best films offer an equal amount to each side. I think it is wise for films to offer some material that will make you think long after the film is over but it is also prudent to give the audience what it wants to see. After all, at the end of day, we all want to see movies so that we may be entertained.Monster's Ball is a film in the tradition of Affliction, Last Tango In Paris and The Pledge. These are the types of films where great actors take on roles they normally shun in the name of garnering some Oscar nods. They may be at a lull in their career or they are just financially secure enough that they can do something a little unorthodox. These are the films that have a pretty standard thought process behind them, contrary to what critics will have you believe. The guidelines to films like this can range from anything from sex to cure loneliness, middle-aged crisis in a small town or problems in your life stemming from your own pedigree. They all work by the numbers and all are praised as being "landmark films", or "a daring and risky effort by all involved", or "mesmerizing....(said actor) shows range and versatility that he/she has never displayed before". And really it is all just a publicity ploy to get you to watch a film that you may not have ordinarily flocked to in the first place. Monster's Ball falls into this category.Billy Bob Thorton plays a second generation prison guard named Hank Growtowski, who cares for his retired prison guard father and also lives with his son, who is also a prison guard at the same prison and under his father's command. His son, Sonny is portrayed by Heath Ledger and as the film opens, they are preparing to execute a black man named Lawrence Musgrove, played by Sean Combs. Sonny has grown up with racism all around him. When you live with a grandfather and a father that have racist tendencies, it is hard to grow up and become anything but a racist. But Sonny doesn't end up like his elders and regularly plays with the younger black children that live down the way and even tries to show humanity Musgrove as he is living his last night before his execution. Sonny has a hard time with the execution and messes up protocol and is degraded, berated and chastised by his father in front of the other prison guards. His father thinks of him as a disgrace and once he finishes his diatribe at the prison, he continues it at his home. Perhaps being pushed one to many times, Sonny is prepared for his father's assault at home and this time he turns the tables and ultimately gives his father something that he will never forget. If this is the path the film stayed with and chose to focus on, I feel it would have been much better. To give Hank his awakening through Sonny alone would have been a little more intriguing than what transpires in the next segment of the film.Halle Berry plays Luticia Musgrove, the wife of Lawrence. She comes to visit her husband in jail only for the benefit of her overweight child. Once the man is executed, she holds no love lost for the man that probably gave her years of truculent days and tumultuous nights. From here, Luticia and Hank somehow manage to find each other and through these two characters we have the recrudescence of Hank. He sees things in a different light after meeting her and at the end all is well that ends well.The key to this film is the performances. Although I think the film is adequate, if not spectacular, the performances by the two leads are what makes the film as intriguing as it is. Billy Bob Thorton has proven himself to be one of the best actors working today. He will probably get an Oscar nod for either this film or for his work in The Man Who Wasn't There. He perhaps should get a nod for both. He is that good. He has a smooth presentation and understanding of who he's portraying in the film and there is not one second in the film when I didn't think the man I was watching wasn't Hank Growtowski. Thorton plays the role to perfection. Berry on the other hand is equally as impressive as the scurrilous and destitude Luticia. This is a woman that exudes desperation. She can't keep a job, she is losing her house, her ex husband has been executed and her son is eating himself to death. She seems to be in an eternal down spiral, and anyone who has ever been through a rough time will certainly relate to her character. When things go bad, they often seem as though they are never going to improve. Berry makes you empathize with this character. A perfect scene is when she gives a customer a bill for $3.94 and he gives her $4.00 and then vapidly tells her to keep the change. This is a woman that hated her job before at a busy diner where she probably got a paultry two or three dollars for a tip and now she has sunk to the bottom of the barrel and has to thank a customer for giving her eight cents. As they say, you have to sink to bottom before you can start your ascent.Monster's Ball is the kind of film that won't be given a wealth of recognition, and although it is a good film, I found it to be uneven. There were times when I was rivetted and completely interested in the story and there times when I was debating on whether or not I should duck out and go see Mothman Prophecies ( best film of 2002, and will be hands down when the year ends ) for the fourth time. There is a story worth telling here but at times it just stops being entertaining and it borders on lifelessness. I enjoyed watching the relationship with Sonny and his father and I also enjoyed Luticia's struggles but there were areas such as the conflict with Hank and his dad and some of the metaphors in the film that just seemed tired and old. I mean how many times can you tell the story of racism before you say to yourself that you have seen it all before?Monster's Ball is not a bad film, in fact, there are probably more positive qualities about it than there are negative but to be labelled as the best film of the year is a farce. What it boils down to a racist white guy becomes a non racist white guy after he rolls in the hay with a beautiful black girl. That is really the gist of it.I would like to see Thorton and Berry get some recognition at the Oscar's and even Heath Ledger should get a nod for best supporting actor. But in the end, you have to realize that when films like this generally get ignored by the public, it is because we know more than critics think we do. There is a reason why films like Armageddon, E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park and Rambo make oodles of money and why films like Affliction and Monster's Ball struggle to find an audience on video. To say this is the best film of the year isn't really that much of a stretch seeing what was released this year was generally average at best. But to ignore films like Lord of the Rings and Vanilla Sky is asinine and unfair. You can't always say that just because a film has a budget nearing the 100 million dollar mark that it has to be worse than a film with nearly 10 times less the cost. Monster's Ball is okay, just don't expect it to connect with you the way others have praised.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a year when movies were hyped as never before and failed to deliver as never before...this movie takes the cake. I thought Ocean's Eleven,A Beautiful Mind and Lord of the Rings were disappointing...They are Masterpieces compared to this piece of garbage. I payed the most attention during this movie during the credits...I had to see if anyone would have the nerve to have their name associated with this production. The plot is ridiculous...we are shown a series of extreme situations, where there is little of no background given...then the characters accept these strange occurrences as if they are natural. Billy Bob Thornton gives a singularly flat, one-dimensional lackluster performance. At least Halle Berry looks nice and shows some energy. The best performance in the movie clearly goes to " Puff Daddy " Combs. This movie was so bad there were people in the audience here in Manhattan that were laughing at inappropriate times which was entertaining in itself. Possibly with better writers and another half an hour added to the film to make the plot believable and comprehensible this could have been an interesting film...as it is in reality is A WASTE OF TIME.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A grueling film. Don't worry; the two protagonists, played by Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton, eventually find a sense of peace and redemption. But, and this is a big "but," not before both of them suffer through the most ridiculously heavy-handed series of tragic events ever committed to celluloid, which actually begin to become funny after a while (let's see, maybe one of them can develop a brain tumor now, that will REALLY get people's tears pumping). It's kind of like Dick Cheney's shooting accident; you keep wondering how worse it can possibly get before the boundaries of credibility disappear all together.Berry gives a fine performance, if fine performance means she was convincing shoving her boobs in Billy Bob Thornton's face (convinced me!) Her performance during her Oscar acceptance speech was better than anything you see from her here. Thornton, for his part, is good, but he's always good. The finest scene in the film comes when he drops his bastard of a dad off at a retirement home and decides never to visit him again (there, that's this movie's idea of a happy ending, if you're wondering).And before there was "Brokeback Mountain," Heath Ledger proved to the world that, hey, maybe he can act after all. Too bad his character's in the movie for about ten minutes.This is one of those movies that a liberal white Hollywood fell all over themselves to honor so that Spike Lee would shut up about how there are no movies for black people. I agree with Spike--African Americans are woefully underrepresented in today's movie marketplace. But come on, we can do better than this, can't we? Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This overpraised film didn't work for me. It was poorly conceived and written, sloppily directed and the acting was merely adequate. The unsympathetic characters are not fleshed out and the only one I cared about was the overweight child and he is killed off. The character transitions are not developed. The Thornton character goes from being a racist to one of sensitivity and compassion almost overnight without much to demonstrate what preciptated the change. The audience is told that the Thornton character buys a gas station yet you never see the guy going to work or overseeing it, all he does it walk around town and eats chocolate ice cream. The graphic sex scenes, as they are filmed, are gratuitous and not necessary to characterization or to further the plot but only for sensationalism and to garner attention. Halle Berry's performance is adequate but very overrated and certainly not of award caliber.</fullReview>

Too bad--she just lets it go. That is really sad that a black actress wins an oscar for basicly screwing a white male. Is that what it takes to win an oscar these days?

		<shortDescription>Whitewashed movie about racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie.... after starting off promising it ends up being yet another Hollywood movie, straining the limits of credibility and boring you after the first hour. This movie is Hollywood's prototypical whitewashing of the bad to create a clean, happy, wonderful solution that makes us all happy to be alive and together, no matter what our race or creed. One second there's hate, the next moment there's love. This movie does little to explain how this could occur and the fact that Hallie Berry needs to bare a LOT of boobs and butt and do her best to act like a porn queen should tell you all you need to know about the value of the script. The fact that Ebert and several other "critics" gave this movie such a high rating shouldn't fool you. It's superficial a movie as there ever was, masked by some fine acting. Perhaps Ebert was drenched after watching some rather distastefully filmed sex scenes, draped in the guise of "artistic filming." Be honest with yourself. If you're renting this movie, it's only to see what it might be like to "do it" with Hallie. Otherwise... you will leave unsatisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Halle Berry got an Oscar for this ?!?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I probably completely missed the point and I probably simply didn't get it, but it is pretty amazing Halle Berry got an Oscar for this movie ! Were all the other actresses on a holiday ? She does nothing more than looking angry and unhappy in this movie and besides a couple of sex scenes even hardly moves ! In the few scenes in which she has a couple of lines, she acts she is drunk (and probably was, too).This movie is slow (which is Okay), has characters that are as shallow as they can be (which is bad) and has no "body" at all (which is terrible). Conversations take an average of 12.5 seconds and usually make no sense at all.In fact, the characters are sooo dull and such a bunch of losers you sometimes would like to kick their buts to get them going. Agreed, it is about a sad story and of course they don't feel very happy, but the way they are just standing there and looking to something or somebody is sometimes too hard to bare. It takes more than an hour before somebody smiles and says more than a couple of lines in one scene ! There is some nice photography and the music sets a nice move, but that's waaay to little to make up for the rest of the movie.Seems most of the people like this movie, but I was really disappointed with it. "Sublime acting" ? "Impressive, realistic drama" ?? "If you like this we also recommend The Godfather" ??? Are we talking about the same movie here ? Somebody commented this movie on this board as "A film that allows the viewer to use her intelligence". Well, that's probably what I was missing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoilers included- Rather unimpressive film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to reiterate SPOILERS ARE PREVALENT IN THIS: I know I may take both departures and derivatives from other comments, but to be honest I really had little patience to read all 30+ pages of previous comments. I had seen this film with no preconceived notions- an Oscar does not make a film good, anymore than a lack of Oscars makes a film bad. But this film really seemed undeserving of the awards it was given.I have heard complaints about pace- but that was not the issue. A film can be paced slowly yet be effective, though this film really did not seem to merit its excessively drawn out pace, even if it was supposed to be a "psychological investigation" of character. Which brings me to the next point.While I definitely appreciate and value character studies in movies, a film is penultimately supposed to tell a story. The character studies were interesting, yes. However, they were equally as unrealistic. Having grown up near an area that is considered among the most segregated cities in the country (that is Milwaukee)- I can appreciate the need to address issues of race, racism, and the rifts and closures that occur as a result. But as far as characters go, and having been exposed to the vast diversity of attitudes that are attached to race where I came from, I can safely say that the changes in attitude were genuinely unrealistic. Yes, the two main characters undergo changes. . .but why? Thorton expresses incredibly racist attitudes throughout the film; he is needy, but that does not adequately explain or address why he would reform long-standing life attitudes in a matter of a day or so. I can accept the coincidences of the two meeting as well- that is often the nature of small town environments. People in close proximities with small populations will pass by each other. But that being the environment, I find it equally as bizarre that Berry would not have known, or if not ignored for that matter, that he was her husband's executioner. Whether she had positive feelings for Combs' character or not, she should have been aware and had that factor in to her behavior towards him. Likewise, too many factors either fade away, or remain unexplained. The relationship between Berry and her husband is tenuous at best, with no explanation for his imprisonment and impending death. Why Berry loses her job is equally unaccounted for. Since her lateness, etc. was known to occur regularly- some cause or rationale may have been useful. I realize the direction wanted us to understand the nature of extreme poverty, but at least give credible versions of it. Make-up or no, I did not believe her class status.The inclusion of sex in a film does not bother me. Since a large portion of what I grew up with was foreign films where sexual themes and nudity were not regarded with such shock, sex does not really offend me. However, in this film, the sex seemed like a forced addition and utterly unnecessary; while I appreciate attempts at realism, the scene really seemed gratuitous and like a waste, compared to time actually explaining, or at least ACCOUNTING, for the changes in their characters. The mere fact that Thorton cares nothing and acts coldly at his son's death, yet suddenly reforms without apparent cause or psychological introspection is almost laughable. Physical attraction can certainly occur between a racist and a person of race, but that does not ultimately change one's attitude. This is no love story- at best a story of intense needs- both physical and psychological- uniting people. . .but again, for no "good reason". Conversely, Berry's transformation from utterly aggressive- to the point of abusive in the case of her son- to utterly passive seems quite unlikely. Even her apparent abuse is not well explained- it is not that she would have been unaware her son was utterly obese before that point. Likewise, the mere fact he has the capability of having candy stashed everywhere I find suspect. In a family where having money just to live is a problem, this provides a logical fallacy.For those who did see realism in this, I apologize, but I could not despite my best efforts. Since my key interest in film ultimately is story, with a film that is attempting at least to tell something realistic, this film falls incredibly short. I respect what it attempts, but it certainly does not achieve. We are given coincidences outside the usual realm to suspend our disbelief toward, and even that aside, the characters fall into an almost formulaic relationship with little or no reason to do so. As interesting (albeit idealistic) a concept as it is, a white racist does not suddenly change when confronted with a beautiful black woman. A father who hates his child is not suddenly changed by a grieving mother. Undoing systematic ideologies like intense racism take more than a few days, or even weeks. Undoing intrinsic personality factors- even less likely, or less quickly. Thus stated, this film genuinely did disappoint me. A lot. A character may be interesting, but the story is not there. Lacking in such powerful ways, I was going to give one star, but I give it two due to its attempts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Could they put any MORE drama in ONE movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seldom seen a film that impressed and fascinated me so much while watching it, but actually turned out a major disappointment after analyzing it afterwards. Throughout its entire playtime, Monster's Ball FEELS like a brilliant film but it leaves a gigantic empty feeling in your stomach when you come to think that the drama and the characters you felt so connected with are actually depth-less and unsupported. It is in fact praiseworthy that director Marc Foster manages to "fool" us during the whole film with utterly simply tricks, as you simply stare at the story's beauty and intensity with great respect and admiration without realizing it's totally fake sentiment you're witnessing. Monster's Ball basically has one trump that makes it all the more appealing for true film buffs: the entire production feels very anti-Hollywood! The tone quite unique and some of the subplots and character drawings are highly unlike to feature in a big production like this. Sober, depressing, modest?and even though the story is highly unrealistic and far-fetched, you experience it as a true event simply because it's brought to you so well. Director Marc Foster patiently takes his time to come to the point what the movie actually is about (namely: the unusual force of attraction between a Southern white prison guard and an Afro-American mother whose husband was executed on the electric chair) but that is a sublimely elaborated element, as the viewer really feels that what drives the protagonists together is agony, loneliness and death. A lot of suffering takes place before Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and Leticia (Hally Berry) finally find some consolation and hope with each other. Probably even a little too much, as I rarely some much bitterness featuring in one film.Now, what exactly is wrong with this picture? Because all the things I summed up so far only increase the suspicion that "Monster's Ball" is an excellent film and a must see for every self-respecting fan of cinema. Well, that's only half true. While the audience is developing sympathy and compassion for the characters' situations, the screenplay fails to enlighten why exactly you do so. I can easily state this with punctual examples but then ? of course ? you'll be reading huge SPOILERS! We're witnessing how a death row-condemned father (good performance by Sean Combs) is saying goodbye to his family and, although it's very sincere, you don't know whether this sequence is justified. What has he done? Does he even deserve forgiveness? Same goes for the painful relation between the embittered prison guard and his emotionally unstable son Sonny (Heath Ledger). Their interactions are cold and aggressive but not once you're given feedback on what exactly caused this. The abrupt ending of this subplot fills you up (whether immediately or afterwards) with disappointment because you feel the sentiment is exploited and the matter could have been arranged in a different way. There are more examples to state that "Monster's Ball' lacks depth but I suggest you see for yourself. Still, I too wish to recommend this film to as many people as possible. Only not for the obvious argument that the story is heart-breaking but simply because it's a professionally shot film. Especially Roberto Schaefer's cinematography is outstanding and shows you camera-angles of which you didn't know they existed. The acting also deserves all the praise it can get. Halle Berry does a fine job but at times it feels like she's hankering too anxiously after her Oscar. If there's anyone here who should have won an Oscar for his performance, it's Billy Bob Thornton but the members of the Academy shamelessly make a rule out of overlooking this brilliant actor. Worth mentioning as well is the remarkable role of Peter Boyle as Thornton's ultra-racist dad. This fine veteran actor did his best work back in the seventies, with movies like "Hardcore", "F.I.S.T" and "Young Frankenstein" on his repertoire.</fullReview>

The rest of the movie is an array of well defined distinct situations that seem forced, manufactured by the writers to lead the inexperienced viewer to certain emotional paths.The reason for this movie's existence is 'American Beauty'. After 'American Beauty's success at the Oscars and since Hollywood couldn't have had a sequel of that (because if they could, they would), they made 'Monster's Ball'.Furthermore there is no explanation for the main theme of the movie, which is the male protagonist's change of attitude. I mean what was it, horniness? The script is amateurish to say the least.And Halle's performance... Why was it worth an Oscar?

		<shortDescription>A good story but so cold...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monster's Ball has been directed by a Swiss born film maker Marc Forster. That, maybe, explains why Monster's Ball sits on a solid story but like a swiss cheese, is full of holes. And this cheese has no real flavor and the director serves it cold. So cold that the story lacks emotion and feelings. And who is the King of hidden emotion in movies today? Billy Bob Thornton! He plays the same cold character over and over. The only difference in this movie, he smiles at time and even laughs in one scene. That's an improvement over his part in The Man Who Wasn't There. In Monster's Ball Hank (Thornton) never shows his emotion. Never. Not even when he says to his son that he hates him, not even when he takes his old sick father to a home, not even when he makes love to Leticia (Halle Berry) Nothing transpires from his inner feelings. Conflicts are based on on human emotion of all sort: rage, happiness, envy, fear, craving, serenity, love, hatred, etc. Hank (Thornton) lives through all of them but you have to guess his frame of mind as the story evolves. Sometimes he talks about it. That is not enough. Audiences do not want to know they want to see.Halle Berry is good and credible in her part. But, by all means she do not deliver a "performance".Therefore it seems odd that she got nominated as best actress. But I'm afraid that's all she will get: a nomination.The most serious flaw makes the story not too credible. Since Hank and Leticia live in the same small city, not very far from the penitentiary, and Hank knows her last name which is the same then her husband jailed and Leticia never asks what Hank does in life. Odd, very odd!!! Even after Leticia shows Hank drawings done by her jailed husband Hank still doesn't click. That's highly improbable. They will eventually find out about each other but for those who haven't see the movie yet I don't want to be a spoiler. Now Marc Forster, second time director, shows his lack of experience so much, that he tries to create some visual of his own by using erratic and non interesting angles and uses too often the split focus technique when two persons talk. It really takes the focus away from the dialogue.For all these reasons and more I give a 4/10. Like I said, this movie was sitting on a great script too bad Forster did not deliver.

		<fullReview>Perhaps the buzz was too great and therefore expectations were too high, but this film did absolutely nothing for me. This movie had enough drama and angst to appeal to my taste, yet the movie left me completely flat. The progression of the story was positively sloth-like and the plot holes were enormous. What should have been wrenching dramatic scenes ended up being distracting by poor histrionics and enough pauses to make Harold Pinter proud. I found myself watching the clock several times, and literally forcing myself to finish the movie, which is extremely rare for this film addict, and when the conclusion finally occurred, I was left completely empty.The performances were fine, but Halle Berry certainly was not Oscar worthy. Nicole Kidman, of whom I was not a fan until Moulin Rouge should have taken the statue last year for turning out a performance that significantly exceeded Berry's in Monster's Ball. If you're curious, like I was, watch this film. But be sure to have a steady flow of caffeine handy.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been brilliant but....it isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iv just finished watching this film and it left me SO disappointed as I had really high expectations.First off Halle Berry is brilliant in the movie and you really buy into her character and her emotions and heart-break, she's effortless in what appears to be her comfort zone. Billy Bob Thornton is brilliant in the movie also, I've not seen him in a lot of movies but based on this I have become a fan, he's very convincing and again effortless. My problem with this movie is that it failed to be compelling and the story seemed rushed. The movie is very dreary and depressing, it plods along, the story lacks any real depth, there's no outstanding part in the film that makes you sit up and take notice. They infamous sex scene made the film no better and felt un-justified especially the long length of time it was on, a talented actress like Halle Berry lowering herself to do something like that made me cringe in all honesty. They could have made it shorter or cut away after they started they initial moves. The oral sex scene again felt totally un-necessary and just took away from the drama and emotion in the film.I found myself relieved when it ended after a very weak ending that left me wondering why I wasted my time watching the movie, damn high expectations! Did Halle deserve an Oscar, I personally don't think so, she was very good but not outstanding she was in her comfort zone and didn't really push herself to an Oscar worthy performance. She played the role by numbers nothing more, nothing less a thousand other actresses could have played the part, it wasn't a stretch for her in anyway in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really not worth your time....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you attempt to watch this movie be warned that it contains a VERY EXPLICIT sex scene.I was excited to see this movie. However, I had to struggle to sit through the entire movie. I am beyond stunned that Halle Berry won an Oscar for her role in it. I found the scene in the living room between her and Billy Bob to be disturbing, disgusting and practically a visual assault! I had not been aware that such an explicit sex scene was involved or I would not have watched it at all! It is a very dark movie that could have been good but to be honest that one scene ruined the entire movie for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fastest shooter in the west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget about Halle Berry's "notorious" sex scene for which she got the Oscar: if sex scenes were the measure to win Oscars my shelves would be groaning. No, our Heath steals the show here too, because when he disappears halfway through the film, you could safely switch off (which would spare you Ms Berry's writhings) and still savor the film's subject matters of racism, the death penalty and oppression within the family unit. But what really made us guffaw on our couch was Heath Ledger's opening scene where he meets a prostitute in a sleazy motel room for their regular tryst. It surely must rank as one of the movie history's shortest sex scenes: from arousal to deflation in less than two minutes, including a drink beforehand and a wash afterwards. I mean, speak of rising to the occasion, it sure wasn't obvious in his demeanour - or swelling in his camouflage pants - that he was glad to see her. Humping her doggy style over the table must have been hotter than his efforts on Jake's arse as it only took nanoseconds before he hauled up his white underpants again over his fetching backside - they hadn't even been fully pulled down for the full delectation we old perverts are accustomed to. And how did his dick go down so fast to be able to stuff it back into his pants without any risk it'd get caught in the zipper? He truly is the fastest shooter in the West. I hope Jake got more satisfaction out of him in the tent on that mountain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbalanced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tackles several highly charged themes at once (death penalty, racism, dysfunctional families, suicide), and inevitably stumbles in doing so. Dramatically it is seriously unbalanced by the accumulation of violent deaths and high drama in the gripping first half, offset by the highly undramatic and very intimate focus on the budding Berry-Thornton relationship in the second. Both parts are separated by a needlessly protracted and gratuitously explicit sex scene which I found rather tasteless and quite annoying. Halle Berry's performance is powerful, Thornton's less so; the one character that I felt truly involved with was Sonny, played impressively by Heath Ledger, but he vanishes from the scene after half an hour or so.The final scene is so clich that I couldn't believe my eyes - all of a sudden we're in Disneyland. In all, a film that is interesting for its prison scenes, but doesn't quite know where to go from there; apparently sincere in its intentions, the story just tapers off. Towards the end, my mind wandered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monster's Ball is a film that, in my view, depicts the sexual side of love at its fullest.A problem I found with this film is that everyone is so sad all the time. I mean, COME ON!!, can someone please just smile for a second. I can understand that it is a sad film and nothing goes right, but there could've been at least one happy event that could've kept the film alive.Despite that.....beautiful, compelling, dramatic, and stunning. I give this film a 6-star rating mainly because of the performances, especially Halle Berry. She was spectacular and couldn't have deserved that Oscar more.And of course, you can't review this film without at least mentioning the sex scene. I don't really know what to think of it. This film has some of the most erotic sexual content I have ever seen, but it's not a bad thing, but wasn't really necessary. I'm satisfied that it had a sex scene but maybe not that.......strong.And the ending seemed a little sudden. It was like hanging out a wet towel in the sun and expecting it to dry in the next 5 minutes.But overall, pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers, maybe. Though spoiling might be a good thing . . .I rank this as a 3 only for Peter Boyle--what a change from the acidic Frank Barone!--whom I've admired since Young Frankenstein. So Billy Bob Thornton guards murderer P Diddy, walks him to the execution chamber, drives his own son to suicide, screws Halle Berry, puts his father in a home, and names a gas station after his girlfriend. Much has been said about this film dealing with racism, loss, sorrow, redemption, but I have seen better on all fronts. The graphic sex scene seemed unnecessary and is used just as a selling point, IMO. Heath Ledger was a diamond here, but bows out far too early.</fullReview>

Thornton rose a bit above the role, but everyone left it what they must have found in it, one-sided, static, mouthing out platitudes about the worrisome naure of race in america.

		<shortDescription>It's such a pathetic excuse for a "movie."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~*~*Minor Spoiler~*~*I only put the word movie in quotations because I do not consider 'Monster's Ball' to be a movie in the least bit. A movie is something that has to be somewhat entertaining, somewhat interesting, somewhat worth the time that it takes for me to watch it. 'Monster's Ball' wasn't any of those and I found it to be one of the worst projects of 2001. Scratch that and make it one of the worst of all time.I'm going to come down hard on this film (there, I didn't use "movie") because it truly is a piece of garbage. I am so tired of the movie companies being under the impression that just because a well known, highly paid and recognized actor is thrown into a film, it will have to be great. That is so not the case. Anyway, let me actually get to my review.I like Billy Bob Thornton. I don't like Halle Berry. Mix these two together and what we have is a disaster. Thornton turns in a less than average performance. At times, his acting just plain stinks. I'd like to say that I was still interested in him because of his looks, but oh, what a mess. I have just one word for Berry: Oscar!? How in the world did she manage to take home an Oscar? For this performance? I'm sorry, but did the Academy and I have alternate versions of the same movie? She is completely unbearable. I thought that any movie where Penelope Cruz was involved was terrible (and they are), but Berry is so darn annoying. Unlike Thornton, she is at least somewhat believable at times. I had enough of her crying though after fifteen minutes. You know, I think that the only reason she won that statue is because someone on the committee just liked that scene in which everyone keeps commenting on. Honestly, she won it because if the Academy kept moving at the pace they were moving at, they would have soon gotten a racist card thrown at them. They have to cover their tales just like everybody else. So, those nauseating credits roll and I find out that Heath Ledger is in 'Ball.' Goody! My hopes of him saving this trash were soon killed as his character faced the same fate. What a shame. Who else do I feel the need to comment on? Oh, yeah, Sean Combs. He's dropped the 'Puffy', so I know he's serious. You know what? He was probably the best actor in this film. Yup, I actually said that.The plot is paper thin and runs out of steam practically ten minutes into the film. I was so bored by it all. Just when I thought that it wasn't capable of getting any worse, the ending came. I was twirling my hair or filing my nails or something to pass the time, I looked away for a split second, and the next thing I know the credits are rolling again. It was absolutely terrible. I thought that I could get all the way through this review without commenting on that now famous scene, but I can't. Thornton's and Berry's love scene was a little uncomfortable, to say the least. I was relieved to realize that I was watching it by myself instead of with somebody else where I would feel the need to break into conversation at that given moment. Anyway, I wouldn't exactly call that scene pornographic, though it was quite explicit. That's just another thing that I hated about this film. The director seemed to think that a sex scene was the only direction to go in; that it would save the film in a way. Why?So, I think it's pretty clear where I stand on this picture. The acting was horrible, the cast just didn't 'jive', the plot was boring, the whole thing's overrated, and I still can't get over how Berry won that Oscar. 'Monster's Ball' is a horrible, horrible film and I wouldn't suggest anybody see it. Ever. PS - If there was one good thing about this whole disaster, it was that I didn't fork out $3 or so at the video store; I caught it on Cinemax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** "Monster's ball" is too slow, too "hard-to-buy", with an amazingly poor and untrue dialog -- much more so for a picture showing as anti-Hollywod realism. For those who have not yet seen it, skip the following, as I just have to talk deep about the script. Consider, for instance, (1) the first encounter between Hank and Leticia (Thornton and Berry), after her son died. It it *so* unreal that they won't mention the tragic incident but the dialog is much like a teenager trying to pick up a girl on the road to school or college. (2) All characters take about 2-3 seconds to respond, as if "stoned", and when they do they whisper; most of the dialog is whispering. (3) Why, *why*, the emphasis on the curious "bowl of ice cream" breakfast of Hank, and he says he would like a bowl of ice-cream after a very bold sex scene..that's Leslie Nielsenish!!!. (4) We don't have a clue as why Leticia's son is *so* fat. (5) The 2 sex scenes of a shared hooker with both Hank and his hated son take place exactly in the same way (unattached, un-emotional, un-physical, however gruesomely "contra-natura") and it's so phony way that it's insulting to our intelligence. The hookers takes out her blouse, without a bra immediately and stays topless, however in both cases neither of the men ever touches her breasts. (6) There are so many unnecesary long trivial scenes (cars approaching a house, main character blurred with an on purpose out-of-focus style and listening character fully focused in back. (7) The movie is soooo slow. (8) It is rather startling that people like Ebert or Berardinelli did not comment on this. (9) The definition of the characters and personalities is so circus-like: the very sordid lightning, enviroment, etc. praised by critics is exactly what it makes it look so circus-lie. The line of thought is "...hmm, photography is too dark, characters hardly speak, voices are heard 95 percent of the time in whispers...ohhh, this "must" be a great "a-la foreign film" movie, thus, it "must" be very good. (10) Everything looks *so* theatrical and stiff. (11) In short, if script-writers tried to convince the Academy and Herbert, Berardinelli and others this has to be great because it's dark, un-Hollywoodish and bold, and thus it should be good (?)...oh-kee-do, they succeeded. (12) Halle is fine, yeah, ok. But that's about all there is to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anybody question why the movie opens in Louisiana -- the terrain that can be nowhere on earth but Angola, La., the inland ferries and prison guards' uniforms are the tip-offs -- but suddenly moves to Georgia in mid-stream. Halle Berry, whose performance lifts this movie from the ordinary, is a waitress in an airport-district restaurant -- again, we're led to believe it's in the outskirts of New Orleans. Forty-five minutes into the movie, the characters, prison and homes are moved to Georgia. What a commute! Perhaps I missed the forest for the trees, but these inconsistencies mystified me. And one more thing: the monster's ball. It's explained as the movie starts, but there's no follow-up. My guess is the director had ambitions beyond his means and hastily assembled this movie as best he could. The results are a qualified success. I just wish someone had had a road map.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a pleasant film to watch, but a fine examination of human angst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, critic Ebert has a superbly perceptive review, so I won't repeat what he says. Thornton as the prison warden and Barry as the wife of the executed man are both superb. And, of course, she won Best Actress for it. The film has a very simple message, that in times of great personal loss, which each of them experienced at about the same time, the human condition often just needs someone, anyone, to pick itself up. And that's what Thornton's and Berry's characters do, and they use each other to do it.But I do have a significant complaint about the sloppy film making. The story was set in Georgia, but the uniforms work by the prison guards, and Thornton, had a very obvious LOUISIANA emblem on the shoulder. Do they really expect the audience to not know the difference in the states of Louisiana and Georgia?? Very sloppy and for me, distracting. And, for those of us who are very familiar with the area where it was filmed, the levee along the Mississippi river and the road through the Bonnet Carre spillway just outside Norco, with the Shell Chemical plant in the background, was also a bit distracting. Also, a sign at one of the businesses was "4201 Airline Highway East", which is obviously in the New Orleans or Metairie areas. Film makers normally take pains to cover up such identifying marks, so that they won't become a distraction. Or, they simply could have set the film in Louisiana.On a positive point, the motel, and even the room which was used for the two prostitution scenes, was the same motel and room that led to Jimmy Swaggart's downfall, according to the commentary on the DVD. Which I will mention further. The director, plus Thornton and Berry, discuss the movie while it plays. I'm sorry, but they display such a simplistic attitude throughout, and don't offer a lot of value. This is one case where the commentary should not be there. Still, overall a very fine film.</fullReview>

They would sometimes invite a hooker to meet them at a hotel room and have sex for 4 seconds. It was several "side scenes" that were so disjointed from the movie that tended to bother me after awhile. Billy Bob and Hale Berry had no tension between them really. The racist elements never came to surface. That old man from Everybody Loves Raymond was Billy Bob's dad and is very racist. Basically, this is a not feel good movie and quite slow. If you like Billy Bob, rent it. If not, avoid it...it will put you to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching this film, I kept flashing back to an episode of the simpsons, only Halle Berry was there....HB: Dearest Billy Bob Thorton, for years I've yearned to prostitute my race on camera and set my people back a good few decades or so and with your help, this I shall achieve....What transpires in Monster's Ball is a competently written, shot and executed film that only manages to impress with the sheer amount of baggage it is able to generate, Many fine actors, such as Thorton and Ledger have places in the film but their presence feels strained, as though they knew they were doing their requisite "thinker" film before going back to their respective typecast genre roles. Halle Berry gives the performance of her life, though that isn't as positive as you would think. In this film she manages to avoid her almost Adam west-like overacting and single entendres that seem to permeate her other roles. Perhaps that is because she decided to stop acting with her mind, and started acting with her body. She essentially is there to be black, and show nipple. But because of racial politics being what they are, some misguided individuals seemed to think this was Oscar worthy. It wasn't.The film still needs to be seen, if only so people can understand why. Ironically in her role as a black woman victimized by racism serves as the single most destructive role for black youth in any movie today. Forget Snoop Dog, Puffy, or Martin Lawrence on a bender. IN this film, the hopes and dreams of a generation and a people are flushed down the colored person's toilet with a single exploitive sex scene, and the line of "Let's have ice cream." I certainly hope that the shiny little man was worth it lady. Me, I couldn't live with myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS BELOW!!***I finally got to watch Monster's Ball today, and of course I was expecting to see a real powerful performance from Halle Berry, who was given an Oscar for her role. Well..........I just don't see the big deal with Berry's performance! In my opinion she didn't deserve to win the Oscar for Best Actress....for THIS??? What did she really do? Other than the drunken/sex scene with Billy Bob, she wasn't very impressive. She wasn't really on screen that long and didn't grab me enough for me to say 'yea, she really did deserve that award'. But again, that's just me. As far as the rest of the movie, it was just 'there'. Nothing really moved me, I didn't give a damn about the characters, no matter how much bad was going on in their lives. Now, I get the whole thing about Billy Bob fighting his father's controlling ways and freeing himself from the fear and intimidation of his father (i.e. his racist ways). But we're forced to assume everything....the whole grandfather-father-son issue was indeed the focus of the whole story, and they REALLY had something there...if only they had went more into that the movie would've been much better. What was really the point of Halle's character? Anyone could've played that character. One day Billy Bob cares and gives her a car, names a gas station after her and then takes her in. When did this transformation take place where he suddently doesn't care about race and allows himself to feel compassion for someone of a different race, particularly a African-American? They needed to get us deeper into his character and his reasoning. Sure you could say it was the death of his son that caused all of this, but again, you're forced to assume this since this is the only thing that one could look at as a possible turning point in his life. This movie really did nothing for me. As far as the acting, it was good. Billy Bob was very good, just as good if not better than Halle. Mos Def was EXCELLENT with what little he was given. But overall the movie was just bland. Nothing really happens, and I was begging for it to end. Halle Berry was good in her role; MAYBE I would've given her a nomination, because that drunken/sex scene was acted out very well, although I thought the sex scene was a little too much. Other than one scene I really don't see the big deal with her performance. It was DEFINITELY not worth an Oscar, i'm sorry. This film overall is VERY overrated, its average at best, and pretty boring as well. The acting, although good overall, can't carry the film because there's not much there story/plot wise. I see where they were trying to go with this, but they really don't get there; not convincingly at least. I was VERY disappointed, particularly in Berry's suprisingly bland and 'usual' performance.** out of **** stars.P.S. Some actress got robbed on that fateful Oscar nite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see little point in summarising the plot , you've either seen it or you haven't. Likewise it is hard to see what might be a spoiler if you have seen it, and if you haven't, why are you reading this comment. Anyway, here goes.I thought the film was good, although I had to watch sections of it several times in order to make sense of them. I hadn't seen it in the cinema when it first came out but just recently recorded it when it was shown on Channel 4. Had I seen it in the cinema, I don't think I would have enjoyed it that much or indeed "got" it. The film's pace and narrative are confusing though that's not necessarily a bad thing. While the pace of the film appears quite slow, the plot itself progresses at breakneck speed, and momentous, life changing decisions like committing suicide or putting your father in a nursing home appear to be taken and executed in a split second. The treatment of time is one of the cleverer aspects of this film.There is a lot of hefty symbolism going on, from the hands reaching into a bird cage during the somewhat graphic sex scene in the middle of the film to the locked up attic room containing Hank's son's things. Many more things are hinted at but never explored. We're all trained to watch for clues in films, so like no doubt many other people I just ended up thinking things like, what's with the vomiting, the plastic spoon thing, the chocolate ice cream, the drawings, the RED CURTAINS!!I'm not saying everything should be explained, this is post modernism after all, but so many other fairly major themes aren't properly explored either, such as the parental violence (Leticia beating her son because he overeats or perhaps just because she's had enough), the death penalty, the history of suicide in Hank's family (there seemed to be a lot of dead women there somewhere), the general inability to relate to women (pre-Leticia) across the generations as depicted in the scenes with the prostitute.Although I trust the message of the film, that there is genuine feeling between Hank and Leticia and that there is some sort of future for them, I couldn't help thinking that Leticia almost prostituted herself when she moved in with Hank. Yes she had nowhere to go and he had the room, but it was all a bit too easy, along the lines of poor black woman moves in with white guy and doesn't have to worry about paying the rent anymore.This is meant to be a film about race and prejudice and social realities and all that but the film does not really work at all at that level. It is in fact curiously colour blind. The film does work perfectly well as a sort of off beat quirky romance between two characters that seem highly unlikely to find love a) anywhere and b) with each other, but against all the odds it does happen when they both lose a child and hit rock bottom. The whole race thing then becomes somewhat incidental. I thought Billy Bob Thornton was very good, and Halle Berry was good but not in any way Oscarworthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen any other Hale Berry movies, so I suppose I look at her with a fresh eye. Why did she get an Oscar for this ? I just didn't buy any of her performances in this movie, even the sex scenes, in which she's "drunk". The worst I found her acting in the relationship with her overweight son. If this type of acting deserves an Oscar, they should invent an "Intergalactic" Oscar for people like Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, etc.Okay, other actors did a nice job, like Billy B.Thornton and his son. (in the movie) Puff Daddy was not too bad, not being an actor and all.But they couldn't save a flawed script... What a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...so at least something productive came from watching this. I did like the use of chiaroscuro and reflection by the director, but a little less of it would have made more sense and made me less confused. Seriously there were times I had to back up to see what it was I was supposed to see. Also it is goof to see that Hailey Berry can in fact act well. She was the best part of the film but that does not say much as there was not much else to do. In all reality, this movie stunk as no one died quick enough and no one that was related to anyone who died seemed to upset about it when they did.Sean Coomes in the start of the film is about the best part of the movie... well, except for Ms. Berry being nude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating: ** out of ****. I watched Monsters Ball on TV and I must say I was not impressed at all. The movie had a depressing story, that I could not get involved in at all. I felt nothing for the characters.The acting is probably the best(and probably only)strength in the movie. Halle Berry gives a good, credible performance here, it is no way worth an oscar or a nomination. Billy Bob Thornton actually does better than her. Peter Boyle gives the best performance as the bitter father, although its kind of a smaller role. I cant believe the movie was nominated for its script. Its story was bad and the dialogue was just average. Training Day had a better script. Monsters Ball is just a mediocre movie, with a very weak ending. If you wanna Halle Berry actually possess some acting skill than watch it but mostly its just a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers If it wins an award it is usually a boring social message movie that has some artistic flavor to it. E T, Raiders, and other true classics will always be beaten out by Philidaphia, Ghandi, etc. Well, this film is an one out of ten. Halle Barry wins an award! Maybe it should have been an adult movie award for her performance. I mean this film was like those clips you see from the Pay TV commercials for their pornos. Billy Bob has progressed in his film career from making one weird film to another, and I think he has topped it. If he can make a weirder film than this watch out. Oliver Stone would have to write and direct it. What bothers me, this film is supposed to be anti Racist. Being of Polish background, if they ever need a jerk character, someone stupid, or a disfunctional family (like in this one) they use a lot of Slavic last names. They just add a Ski to it, and it will win an award. What if they made characters like this for other groups, blacks, jews, gays etc would it be socially correct? It seems Poles, Italians and Catholics get it all the time, and they have to show Crucifixs in the houses in these movies often. Pole's have some bad sterotypes, but this movie hits way beyond that. By the way how many Slavs live in the South? The part that gets me is there is no social message; for the lead character is a jerk whose stupid son who just did not get in the truck and leave kills himself. It seems every time Billy Bobs character finds himself in a bind, he becomes a hypocrite and hurts someone. He hates his son so he drives his son to suicide; doesn't need his dad's anymore and sends him off to a very awful care home. Hates his job so he quits its, instead of trying to reform it. All of a sudden he is lonely, he does a 180 loves black people and gets laid. It reminds me of many people in life who do one thing and change too another when it is convenient for them. There is no real spiritual conversion of the person here. I guess it was maybe to shock us or send a social message, where I find neither. No shock with this film, I have been so bloated with messages of violence and sex on film. The sex scenes where there only to create a rating, and an excuse for making a borderline adult film. All they needed was that NWO music from Wrestling during the countless sex scenes, and bad lines like I change attitudes lets have sex. Or hey baby its getting bigger, don't stop etc. This film lacks any direction, depth or entertainment value. I'd rather watch Stallone in Cobra at least it's entertaining, and makes more sense than this one. Maybe they call this art, I gave it a one. I would respect it better if at least they made this a sex film than hiding it behind a social message. At least Porky's did not do that. 1/10</fullReview>

The whole movie seems to be developing the much more interesting character of Billy Bob Thornton. His acting is great and his character development smooth. Halle Berry seems to be there but is not the pivotal part of the movie except being a helpless person who finds solace in Billy. I give this movie a 8 for some very thought provoking scenes and great acting done by Billy.</fullReview>

I should have gone by my usual criteria for picking movies (if the critics love it, I know I'll hate it and vice versa). What exactly was the point of making this movie? Halle Berry won best actress?

		<fullReview>Aside from the fact that the characters kept doing things and reacting in ways that simply didn't make sense to me at all, the plot was completely stupid.There was a hell of a lot of self-importance and for some reason, I felt like the director was hoping that I would read something deep and meaningful into this overlong film with completely undeveloped themes.But the stupidity of the story made it that much worse. ***SPOILER FOLLOWS***** By chance, a prison guard who flicks the switch of a death row inmate shacks up with his widow after her overweight son is accidentally killed. IT just seems ridiculous.As for themes, I'm almost open to suggestion about what this film is about. Some say overcoming racism. Some say its a meditation in despair. I think that, whatever its about, the direction failed to bring it to light sufficiently and left most wondering what to make of this odd mix of vague and jumbled subthemes with no coherence or 'point.'Waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best screenplay, no, really didn't even need a nomination. Best actress, NO! Halle, she's a great actress, but this was not best actress worthy. And so not worth her raving speech as if she had broken all berriors for black actresses in Hollywood. I might have agreed with the nomination, but I've seen way too many actresses at the Oscars who deserved the Oscar getting passed on because of their rep or age. Halle is young, but I think the Oscars felt more like she needed this Oscar instead of earning it.The story of Monster's Ball has no point and could have gone on for hours. Both Halle and Bill's character went no where. It's like most movies have the characters go from point A to point B, but not in Monster's Ball. I think also the two sons in the beginning were like trash to the script writer, when it's at it's fullest, throw it out! I just didn't feel that much after this movie was done. I'm sorry, but this was not that good of a movie.4/10</fullReview>

She won a bloody Oscar, a bloody Oscar for that scene though maybe someone can help me cause I'm not sure, when he is behind her and preforming penetration where is he preforming it, is it just doggy style sex or is it the full anal penetration? i just wonder what she did for that Oscar and if it resembled the film version, maybe she got off easy and it was about a metre above the film version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly Monster's Ball, more appropriately entitled Monsters' Ball, is not worthy of a Golden Globe Award. I believe that it was best picture of the year. Why? The story-line, mistakenly perceived by the populous as vulnerably dramatic, is really only intensely pitiful at best, and portrayed as such by the characters; they are not worthy of our sincerest sensibilities. Additionally, the script is missing vital pieces including: setting ? city, state and year. If it was shown, I missed it. Thus it could have been repeated for emphasis. Leticia's (Halle Berry) husband, Lawrence Musgrove (Sean, P.Diddy Combs) what was his crime for the death penalty, the electric chair? Leticia's son, Tyrell Musgrove (Coronji Calhoun), why isn't he in school? Doesn't he have homework? Leticia reprimands her chocolate feasting son ? too little too late. The scene is too scripted and not natural, only another interference reminding us that we are watching a poorly written movie. Gruesome to admit, but seeing the hit and run accident upon the son would have been more credible. After all, we saw Corrections Officer, Hank Grotowski's (Billy Bob Thornton) son, Sonny (Heath Ledger) shoot himself through the heart, after confessing that he did everything to please his dad for the love of the man. Finally, was an audience at Lawrence's execution really necessary? It is such a cold and crude film, from sexual, racial, to familiar content, that it is really hard to transcend any other more worldly meaning, other than education and different jobs would probably serve them all better. Hank's father (Peter Boyle) tells Leticia that every white man isn't really a man until he has done a black woman. Frank, himself has his father's black man slave mentality, shooting a gun in the air, when blacks are roaming outside of his property, but stealthily slips into black woman lover role, never admitting to her his historical thoughts and present confusions on the matter. Hank resigns from his nausea induced correction's officer job, opening up a gasoline station and convenience mart in Leticia's name. Nevertheless, there is nothing likable, or one dare say noble about his character, particularly his perceived attempts of being considerate to a woman's needs from every mechanical detail, as to whether the music on the radio is alright for her listening pleasure and whether or not she is pleased with the oral sex he has just given her. When she replies that she is sexually content, he expresses a sudden craving for chocolate ice-cream, only proving that the moment proceeds little after thought other than satisfying his own untimely desires. It's not a moment too soon to up and drive to his gasoline store. Leaving lingering Leticia in bed, he hops in his car to his gas station. Pulling from the glass sliding door, among the industrial store lighting, a pint of chocolate ice-cream, he returns to now perturbed Leticia. Unconsciously telling her that she looks beautiful to appease her unease, chocolate ice-cream is now only a white plastic spoonful away, to feed her senses, maybe like her son fed his own. On the back steps to his home they sit, where to the right, we see the grim sight of three grave stones: her dead husband and son, and his son. There is no explanation as to why Leticia's husband and sons bodies are buried on his property. We are surprised but don't really act it, as from this story, we've come to expect anything.It cannot be reiterated enough how little this story reaches our sincerest sensibilities, for various reasons, including an underdeveloped script with key missing story telling information. Some may say that this movie doesn't come close to reflecting pity, only disgust, whose characters never cultivate a higher sense of redemption. In light of the mood and tone, one might say that they all should have been shown over indulging in chocolate bars, only to be hit by oncoming cars, during a torrential rainy night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monster's Ball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people will know this film for have the first black leading actress to win Oscar, but it is also a very good drama from director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace). I should first say that the "Monster's Ball" is what is known as a final feat for prisoners before they are executed. Basically Southern American prison guard Hank Grotowski (Love Actually's Billy Bob Thornton), works with his son Sonny (Heath Ledger), and lives with his racist father Buck (Peter Boyle), who has influenced his own racism. After recently executing Lawrence Musgrove (Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs), husband of Leticia (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Halle Berry), and Sonny commits suicide, Hank retires from the prison. He and Leticia do meet when she serves him in the caf she works in, but they get to know each other when Leticia is in pieces after her overweight son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) dies after being hit by a car. When she asks him to make her feel better, they quickly fall in love with a highly passionate first time together, and they seem to be easing each other's pain. Of course there is a little scrape with Leticia meeting Hank's father, but it settles. But what makes the ending really poignant is that Leticia mentioned her husband before they made love, and she discovers that Hank knew him from finding some of his drawings, but it ends with her not saying anything! Also starring Be Kind Rewind's Mos Def as Ryrus Cooper, Will Rokos as Warden Velesco, Milo Addica as Tommy Roulaine, Coronji Calhoun as Tyrell Musgrove and Taylor Simpson as Lucille. Thornton is impressive as the secretive (ex-)prison guard, and Berry is most magnificent in her award winning role, together they make a compelling duo, and their love scene is one of the most passionate I know in cinema. It is a controversial and gripping tale tackling many powerful issues about racism, bigotry, despair and redemption, all social complexities done bravely, boldly and honestly to make a most watchable film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Halle Berry was number 99 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>
