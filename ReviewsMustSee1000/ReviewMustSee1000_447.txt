		<shortDescription>Artfully subtle, quite nice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this screening without any prior knowledge of the film, and I was pleasantly surprised. Well acted and well directed, this is a more mature and deeper "thriller" than we're accustomed to. The story is compelling with enough twists and turns to keep one interested, but what was really riveting was the fact that the movie wraps up neatly but in a thought provoking way, unlike so much predictable Hollywood fluff nowadays. It is a thinking person's film and I appreciated that.One other thing I wanted to note on was the tone: dark, bleak, isolated, and barren. From the acting to the cinematography, the director really nailed this feeling in everything from the characterizations to the visuals. Just something I really noticed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid indie thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows what's great about film festivals. So many movies, and they're not tied down to every Hollywood cliché in the book.The way Little Trip plays out is hard to describe. Forest Whitaker plays an insurance investigator, a company man. He comes to know Julia Stiles' character, a vulnerable housewife living with an unpredictable screw-up (Renner) on barren tundra.The relationship between Stiles &amp; Renner was intricate yet believable. And the relationship between Stiles &amp; Whitaker is surprising. I didn't see the ending coming, which I appreciate always. I'm so tired of formulaic thrillers. This movie reminded me of movies from the 70's - the good old days when every plot point wasn't spoon fed. It has style and feeling like classics from that time too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>twists &amp; turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really surprised by this screening. I had heard of the director's foreign-language movies but never seen them. So I had not much to go on except that I like the actors... I knew it was a thriller of some kind but didn't expect it to be a thinking person's film. Basically, the movie is an investigation into a mysterious death. But the characters involved have layers and secrets to them as well.Julia Stiles was ravishing as always, Forest Whitaker very convincing, but I was most drawn in by Jeremy Renner. He's a sneaky actor in a good role. Also must mention Peter Coyote, glad to see him in anything.Anyway, I enjoy movies with twists and turns, and this one had plenty. It was atmospheric and ultimately satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filmed In Iceland, This Is Intriguing, But Ending Hurts It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an intriguing, although not satisfying,, movie and one I still felt was worth my few bucks I paid to rent it.It was filmed in Iceland - one of the few films I've heard of with that locale - but the story in the film takes place somewhere in Midwestern America. I knew that going in, so it made it kind of strange to view, in that respect. However, the story seemed very realistic. In parts, it almost felt like a documentary, it was so real and atmospheric.However, as much as I enjoyed the movie, and particularly Forest Whitaker with his odd accent, the ending was a big disappointment. The film had so much promise up until then.Some people say this film had the feel of a Coen Brothers movie, and I agree with that. To some, this might also have been a bit slow or boring but I thought it had unique atmosphere to it. With a more satisfying ending, I would have bought the DVD and watched it several more times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Story, Disappointing Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a suspicious fatal car accident in Hastings where the identity of the victim was forged, the Quality Life insurance company sends their smart investigator Abe Holt (Forrest Whitaker) to identify the body. The unique beneficiary of the one million dollars death benefit is the sister of the victim, Isold (Julia Stiles), who lives with her son Thor and her husband Fred (Jeremy Renner) in a poor cabin in the middle of nowhere. Along the investigation, Abe discloses the truth about the fraud, but feels sorry for Isold and Thor and tries to help them with tragic consequences."Little Trip to Heaven" has a good premise, showing both sides of the insurance policies, with some fraudulent cases of clients and questionable procedures of the companies themselves. The story is good, with a suspenseful atmosphere in a dramatic and tense situation. In spite of the very disappointing conclusion, this movie worth watching. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "A Fraude" ("The Fraud")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, amazing to see see how they used the countryside of Iceland to display a small town in the USA. As well as the scenes from the "big city" which where all shot in Reykjavík the capital of Iceland, where they only put American signs on the buildings to turn it all into an American city.The story is really good, all the unexpected twists and turns keep you interested throughout the whole movie.I also have to make a comment on the soundtrack, incredible work by the young Icelandic artist 'Mugison'. A solo guitarist with incredible talent. The lyrics are great and the rhythm of the music fits the story perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something about this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a chance to see this film in Toronto and I have to admit I've been thinking a lot about it since. Visually, it's so beautiful... and yet stark and haunting (apparently it was filmed in Iceland). But what I really found engaging was that it was a noir-esquire mystery but with a very realistic feel. When opportunities present themselves for the film to go down a formulaic road, it doesn't. There's something strangely real about the film, from the first-rate acting, to the dark tone, to the deliberate pace... I think the director's decision to give this film dramatic weight will set it apart from other mystery/thrillers (I feel weird even trying to categorize it). Maybe it's just me, but I can't stop thinking about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the characters that Forest Whitaker usually portrays in his movies: soft einzelgangers who are balancing on the thin line between good and evil. In this flick he's playing an agent for an insurance company who tries to dodge off the claims of their clients. He does a pretty swell job, scrupulous and efficient. But then he stumbles upon a messed up couple who are trying to file a claim over a dead brother. Our protagonist feels that there is something wrong, and he dives in the lives of the two to find any sleaze and dirt. And, as expected , he does find something that can stir things up.This movie reminded me of ''Fargo'' and '' A simple plan ''. Like in those flicks, ''A little trip...'' deals with the brutalities that people will do to each other out of pure greed. It's also about the cruel way of thinking that a life insurance can make up for the loss of a human life, and how insurance companies like you to believe that. It's a modern film noir with an excellent cast, a beautiful soundtrack and atmospheric sequences in the rain or snow. Maybe the tone is a bit too sad and nihilistic for the big crowd, it definitely deserves more than the meager 6 it's receiving here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Story in a Dark Place Without the Benefit of a Director's Enlightenment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A LITTLE TRIP TO HEAVEN is a strange little Indie film by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur, a young director with some very fine ideas but with a script (written both by the director and Edward Martin Weinman) 'that is so spongy that the impact of the film relies on the considerable qualities of the cinematic images. Filmed primarily in Iceland with some scenes in Hastings, Minnesota, the mood is dank and dark and cold - and so is the story.We first meet insurance investigator ('adjustor') Abe Holt as he listens to his boss Frank (Peter Coyote) explain to a new widow why she will not receive full death benefits because the insurance company took photos of her husband smoking, the apparent cause of his death. Abe just sits in the background but we know he is in tune with the fraudulent activity of the insurance company. Almost immediately he is assigned to a new case: an ex-con with a million dollar life insurance policy has apparently been found dead in a car crash burned beyond recognition. Abe drives to the tiny snowy desolate village where his questions of the townsfolk reveal that the victim was Kelvin Anderson, the brother of Isold (Julia Stiles) who is married to a low life type named Fred (Jeremy Renner), a man who we have seen in flashbacks as the one responsible for arranging the car crash and setting the car on fire. Abe sneaks around the town, spies on Isold, and becomes involved in the investigation in more ways than the honest one. It is the interplay of the three - Abe, Fred, and Isold - that provide the intrigue and mystery of the apparent framed insurance scam.The screenplay is so full of holes that it is difficult to follow the case's development. The actors are superb artists: Forest Whitaker made this film almost simultaneously with his Oscar winning 'The Last King of Scotland' yet here his character is plagued by an affected accent and by the lack of substance that might make us care about his plight; Julia Stiles does her best with the little she is given to do and Jeremy Renner is convincingly menacing without any factors that make us find him worth caring about. The supporting actors (Joanna Scanlan as a sleazy bartender, Iddo Goldberg and Philip Jackson as the police, Alfred Harmsworth as the 'son' of Isold, and Vladas Bagdonas as the coroner) actually fare better than the leads as far as material available.The strong aspect of the film is the visual imagery, due to the decisions of picture composition by Kormákur and cinematographer Óttar Gu?nason and Mugison's musical is apropos for the mood. But the film remains grounded and a bit on the confusing side because of the director's lack of unity. One wonders why Whitaker, Stiles, and Renner signed on to this little film.

		<shortDescription>Poorly executed thriller had promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This somewhat awkward transition to American markets finds Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur a bit over his head with this little mystery. In effect, A Little Trip to Heaven plays a bit like the watered down, third-rate cousin of the thriller Insomnia (nothing spectacular to begin with), although here most potential intrigue is crushed by the deadening weight of a charisma-lacking direction. A talented trio of actors do help elevate the often lifeless direction, but the movie does take an even greater toll by employing Forest Whitaker in the misguided lead. A shame to be coming out on DVD so quickly after his triumphant academy win, Whitaker's questionable Canadian-esqe accent paired with the boring, underdeveloped character he is written here just proves too bland for lead role material. Co-stars Jeremy Renner and Julia Stiles do offer more inviting performances however.Difficult as the actual lack of energy beaming off the screen may be, the film is not without it's subtle shade of merit. Beyond the b-grade artistry lies a filmmaker with a promising talent for composition, often showing his best, least obvious strength when setting up succeeding, more important shots. As well, the script might have seemed a lot more convincing when on paper (which would explain some of the big name interest), offering a humbly ambitious, localized little guessing game centering around insurance fraud. Sadly, the adaptation to screen just does not gel in any real compelling way, though the detail oriented plot should throw enough curve balls to keep mystery buffs afloat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This should have been better than it was...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love Icelandic cinema and all those stories which have an inherent ancient Nordic mysticism or spiritualism about them. I knew nothing about this film prior to viewing it at the Melbourne Film Festival except that it was Icelandic. Having visited there and been totally captured by the stark beauty of the country I was really looking forward to anything that was served up.However I was really disappointed when I found it was for all intents and purposes an American film shot in Iceland. I'm a fan of Forest Whittaker but in this film he is totally miscast. And what was he trying to achieve with the inconsistent accent? He stood out too much and just did not fit the character of an insurance investigator. Julia Stiles character was half way to trailer trash and frankly, she just looked too good throughout. Perfect complexion, glowing skin color, simply too healthy - it didn't fit the role. The ending was also way too manufactured so as to keep commercial audiences happy. She's a single mother with a "son" who needs money to survive - let's make sure she gets it even if we have to totally change the lead character's actions to ensure it happens.One thing I will say in its favor is that the car crash stunt towards the end of the film is absolutely fantastic - that really came from nowhere. Very impressed with the genuine level of danger involved - it looked very hairy to perform.However overall, a disappointing storyline with few engaging characters and a poorly cast lead sinks this film for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have to say that this was a well acted, very well directed little offering, i would like to have seen more of Peter Coyote as i thought he portrayed the part of the Investigator with relish, and seemed to revel in ensuring people did not receive their full benefits. the whole feel to the film was dark, brooding and you always felt that things could not get any worse for Mr. Renner &amp; Ms. Stiles, but it did. i suppose people will feel this is to dark for their tastes, but these are the dramas that make compelling viewing. Forest Whitaker does a good job and displays a determination to resolve the case that if were true to life, with the income he displayed within his character, i am not sure would be there?i notice a lot of 10/10's for this movie and think this is unwarranted, but having said that this was a worthwhile effort and should be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this at a Hollywood video store that was going out of business. A couple who get caught up in an ordeal dealing with her rich brothers insurance. The commercial for the insurance is really and oddly eye catching and artistically done. Julia Stiles does a fairly good job as an abused lifeless mother, and Jeremy Renner does good as the abusive husband. Forest Whitaker as usual does an excellent job, bringing character and color. The movie overall is really well done, its not great, but well deserves more attention than it does. Its got hear and emotion, which a lot of thrillers like this wouldn't usually have. Highly recommended. I rate this 8/20. Rated R for language, some violence and disturbing images</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, if you like something a bit different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "independent" movie is set somewhere in the USA, but it is filmed in Iceland. All the crew and the director appear to be Scandinavian. It is about a man who seems to live his life running scams to get insurance money, but this time he runs up against one of the better insurance investigators who tries to minimize payouts.The lead role is played by Forest Whitaker as Abe Holt, who seems very good as the insurance man. When a man insured for $1Million is found dead and burned in a tragic car wreck, Holt is dispatched to see if there is fraud involved. Basically, he tries to find the victim alive. The rat is Jeremy Renner as "Fred", who apparently is married to the sister of the deceased man, and she is the sole beneficiary of the $1Million. But not all is as it seems to be. Julia Stiles is Isold, the sister, and the young son is Thor. Interesting movie, something different from Hollywood blockbusters.SPOILERS: The man Fred who appears to be Isold's husband is really the man supposed to be dead, Isold's crooked brother, who found a drifter to kill in the wreck. Holt figures this out, a key piece of information is finding the real "Fred" was already dead. Holt arranges the policy so that Isold will get $1Million, but when he tried to get the brother to justice, both end up dying in yet another car crash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece Under The Radar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cruising YouTube on a cold winter's night is often a voyage of discovery. Forest Whitaker reminds me of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who spun out of this world not too long ago. This is a character study, so carefully crafted, or should I say sculpted, by Whitaker in his portrayal of Abe Holt, that the end result is a piece of art, not a formula. The stutter, the hesitant intonations of speech, convey that Holt as a man has never really been comfortable in his skin, in the ugly career of a man who is always hiding, always pretending to people to be something or someone he is not, paid to find dirt, wherever it leads, and no matter how many lies he tells. Not far into the movie at all, I understood his breaking point was closing in on him. His overwhelming loneliness was his fragile coat of armor. Then real human contact destroyed him, or saved him, depending on your point of view. First, it was the Mother-Earth-Waitress, whose performance blew me away. Then it was the little boy Thor. Suddenly in the middle of the coldest rain and the slickest snow and the most revealing shadows ever caught on celluloid, a human being emerged from the blackened, contorted ruins of a corpse on a slab. Watch the film, and you'll know what I mean, and what Holt's camera shots in that makeshift morgue were really highlighting. This was an outstanding cast, and a film that kept me under its spell right to the end credits. Honestly, any decent actors could have played the other parts. But no one, no one ever, could have brought Art Holt to life like Whitaker. Ten stars, and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better movies in this bunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, this movie is pretty good. Forrest Whitaker does a good job as a detective in a rural area, and Julia Styles does a good job as an abused wife (if I remember). Overall, the movie's very slow for the first hour, but then it gets better within the last 30 minutes. I thought it was a complex, yet smooth movie to sit through. Styles to me is underrated as an actress and may be dated to the 2000s as peak, but that shouldn't discourage you from watching this. It also goes into detail about Life Insurance and the claims people will actually go through to protect the bottom line. This wasn't a big hit, but I think it will be popular in the future. It's actually my favorite Forrest Whittaker film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forest Whitaker investigates insurance fraud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Little Trip to Heaven" is a neo-noir that has notable positives and negatives that co-exist. The overall result is therefore mixed.The story has possibilities, centering on an insurance fraud accomplished by a car crash and murder. The perpetrator has a history of such frauds, having done a previous one by a car crash too. But he has assumed a different identity to go undetected. He lives with his sister who poses as his wife, but she is now more on the up and up and doesn't know what he has done. Forest Whitaker is an insurance investigator who works for a company that makes every attempt to find loopholes so as to deny payments, so he comes to investigate. This story has several quite unrealistic elements and large plot holes to it that could have been smoothed over in a better script, and this brings down the movie. The car crashes themselves are unrealistic.Another negative is Whitaker's Canadian accent. It is never made clear why he's where he is somewhere in the upper midwest of America or possibly even in Canada. The place looks more like Canada (it's actually Iceland). At any rate, his accent is constantly annoying (by being too exaggerated) and unnecessary in the bargain since every one else sounds American. The Canadian accent is more subtle.Another negative is the music, which not only is grating but doesn't fit the story and mood. I understand that this is a matter of taste, but it didn't fit in my opinion. It annoyed me too.The ending flies off into the realm of implausibility as Whitaker's character does a u-turn, apparently due to a change of heart about the girl and her more-or-less adopted son. But the u-turn is way too large. Then the movie ends with a Hollywood touch tacked on that completely changes the mood and doesn't fit the story.Counteracting all of this are the very strong visuals and locations. The snowy backgrounds and dwellings are used very well indeed and add danger and intrigue. The story itself has enough complexity and mystery to it also to be engaging. The side characters and the Whitaker character (and performance) are more on the plus side.What it adds up to is that we're rooting here for a good film in all departments, because this could be a very good noir, but the negatives tend to bring it down. Of these, we can live with the music and the accent (barely), but the ending and the transformation of Whitaker are too much to take, and they only remind us of the earlier plot holes. So that the film leaves us quite disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nordic noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur directs "A Little Trip to Heaven", a noir inspired drama starring Forest Whitaker as Abe Holt, an insurance agent tasked with investigating a mysterious death in small town America.Bizarrely, the film's shot in Iceland but takes place in the United States. This gives the picture an unconventionally hyper-stylised look, with moody skylines, rain drenched locales, and lots of blacks, greys and grubby browns. The interesting-faced Julia Stiles plays a cross between your typical noir femme-fatale and damsel in distress. Whitaker sports an unconvincing Minnesotan accent.The film contains a wonderful opening act ? very atmospheric - but quickly falls apart. You can almost pinpoint exactly where it goes off the rails: Whitaker, who plays a lonely, shy, work-obsessed investigator, is approached in a bar by a man-hungry obese woman. Too timid to push her away, he finds himself dancing with her, their lonely, chubby bodies swaying to the sound of a midnight jukebox. Unfortunately Kormakur cuts away from the moment as soon as it starts. The rest of the plot proceeds in a similar manner, Kormakur uninterested in dwelling on more interesting, original moments, or even his central character, and too preoccupied with rushing through his familiar tale.6.9/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Little Trip To Heaven" is a well-acted drama.The Plot: Abe Holt (Whitaker) is an insurance investigator who is sent to a small town to find out about a car accident. He meets Isolde (Stiles) and realizes that the truth could also be a scam.Forest Whitaker is excellent in the role. He brings a lot of sadness and humility to it. His accent, while unnecessary, works for him. Julia Stiles also does a good job, and Peter Coyote, as Holt's boss, is always worth watching. The climax\ending doesn't work but it could have ended worse."A Little Trip To Heaven" is definitely a hidden gem that's being thrown onto the video market. It works well on the small screen however.For more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Noble Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this movie completely falls apart, it's still an interesting piece of work. There's genuine talent on both sides of the camera, but the story is such a mess that they just can't make it work.Forest Whitaker plays an insurance investigator who goes to a small town investigate a seven figure claim involving a life insurance policy. What he finds is a variety of local eccentrics, a father and son police force that is ineffectual, and an incredibly muddled storyline that goes absolutely nowhere.What's good about it: Great music, well visualized, great cast. It's character driven enough that I can see why Whitaker and Julia Stiles would sign on for it.But the story is too muddled for film. On stage or in the pages of a book these sometimes nonsensical events could possibly be accepted. Film is very unforgiving. A barn is a barn. A clinic is a clinic. We're so rooted in the real world- even though the role of Minnesota is played by Iceland- that the behavior of these people is beyond belief. The protagonist first sees the leading lady while staring through her window in the middle of the night. He has a habit of breaking into houses and clinics- possibly being a cat burglar is one of the requirements for working for an insurance company.Logic flies out the window when Stiles and Renner manipulate a huge truck to crash into their car and they and the car goes flying off a cliff into the ocean and they emerge unscathed.There's potential for a strong film out of this material. It shows the film's makers' dedication to their task by the strong cast they've assembled, including Phyllidia Law in a short but effective scene and Jeremy Renner as Stiles's brother or husband or accomplice or whatever.One thing that was dissatisfying was the fault of The Sundance Channel (I saw this on cable). It was filmed in wide-screen 2:35:1 ratio, but a full screen version was broadcast. So in a critical scene in the third act there's a moment when both characters speaking are out of camera range. That's why I prefer Independent Film Channel, because they're not afraid to letterbox.This is worth watching, but don't let the strong cast get your hopes up too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though certainly flawed, it is still nonetheless an interesting and engrossing thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film received mixed reviews from critics and viewers alike, some embracing its "arty" and ambiguous sensibilities, while others were displeased with it's disconnection and aloofness. As for me, I find myself edging towards the former group as as certain this as being a rather interesting, intriguing, and fascinating film, albeit flawed.The visuals are certainly the film's strongest aspect, with its moody lighting, saturated colors, bleak landscapes, and striking camera movements that are all hypnotic and mesmerizing. All of these elements accumulate into a despairing viewing of existentialism and fate - a character stands in a field and sees everything around him, but each direction he faces is the same dreary and gloomy destination.The acting is also superb from the entire cast, with Whitaker providing a unique accent that adds to the quirkiness of his character. Stiles is actually quite good here as well, giving one of her best performances. Last, but not least, is the criminally underrated Jeremy Renner, who gives a reliable performance as always.I was nervous after hearing talk of the plot's ambiguity and unsatisfactory nature, but I can happily say that it is fairly solid. The narrative has a strong sense of mystery, with even some plot twists to peak the viewer's interest. The pacing is, admittedly, glacially slow and this will indeed test the patience and attention-span of its viewer (despite being only 87 minutes long). In addition, I wouldn't say the plot was anything original, but it is involving due to its characters and the sense that there's something more lurking underneath the surface.Those who enjoy character studies and mystery films may enjoy this hybrid of the two genres, which isn't a complete success but is executed in a very effective manner.More contemplative than thrilling, this gets under the skin more than those adrenaline-pumping, yet hollow, thrillers studios are churching out now-a-days.Solid Recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little trip to heaven is an odd film, not good though not particularly bad. It's a film that survives on the merits of an excellent cast and in particular the performance of Forest Whitaker. He play a quiet, reserved inquisitive insurance investigator. His character Abe has so many ticks and tocks and little mannerisms that it's a pity he's never fleshed out, Abe is a good man but why does he do what he does? Why is he single if he's so sympathetic? And why does he care about Isolde? None of the questions aroused are answered. There is no mystery here. The story is okay, excluding some footage earlier on would have been awesome, for instance if you left the audience in doubt for a longer time it would have been much better. The film just never pulls you in, it keep the viewer at a distance, even with all it's foibles this could have been an amazing film if they could have simply fleshed out Whitakers character. The ending sucks too, pure suckage, inexplicable actions taken and consequences garnered...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great cast does what it can with ludicrous details.The most intriguing aspect of this story is that the audience is constantly in search of a hero or victim, but all of the characters are villains, to varying degrees.The real problem is the basic premise. It would have been nice if the writers would have actually done some research instead of making up ridiculous lies about the insurance industry.For starters, attempting to deny or reduce legitimate claim payments is a practice called Unfair Claims Practices, and is prohibited in all states. Secondly, no insurance company would issue a life insurance policy to a known con man, especially for $1 million. (And you can not blame it on a particular office - all policies go through a central underwriting department at the main office.) Thirdly, once a life insurance policy has been in force for 2 years, it becomes incontestable. The only thing that would cause an investigation is if there is a question of the deceased's identity, or there is an accidental death benefit that might not be an accident. Furthermore, insurance fraudsters are notorious for NOT self-inflicting real damage to themselves. Lastly, a claims investigator, agent... can NOT do what James Whitaker's character does near the end of the movie, or even throughout the movie.The ending was rather unusual. Afterward, it does make sense, in a strange way. But this is a strange film. Give it a try if you have nothing better to do and like strange plot twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd and compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HEAVEN stars Forest Whitaker as an insurance investigator who smells a rat in the case of a fatal car crash in snowy Minnesota. In fact, it turns out to be just one in a series of insurance frauds perpetrated by a sister (Julia Styles) and brother (Jeremy Renner of ROAD TRIP). The movie, directed by an Icelander, has a n extremely bleak feel about it. Ice and snow are not surprisingly a prevalent theme. The locations look a lot like those used in FARGO, in fact. This is a thriller, but a thinking man's thriller, and confused identities play a prominent role. Whitaker offers up a very odd, clipped accent and stutter to go with his shambling, raincoat-draped, Colombo-like character. Renner, who has been pretty much invisible throughout his career, acts the bejeezus out of his character -- just as he did on a recent HOUSE, MD, where he played a nihilistic punk rocker. Styles, more of a pretty face than an actress, manages to look pretty throughout, even with dirty hair and shabby clothes. Worth a look. Clearly a foreign film using a trio of American stars and U.S. locales. But still foreign. Check out the names in the closing credits to see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow to start, good ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was slow, actually almost painful, at the beginning. I very nearly gave up on it about half an hour into it. Still, I persevered, and am glad I did.It shows the dark side of abuse and what a woman will do to 'save' her child.The plot twists and turns, and is a little difficult to follow at the beginning, but all comes together nicely toward the end, when the insurance agent finds his heart and does the completely unexpected thing.Overall worth watching, the bleakness of the setting becomes a character in itself, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, it's stark and almost frightening at times. It really makes the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film here in Iceland and I just loved it. It's just fantastic. Baltasar has done great things over the years and when I was a little girl he was my favorite actor. And the music was done by Mugison which is my favorite Icelandic band. The funny thing is that the Motel Isold and "Frank" were staying at in the end of the film used to be a boat shelter... and the building where the insurance company was, is a big brown building in the shape like ")" where my dad used to work. And the funniest thing is the place where the bus crash was shot. That place is one of the two main bus stations in Reykjavík and is called Hlemmur. Anyways. The film was fantastic and I recommend everybody to see it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Coen Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Icelandic film has a feel of Fargo, but comes up short despite the stars attached.The scenery is bleak and depressing, just like Iceland in the winter. It adds the right atmosphere to a murder/insurance scam. There are some obvious plot holes, and it seems to drag a bit at times, but the story is fascinating and the characters are favorites.Forest Whitaker (The Great Debaters, The Last King of Scotland) is a claims adjuster and tries to wring the last dime out of his clients, just as his boss (Peter Coyote) does. They are ruthless about the fine print in a contract.Whitaker is investigating a crash where the victim burned to a crisp. He is like Columbo the way he asks questions and keeps hammering until he gets at the truth. Julia Stiles (The Bourne trilogy, The Omen) is supposedly living with her husband and son, and it is her brother that is supposedly dead in the crash (we all know different, but she doesn't), but Whitaker ferrets out the truth.Of course, he falls for her - who wouldn't - and this leads to a strange Coen Brothers ending.It was a nice ride getting there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SIGH..., When the HELL will I learn to read MORE of the posts first...???!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first off, it wasn't an absolutely horrible film. The soundtrack was kinda neat although very oddly placed along side the story. I FULLY agree with many of the other posters here (which I SHOULD have bloody well taken MORE time to read first!!!!!) when they say that the visuals and the VAGUE fundamental mood of the film is good. But, it is SO dang BLAH...They simply could have done WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more with it. The way the dialog was written and staged (directed) left a HELL of a lot to be desired. Needless to say Forest Whitaker's accent was ABSOLUTELY, CATEGORICALLY, and COMPLETELY annoying and unnecessary. I mean, did ANYONE ELSE bloody well sound like that???!! What the HELL was the point??? GEEZ...If the director had just done EVERYTHING the same EXCEPT added some really good, stylistic, Lynchian Surreal touches... Bloody SOMETHING!!!! Then maybe I could have at least lived with it...VERY, VERY disappointing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen brothers minus a sense of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Baltasar Kormakur leaves Iceland to make an American movie, except he really doesn't, and that's a large part of the problem. Kormakur actually shot this film in Iceland, and it would take a hyper-credulous viewer to accept these stark landscapes as Minnesota. "Heaven" is a dark tale about insurance fraud. Dark in every sense of the word, as several early scenes are nearly invisible. The plot is murky; the cast's accents are all over the lot, especially Forest Whitaker's. Whitaker's attempts at Minnesotan leave him somewhere between Duluth and Dublin. The ending is intended to be richly ironic, but falls absolutely flat. For a far better experience, see Kormakur's "101 Reykjavik."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the movie, as it hasn't arrived here in Iceland, but I must tell you one thing, one thing that will surprise you...This movie was filmed in Iceland, I saw a comment where someone said Baltasar Kormákur had left Iceland, but actually I think he never left, except maybe for cutting and editing the film, but ALL the filming was done here. (why must I have the comment 10 lines, this will result in me getting blocked, well anyways..... . ........... ........... ....... .......... ......... ........ .... ......... ...... .............. .... ............. .......... ..... ....... ..... ....... ............. ........ .............. ................. ........... . .............)</fullReview>
