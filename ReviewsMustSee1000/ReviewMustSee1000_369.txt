		<shortDescription>Logic takes a beating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This expose is for people who have seen the movie and can't quite put their finger on why they have come away feeling so dirty. Well people, following are a few reasons why The Core poops all over science along with having the worst plot, characters and premise of all time. Firstly, that little speech the physicist gave to the class about sound traveling through rocks? He says something about the wavelength increasing (ding right), and then says the frequency will decrease (bzzz wrong). Frequency stays the same regardless of the medium it is traveling through. It is the wavelength that will in fact decrease.Secondly, what's with the explanation of how the Earth is going to end? Burning a peach with a deodorant can? Come on, I know military people are considered no-brainers, but he was demonstrating this to the people that lead a high tech organization. This patronises any military personnel, as well as the audience. Thirdly, The premise of the film is based around the effects that occur because the core of the Earth stops rotating. Let me just first note that there are geological records to say that the magnetic field has changed direction many times in the past, with evidence to support that each time it has been reduced close to 0. To the best of my knowledge, and that of every history book out there, this happens without any of us combusting like the peach.Fourthly, the scene with the golden gate bridge heating up because of a hole in the magnetic field? I think someone got magnetic field and ozone layer mixed up. The idea of punching a hole in a field is absurd. The field may be weakened, but the atmosphere would still protect our little bridges from cosmic radiation.Fifthly, there is a force field (magnetic) around the Earth, not much of one, but there is one, not an "electromagnetic energy field". An energy field would do sweet f*ck all to deflect radiation. The same radiation that is supposed to wipe out humans like the peach... Sixthly, 5 200-megaton nukes? Come on, those would weigh about 250 tons together. Let's try transport that on the dildo shaped 'virgil'. And the computer simulations of how they would be set off? All in 1 spot? That wouldn't create the required rotational force, since there would be no rotational force due to symmetry. He finally gets it right in the end to place them apart from each other. How they initially overlooked this one, I have no idea.Seventhly, the material used to withstand all the pressure and temperature on 'virgil' was called 'unobtainium'. nuff said.Eighthly, assuming we just spent the entirety of the world's budget on developing paradoxically copious amounts of unobtanium, it would take another 10 budgets over to have the resources to "control" the internet.Ninthly, when 'virgil' was tunneling downwards, why could the people walk around inside as if it was horizontal? They mentioned the rotating bridge, but didn't mention anything about rotating hallways, or the rip in the space-time continuum needed to walk straight between the bridge and the subsequent hallways. The compartments would need to rotate individually, which would put them out of alignment with each of the other compartments. Logically, they would be aligned parallel for everyone to be walking horizontal, and not fall to the front of the ship, as the front is pointing towards the centre of the Earth. If only they could pretend virgil was round, and the entire inside could rotate as one. A pity every shot shows a long cylindrical ship incapable of this.Tenthly, the giant geode that they crash into? All that pressure, all that temperature? But if that wasn't enough, they get out, and walk around. I know those space suits they had on looked cool, but they couldn't withstand the ~1000 degrees of temperature, and a few thousand kPa of pressure that is needed to keep the geode from collapsing under the weight of the world. Eleventhly, when the ship springs a leak? It would have been like a nuke going off in the ship, but instead, it took a few minutes for the compartment to crush. Twelfthly, the unlucky guy that has to walk through 9000 degrees temperature in a suit only designed to withstand 5000 degrees. He makes it to the duct and switches the lever? 9000 degrees is about 2-3 times the temperature of a nuclear bomb going off. I think the walls and floor of the corridor would have been glowing white with heat. Our man would have been vaporised, but lucky for him, only his converse pumps melted to get to the lever. Thirteenthly, the guy that pulls out the plutonium rods undergoing fission? He didn't even have a helmet on. $10 says his kids will have 5 noses, 3 mouths, and a foot coming out of their heads. I guess it's a good thing though that the DNA of such a twit is wiped from our society in these industrial accidents.Fourteenthly, when the power cut out from the lack of reactor rods, they hook up the power cables to the inner hull. Where do they put the ground? There needs to be a potential drop for power to be gained, and if there was a ground, then anyone that touched the hull would have been electrocuted. Fifteenthly, the arming code for the nukes was the first four prime numbers... 1 2 3 5... Pretty sure 1 is not a prime number. Well, thats about all, and thats not even going into the fact about how the core could stop spinning in the first place. Thanks for your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Core has chewy center, cheesy surface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood's gone to the outer reaches of our galaxy (not to mention others), it's plumbed the depths of the ocean, mapped dank swamps and arid deserts, but one place it hasn't gone to with any sort of regularity is the inner core itself.The Core is certainly one of those movies for which one must suspend disbelief. It's a science-fiction movie that emphasizes fiction over all; that is, the physics of the film don't hold up to snuff. If you're an engineer or physicist, you should be smart enough not to watch it - you'll just spend most of your time second-guessing the inane psuedoscience.It seems the inner core of the Earth has stopped spinning, for some reason, and this has caused the electromagnetic field that surrounds and protects the planet to begin to decompose. This is evidenced by, among other things, pigeons in Tralfagar Square in London suddenly veering at plate-glass windows and sundry people who wish they were extras in a less-violent movie, like Daddy Daycare or maybe Finding Nemo. At any rate, the world's leading scientists, commissioned by the military (it wouldn't be a Save the Planet from Imminent Destruction without our pals in the movie military), figure out that the core's stopped rotating, and that Something Must Be Done to get it going again.Ah, but what? We've only drilled down about 8 miles, and according to my calculations the distance from the surface to the core is .... a bit further. We must drill down, sayeth the sage scientists, and lo and behold, through the magic of movies, there's this guy in the desert who's been working on a laser rocket thingy that'll help them blast all the way down. This handy little thing is just the cure, so a crew is hastily assembled: Commander Iverson (Bruce Greenwood), Major Beck Childs (Hilary Swank), Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart), Dr. Serge Leveque (Tcheky Karyo), Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), and Dr. Ed Brazzelton.Like such doomsday movies as Armageddon, what The Core has going for it are likeable characters and a lot of nifty FX. It also has the unknown working for it; we don't know what lies beneath the thin crust of the Earth, because we haven't drilled beyond it. That allows filmmakers a lot of free reign to depict whatever the heck they want in terms of What's Down There.What The Core has going against it, however, is a predictable plot and some howlingly awful dialog. Now, it's not giving anything away to mention that at least one person doesn't make it back from this mission. It's also not giving anything away to note that there's at least one knockdown, drag-out hissy fit of a scene in which Keyes admonishes Childs for something she didn't do. It's hysterical to watch, although I suspect the emotion the director was attempting to convey was more like empathy, not euphoria. Or ennui, which is unfortunately how some of the movie felt.The Core is cheesy. No, not the actual inner core - although, come to think of it, maybe it is, since we don't know for sure what it's made of. And wouldn't that be fitting? A cheesy core for a cheesy film made by cheesy people in a cheesy society? Who's up for some Muenster?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Core is a solid action-adventure/disaster flick with a novel idea and a great cast. True, it is very silly, and some of the effects don't quite come off, but that's true of most films in its genre. I've watched it on DVD a couple of times now, always late at night, always steeped in alcohol, and I have to say it passes a couple of very easy hours. The opening scene in Trafalgar Square with the crazy pigeons is better than anything in The Day After Tomorrow. And who can resist the beautiful, talented, Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank? So please give The Core a break. Stop taking it so seriously. Down a six pack and accept The Core into your lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A middling, mildy entertaining diversion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of ****The Core is the "low-budget" answer to Armageddon, meaning it was made on less than half the cost but desires to be its equal in delivering thrills and big buckets of popcorn fun. Now, whether or not you liked Armageddon is a good determinant of whether or not you should even bother watching The Core in the first place. I myself haven't seen that Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer production in a while, and memory serves that it was an unbelievably preposterous, but enjoyable thrill ride that had a great sense of humor. How does The Core compare?Well, if I hadn't seen Armageddon, I might have liked this film more, which is not to say that it's a weaker movie, just that the disaster formula plays out in much the same way so there's a sense of deja vu hanging over the proceedings. There are a lot of people out there who hated Armageddon, perhaps for its absurd science or for its quick-cut action sequences, so for those who didn't like the latter, The Core would be more up their alley, though the science here is even sillier.The premise is the anti-Deep Impact/Armageddon. A group of expert individuals have to go to the center of the Earth to jumpstart the core, which has stopped spinning for some unknown reason. Heading this mission is professor Josh Keys (Aaron Eckhart), who's leading a six-man team, with a woman playing a key role, of course, as the pilot, played by Hilary Swank. Recognizable faces Delroy Lindo, Tcheky Karyo, Stanely Tucci, and Bruce Greenwood round out the rest of this very expendable team.Already, we realize the plot is fundamentally impossible. The only people who wouldn't recognize this are those still in grade school, so they'll probably get a kick out of the movie while thinking they're getting some kind of education out of this because of all the scientific mumbo-jumbo and technobabble. More discriminatory viewers will scoff at all the sudden new inventions that aid our intrepid group of heroes, particularly the hull Delroy Lindo devises that's actually strengthened by heat. For me, scientific flaws are acceptable so long as it's not so blatantly obvious, but this movie's stretching my suspension of disbelief.But those who don't care for any scientific inaccuracies will wonder, is the action any good? The answer's a mixed bag. Almost all the action is entirely CGI-related, so the question of whether or not you find it exciting to see an "earthcraft" (named Virgil) get banged around quite a few times is crucial to your enjoyment. The action aboveground is all given away in the trailers, and none of it's particularly exciting, thanks to the weak special effects. The space shuttle crash, the destruction of the Roman Colosseum and the Golden Gate bridge are not examples of CGI-work at its best, to put it kindly. A 60 million dollar budget isn't quite enough to pull a movie of this sort off, and it sometimes shows.Surprisingly enough, the scenes set below ground do somewhat make up for the slack. A crisis is introduced every five to ten minutes to keep the characters working, so what we get is a briskly paced and often enjoyable second half. The effects work is still spotty, but I found the characters relatively engaging, the situations fairly compelling, and the Mcgyverish-solutions amusing. Still marring this outing on a consistent basis, however, are the film's predictability, the occasionally really bad dialogue, the lack of solid intentional humor, and the stilted finale. The Core is not an unenjoyable timewaster, but it's not exactly a great night at the movies, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than often given credit for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am watching "The Core" after having read several other comments about the movie. The sentiments expressed go from being "Fine Movie" to "Worst Movie ever," the last obviously coming from someone who rated "Starship Troopers" as the "greatest Sci Fi movie ever made." There are parts of this movie that are actually very good. The first thing to give credit for was the cast that they had. It is a very good cast. Let me repeat, a very good cast. Alfrie Woodard has never given a bad performance, and although her role was relatively small, she brought moral gravity to the role that the movie needed. Delroy Lindo showed a range that I have never seen him do. Obviously better recognized as a man in control, he was nigh on perfect as the forgotten but brilliant scientist who still stings over Stanley Tucci's Conrad Zimsky having stole his discoveries from a generation earlier. Tucci, a fine actor, did take it over the top a bit too much. DJ Qualls gives an underrated performance. He is 6'2" but makes us believe he is a 5'7" geek. He gave a touching performance as he tried to slow down the big bad that caused the problem in the first place. Aaron Eckhart, normally a baddie, did a believable performance, with Hillary Swank, a two time Oscar winner bringing her easily recognized skills to the screen. I originally wanted to blame Director Jon Amiel for the faults of the movie, but when I went back and considered individual roles and scenes, I realized that he did the job he was paid to do. The visual effects were more than adequate, constrained by the need, not for realism, but by the need to show things that would further the story.So where did it go wrong? First, the problem, I believe, was with the writing. The script was very uneven. Part of it came from what appears to be last minute changes in the story line. Early trailers suggest a very different story -- and rumors from Hollywood at the time indicated this was true.Too much of the story telling was quick and dirty, trying to just get it done. Had they not been locked in to a predetermined release date, they could have gotten the script right. Second, it seems there was a problem with editing. There were times when the film just went clunk. Was it poor editing in and of itself? Or was it editing that had to serve the problems with the script. Far from a perfect movie, but one with some very good elements. Give credit where credit is due.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you jump start the Earth's core? Well, if you want to find out (and have a few laughs in between) all you need to do is watch 'The Core'...Yes, it's stupid, yes, it makes no sense, yes, the science is flawed, and yes, it's impossible. Nevertheless, I have to say I enjoyed watching this movie. It's one of those 'get a beer and some popcorn, turn your brain off and enjoy the afternoon' type of pictures. If you are not pretentious and take this film for what it is, you are more likely than not to enjoy it as I did.All in all, this is a classic disaster flick, and for a disaster flick, this is above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the critics really laid into THE CORE on its initial release . Granted the central premise of Planet Earth stopping on its axis is ridiculous but the script structure compensates for the bizarre scientific impossilbilities . Look at the opening scene with people dropping dead in Boston , it does its job of drawing the audience into the story . It doesn't stop there because a few moments later we cut to London and see a remake of THE BIRDS . Not not good enough for you ? Well wait around because they'll hopefully be a disaster around the corner that will appeal to you It's never explained in any convincing detail how the Earth's core stopping spinning can cause these effects but we're talking about a Hollywood movie not some theory put forward by Stephen Hawking . Unlikely events do happen in Hollywood movies as if you hadn't noticed so when people criticise this movie as being " Dumb " they're perhaps taking life a little too seriously For what it is - A dumb movie with special effects and an action adventure concept - THE CORE certainly succeeds . We're shown a ballsy heroine played by Hilary Swank who can actually act and unlike say the very similar Armageddon we don't have to put up with macho American flag waving at every opportunity .If you're looking for an entertaining pop corn movie THE CORE should do the trick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you tell when a director is bad? I mean, assuming the director is given $50 million or so, competent actors, and a halfway-decent script, what would the film look like if he/she REALLY didn't know what he/she was doing? I think that film would look a lot like "The Core."From the preview stage, this movie was on my "might see it but not pay for it" list, so I just now caught it on cable. Hilary Swank and Aaron Eckhart will definitely have Oscars someday, and most of the other actors who make it on the ship are of similar caliber. The comic relief generally works ("I'm going to need Xena tapes and lots of Hot Pockets"), and the plot is no more ridiculous than, say, "The Day After Tomorrow" (though it is slightly LESS ridiculous-- at least this movie attempts to offer a cause for the problem, however unlikely).I remember watching "Entrapment," another John Amiel film, and thinking it was, in a word, awful. The editing was off, the plot lumbered ahead only through the will of Sean Connery's accent and Catherine Zeta-Jones spandex-clad anatomy. Watching "The Core," Amiel has decided his mistake was pacing, and turns up the volume to eleven and full speed ahead, hoping the charisma of his actors covers his butt. In the second half of the film, this works fine. In the first half, it just shows his limitations as a director... poor special effects during the space shuttle landing that could easily have been fixed with model work or different camera angles; birds going crazy and smacking into buildings look exactly like someone tossed a dummy against a building, then the editor cut it as close as possible. Truly, this is a man at the helm who doesn't know what a good film is supposed to look like. I wonder what an Ed Wood movie would have looked like, if someone had given THAT guy $50 million?Characters die with clockwork predictability, and my only problem with the resolution was the actors were TOO good. They play geniuses, the absolute best in their fields, so when the movie ends I wanted to spend more time with them, see what incredible problems, discoveries, adventures they had next. The movie itself is barely a D+, thanks to the actors, occasionally adequate special effects (which we will call simply "effects"), and a really great score to hold it all together. I'd buy the score (not the pop songs over the credits) before I'd watch the movie again, but it's a thumbs up effort for everyone who isn't Amiel. Worth a dollar if you have two hours to kill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got done watching this...uhhh...movie, if that's what you can call it. It happens to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not since "Mission to Mars" have I hated a movie so much. This movies few supporters try to say "relax, and enjoy a mindless disaster flick."The question is, exactly how mindless are we supposed to be? Should we completely remove our brain first by smashing our head on a rock until it falls out, because if so, I'll do it. It would surely be a hell of a lot less painful than watching this rancid mass of decay again. And I love mindless action flicks. The problem is even for a pure f/x only movie, it sucks. All the "special" (as in, short school bus special) effects look like they were done by some failing college students using their pirated and hacked version of 3D studio. During the space shuttle crash sequence, I was half expecting to see little strings attached as it bounced around like it was in a freaking puppet show.The "acting" (a very loose term) was below sub par, and everyone seemed like they hated the very movie they were acting in. Hilary Swank's character couldn't be any more plastic, annoying, and clichéd if she tried, and as for the rest of the cast, yuck. Delroy Lindo, was okay as Dr. Ed Brazzleton. I wish I could have skin that could withstand 4500 degree heat for 5 minutes. (It was 9000 degree in the core, but the suit could 'only' handle 4500 degrees, and naturally, someone has to go outside.) Then again, it might have been lucky for him, so he didn't have to suffer the humiliation of being 'saved' by whales.All in all, this movie was an abomination; a freak of nature that could have only been devised by the most twisted and sadomasochistic of minds. Maybe in about 10 years or so, they'll do a "Mystery Science Theater 3000" for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the Worst Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by people who must have failed all of their high school science classes, directed by someone who must have never seen a computer actually function, this film is jam packed with the most tired clichés of filmdom. The acting is abominable--and by actors who are very talented. Shot almost entirely in television style close ups, this film is an insult to intelligence. It all starts with an awful script--it really seems like someone just recorded a bunch of twelve year olds playing "rocket ship" together--"whoah, someone diverted our energy! where's it gone?"(actual line!)--transcribed it, and decided to spend one hundred million dollars on it.No reason to write a spoiler, you've seen it all before a hundred times, mostly on television.Basically, if Ed Wood was given a gigantic budget, this is what he would've made.It just goes to show that in the words of Miles Davis, "you can't polish a turd."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because I am generally a fan of sci-fi films, I gave this movie a few hours of my time this afternoon.After about ten minutes of (spoilers): Confused pigeons flying into windows, the Space Shuttle landing in the "LA River," ridiculous electrical storms and unrealistic plot lines, I found myself wishing the Earth's magnetic field was really screwed up so I could be taken out of my misery.There is nothing positive about this movie to report. Sometimes bad movies still have some kind of unexplainable charm, but this piece of cinematic trash can't even deliver there.Films like this are supposed to AT LEAST have decent special effects, but not this gem! The "exciting" space shuttle scene looked like somebody took their toy shuttle and threw it off a roof while filming with their new camcorder... horrible! I truly feel insulted that a motion picture company would sign off on this and expect anybody with an IQ over 50 to like it! In fact, I'm heading out for treatment right now because I'm doubting my own sanity because I actually sat there and watched it! Trust me... skip this and watch something else!</fullReview>

Within the first five minutes I knew that the two main characters would get together, the rest of the crew would die, and they would be successful. The movie hit rock bottom when the characters got out of their ship into a geode that couldn't possibly exist. The temperature was about 9000 degrees and they're walking around in aluminum foil suits(witch conduct heat and energy). The only good part of the movie is when the guy who made DESTINY dies. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who has ever had a conscious thought or has an IQ equivalent to a small stone.

		<fullReview>Jon Amiel is a well known and respected director known for his work with actors, so it may come as a bit of a surprise that he wanted to tackle a project like this. And he does say in the 'featurettes' that he wanted this to be a character driven narrative. And if you check the deleted scenes you'll see there was in fact enough material to make it so.But something happened in the cutting room. The scenes that added depth to the characters were cut, leaving only the vestiges of a run of the mill catastrophe science fiction movie.And it's wonderful the special effects people are proud of the work they've done but as viewers we're not interested so much in that as we want to have something pleasurable to watch.And that's where this turkey fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know much about geology, but what little I do know suggests that the nature of the Earth's core is such as to be impervious to any merely human intervention, and that traveling to it is something human beings probably never will be able to do. Hence, any SF flick about humans doing one to rectify the other is likely to be as fanciful as The Wizard of Oz, so a big "caveat emptor" is attached to this movie. I figured that anyone audacious enough to cook up an eco-fable like this would have checked his science so as to make the movie more believable, but apparently I was wrong according to the legion of IMDb reviewers who have savaged this film.This film reminded me a bit of the 1966 film "Fantastic Voyage," in which a group of scientists and their craft are shrunk to the size of a microbe and injected into the body of a scientist (or was it a diplomat?) who has been wounded in an assassination attempt, in a race against time to save his life. "The Core" resembles "Fantastic Voyage" in several ways: First, the technological premise that makes possible travel to this inaccessible realm is so far-fetched as to be more magical than scientific. Second, in all but a few places, the inside of the body is naturally quite dark, and so, one would think, is the interior of the Earth; but in both movies, these unseen realms are aglow with light. Third, the sex ratio is similar: Four men, one woman, who of course is played by Raquel Welch. Fourth, none of the characters rises much above stereotype, since the story is driven by situation, not characters. Fifth, come to think of it, Hilary Swank, while not as voluptuous as the young Raquel Welch (who could be?), does slightly resemble her. Sixth, the events of the film are kept secret from the public, and Edmund O'Brien's General Carter is very similar to General Purcell, who is played by that excellent and serviceable character actor Richard Jenkins. (Unfortunately, every time I saw Jenkins, I was distracted by memories of his hilarious performance as Walter Wingfield in "Say It Isn't So.") I will say one thing in this film's defense: As absurd as it may be, and as uninspired in terms of plot, characterization, visual effects and believability, it did keep me watching to find out what would happen next all the way to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember why we GO to movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are supposed to be fun. Entertainment. And on that score, I think The Core answers. If you want everything to be scientific and plausible, you'd be better off watching a documentary, but The Core is no less fantastic than the novels of Jules Verne (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Journey to the Centre of the Earth). Instead, I think expectations have changed.Yes, The Core requires a massive amount of suspension of disbelief. And personally, I'm willing to suspend it. Would the Earth's core stop spinning? Unlikely. Would we be able to restart it if we did? Improbable. Do I care? Not one bit. The Core is a movie I never tire of, and I think it is one of the better natural disaster movies. The performances are solid and the dialog interesting. If your problem is the performance of the script, I can't say anything more, but if you're quibbling about the "scientific errors", and I'm sure there are many, I have this to say to you: Relax. Have fun. You'll live longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>craptacular! **contains possible spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well...The Big Dumb Action movie sub-genre known as the Disaster Movie certainly has its share of expensive, implausible examples: The Day After Tomorrow, Armageddon, etc. The Core sits right alongside these movies and outdoes them in dumbness. While it wasn't horrible, and had moments of being a fun ride, The Core was far from great.The plot is just about as ridiculous as it gets: the earth's core has stopped turning, and a crack team of "experts" has to (what else?) set off a nuclear warhead to start it up again. These include the Aryan (blond, built, square-jawed) academic played by Aaron Eckhardt, the SuperWoman navigator played by Hilary Swank (i.e. White American Alpha male and female), plus a French guy, an old guy, and a black guy. Who do you think is going to kick it? The team inside the Rocket to the Centre of the Earth plays out its inner tensions against the team on the surface, which includes the always awesome Alfre Woodard as a sort of Lt Uhura whose responsibility seems to be to talk to the team, Richard Jenkins as a by-the-books-need-to-know Military Overlord, and DJ Qualls as comic relief-cum-hacker. Even though the cast choices are great, unfortunately the characters have barely even enough character to be stereotypes, and their real purpose is to move around the movie magic of a planet falling in on itself.So a giant penis, I mean rocket drill, hurtles in a large vagina, I mean tunnel, into the earth's core, which calls up all kinds of images about returning to the womb. They've made it out of some magical substance that gets better the more pressure you put onto it, cooled it with liquid nitrogen so it'll withstand the nine THOUSAND degree heat, and made its occupants into superheroes that can casually lift a series of warheads and move them into separate compartments for detonation. Not to mention the super-laser beam that will blow holes through rocks, allow the ship to glide through, and have the holes effortlessly close behind it. All of that is taken care of in the whole "willing suspension of disbelief" that's necessary to watch a movie like this, so I'll forgive it, because of the sheer joy of any disaster-movie. You watch it to watch the heroes get stressed out, and overcome it through the overwhelming force of their American spirit.And boy, is this movie American. Not only do you have the clean-cut stone-chiseled action heroes win, but for some reason, the entire PLANET is screwed, and the Americans seem to be the only ones with the brains or powers of observation to even notice, let alone try to fix it! Never mind the other hundred or so "First World" countries that might possibly have scientific researchers or be looking at electromagnetic activity.If you want depth or character or a believable plot, this isn't the movie for you. If you want a fun ride, good actors who must be doing this for money, and a vast imagination that compensates for its implausibility, enjoy. Myself, I couldn't help thinking of DJ Qualls' comment in the commentary for Hustle and Flow--he was proud they'd made H&amp;F for less than $1 million, because he'd watch other movies and think "You spent $XXM on this?" Indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie. It's not meant to be anything meaningful or useful, it's meant to entertain and it does so perfectly. There is quite a bit of humor which makes even the most implausible parts worth watching and extremely entertaining. If you combined the best parts of "Armageddon" (which was wonderful) and the funniest lines from "Evolution" (the one with David Duchovny) you will have this movie.Yes, it's campy. Yes, the science is noteworthy only for being completely impossible, and YES it is a wonderfully funny and entertaining movie.So what are you waiting for, go SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure I wanted to see this in the theatres. There was something fishy about the trailers -- there were two distinct trailers: one which played on the whole "journey to the core of the earth" fiasco; and one which was much more interesting, touting the whole "government weapon conspiracy which wrecked the world" angle. I was more partial to the second one, and there wasn't really much of this in the film. It was mostly about putting together enough duct tape logic to get a machine that could travel inside the Earth. Unfortunately, the film played a little rough and tumble with the science, using it only when it suited them, and sweeping it under the carpet in other circumstances, hoping no one would notice. Case in point: they go through great lengths to explain how this gadget will destroy all rock and metal which gets in its way, then come up with a fantastic new element which resists this laser drilling mechanism. Later, they find out that this drill can't get through diamonds (or for that matter, amethysts). Why not just build a ship out of diamonds? We can mass produce these now -- why not just take the existing science a step further. Case number two: this miracle metal, "unobtainium", has the fantastic capability to absorb heat and convert it into energy (somehow). So later, while swimming in 9000 degree molton nickel, they use a blowtorch (!) to solder copper cables to it. There's obviously two things wrong here. #1, shouldn't this guy get electrocuted by standing so close to the bulkhead? #2, how could a blowtorch make the bulkhead hot enough to take the solder? This thing is holding back 9000 degree metal on the outside. Every calorie of heat from the blowtorch would be converted into "energy". I won't even go into the whole idea that heat IS ENERGY! This drove me nuts every time they mentioned it. There's dozens of these bad science examples running throughout the film. But really, I don't care what kind of science you use, as long as you at least keep it consistent throughout. What was even funnier about this film was the fact that they took the greatest minds in the world of geophysics, and simply dropped them into the molten mantle of the planet. Why would you do this? I'm surprised none of them dies during training... what if they were all to die instantly? Wouldn't it be a better idea since they had a RADIO UPLINK TO THE SURFACE to have some Navy/Air Force/Space program pilots drive the vessel? As much as I hate to say it, I liked Armageddon better than this film. And I absolutely hated Armageddon. But at least it had a little star power, a little campy humour, and some personality to the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I had expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the Core expecting to see the worst movie of all time. Perhaps because my hopes were so low for this movie I actually found it not as bad as I had feared. In fact, it was quite enjoyable.Sure, there are plenty of dumb moments in it and the science is questionable, at best. But it is moderately entertaining and fun. There are some spoilers ahead.The silly, but amusing stuff:Journeying to the centre of the Earth is bad enough - but did they have to do it in something that reminded me of my Hornby train set from when I was a kid?Just how does a penniless scientist living in the desert make (let alone invent) a substance that would revolutionise modern life?Why did that scientist not immediately patent and sell his substance and make a fortune from it, which he could then use to fund his Earth ship?I'm sorry, but the "Project Destiny stopped the Core spinning but it can't start it again" line doesn't wash with me.The computer hacker. Yawn.No kissing at the end, despite the obvious attraction of the two characters for each other.However, despite the above, I enjoyed the film and was able to overlook the silliness. There was one thing, though, which had me gritting my teeth and shaking my head.The manual release mechanism for the pod separation. Nobody would design it that way, even if they were under a deadline to complete the project. It's the equivalent of designing a plane with the landing gear release lever on the outside! Or a car with the gear lever in the boot/trunk! Stupid, just plain stupid.Up until that point I was enjoying the movie. That kind of killed it a bit, but I soldiered on and enjoyed the rest of the film in spite of it.All in all, much better than I had expected, and worth watching on a rainy day, or even a mildly cloudy one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better Armageddon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amid all those bad reviews and given the fact that Michael Bay´s Armageddon is one of the worst movies of all time, I didn´t expected very much from this one. I had some hope for this movie, because Jon Amiel also directed the wonderful "Sommersby" and the great but underrated "Copycat". The cast was as good as it can be in this kind of disaster movie, especially Stanley Tucci as Zimsky, who clearly had lots of fun with his role. The rest was ok. The camerawork was excellent, the film has some fine FX, especially the space shuttle sequence, and it unfolded at a good pace. To me it didn´t seem to run 135 minutes. Obviously logic isn´t something you should look for in this one, but most of the scientific and technical details can be swallowed, except for the material the "Virgil" is made of. Do I have to say "Unobtanium"? I laughed out loud, the moment Delroy Lindo took this word in his mouth (Watching this film in Germany, most of the other people in the cinema didn´t get it, because in the dubbed version they didn´t translated this word into german). All in all I really enjoyed this movie and can recommend it to everyone who likes this kind of popcorn flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice and entertaining adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I watched the trailer and it promised a descent adventure-flick. Then I read various comments... and they made me shiver. But between the lines I got the feeling that watching this movie would be the right decision.And I wasn't disappointed.I think most of you know what it is all about and I can omit the summary of the 'story'.Anybody should be aware of the fact that this movie was surely never meant to be serious and sometimes just pretends to be. It's all about a great adventure of venturing to the earth's core - awaking memories of Jules Verne. Certainly nobody had, at that time, seriously expected people thousands of miles under the ocean, walking through caverns to the middle of the earth or to be shot to the moon with big cannons...As in Star Trek they make something up which sounds cool and (at most times) fit into the story but not in our scientific point of view. Especially as a scientist I laughed out loud at various points when they talk scientific nonsense or pretend to be serious. But even including the predictability, all this doesn't diminish the entertaining potential of this film - it is certainly not a comedy but with more self-mockery than Armageddon, which is a good sign.If you know what to expect you won't be disappointed. I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is way under rated.It is probably my favorite "end of the world" movie.There's the genius professor who prefer to teach the new generation than use his intellect to work for a big paying job that would flatter his ego and make him look important. It destroys the idea that when you aren't good enough at something to work in the field, you teach it. Professors are underrated and this makes them shine in a new light.There's this woman in a man's world. Men try to keep females off big ego boosting jobs. But she's good at it, it's her calling. She first get blamed, after all she's so pretty and young so she has to be lame, but they find out that the accident happened way before her decisions, and that they actually saved the day against all odds...There's also this geek, a pure computer genius who can hack a company with a mere piece of gum wrapping, and 2 notes of music with it. Don't mess with geeks. We also see him have a big emotional moment, so the belief that introverts are just distant, cold and calculated gets shattered. There's some deep emotions going on in there.We also have the moral that when your defense army is so full of mistrust, they can end up destroying the world and themselves along with it... and kicking a dead horse with more of the problem isn't going to cut it... even if weapons can be used to save people, you have to aim them properly, not at people, with good intentions, and even so you can die in the process...3 loved ones makes this ugly world worth saving... It doesn't have to be perfect, we don't need the arrogance to care for the whole planet to do something heroic... a simple man wishing to save what his precious to him can do a lot of heartfelt good... If everyone was to do their share, the world would become a better place way faster than superman would be able to make it. (But that's my own interpretation) You have great apocalyptic moments, funny moments, the impact on children... Rivalry and making peace, how people behind the scenes in the dirt can actually be way more productive and clever than people bragging in the spot light... How criminals can actually care much more for the fate of the world than people who think they are in charge of it and only care about their personal control, led by fear far more than reason, and certainly not wisdom.It was a family friendly movie, heart warming... It was magnificent to see deep n the earth, the giant geode and diamonds... ah~!!! And the science, maybe a lot of people hated it because it seemed far fetched... that's what we said about the greatest discoveries before we accepted it centuries after... like the earth being round, and not the center of the universe with god's eye directly staring at it... I think it is possible... I like making theories, and I recently thought about maybe the gravity isn't only done by rotating around the sun, maybe all things have a center of gravity on it's on... even people, we can take pictures of their energy (some weirdos call it auras... apparently it exists, things have one too)... so everything has energy... so I wondered if the earth could have one on it's own... that movie explained it in details! And it made so much sense (well, to me... I was open to the idea...) and how powerful is the magnetic field... enough to repel the energy of the sun so we won't boil... not just from a bas bubble's crust (ozone) but energy too... and this energy is made by centrifuge force (like turning a bucket full of water above your head fast enough, the water stays in, and the planet turning around the sun) so to have someone turning inside the earth... and how small repetitive strikes can disturb and even stop it... (or our moral and health) It's brilliant!!! The earth is alive... changing, moving... and if it's heart stops... we all die...Yeah I bet many hate the idea, because then you can't suck it's blood and do whatever you want to it... you'll poison yourself right back... to the core... how something so far from our eyes could affect us... (like the moon and the tides) and their idea of the consequences... letting the suspense intrigue us before they explain it... like how you can think that you are on top of the world, young, successful... but then in a second, out of the blue, you drop dead... How much it's important to enjoy yourself now while you still can...I felt bad when they hid the information from the population... the masses could have come up with ideas... Like putting lighting rots... that could have been useful... blissful ignorance tend to explode in your face soon or later... enjoy it while it last I guess, but then you are powerless... it wasn't an act of god but an act of human stupidity... but yeah, go ahead... just whine and blame god, way easier than do something about it, no wait you're dead.I guess people really hated to see that... hum...But the truth always come out... you can't hide it from people who want to know... people who want to tell always find a way...Because the least we can do when people die for others, is to know and be grateful.I adored this movie! Full of emotions, science, morale, colorful characters...But no sex, not even sexy clothes... no one farted... man what a flop... don't waste your time... it could make you think.. and that could make your brain create new pathways between your neurones... Ouch... Thank god it's entertaining!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Smarter than Armageddon and equally extreme, The Core is high-tech Hollywood hokum at its finest. It's scientifically ridiculous, but this variant of Fantastic Voyage at least tries to be credible as it plunges deep into the earth's inner core, where a formulaic team of experts pilot an earth-boring ship to jump-start the planet's spinning molten interior, now stalled by a military secret that could seal the fate of all humankind. It's a geophysicist's wet dream that only a fine ensemble cast could rescue from absurdity, and director Jon Amiel (Entrapment, Copycat) draws excellent work (and plenty of humorous interplay) from Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, and a host of memorable supporting players, especially The New Guy's D.J. Qualls as the world's greatest Cyb-nerd. With enough digital F/X disasters to satisfy anyone's apocalyptic fantasies, this is a popcorn thriller with all the bells and whistles that its genre demands. Sit back, pump up the volume, and enjoy the dazzling ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this a solid grade because it's fairly entertaining. Not quite as retarded as "Independence Day" or "Armageddon", but quite silly. Scientifically, this film stretches the boundaries of nonsense like rarely before. Plus we have Lindo as a brilliant scientist?! I don't think so. A black woman as NASA's top dog?! Where will this political correctness go next? There were no courtroom scenes to stick a female black judge into, so they came up with NASA?! Come off it, you PC idiots? The U.S. gov't hires a degenerate internet criminal to aid them? Don't they have anyone of their own? I do think so. And what the hell do they need the internet for? So he can screw them over when they want to launch "Destiny"? God, it's dumb... When strange things start happening, why does Pentagon send for a college professor? OK, this isn't as silly as the other stuff, but still a little dodgy. How about the scene where the rat-faced internet nerd figures out the whales singing? Or how about Hillary Swank as not only an astronaut, but a top NASA pilot!? I really don't think so - at all. And how about that shuttle landing in L.A. without a single person scratching half their ass-cheek? Wonderful stuff, the kind of retarded nonsense that Hollywood has excelled in, especially in recent years. I really don't want to go too much into "core travel" because, after all, it's supposed to be a fun movie? BUT INTO THE EARTH'S CORE??? The temperatures and the incredible pressures alone would disintegrate anything and anybody, and Lindo's ship that drill's instant holes and without leaving residue?! Come on. And I love that line, "Well, it's a good thing the suits protects us!" when these bozos actually LEAVE the ship and go "outside"! However, the single dumbest thing in the movie is that the "core crisis" was caused by humans! And of course by the U.S. government - who else. At a time when Bush is blamed for just about everything ? apart from perhaps dangerous South African sharks (well, maybe that, too) ? it comes as no surprise that paranoia-and-stupidity-inducing Hollywood would put the blame even on something as this on the U.S. How the hell can anything humans do on the surface AFFECT THE ZILLIONS OF TONS OF MOLTEN IRON IN THE CORE?! To me, this little fact "tops" anything in "ID" or "Armageddon" even.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is all setup and no payoff. You know it's bad when an "action" movie stretches the final five minutes worth of action into 30 minutes worth of screen time. But why start at the end? This film has cheese in it from the get-go.*Spoilers aplenty*It starts off wobbly, but in a way that looked to be perhaps as promising as Stargate. Drs. Aaron Eckhart and Tchéky Karyo are brought in by the government to offer up their expert opinions on a series of unusual phenomena. After being dismissed by the feds, Eckhart does some research of his own and, based on bird and whale migration patterns, determines that the earth's core has stopped spinning and the world is doomed. After going on a bender, the good doctors alert the feds of the earth's impending destruction. The feds pull out all the stops and assemble a team and plan a mission to tunnel to the center of the earth and restart the core's rotation.This is all well and good. The problem I had with the film is not the plot, but the execution. About 30 minutes into the movie, the audience has a choice to make: either walk out mid-film, or stay seated and watch as cliché after cliché are thrown at us by the oh-so-inventive writers. (I am currently unemployed, but there are people making 6 and 7 figures to write crap like this??) First, the science is lousy! I'm no good at the science a mission like this would entail, but even I know without a doubt that the science featured in The Core is crap. Next, the characters had about as much depth and substance as the giant Core cutout that dominated my local megaplex's lobby. The characters were so flimsy that, I swear to you, I not only knew who would and wouldn't survive, I knew the exact order in which they would die. That's a first for me. The standard confrontation between the bullish Army brass and the ship's crew was right on cue. The climax is fairly tedious, just a series of small special effects explosions that were less exciting than whether the lady at the concession stand would overfill my medium fruit punch and spill it all over the counter. To make matters worse, the climax takes place a good 20 minutes before the end of the film. What follows is the ludicrous escape from the center of the earth. The ship, having shed a few sections in the execution of the mission, is now as agile as a Porsche, dodging mountain-sized obstructions with ease. Then the Navy sends what looks like half the Pacific fleet out to look for them in a very tight search pattern, but they give up after 10 minutes. "We'll never find them. Let's call it off." Then...well, then it goes on for another yawn-inducing 10 minutes.What a waste of an opportunity to make an good sci-fi action movie. What a waste of Delroy Lindo and Hillary Swank. What a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those dumping on this movie, did you ever hear of "science fiction"? Well, this is it... - without the "science" part. If you want a movie that is 100% true to the laws of science, tune in to the Discovery Channel.Having said that, the movie is watchable with some neat tricks. It is, however, tiresomely clichéd, certainly as far as its cast. We have the "hero," by far the best looking guy in the picture who is amazingly intelligent and resourceful. A thirty-something Ph.D. professor so accomplished he's headhunted by the Government and airlifted to D.C. at a moment's notice. Did I mention he's single and available? Then we have the resident 20-something-year-old floozie who is such a multitalented braniac and savant that one's mind boggles to learn that she has not yet been crowned queen of the universe and all its dimensions. Plus, she's beautiful, voluptuous and flirtatious. (Heaven forfend she would look anything like her real-life counterpart: Bespectacled, plump, spotty...) Oh, did I mention she's single and available, too? There's the token African-American who is, but of course, at least equally as smart as the smartest fella in the movie (Zimsky). He had a great injustice perpetrated against him a couple of decades ago (geddit?), so he became a recluse, which I guess is supposed to add depth to his character or some sh*t like that.There's a Frenchman for some comic relief.There are a few other totally forgettable characters whose only purpose is to make the brilliant, beautiful protagonists look even better.Who do you think eventually shacks up in this picture? If you've been paying attention, that question should be a cinch! Answers on a postcard, please.*rolls eyes*</fullReview>

What sells it for me is the acting. Stanley Tucci in particular comes off well. Its clear he knows he's in a cheesy movie, but rather than pull a Dustin Hoffman and try and take it seriously, he dives right in and starts chewing scenery in a big way. I half expected him to literally start gnawing on the set. The plot is pretty clever and keeps throwing obstacles in the way of the crew that they have to use their smarts to overcome. But anyway, if you've got some bucks to spare and like a cheesy flick now and them, you could do worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't mind this film, but then, I was not expecting much. The "disaster" was built up nicely in the first 30 minutes, with some decent special effects. The acting was above par for this type of film, but the characters seemed to be a little underdeveloped. Very much a poor mans Armageddon, this is good Sunday afternoon entertainment. The film is a little long, it drags a bit in the middle, and the ending is contrived - but it's a lot better than some of the other "blockbusters" currently released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Great Science, but not bad science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people including myself anticipated this movie with great dismay. The last thing we need is another sci-fi movie based on bad science.As a geologist, I have viewed THE CORE and I believe that the film is not as awful as I had feared. There are several instances of blatant neglect, but overall, the science is good. And the parts where they jump the gun and shoot off the scientific radar are compensated for by the fact that they invent ways to get around it.The movie is a run of the mill save everyone by killing yourself type flick, but it does keep you interested, and gives a much needed update to the genre of exploring what is beneath us. An all star cast make the characters meaningful and you grow attached to them.I think that this film is good. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good action science fiction film. Of course who would expect so called realism in a film like this or Time Machine or Planet of the Apes. If you are looking for slow motion vomiting or anything like that which people now call realism it is not really here. The film calls for some imagination by the audience and dimwits who have no imagination might laugh or not like this film. The only part I did not like is the kind attitude it had toward anything government or army which is disconcerting when the army seems like such a positive thing right now on the war coverage. Also criticism of army etc. is so old and tired in movies and common.But the film is still good although pretty grim at moments. It reminds me of Dantes Peak movie a few years ago. I also saw this film the same day as Tears in the Sun which is one of the great films of all time so that made this one seem not as good. But it is still worth a look.</fullReview>

Some people may like this claustrophobic terror, not me. When the movie is set outside, the special effects are ridiculous, particularly Rome destroyed by a magnetic storm that makes strangely explode the Coliseum. If the cast is talented, the story is not up to them and the journey is boring.

		<shortDescription>For what it is, it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people seem to dislike this movie but I think they are the kind of people that go to movies just to knock 'em. These are the kind of people who read books, listen to music, and watch TV shows just to create a mental checklist of all the things that are done wrong in their own brilliant opinions. So if you follow me so far, here's my brief review of The Core.My reactions to the various big budget disaster movies of recent years have been varied. My expectations were low going into "The Core" because the trailer, while interesting, still made the movie look like major cheese potential. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. For what it is, which is pure popcorn escapism fun, it works. The special effects and sets are excellent, the actors are all good, and the story was not nearly as hokey as I thought it would be.Aaron Eckhart, Hillary Swank and Stanley Tucci are all pretty respectable actors, and they give the movie the substance that it may have otherwise lacked. Yes, the cliché "hacker nerd" and military brass characters are a little old, but they don't ruin the experience. I have no idea how realistic or plausible the story is. But "The Core" is one of those entertaining movies that will take you away for a ride if you can suspend your disbelief. Thumbs up for a good effort.</fullReview>

It's one of those fun Science Fiction films you're not supposed to take seriously, just sit back and enjoy. If you have a chance, take a look. **SPOILER!!!** My favorite character is Conrad Zimsky, an egomaniac who thinks he knows everything about everything. He disagrees with anything anyone says or does, is prone to throwing "temper tantrums" complete with flailing arms and is speaking his every word into a small recorder for a big book deal. While helping our what's left of the crew set up the atomic bombs, he gets trapped and is jettisoned out with part of the ship into "The Core." As he awaits death, he records his last thoughts. Suddenly, he realizes no one is going to hear this recorded oration. He throws the recorder away, says, "What the *** am I doing?" and bursts into hysterical laughter. As the camera pulls back, we see the seconds click to 00 on the bomb. No character has ever died a more magnificent death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Save The World Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!! This is probably one of the best what I like to call "save the world" movies I have ever seen. It seems like almost a reverse of the movie "Armageddon". A group of scientists discover that the earth's core is about to stop spinning, thereby causing disasters around the world. Dr Josh Keyes realize that there is something very wrong when a bunch of people with pacemakers suddenly die, and flocks of birds suddenly start dropping out of the sky. Keyes realizes that it has something to do with the earth's magnetic fields. Keyes meets up with another scientist, Dr. Conrad Zmiky, and together they begin to understand what is happening. At the same time, the space shuttle is entering the atmosphere, and on its way to landing, when the crew suddenly see that they are about 100 miles off course, and about to crash in Los Angeses. One of the pilots, (Hillary Swank) makes a daring landing in a drainage channel, and is chosen along with her fellow pilot for a mission to save the earth. Another scientist Braz (Delroy Lindo) has the concept for a craft able to make the journey to the center of the earth. The mission: the crew must deposit several Multi-megaton warheads at the center of the earth, and hope that the resulting explosion will be enough to start the core spinning again. I would have to say that all the actors in this movie gave a powerful performance. Most especially Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci, and Delroy Lindo. Their broad knowledge of physics adds to the intensity of the film, and ultimately has them at each others throats. This is evident when Dr. Zmisky is knocked out after he goes on a rampage. During this mission, another disaster occurs when deadly microwave radiation is allowed to penetrate the atmosphere, causing the Golden Gate Bride to be destroyed. Eventually it is a race against time, as the crew realizes that the nukes they have onboard may not be enough to do the job. Add also another situation brewing on the earth's surface concerning a secret project that the U.S., whereby they have the capability to unleash earthquakes on other countries at will. Luckily, "Rat", a computer geek, is able to stop it in time. The visual effects shown in the movie make it all the more beleivable. I would reccommend this movie to anyone that enjoys Sci fi adventures.</fullReview>

Thank-(enter an acceptable deity here) the liberals were there to bail us out. What a load of tripe. If you enjoyed this movie catch the sequel,"An Inconvenient Truth".

The long &amp; short of it is that the Sun will fry the Earth in a year if some way is not found to start the core spinning again.You know you're in for trouble when first introduced to Hillary Swank's character (an astronaut) during a crash-landing of the Space Shuttle in the Los Angeles aqueduct...sheesh...Recipe for this disaster? Steal 3/4 of the content of Armageddon, mix in a dash of Independence Day, and stir it all together with ridiculous storyline and cheesy special effects; bake for two hours, and sit down to a wholly unsatisfying meal.

		<fullReview>I am biased: I love this movie and have watched it numerous times, but I can see it does have problems. Yes, the science is very shaky, but no more so than any other sci-fi movie.The main difficulty I have is of the casting of DJ Qualls, who is just too freaky to be taken seriously, and Stanley Tucci. The latter is a perfectly good actor, but just did not seem to grasp the part, having the appearance of some walk-on part in an amateur theatrical production set in the 1960s.The effects are mostly excellent, particularly the shuttle landing and the imaginative depiction of the ship travelling through the interior of the earth. I rather enjoyed the 'geoid' sequence too. I studied geology, so know its all a little ludicrous, but also know that there are amazing things down there.The music score is excellent, and visually it is a very glossy product. I recommend listening to the director's commentary on the DVD, one of the best I've come across, and really illuminated the film-making process, and his enthusiasm for his own product is infectious.I can't help it! I just enjoy this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why save a town when you can save the world?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Armageddon all over again. Except this time we have to go to the core of the Earth instead of the core of an asteroid. I am a fan of action adventure movies that involve last ditch self-sacrificing efforts in order to save the day. Now... usually saving the day means saving a life, saving a building, saving a town, maybe even saving an entire country, but rarely ever does it mean saving planet Earth. It looks as if the writers and producers want to go beyond the minor mere tasks of saving a few lives, they now have to go to the ultimate level of saving every human life. This was good in science fictions like "Independance Day", or others like that because the foes were aliens and it fit. In "The Core", the foe is the planet Earth itself. This is a whole new level of stretching the imagination, and I, for one see it as a little too egotistical.A small elite band of scientists and such journey to the core of the earth to set off some well timed explosives to disrupt the cataclysmic activity of the Earth's center. Of course there are the heroic martyrdoms along the way while leaving just the obvious two characters alive. Two characters that should have died as well except for some insignificant statement muttered by one of them days earlier. That one insignificant statement that someone happened to listen to and remember and correlate to saving the last two survivors. *Ahem cliché ahem* All in all the movie was slightly entertaining, but in the end just a planet sized cliché.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fiction than science!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a bad movie, but it's not a great one either, and after I watched it a couple of times it went up in my estimation, and then it went down again! It is a rather different take on the journey-to-the-centre-of-the-Earth type story with some good effects, (although they're all computer generated unfortunately, and would be impossible in reality), with good casting, and a very interesting ship. It peeves me that nowadays they can't make sci-fi movies without using CGI, so that the finished movie lacks any of the charm that the good old sci-fi yarns from the 50's &amp; 60's had. Today's creations just aren't as well made as the old movies, and are not as enjoyable either. The scientific theories in this picture don't have much plausibility, and I wonder about such things as the effects on the planet after the crew accidentally pierces the cobalt shell and lets tons of lava flow in, but that is overlooked, as is the question of radio and computer communication deep within the Earth with all the interference problems which that would present. That side of things would be completely impossible. On the casting side, Hilary Swank is good as the pilot, and she certainly isn't so sexy that she takes your mind off the job, which is a good thing if you're trying to save the planet. Aaron Eckhart and she work very well together, and I really like Dr Brazzleton; he's pretty cool, and his "Unobtainium" is excellent! A chain-smoking Stanley Tucci adds moments of comedy to the ensemble. Technically though, this picture is a half-baked attempt at sci-fi, and to me it's nowhere near the quality of say 'Contact', or 'The Arrival', and it's certainly not as good as the old classic sci-fi's like 'The day the Earth stood still'! Even 1951's 'Unknown world', which has a somewhat similar plot, would give this mess a run for its money. I find the ending a bit impossible, as the crew is stranded on the ocean floor and generates some sound, and the navy just happens to be able to find them and bring them up from 800 feet down. That whole thing is implausible. I give it only 8/10 because of all the stuff in it which would not be possible in real life, and all the scientific mistakes in it, but for some reason it is still an enjoyable piece of entertainment. I just wish they'd got the scientific stuff right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a disaster only in genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSFrom the offset, I admit I tend to love disaster movies. There's something almost surreal about major world monuments being blown up on the big screen. With this in mind, I'd kind of wanted to see "The Core" for a while now. After finally getting a chance, I wasn't disappointed.In "The Core" the Earth is basically ruined. After an experiment destroys the planet's rotation, a group of specialists in different fields are sent, in a specially constructed vehicle, to the centre of the Earth in an attempt to jumpstart the world again.The first thing which really springs out about "The Core" is that there's an almost cult feeling towards this film. Whilst other disaster movies ("Armageddon" for example) make a lot of money at the box office and become almost chick flicks in their romantic subplots, "The Core" seems to keep his credibility as the rollercoaster ride kicks into gear and doesn't give up until the very end. In a known but not really well known list of actors, "The Core" has assembled a group of performers who can be relied upon to play their parts adequately. DJ Qualls in particular, an actor who normally plays the "nerd" of a group, succeeds as Taz 'Rat' Finch, a Computer Genius whom is brought on board to keep all rumours of the situation off the internet.The point to ultimately remember about this movie however is that whilst the cast might do an acceptable job, as with all disaster movies, this one is very much about it's special effects and graphics. In a plot which appears scientific, although truthfully I haven't a clue how accurate the science is, the movie provides the audience with the usual mixture of explosions, destruction and death.Finally, the one thing I really do like about this movie is that it doesn't seem to promote America saving the world again. Whilst in films like "Armageddon" and "Deep Impact", America is the primary area and foreigners are only really there as a people to either be destroyed or to be completely ignored (is anywhere else on the planet actually mentioned in "Deep Impact"?), in "The Core" there is an element of diversity almost. America not only causes the original problem, but on the team who travel to the Earth's centre there is a friendly Frenchman who is best friends with the main star. Added to this the novel idea of having Rome destroyed rather than the traditional European movie targets, and Europe and the rest of the planet has a relatively decent role in this movie. Which is rather good actually.In the end of the day, what we have here is your regular Disaster movie. Unlike others it hardly mentions a relationship at all (it's obvious something is there, but it's not in your face like Tyler &amp; Affleck in "Armageddon"), the rest of the world gets to aid in the efforts, and all in all it's just a good piece of fun. Put your feet up, put the movie on, and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon reviewing the movie, I enjoyed the following elements:(1) Good cast of characters. (2) Special effects were good. (3) Emphasis on scientific explanation of the core problem, good. (4) Would have liked to see the 'Rat'(hacker) with more storyline (5) Fast moving, no explicit scenes of intimacy, no 'dragging'...The following were problem areas:(1) The script should have placed more emphasis on the construction, training and trip itself.(emphasis on inner relationships with the cast aboard the ship would have been nice. (2) The deaths of 2 of the 3 cast (ship) members was unnecessary and disappointing. I believe this was a movie where the 4 should have survived (3) The only death should been the Commander. This would have highlighted the new role of 'Becca' as the new pilot. (4) Becca's first command decision should not have been in regards to the death of the French Weapons Expert. She could have saved him.Her excuse or reasoning for not opening the hatch was weak. Her first (defining moment) decision should have been when she voted 3 to 1 to continue the mission and not return home as ordered by the General. Basically, I felt the movie was very good until the latter half.(when deaths started to occur). The ending could and should have been much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Core: 6/10I couldn't believe this movie bombed at the box office when I was told the other day, because the concept seemed like a sure seller. I mean, the plot is kind of contrived, but it makes for an entertaining "one time" special FX bonanza. Also, if you can get past the plot flaws, the movie doesn't disrespect your intelligence like others of this type do. Also, no lame Hollywood romance plot (despite teases)! I thought the actors were really good, the only downfalls were the script. In particular, Aaron Eckhart and Stanley Tucci were really good in their roles. Everything is a bit predictable, but you won't get bored watching it. Look out for an excellent opening half hour, with some shocking scenes (especially the one involving people with pacemakers, and then the one with pigeons).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good B-grade disaster film... for what that's worth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My advice - go out and see "The Core" for a brainless evening if you like disaster films and / or b-grade films. It meets the criteria for both and generally moves along fast enough that you don't stop stop to think how stupid some of the dialogue and ideas are."The Core" does the right thing by hiring good actors to deliver terrible dialogue. The special effects are passable and there are plenty of unintentionally funny moments (like a room full of people cheering after the announcement of "We've got central flow!").A dumb film that is pretty forgettable, but the ride itself delivers everything you'd expect. Just remember to disengage your brain before watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not exactly and expert in the field of physics and geography, but anyone with some sense can tell that the plot of this film makes no sense. However, if you can forget about that (which, I'll admit, is hard from time to time), it's enjoyable. Nice CGI, not too showy but likeable enough, nice cast... Stanley Tucci was fun as the arrogant scientist, Hilary Swank is always good, but this time my favorite was Aaron Eckhart; to be convincible with this script, is pretty impressive; plus, he managed to win my sympathy for his character. Cool.Just too bad there were so many flaws &amp; predictabilities, but I had a great time anyway. 7,5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I see the same movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit it wasn't as lame many people whine it to be. Ok, first off, this movie was not as terrible as Armageddon. The humor was JUST at the right level and I think there was only one or two corny lines throughout the film. I won't explain the plot because I think you can tell from the title that it's kinda obvious it somehow centers around the core. It has to be restarted. The science was pretty inaccurate I have to admit. The acting (I thought) was great by Eckhart (Keyes), Lindo (Braz) and especially Tucci (Zimsky; just look at his outburst towards the end) This guy is such an underrated actor.And for once a NON American is part of a crew to "save the world" (a Frenchman to be precise). Now, I AM American but live in France. So I was glad that Jon Amiel included the fact that not ONLY the United States has weapons of mass destruction and smart scientists. And for ONCE a computer screen in a movie doesn't display Windows (as was the case in Independence Day in the alien mothership LOL). Nice hacking moves.Whenever people praise a movie and say it's the best, blah, blah, many walk with great expectations and then most kinda lose that feeling of it being the best. And whenever people criticize a movie like this one, I, as one of many, have basically no intentions to like it when I go to see them. And the zero expectations help to enjoy it and realize it wasn't as bad as many people claim it to be. That has happened to me before. SO THIS MOVIE WASN'T PERFECT. WHAT, YOU WANNA EXPLOSIONS, MORE PEOPLE DYING?! SOME PEOPLE ARE SO USED TO PLOTLESS EYE CANDY THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO VALUE A MOVIE ON OTHER ASPECTS. And this comes from that great line by Tucci: "WHAT YOU WANNA BE A HERO?! YOU WANA BE A MARTYR?! WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE?!" Sorry for the shouting but the movie made me want to speak out ;-). Definitely worth getting on DVD.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good comic book action, but turn your brain off first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key to enjoying this film is to expect it to be absurd. It might have been better (and actually turned a profit) had it been a SciFi comedy (on purpose). If Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still going this would be an excellent target. You must not think at all during this movie. It's not just the scientific angles that are so ridiculous. Everything is. Every decision, every event, every behavior... It's also about 30 minutes too long.Regardless, it's a fun movie; the kind of thing good daydreams are made of. Loads of action, interesting visual effects, and did I mention action? Momentum is what holds it all together.I hope dismal ticket sales might help Hollywood get a clue that viewers increasingly want producers, screenplay writers, and directors to turn their brains on rather than expect us to turn ours off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Earth's core is coming to a screeching halt. In three months we'll all be toast, because the things that keep Earth from being the cat in the microwave will be destroyed. Someone has to get down there and give that sucker a goose!This is a fun, Jules Verne-ish, kind of movie, so never mind trying to pin down the technology. It is pulp science fiction, written with humor and heart. Never mind that Dr. Ed 'Braz' Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo)---a genius whose research was stolen by his former colleague, the archly slimy genius and careerist, Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci)--- has retreated to the desert where, with no apparent source of funds, he putters around building what appears to be a massive gattling-laser and develops materials with marvelous qualities found nowhere else on Earth. Never mind that Zimsky's own pet project, Destini, the most powerful weapon of mass destruction ever conceived looks something like a giant sparkplug. Never mind that billions are spent to build the core-boring ship (christened Virgil, after the poet who descended into Hell), a vessel that must withstand unimaginably high temperatures and pressures, and...when it gets stuck among giant crystals down there, the crew can get out in their thin little suits to work it free. Never mind that these top flight scientists and engineers calculate distances in feet and miles.Oh, and perhaps the oddest anomaly-when three of the crew have to choose which of them is to carry out a crucial, and perhaps fatal, task, they draw straws. Yep, three broom straws. You have to have experienced Virgil to appreciate the incongruity. Did the cleaning lady perhaps leave them behind while tidying up the ship?Somewhere in the film critics' restroom, there must be scrawled on the wall: "For a fun time, go see The Core."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS is how disaster movies are done. Bear in mind, that I hated, absolutely HATED Armageddon and ID4 (Independence Day) for their swaggering "me-smart-ape, me-save-world" mentality. This movie has almost none of that. Add a totally respectable cast and you've got a really great action movie. Is it The Godfather? No. Is it The Usual Suspects? No. Is it wrong for the imagination-deprived elitists to expect it to be? Absolutely.What originally kept me from writing this movie off when I saw the trailer was the cast. Aaron Eckhart? Come ON! The guy was in Your Friends &amp; Neighbors and Thursday. He RULES. Hillary Swank; an award winning actor. What the elitists call "slumming", I call "broadening one's horizons". Delroy Lindo; thoroughly underrated and oft-overlooked, he's great as the geeky-cum-cynical genius who builds the ship. Throw in DJ Qualls (Road Trip) as the token new-schooler and keep his screen time to a minimum. Bake at 9000 degress and enjoy!The visual effects are excellent. I almost felt my temperature rise during some of the extended exterior shots in the mantle of the earth. The technical aspects are entirely plausible and require only a minimum of suspension of disbelief. Armageddon and ID4's "Rah Rah USA!" attitude is also thankfully absent. (To clarify, I'm as American as baseball and apple pie. So shut up.)The movie loses points for slightly-sub-par dialogue, a forced "lesson" about what it means to "make the tough decisions", and a strained and completely pointless attempt to develop a relationship between Swank's and Eckhart's characters. These are ALL forgivable offenses, mitigated by the high overall quality of acting talent.I will very likely purchase this movie when it is released on DVD. And just to piss off the elitists, I'm going to put it on the shelf right next to my Kubrick boxed set.8 out of 10. Yeah, that's what I said...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many comments here that say how bad this movie is, that this movie sucks, that the acting blows, etc... Well, what does the audience expect? As movie buffs (that's why we take the time to write a comment here) we know that these kind of movies do not ever get Academy Award nominations for best actor/actress. They are just made to entertain us with amazing special effects and incredible CGI. Some people also comment how unrealistic this movie is. Well of course... it has to be, it is a Sci-Fi movie, just like The Matrix, Star Wars, Starship Troopers, The Fifth Element, The Time Machine, ID4, E.T. and many others! That is what a movie in this genre will transmit to the audience. If you do not like unrealistic "stuff" don't watch The Core or any other Sci-Fi Movie,instead watch a drama or something closer to life itself.Now, The Core is just a plain great adventure. The Plot: Scientists combine intellect to re-activate the core of the earth which stopped spinning. Impossible but very entertainig. The characters are OK, might need more development, but who cares? the movie goes so fast that it is not very noticeable. In general, The Core is a good movie. Something that I liked is that there weren't many one liners or clowns unlike Armaggedon. The Core has its moments, it delivers action, drama, IT-comedy and suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie Roger Corman would have made if he had a huge budget. These kinds of movies are my guilty pleasure; and this one was highly enjoyable. The earth's core has stopped spinning and a rag-tag group of scientists and astronauts set out (or down) to jump start it before the earth above is cooked. It kind of reminded of another B-movie from a bygone era: Unknown World. They journeyed to the center of the earth in what looked like a big corkscrew, but in the 21st century, our heroes have a much more sophisticated laser equipped vehicle with TV's and air conditioning. Very cool transportation for 50 billion bucks!The acting was first rate, although all Alfre Woodward had to do back at Mission Control was look worried, concerned and relieved. The special effects were pretty typical for this kind of picture, but the big crystalline bubble was terrific. The music was also great. But I still don't know about that earth's core spinning thing...can that really happen?? I guess the next time the birds go crazy in Trafalgar Square, we'll know why!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers ahead) When going to see a movie, oft times the audience is asked to 'suspend disbelief'. The Core asks us not only to suspend our disbelief, but to leave it in the car. My mind boggles at the amount of bad science...from a single scientist that invents the amazing laser drill and(!) a totally new material that is impervious to temperature, pressure and converts those elements into energy (but not used for an energy source until...later). A series of PRECISION blasts must be made, and in the end a lump of plutonium is 'duct taped' to the bomb, this will produce a bigger bang?? I seriously doubt it. A hole that allows raw microwave energy appears...not at the poles, where the field is naturally weak, not over the 7/10ths of the earth that is ocean, but right on top of a major city. And these suits! wow! fabric that is capable of zillions of pounds of pressure? and they pop in and out of them so easily! Too bad they didn't have them later, just swim up in your supersuit...(heck, ida never took it off!). The crew! NASA pilots?? why not deep oceanographers? closer to the environment involved. I could go on and on, and who knows maybe a list will be started on the sheer number of bad science events in this steaming heap. One more point..the scene in Rome..&lt;Boom!&gt; the FX department has rubble flying thru people, who then continue to live, and even run..(it was short, but I swear I saw it.) ENOUGH. Wondered why this was put out so early, now I know.</fullReview>

Well I have to say that the story reminded me strongly of that of 'Armageddon': you know the world is in jeopardy and someone has to save it. They put together a bunch of very different personalities that travel into the center of the world to get the core start spinning again. All goes terribly wrong underway, but... :-) Nevertheless I have to say that the characters are played well, there's some good humor in it and the special effects are really great.

		<shortDescription>A fair exercise in bad science, but still a decent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********Spoiler Warning********"The Core" is probably the only movie I know of that's tried to take a stab at tunneling to the earth's center in a semi-plausible manner. A vehicle made from a substance appropriately called "Unobtainium" that magically converts heat and pressure to energy and uses a drilling laser more powerful than the electrical works of a few major cities would be about the best thing to get you there. Beyond that, however, the movie falls apart. Such as:Astronauts will tell you that going outside the earth's magnetic field such as to the moon (or space probes beyond that) doesn't invite killer microwaves and electrical storms. True, we have ultraviolet and cosmic radiation, but those cause damage slowly and subtly, not melting the Golden Gate Bridge.No one has 200 megaton nuclear bombs lying about, the most powerful ever tested was 50, although the design was capable of 100. 1000 Megatons would be unlikely to even make a nudge to the earth's core, and you can't increase the yield by plunking the exposed core of a power reactor next to a hydrogen bomb.The "unobtainium" shell of the ship is awfully thin and I wondered how on earth they welded it; it conducts heat as they need liquid nitrogen to keep them cool, yet you don't see much in the way of pipes or insulation, just a half inch thick wall between them and the lava. Lastly, if it generates power then why wasn't it already used to supplement the ship's power? Just welding some wires on the hull is quite a stretch to turn the power into useable electricity.Landing the space shuttle in an artificial river and then dropping the landing gear to make it skid is a little silly; the multi-ton shuttle would collapse rather messily, and having just gone through re-entry it'd be so hot the water would boil and some things would crack.You think having Rome and LA decimated on top of auroras everywhere and mega-lightning storms would have people getting some idea there was a serious problem, and do you really think the world's greatest hacker would be willingly helping in a massive cover-up?Kind of amazing how you can see for miles through the molten lava/iron of the mantle.The ship seems to move only at one speed and they run into everything they can down there. Maybe the rotor blades depend on having a bit of liquid rock to turn in as the laser tunnels, so if it slows down the rock solidifies and the ship is stuck; still it seems like they're driving a car with a stuck accelerator.We rarely get a feel for the temperatures and pressures they must be in, even inside the giant geode, and despite people being in situations that are so hot their boots melt and eyeglasses crack they just seem to break a sweat and faint. OTOH as I'm not a fan of gore maybe that's not so bad....The plot? Oh yeah, standard action-adventure stuff with all the cliches, such as when the scientist says the ship can break off segments and if they don't they'll lose "structural integrity," you just *know* someone's going to die in a perilous save-the-ship scene.All of it is something we've seen before, although for a cookie cutter retread of the small-group-battling-to-survive it works fairly well. My only real gripe on that part was Hilary Swank is too good an actress to be doing B-grade action-adventure, she ought to put a call in to her agent. Otherwise "The Core" is best left to be seen on cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical disaster movie. Great special effects, poor plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would happen if the Earth's core stopped spinning??? This is the premise behind the latest disaster movie "The Core". In the film, the core stops spinning causing problems with the earth's electromagnetic field resulting in a natural disaster that could eventually destroy all life on earth within a year. The professor who discovers the problem, Josh Keys (Aaron Eckhart) is tapped by the U.S. army to help try and fix the problem. He teams up with the usual gang of brave do-gooders who set off to try and save the world. In typical disaster movie fashion, the team is the worlds only hope of survival. For those who saw either on of the Comet disaster films of 1998 (Armageddon, Deep Impact), this screenplay will look very familiar. Just replace the comet with the earth's core, and a space ship with an earth ship. This film was filled with recycled plot elements with very few original ideas. The only thing that saved this picture was its half decent special effects.</fullReview>

Or Star Trek because aliens dont exist? This is why: The problem people are having with the core is that it is supposed to be present day america, and building a machine like this in present day america is impossible. That is true. Thats why the core is not real science fiction. Star wars was good science fiction because it sets up the premise that you can travel through space and use lightsabers. This makes it unbelievable in this world, but believable in the star wars world. Maybe if the core would have been set in the year 3000 or so, then it would be slightly more believable, and people wouldnt complain as much. Or if people would be willing to get past the fact that its impossible to do now and just enjoy the movie, they wouldnt b**ch so much. PS. Good special effects!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Albeit some of the science seems a bit far fetched, however, looking beyond that this movie delivers a good bit of emotional drama and action that lots of movies seem to lack as of recent. This movie is based on a top secret project that really did operate in Alaska and playing on the fears people had of that, this movie put those fears to screen in a pretty believable fashion. The scene of the space shuttle Endeavour was for me a kind of sad affair since, 1. I live in Florida near the Space Center, so it means a great deal to me and 2. The fact that it wasn't long ago when we lost the Columbia in re-entry- which the shuttle was in the process of. However- it makes a scary, but safe landing, which was one of the most gripping moments of the film. This movie had the sense of action and wonder of like wise movies, 'Journey To The Center of The Earth' and 'Armaggedon'. The movie never gets stale and the story progress at a nice pace, a definate Saturday Night movie to go and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK film, not the best but an enjoyable way to spend an hour or so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sick of the user comments on here taking a film apart and criticising everything. Now this film is perfectly OK, yes its on the same line as armageddon, and the world needs saving again, + there is a bit of a political statement ("Lets use weapons of mass destruction for some good for a change"), but on the whole the effects are good, the ideas are good, (The laser powered drill they are all riding in for starters is a great idea).Now I enjoyed the film, and thats what a film is meant to be is enjoyable, yes it doesent take a lot of thought to watch this movie, however sometimes you want to relax and enjoy a film rather than take it apart and analyse every part of it.This movie is on par with armageddon, and many people enjoyed that too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A likable film that actually had me cracking up more than shivering with fear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has always had an infatuation with films that deal with natural disasters. However, the portrayal of such disasters is usually far over-blown for the sake of dramatic effect. But these films can't be taken seriously, as their purpose is nothing more than to give their audience an exciting, wild ride. This was the case in `The Core,' the new film from director Jon Amiel whose last film was 1999s `Entrapment,' which starred Sean Connery and Catherin Zeta-Jones. At first glance, `The Core' appears to be a science fiction/disaster flick about the end of the world. However, after analyzing the film, it's safe to say that this film is about 25% science fiction, and about 75% absurdity. But don't let that stop you from seeing it. Despite its silly story, `The Core' is a likable film that actually had me cracking up more than shivering with fear.The film opens with various minor catastrophes occurring worldwide, from 32 sudden deaths in a major American city to flocks of birds flying into crowds of people and buildings (an apparent rip-off of Hitchcock's, `The Birds'). Scientists are brought in to examine these occurances and they hypothesize that the core of the earth has stopped spinning. They now need to find a way to get the core rotating once again in order to stop the cataclismic events from taking place. With the help of world's best scientists, they create a ship, properly titled as `Virgil,' designed to travel to the center of the earth, dump off a nuclear payload of about four bombs, and then as Aaron Eckhart's character, Josh says, `then we outrun the biggest shock wave in history.' `The Core' has some great talent. Eckhart (`Erin Brockovich') and Tcheky Karyo (`The Patriot') portray professors brought on to study the devastation of the super storms and strange deaths that are happening. Stanley Tucci (`Road To Perdition') plays a famed scientist with a severe ego problem. Hilary Swank, the Oscar winning actress of `Boys Don't Cry' plays a NASA astronaut sent to maneuver the ship through the earth's interior, along with Bruce Greenwood of `Double Jeopardy.' Richard Jenkins, who has appeared in several Farrelly brother's films including `There's Something About Mary,' and `Me, Myself, and Irene' appears as a general in charge of the mission.Perhaps the film's most humorous points transpire when DJ Qualls (`The New Guy') enters the film has a hacker recruited to keep the media out of the public's eye by hacking the Internet and rooting out those who know of this secret mission to save the planet. If word of the events did get out, naturally as in any disaster flick, the fear of rioting and social unrest could take place. `The Core' is filled with clichés. It's easy to sit there and point out scenes that have taken place in other films, especially `Deep Impact,' and `Armageddon.' However, I found it to be forgivable. I liked `The Core' and found it to be fun escapism, not to be taken to heart. Disaster films have always been ridiculous, especially the greatest disaster schlock film of all, `Earthquake,' which starred Charlton Heston and George Kennedy. In recent years though, the idea of Earth's destruction from a force that mankind has no hold over has grabbed both the film industry and the public's attention, most notably with `Armageddon.' Quite frankly, I don't see why so many people loved `Armageddon' what with its stupidity, exaggerated direction from Michael Bay (`Pearl Harbor') and its dumbfounded performances from Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis. `Deep Impact' was a far superior film that was a box-office success in its time, but wasn't remembered because of mass appeal of `Armageddon.' Nonetheless, `The Core' is a decent flick that the average person can check his or her brain at the door of the theater with and veg-out to. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always loved the science fiction/action genre. This is a great movie for anyone who is interested in the concerned field. I'd probably say that most of the movie (which takes place beneath the Earth's surface... gee what a surprise) is theoretical.About the plot. Something threatens to destroy the planet so we retaliate and try to stop it, or in this case, fix it. I thought the way the film makers displayed the catastrophic events was well done. I do have the say the plot brings back memories of Armageddon, only instead of in space, it's just the opposite.This is the first movie with a plot as in depth as this to come along in a while and I think they did a great job with it. I give it an 8 out of ten.</fullReview>

The idea that the world is going to end is quite common, but instead of going out into outer space, they go into the earth, so it's different!At the heart of this film is a tiny little love story. Eckhart and Swank are very strong in this film and subplot. I would like to see more of their characters and story! Tucci and Qualls are the comedy in this film and I enjoy a dash of comedy with my action-adventure films. For me, this movie can stand up to repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Core is a good solid movie as far as a movie being in the disaster movie genre goes. It's not going to insult your intelligence like Armageddon did and the science holds up in the movie more so then The Day After Tomorrow did. The science may not have been totally true in The Core or as far as what you could do in real life as far as being able to drill to the center of the earth. But as far as the way they presented everything it was at the very least plausible that they could do it.And while they had a bit of a hook up between Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank it was very subtle and didn't happen till the end of the movie. Overall a very good cast to go with the movie too with Eckhart, Swank, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, Richard Jenkins, DJ Qualls and Bruce Greenwood.It's not a movie that's going to win a Best Picture by any means but at the same time it isn't a movie that's going to be nominated for a Razzie either, like most of Michael Bay's filmography has been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resurrected the Fun in Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In simple and boring words "The Core" is another movie like "Armageddon" and "Independence Day" where our planet is going to be destroyed and a bunch of people is called to save the Earth. In more complex and interesting words "The Core" is a very highly entertaining movie where you're going to be taken to a different place where Hollywood almost haven't appeared before: to the center of Earth.Strange and bizarre happenings are starting to damage our planet (birds shocking against statues, people fainting in the middle of business meeting or in the middle of the street, burning bridges). This happens all across the world. An American General (Richard Jenkins from "The Visitor" and "Burn After Reading") convene a fantastic team of experts to see what's going on, if it is a terrorist attack or something similar. This team discovered that Earth's core has stopped for unknown reasons and what they need to do is the enter in the core and make it run again. Another group joins the first group and they start to develop a subterranean machine (something like a space shuttle) that can cross the depth of Earth.The crew is formed by scientists (played by Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, Tcheky Karyo) and two astronauts (Hilary Swank and Bruce Greenwood). They count with the help of a hacker (DJ Qualls) and a commander of the Space Program (Alfre Woodard). Like any movies of the genre they have their differences, something funny always happens when they are summoned but they stay together until the end of the mission. And of course the tragic happenings."The Core" is filled with many scientific references (I don't know if they are accurate). In many films these references are boring and dominates the story. This isn't the case here. Aaron Eckhart's character made many of the scientific things looks simple here, showing examples (the apple scene representing the Earth). Everything was made to be fun, to entertain and it's very easy to follow what happens. The story is pure cliché, the visual effects sometimes works sometimes not, the cast is fantastic (Tucci and Karyo were the most funniest, in a good way), a real good work from Jon Amiel ("Sommersby"). I was really impressed by the quality of "The Core". It really made get stuck in my seat, enjoy everything and resurrected the fun in me on watching a disaster movie after watching many movies that didn't work quite well to me like "The Happening". Don't be too harsh with "The Core", don't take it too seriously and you'll like it as much as I did. 10/10</fullReview>

You also have Aaron Eckhart doing a workman like job. Zimski who is played by Stanley Tucci is a great character. There is a computer geek in the movie that is developed in an very interesting character. Have watched it since on TV, if you like science fiction you will definitely like this film. As you can see there is lots of characters that were fairly well developed. The special effects are excellent also. The shuttle scene, core scenes, and birds are especially effective. there are also twists and unpredictable happenings. All in all an enjoyable action film with a great cast and a lot of character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prequel to the equally hilarious "Sunshine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so glad I finally had the chance to see the movie that is supposedly like "Sunshine" and that was mentioned sardonically in all the rightful thrashings it received.Wow, this has so much stuff to laugh at. It's a fantastic comedy. Those twirling pigeons on Trafalgar Square alone were a riot! High precision was involved in those pigeons aiming for all the available windows. Wave after wave of aimlessly attacking (...) birds. Notice how all the cars and buses were going at full speed just so they could spectacularly crash in flames. Exploding things, crying kids, this scene has it all. The pigeon intermezzo was almost as funny as Mel Brooks' spoof of Hitchcocks Birds in his own "High Anxiety".That "rocket train" shooting through the ocean, through the Earth's crust and heck even to the Earth's core is phantasmagorically incredulous. It takes guts to come up with stuff like this (or lack of coherent thinking). My personal favourites were all the lighting down there which makes everything so beautifully visible (phew - we'd have a dark movie otherwise) and those mountain-sized diamonds...Awww...and those whales escorting the ship and finally saving everybody...too sweet.I loved the coincidence that this American ship just happened to shoot out of bottom of the Ocean next to Hawaii. So close to home. And yeah, who knew it, right next to some red-white-and-blue aircraft carriers.Of all the crew I'd like to especially mention Hillary Swank - she surely picks her roles. What can I say - her face is 50% teeth. The woman is so un-human-like, she looks like a robot. Plus: does she have an iris? Her eyes are all black it seems - like a cartoon figure. Just huge pupils - like a newborn bird with a big mouth and huge eyes, screaming to be fed. Just would like to mention that.The exclamation point of the movie of course was this final preposterous hacker's attack: I love it when brain-free entertainment tries to be clever and P.C. as well.</fullReview>

Now that goes counter to all theories of the earth's composition and you have to wonder, if they got that wrong, how can they trust any of their theories?Oh well - there is a fair amount of excitement in the film and hillary swank is very attractive as the co-captain of the earth-boring ship.

		<fullReview>I love silly 1950s grade-b sci-fi. Two of my favorites are Monolith Monsters and This Island Earth -- movies that are so bad that they're great fun to watch. The Core fits right into the genre. The cast obviously had lots of fun making it (as director Amiel points out in the DVD commentary, they substituted a trout for a pigeon in one of the sequences.... just for the halibut, I guess). One of the fun parts is that no one takes themselves seriously, the actors all give earnest yet tongue-in-cheek performances, and they a play a super-stupid scientific (?!) idea with absolute deadpan. The core idea is a silly as the Van Allen belt "catching fire" in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, but the movie's a lot more fun. Great way to waste a couple of hours.</fullReview>

The only smart thing on which producers remembered is that the atomic bomb is activated with usual bomb that needs air. I think that this is the only realistic thing.

I'm not any type of scientist, but 150 degrees F is too hot for me. Yet somehow his light, facial glass and everything on him doesn't burn except an iron rod that almost disintegrates when he gets in the tunnel.Too many other flaws to mention and not worth watching again to remember them all.Save your time and don't even bother with this movie.Terrible acting, terrible dialog and completely a waste of time.</fullReview>

And I must say that, despite the absolutely unbelievable plot and effects (just like Armageddon), this movie still manages a fun ride (just like Armageddon) if you can leave your mind out of the viewing process. I watched this movie at 3 am and managed without much trouble to stay awake for the duration of the show, that at least says something for it. The plot is forgettable, so are the characters, but it's a fun ride. Rent it, don't buy it because it's not worth that much.Something else to add, the concept behind the ship is a ripoff of a failed TV series whose name I can no longer remember, I saw the pilot episode once upon a long time ago, the show never made it past the pilot, and followed the jules verne approach more than this movie, but the energy drill was basically the same thing, even down to the testing scene where it makes a hole in a rock, only in the TV series they blew away most of a small hill.The Bottom Line: Worth your time if you have nothing better to do whatsoever, there are much worse time-killer movies out there, this one will use up time, not waste it completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Journey To The Center Of The Earth was never like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you cross two classic science fiction movies? The question's no joke. What do you get when cross The Day The Earth Stood Still, (1951), with A Journey To The Center Of The Earth, (1959)? Answer: The Core. A Journey To The Center Of The Earth was never like this. In that 1959 classic, James Mason led a group of explorers into the center of the Earth. The popular theory back in the 1800s was one in which Earth was hollow. Now for the other comparison. In 1951's The Day The Earth Stood Still, Michael Rennie was an alien from a peaceful planet, who'd come to Earth to warn us about our nuclear testing. Since this was during the darkest hours of the Cold War, the Army freaked out and shot him. Killing him temporarily. He was revived by his robot. Makes you wonder where Andromeda got the idea to revive Trance after she was "killed." Doesn't it? Back on point. To prove he's an alien, and convince the people of Earth to give up war, he makes Earth stand still for a day. What does this have to do with The Core? You ask? EVERYTHING! The movie begins with Earth standing still. People die unexpectedly, birds die unexpectedly, the space shuttle is forced to crash land in the Los Angeles River. Coincidently, this movie came out the same week as the Columbia explosion. The same thing happened in 1986 with the movie Space Camp. Hilary Swank is the pilot of the Endeavor which is in orbit when it happens. When the Endeavor begins its re-entry, it goes wildly off course. She has to compensate, or in this case, overcompensate, for it. She's brought before a review board and grounded. At the University of Chicago, a professor geophysics is in classroom, teaching his students, when the FBI comes for him. He's brought to Washington where he meets Serge, a French physicist who's an expert in atomic bombs, and an Air Force general. The Air Force general tells them what happened, and about the unexplained deaths. The geophysics professor and his students had modeled the entire planet. There's a scene reminiscent of the 1963 movie The Birds, in which the pigeons of Trafalgar Square attack the London tourists. Armed with his information, he tries to convince TPTB that "The end of the world is nigh!" Nobody, not even the President's science adviser, played by Bruce Greenwood, wants to listen to him. When he finally convinces Bruce Greenwood to listen to him, it's almost too late. They go to see Delroy Lindo, who's invented a high-tech earth borer. Delroy Lindo and Bruce Greenwood have serious issues. Delroy Lindo accuses Bruce Greenwood of stealing his idea for the machine. Bruce Greenwood gives Delroy Lindo a deadline. What is it? You ask? Three months. Says I! It's built in the required amount of time. The ship, christened Virgil, is prepared for launch. Rebecca, (Hilar Swank,) is told by her commander, Bob Iverson, that she doesn't know how to lead because she wants to win. It's only when she has to lose that she'll be a commander. Things start to go awry right from the get-go. Right after Virgil's launch, they meet up with whales, and they're singing to them. Then their speed increases. On the surface, the Air Force general and the capcom, maintain contact. The CapCom, call sign Stick, tells them that they're going too fast and to slow down. Rebecca says that it's too late. They're already committed. When they hit the mantle, and punch through it with their lasers, they're inside an enormous geode. They didn't know that, So what happens? Virgil gets stuck. To continue on their mission to Earth's core, they have to get unstuck and back on their way. Which they do, with the loss of Bob Iverson. They then run into diamonds. As they prepare to arm the bombs and jettison them, a diamond hits the compartment they're in. To prevent a damaged compartment from compromising the integrity of the ship, the damaged compartments were designed to be jettisoned. Serge dies collecting diamonds. The physics professor and the President's scientific adviser are among the survivors. So are Rebecca and the builder of Virgil. Then just as they reach the core, they find it to be bigger than they'd expected and their supply of bombs too limited to do the job. The physics professor has an idea. He proposes that they take the remaining bombs and put them in the undamaged compartments. Unfortunately, someone has to manually jettison the compartments. Virgil's builder volunteers for the suicide mission. The physics professor and the scientific adviser go to the last undamaged compartment with the remaining bombs. The ship lurches and the bomb traps them. It lurches again and frees the physics professor. The Air Force general had ordered them home because he wanted to use DESTINY to restart the core. He was overruled. As the last compartment's jettisoned, the physics professor and Rebecca are the only ones left. Rat, the computer hacker, had hacked into DESTINY and shut it down. Before Earth's rotation's restarted, microwaves destroy both the Coliseum and the Golden Bridge. Meanwhile, Virgil's lying dead at the Earth's core. The physics professor has another bright idea. He asks Rebecca if she has enough power to get them out before the bombs explode. They ride the pressure waves back to the surface. Are they rescued? What's the physics professor's next bright idea? Watch The Core and find out for yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers Ahead!The genre is called Science Fiction for a reason. I've seen a lot of reviews that have degraded this film because 'it's not plausible'. Granted, it may not be plausible to our level of technology now, but that's why it's FICTION. Is it scientifically plausible? I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I found the concepts to be quite intriguing, personally, whether or not they are plausible.Is Star Trek plausible? Some would say yes, others would say no. Why is it that a large majority of Science Fiction fans seem to think that movies or concepts that are set in space are far more plausible than a concept that sends people to the Earth's Core? Is it just the pressure and the heat? Well, the movie gave an answer for their mission. Again, granted, it's not something that many would believe, but is it a realistic scenario for the movie? Yes. Does it fit in the science of the movie? Yes.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because of the storyline and how it played out. The characters were brilliant and well portrayed. I took a chance on the movie and bought it on DVD. I'm glad I did. I just wish others wouldn't take the movie so seriously and would just sit back, relax, and look at the facts that the movie gives rather than the facts that our current scientific level gives us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart movie about smart people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very apprehensive about renting this movie after so many mindless apocalyptic special effects movies in recent years. Most are all effects and brawn; no characters or brainpower. The Core has it all. It's based on a lot of real science. It has good character development and you actually care about the people. It is about smart people solving problems. It has a lot of great tongue-in-cheek humor too. On the extra features, they said they were trying to make a 1957-style SciFi flick and they succeeded pretty well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb SF "B-movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term B-movie is not a criticism. Some of the classic SciFi movies of the 50s can only be described as B-movies, including some of my favorites, like The Thing (from Another World), Them and Forbidden Planet. The Core is an exciting story, with good actors playing interesting, non-heroic characters thrown in a heroic situation and acquitting themselves well.I almost missed this one because of negative reviews. I don't know what such reviewers expect of a SciFi film. I've seen complaints that the premise is far-fetched and the technology impossible -- this last while comparing the movie to Armageddon! Please! If you are to enjoy science fiction films at all, you have to choke down one or two unknown technologies on faith. Is the nuclear-powered Core-driller any harder to believe in than the Stargate? Than the notion that aliens allergic to water would invade the only planet in the stellar neighborhood that is covered with the stuff (Signs)? That computers can take over the world, but are dependent on human bodies as a power source (The Matrix)? That you can defeat an seemingly invincible alien race by uploading a computer virus into a single ship (Independence Day)? Why then is it so inconceivable that you could set off nuclear explosives in the Earth's core to counteract a catastrophic failure of the Earth's electro-magnetic field? Science fiction movies are not required to mimic real science. They ARE required to stick to their own rules about what is possible an what is not, and here The Core plays fair. The film establishes its rules early on, and given the premise and the characters, I found every outcome reasonable.Is the moral center of the story a bit cliched? Yes. Is the ending pure Hollywood confection? Also yes. But more importantly, I was intrigued by the story's central problem, became invested in a cast of characters I liked and enjoyed cheering for, and left the theater feeling that the human race could probably tackle a real challenge like the one depicted. And that is what science fiction movies are (traditionally) all about -- optimism in the future of the race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best disaster film of all time, one of the best films of 2003, and one of the most fun films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mother of all disaster movies has arrived. Look no further than The Core. It sets the example for what a disaster movie should be. Character development, some smart dialogue, great actors and intense action sequences with truly awesome visual effects make this on top of all the rest. I was surprised at the amount of character development in this film(not like an art house film[blech!], but unstandard in the world of disaster movies). The writers, director and actors all worked well to bring life into the characters and have you care about them, instead of just waiting around hoping one of them will die. Smart dialogue is also present in this movie. Comebacks, one-liners, solutions, equations and numerous other speech uttered comes through clear and well done. It also helps that since the movie is serious(which it truly is...more believable than some non-disaster movies), it plays it fun(definitely). Aaron Eckhart...what can I say? Truly a great actor along with everyone else in this movie. Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, DJ Qualls, and Tcheky Karyo all bring their characters life into our eyes before us on the screen, and all so believable.But the main thing about this movie is: THE VISUAL EFFECTS. These effects are extremely well done. I give my highest regards to everyone involved in creating and bringing to the screen some of the best visual effects to be seen yet. The scenes inside the Earth are definitely of note, as it feels as if we are actually there. Above ground...the effects are astounding as well. A sequence in Rome featuring thousands of lightning bolts destroying everything, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge being decimated, The United States Shuttle making a crash landing and other effects so numerous, but so well done, that we should give the Academy Award to the makers of this film NOW.Definitely see this movie. I would pay full price to see it, and I've seen it twice so far this year. Truly one of the best movies of 2003, one of my favorite movies of all time, and the best disaster movie of all time. Worth the money I've spent, and I hope to see it again before it leaves theaters. This is a DVD I will absolutely must have when it comes out.MPAA Rating: PG-13(Sci-fi life/death sequences and brief strong language)Final Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am proud of the work we did on this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really feel that Jon Amiel did an amazing job with this film. It takes an extremely talented individual to combine performance and visual effects together. His ideas with regards to casting were brilliant and his story development allowed us to meet each character on their own terms. When tragedy strikes in the story I think we can genuinely sense a characters lose because we are allowed to know the person(s). The tragic irony of the recent shuttle accident and the opening scene in the movie does not go unnoticed. I congratulate Paramount with keeping the scene in the movie. That sequence was so well researched; there is no better visual way to explain a shuttles re-entry. How dangerous it really is and how fragile/vulnerable that spacecraft is in the scale of things. NASA does an amazing job and the men and women who fly those missions are not only very talented they are some of the bravest of the brave. We should watch that sequence knowing that the work they do is done willingly and with the betterment of humanity as their dream. Finally this is a movie and it does entertain. That said people need to learn to not take these stories so seriously. There will always be flaws in any movie you watch. It is really a miracle they ever make it to the theatres. There are so many creative elements that must come together to make a movie. THE CORE had a crew of over three hundred people. I would really love to see one of these critics try to work the hours we as a film crew work in order to put even a minutes worth of film in the can.I will close with, go to see The Core or any other movie for that matter, support our film industry by going to your local theatres. Be entertained, spend the money, and watch it on a big screen. That was the intention of the studio in the first place. These films are shot on film not video and as such they are designed to be projected onto a forty-foot screen for your viewing pleasure. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the worst science fiction film ever produced. The laws of physics have been rewritten to the extent that this can't even be classified as sci-fi, but instead is pure fantasy. The story's basic premise is that the Earth's magnetic core has stopped rotating, and it'll take nuclear bombs to restart it. First of all, the earth's core does rotate slightly faster than the rest of the planet. It takes about 120 years for the liquid portion of the core to make a complete rotation independent of the Earth's 24-hour spin. The magnetic field is produced by convection and circulation of the molten metals. So the basic premise of the film is seriously flawed from the beginning, but that's nothing compared with the liberties the script takes with natural science. Lets go over a few of the worst examples, shall we? If the earth's crust could be penetrated down to the liquid core, it would result in the creation of the world's largest volcano, and the ship would be ejected in the eruption. The ship is shown dodging mountain sized diamonds in the earth's core. I did my homework and discovered the melting point of diamonds is 6,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and the temperatures in the core reach near 10,000 degrees. This leaves a slew of plot holes open. First of all, the ship would have to be much stronger than diamond, which is the hardest known substance. Even if this could be achieved, the transfer of heat would vaporize the crew and the electronic instruments inside the craft, not to mention the atomic weapons. Speaking of nukes, if a 200-megaton bomb were detonated in the core, the shock waves would destroy the ship and the Earth would be decimated by catastrophic quakes. Even more absurd, the script has the craft travel the circumference of the core (minimum 4,700 miles) within a matter of hours, releasing and detonating several nukes. In order to enhance an atomic blast, a crewmember removes the atomic power source for the ship, which leaves them without the magic ray to bore through solid rock, but they are able to return to the surface anyway. Exposure to the radioactive fuel rods would have killed him and they could not have simply been added to an existing warhead. Here are just a few more ludicrous plot elements. An x-ray machine powerful enough to penetrate three feet of lead is operating continuously in the same room with two scientists, who would be killed instantly by the amount of radiation produced. The interior of the earth is not transparent as it is depicted, nor would there be a light source to see by. The crew has radio communications with the surface, which is impossible. The Golden Gate Bridge is destroyed by solar radiation, but the cars falling from the bridge are undamaged. Lightning causes the Coliseum in Rome to explode. The later two locations were used in Ray Harryhausen's films, and I'm almost willing to give them a nod for an inside joke. An early scene in `The Core', is an obvious homage to Hitchcock's `The Birds', and is very well done. The introduction of characters and the investigation into bizarre events is far more interesting than the actual mission. There's a three-month deadline to launch a manned craft to the core, and leap 300 years ahead in science. It starts out with a crash landing of a space shuttle in present day, but we've got particle beams that can melt through mountains in seconds. In one of the rare moments of deliberate humor, it's announced the indestructible ship is to be built from a substance called `unobtainium.' More humor would've helped, but it's all played rather straight and grim. It takes itself far too seriously, considering the ridiculous premise. Like many movies, the build-up is greater than the pay-off, and in this case it was like waiting to see people flap their arms and fly away. After you've seen it, you still don't believe it.</fullReview>

It doesn't even make decent entertainment for the moment, you really just sit there and wonder when this disaster of a movie is going to end. It's the exact same film as Armageddon in every possible way. The only difference is that this time they go in to the core of the earth instead of out in space. They even manage to make the character-descriptions so shallow i wished the "good-guys" would die just to get rid of their über-predictable and unskilled performance. The fact that this movie is released on theaters instead of going straight to video is nothing less than humiliating. I warn you, this movie might not be worse than "Pups" but it sure is worse than "The Mangler 2" which scored 1,5 points here on IMDB.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has got to be one of the best disaster type science fiction films I've seen in awhile. I saw the trailer not too long ago, and should check this out, and I was amazed, I was not let down at all. The film stars Aaron Eckhart, Delroy Lindo, Hilary Swank, DJ Qualls. Stanley Tucci, Bruce Greenwood, etc. I will go over the plot.It's about these group of scientists learning about the earth's center core led by Aaron Eckhart (from The Dark Knight as Harvey Dent/Two-Face.) They soon realize that the earth's core has suddenly stopped rotating, and then Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby, Freedom Writers) starts investigating the mysterious change. They built this massive, narrow underground machine to reactivate the core back up and running, otherwise, it's the end of mankind.Even though this is a science fiction movie, there are a few disaster elements that happen in the movie, like the city of Rome, Italy gets destroyed by a lightning storm, intense heat melts the Golden Gate Bridge, and birds go crazy in Trafalgar Square, London.I don't want to get into more detail on this movie, but I thought it was one of the "best science fiction films ever created", it was intense, suspenseful, and awesome. Ignore these critics, they don't know what their talking about, this movie is a must see!!!!I give the "The Core" 10/10</fullReview>

The film's release date was 28 March 2003, and one of the early action sequences involved the dangerous landing of a NASA Space Shuttle. I think it matches the kind of fun excitement one finds in an Indiana Jones film. Sadly though just a month earlier (February 2003) the Shuttle Columbia was lost upon its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. I can only assume that Paramount Pictures pulled back from its publicity efforts. Timing, as they say, is everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthropocentric Spin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to hurt this movie. Like it hurt me.But first, I need to hurt the puerile-minded fans of this schlock: Any ratiocinating fools who entreat those of us with a modicum of intelligence to "sit back, relax and enjoy this entertainment" do not realize that we who rail against bogus "science" in movies of this ilk, do so NOT because of bogus science per se, but because of the INCONSISTENT bogus science. We may not boast Geophysics degrees, nor do we aspire to atom-splitting scientific accuracy ? we just want CONSISTENCY! Example 1: If your movie maintains that pigeons use the earth's electromagnetic field for "long-distance navigation", why show pigeons disoriented whilst tooling around the few hundred feet of Trafalgar Square? Example 2: If your movie cites Real Science to explain the impossibility of generating enough energy to start the planet's core re-spinning, why not establish that it takes that same impossible amount of energy to STOP the core in the first place? More on this later.This movie has less "science" in it than Star Wars ? and Star Wars has NO science in it.Furthermore, note that "implausible" = fiction; "impossible" = fantasy. A laser disintegrating rock to nothingness: implausible. Humans sustaining diamond-crushing pressure in the earth's mantle - no matter WHAT they're wearing, let alone wafer-thin spacesuits: impossible. Throughout the film, Impossibility outweighing Implausibility means this is Science FANTASY, not Science "Fiction", so cease associating it with a once-legitimate term. When physics knowledge was at a groundling stage, scientifically-inept tales like "Journey to the Center of the Earth" were acceptable, but these days, even the common rabble are well-versed in general physics, so it is INEXCUSABLE that knowledge be so denigrated, ignored and subjugated to the inadequacies of feeble-minded technicians with big budgets, who promulgate ANTI-knowledge with their idiotic product? Movie opens with a guy who looks like Peter Gallagher sans Eyebrows dropping dead at a board meeting ? so begins a series of events that establish that the earth's core has inexplicably stopped spinning, causing electromagnetic anomalies. So scientists must drill down and re-start the spin with The Universal Solvent ? nukes.But the spin begins long before they take the plunge? At a militia symposium, geophysicist Aaron Eckhart (your average "biscuit-thrower" college professor: disheveled hair, attire and lifestyle; upon arriving home, throws biscuit to dog which has no name ? Hollywood stereotype created by Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon"), cites Physics 101, yet none of the generals seem to have even a sixth-grade education, as they stare dismayed at his demo of burning a peach with a spray-can, to illustrate ? get this! ? how the Sun would burn the earth were it to lose its electromagnetic covering. The stupidity meter could go no lower at that point. Movies of this ilk are constructed around one or two thrilling sequences upon which the burden of the storyline is draped uncomfortably ? such a scene was the introduction to grotesquely gorgeous Hilary Swank, as her crew emergency-land Shuttle Endeavour in the LA Aqueduct. The movie's pitch was ALL ABOUT sonic-booming over Dodger Stadium and navigating through overpass bridges like technofied T-Birds from Grease. Magnificently-staged, the thrill meter hit climax ? consequently, it was all downhill from there. Stanley Tucci's suavely turtle-necked character is simply to insult Carl Sagan. Ironic that we meet Tucci exiting his Einstein seminars, even whilst this movie flings caca in the face of Einstein's most rigorous theorem (E=mc squared).Tchéky Karyo, as Frenchman Serge, is the only likable character. Of the admittedly talented cast, his performance alone is so poignant that we're truly saddened to see him die. (His end was pre-ordained; he was, after all, French.)Let's play Meet The Stereotype: gorgeously grotesque D.J. Qualls as computer-hacker, Rat. Isn't his "unlikely hero" character one of those rootless, amoral beings who make our modern online lives unbearable with viruses and identity theft and their wholly unnecessary existence? The sooner they are eradicated, rather than pedestalled, the better.There's the Square-Jawed American Pilot (least-known of the principals ? ergo, first to die); Delroy Lindo, Token Black Dude; That Guy from Six Feet Under and Alfre Woodward as the preposterously miscast Flight Director. One keeps expecting F. Murray Abraham in a movie this bad. (The actors did their best, but the blathering catastrophe of the script gave them no quarter.) Lindo constructs their drilling craft with a substance called Unobtainium (stop that laughing in back!), which, he tells us, converts heat and pressure to energy, so the deeper it gets, the stronger it gets?.er, I think the misinformed "scientist" MEANT to say that energy in the form of heat and pressure is converted to MASS by the Unobtainium. (Remember that "E=mc2" thingy?) Was the "science consultant" a G.E.D.? ? and more importantly, may I book some time to slap him uncontrollably?The SCRIPT was made of Unobtainium. The deeper it got, the more energy it expended in keeping us from frying in outrage.In an Act II sequence, where everyone takes turns saying something scientifically illiterate, Tucci reveals that a man-made device, "Destiny", is responsible for the stalled core. I'll say this once: NOTHING MAN-MADE can output the amount of energy needed to stall a PLANET'S core. What part of "NOTHING MAN-MADE" don't the film-makers understand? Arrogant, anthropocentric, bacterial mites! Conceited humans refuse to acknowledge One True Fact: THE PLANET will be fine ? whether or not the core spins at all; *whether or not humans EXIST at all*. You're only "saving" it for your OWN selfish ends? As the two surviving Attractive People are rescued, Rat cries, "The earth is healing itself!" - It was never sick, dimwit! But I think I'M going to be?(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Core: 5/10: Disaster movies always seem to do better when the disaster is local in scope. A city threatened by avalanche, a tower threatened by an inferno, a Poseidon threatened by an adventure, that kind of thing. Earth killer movies are always a harder road. You have your 4 standard horseman of the earth disaster; nuclear war, space invaders, plagues (esp. those that create zombies), and meteors. Lately earth killing movies have gotten creative and lets face it stupid, global warming (The Day after Tomorrow), President George W Bush (Fahrenheit 911) and now The Core with it's well? I'm still not sure what broke. The core of the earth stopped spinning (not the earth itself mind you) which is causing the electromagnetic field to dissipate. Okay, that sounds serious. So that would cause what exactly? Apparently the movie wasn't all that sure so we get scenes of some the lamest and implausible disasters ever. Lets put two under the scientific microphone shall we.One involves birds going all Hitchcock in London due to their inability to navigate using the magnetic field. Okay that may effect the birds ability to fly south (Oh my god the pigeons they're going east!), but even the Mr. Magoo of the avian world wouldn't start flying into statues and buses.In another all too short montage a lightning storm destroys the Roman Coliseum. I'm not sure what is more unlikely, lighting striking relatively short rock structures, or the granite exploding when it does. Lightning, last time I checked, was attracted to metal. But what would you expect from a movie that puts a giant windshield in a rock-drilling machine (Made with that magic metal Unobtainium). Keep in mind I've only scratched the surface of the silliness. Acting wise Stanley Tucci is a joy, Hillary Swank still kind of looks like a guy, and everyone else is forgettable. The Core is enjoyable in that bad 50's sci-fi kind of way. But they needed more (and more plausible) disasters, and much less well everything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pointless wannabe disaster movie (the only disaster bit shown is about a minute worth of Rome and the Golden Gate bridge getting blown up) with so-so effects. The script tries to anchor itself in some kind of real science, which of course ends up being the same old fantasy as always. It's also fun to identify who's going to make it and who's not. Although, if you've ever seen a film before it's not that hard.Plotwise, it relies on the all too familiar setup: "We have to _____ in order to _____. But that's impossible. Wait, what if we ______? Yeah, that could work!" The core repeats this conversation several times and isn't afraid to go all the distance with it either. Like when they need a means of transportation to drill down to the earth's core, and they just happen to know a guy (alone in the middle of the desert) who happen to have developed a way of drilling and a material (logically called "unobtainium") that's virtually indestructible.The actors are of the well respected (and presumably rather cheap) kind. You can almost see them hacking away at the stupid dialogue and clichéd characters thinking to themselves, "do it for the money, do it for the money...". At best, The Core is cheesy and ridiculous, at worst... well it stinks. [1/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An intelligent person's science fiction movie. Very good. Although the script is bit weak in a few spots (and there are some other minor flaws), this is outweighed by the Excellent Ensemble Cast, Good Direction, Good Editing, Excellent Programmatic Music, and Excellent Special Effects. And Gratefully - No Gratuitous Junk! Overall, the movie is definitely worth seeing. For those interested: While there is debate in the scientific community as to the time and frequency, the earth's magnetic polarity does, in fact, shift periodically. This is proven in the geological record. North becomes south and south becomes north. As to the core being a natural nuclear reactor that could, at any time, suddenly stop working, the only theory here is as to the when. And given that scenario, life on earth would be a whole different supposition. Also, for general edification: In the late 1960's and 70's there was experimentation done on creating and using earthquakes as weapons. (Human arrogance, greed, and stupidity have no limit.) I have not (for a variety of reasons) kept up with the literature, so I don't know the current status of such blundering, though I fear the worst. In any case, it is obvious that someone doesn't want that information proliferated. That goes right along with all the other censorship currently in vogue. As for MAD - Mutually Assured Destruction - that is a mainstay of USA foreign policy. Draw your own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swank Jumpstarts The Planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In between her two Oscar winning roles in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby, Hilary Swank got to save the Earth in The Core. The film is a big budget maximum special effects science fiction disaster thriller which was so common in the Seventies. The only thing it lacked was a bunch old time movie names being put in harm's way of the disaster. Of course between then and now those who might have rated guest star roles have either gone to the great beyond or are in nursing homes.I don't understand the trashing this film has gotten in certain quarters. Hilary Swank is always good even if the films she appears aren't always of the quality of her two Oscar winners. She gets to work with hunky Aaron Eckhardt in saving the planet whose magma core has stopped its own rotation, causing all kinds of strange disasters all over the globe.Swank is the pilot, Eckhardt a scientist and Delroy Lindo the designer of a prototype machine for exploring the inner reaches of the earth and the high temperatures it has. It's getting pressed into service fast so that Swank and the group can deposit nuclear bombs in strategic places and set them off. That's the plan, but there's a lot going both within her crew and up top at the command center where people have some conflicting agendas.I liked the special effect very much and the film keeps the tension going throughout. On the top the efforts of DJ Qualls should be noted as he keeps something nasty from happening with some creative work that his hacker character is capable of. The Core is a very well made science fiction thriller with the attention on the action and at a tense pace that never lets up until the very end. I wouldn't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why All the Negativity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I don't get is why everyone have to be so negative about this film. They are just being too rational and they forget one important thing: this is a mindless sci-fi film that's for fun only. Half of the reviewers on this website have to analyze every single thing that cannot possibly happen. That's just dumb. All that aside, this movie is a great film.The film is a disaster movie so the plot is predictable. Scientists realize that the core of the Earth has stopped spinning. They head to the center of the earth to nuke the core and to get in spinning again.I must commend the acting performances. Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci, and Hilary Swank all turned in very fine performances.I also must commend the special effects. The visual CGI was very effective.Now for a movie genre like this, this movie should have performed better at the box office. But I guess all the negative reviews had something to do with it. I rate this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to judge a movie like this because like many action flicks it aspires to some seriousness in spots. If it did not have Hillary Swank I would just let it go. But there is too much of an attempt to have character development and intercharacter dynamics to just go with the flow.Needless to say that the attempts at real drama fall flat, say as flat as "Space Cowboys," or "Armageggon," which are low spots for this sort of thing.That leaves the normal action metrics. Is the situation interesting: the science, the conspiracies, the notion of brilliance and invention? Are the gizmos cool, cool enough to make us want to sit up and lean into the thing? Are the effects mindblowing? Is the pace rush-inducing, at least at times?For me, the answer is no on all accounts except for one effect: The Golden Gate bridge disintegrates in an insert that seems to have been added late in the game. Some nonsense about the core disrupting the ozone layer in such a way as to produce a travelling laser-like beam of destructive radiation.Anyway, it gives an excuse to insert this bit which looks and feels like it was done by experts that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie.The core of this movie was damaged.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*One of my concerns before seeing this film was whether or not there would be any surprises under the Earth. As far as my limited understanding of the Earth goes, there's just rock and magma under the ground. So what could they whip out to make "The Core" cool? There were a few cool spots but "The Core" needed to take out an emergency movie loan from the bank to pump up their F/X.So the usual gaggle of eggheads and military people hop aboard the U.S.S. Penis and proceed to penetrate the Earth's Crust in order to reach "The C-spot". Once there, they will eject their cargo in hopes of stimulating the Earth and making it come to life. "The Core" probably sounded pretty awesome on paper. "It's like "Armageddon" except we dive into the Earth instead of outer space. Instead of asteroids, there are rocks! Underground!" The script called for a lot of chaos and destruction. It sounded good. But the piggy bank was empty. There were a lot of effects but they weren't that special. I should have been more astonished at seeing multiple nuclear explosions underground. I wasn't. The Earth's core looked like the inside of a lava lamp."The Core" wasn't too bad. I had an OK time. It just felt like a summer movie wannabe. Somebody should have given this bad boy a cash infusion. There should be low interest loans at the bank for just such emergencies.

		<fullReview>This film is quite amazingly bad. So bad that it's thoroughly entertaining.The special effects are OK, sometimes they are quite good and they are always sufficient for the film's needs. The actors are generally capable but their performances are wooden. Is it the script? Is it the direction? I think it's both. The basic plot line is pure 1960s 'B' movie but whoever turned that into a script must have been on a deadline. Maybe the director realised that there wasn't much he could do to rescue it so just moved as quickly as possible from set piece to set piece.Best actor: Stanley Tucci's hairpiece.Best game: Guess which character dies next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Core is a really boring and bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Core is such a bore to sit through and it doesn't really make a lot of sense either. For reasons unknown, the earth's inner core has stopped rotating, causing the planet's electromagnetic field to rapidly deteriorate. Instantly, life around the globe begins to change dramatically. Scrambling to resolve the crisis, government and military officials call upon geophysicist Dr. Josh Keyes and a team of the world's most gifted scientists to travel into the earth's core in a subterranean craft piloted by Rebecca "Beck" Childs and Commander Robert Iverson. Their mission: detonate a nuclear device that will reactivate the core and save the world from sure destruction. The plot sounds exciting and this could have been a good disaster type flick Unfortunately it wasn't as this film was pretty boring. I know this isn't a film your supposed to take seriously. Your just supposed to sit back and relax. I did try doing that and it still wasn't very enjoyable for me. The film starts off nice but by the middle it starts getting too stupid even by my low standards. The cast is talented, too bad they don't show it in this film. Hilary Swank is a great actress yet she couldn't even save this film. DJ Qualls, Stanley Tucci, Bruce Greenwood and Glenn Morshower are all good actors yet they all together could not save The Core. The worst actor in the film is Aaron Eckhart and I find it odd that he gets work in Hollywood. Jon Amiel directs and he does a poor job of doing so. The only thing this film had that was above average was the special effects. Everything else about this film was pretty bad. The acting was bad and the dialog was pretty lame as well. The direction was bad and there was very little character development. Some of these things don't really matter in this type of film but it becomes more noticeable when you don't find the movie entertaining. The science isn't realistic though that's a given. The Core runs for a very long 135 minutes and it feels longer then that. Sometimes the film is unintentionally funny and that's always a bad sign. Some of the destruction scenes were okay but they were no where as good as The Day After Tomorrow and other disaster films. In the end, The Core is a pretty bad film and it fails to entertain. Rating 3.4/10, worth skipping as there are better films out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The magnetic field of Earth stopped from working! This horrible scenario faces us in this thriller. Okay, it sounds a little awkward, but hey, maybe we get a well-enough crafted explanation to make it feel believable for the sake of entertainment. Alas, we don't. This movie was a huge waste of money. The writing is so horrible, i was cursing myself for not having any beer left to ease the pain. The characters were obnoxiously superficial and cliché-loaded, i could perfectly understand the actors to not be interested in bringing their characters to life.But nothing can beat these ridiculous ideas! Stupid actions of the protagonists take turns with the movie presenting hilarious effects of mother earth going bonkers (mostly by ignoring all laws of physics). I don't expect everything in a movie to be completely correct, after all it is entertainment, but at least once in a while something should work in theory in the real world! Research...!! Is that really too much to ask?! Oh, and the writer sees Europeans only as making nice victims in movies. At least this time it is not again the Eiffel Tower, that explodes. But again, when Mr. Scientist explains what is going on in the first part of the movie, he makes it really, really easy (not to say primitive) to understand the basic physics behind the idea of the film. And if the target audience doesn't come from Europe, who is this kinder-garden-lecture aimed for then...? But whom am i to assume... At least now i know we live on a peach which will be burned by a flamethrower.In short: Spare yourself or expect major rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern-day version of a 1950s B-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE CORE is a '50s B-movie writ large. It may not be a brilliant film, but it successfully taps the 'anything goes' mentality of a schlocky black-and-white sci fi epic and updates the formula to modern times. In essence the movie itself is about a crew drilling down into the core of the earth; if you're looking for more depth (hah) than that, then look elsewhere. However, the decision was then made to add some familiar 'disaster' scenes to the mix, thus increasing the running time to over two hours in the process and making this movie way too long. With half an hour cut out, the tension and story would have been tighter and it wouldn't have that bloated Hollywood blockbuster feel to it.Of course, the 1959 epic JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH with James Mason is THE drilling-into-the-Earth movie and THE CORE doesn't come close. Ironically, the special effects are worse than in that film; despite replacing tacky dinosaurs with CGI effects of molten rock and running lava, all of the 'outside' scenes of the craft heading underground are poor-looking in the extreme. However, I did like the 'global disaster' set pieces which are thrown in to keep the film exciting. Highlights include: falling pigeons in Trafalgar Square; super-storms in Rome; people dropping down dead in a US city and my favourite moment, when a hole in the Earth's atmosphere sends down a heat ray that melts the Golden Gate bridge ? a wonderful and surprisingly sadistic moment.Speaking of sadism, THE CORE sets about offing crew members with relish, imaginatively inventing the most horrific deaths in existence for these poor saps. One guy is slowly crushed to death; another is blown to pieces; a third literally melts in the lava and a fourth burns alive. It would be pretty disturbing, had the film more realism. I didn't mind the script, which has some authentic-sounding dialogue in places, and you can't fault a movie that name-checks one of my favourite magazines. There's also some good humour, like the 'yes, yes, and the core is made of cheese!' quip that Stanley Tucci's scientist character utters. There's not as much annoying flag-waving as in Armageddon, although the pay-off (using a bomb to save the world) is virtually the same.The casting ain't bad either. Aaron Eckhart (THE DARK NIGHT) excels as the rugged lead; Hilary Swank is the tough-cookie pilot forced to make some drastic decisions. I didn't care for Stanley Tucci's acting, but I did appreciate the presence of Tcheky Karyo (KISS OF THE DRAGON) in a good-guy role for once ? in fact, he's my favourite character in the film.</fullReview>

The interaction between the heroic woman and the chauvinistic men is hokey. The self-centered plagiarist of a scientist is hokey. The heroism of the heroes is even hokey.But I enjoyed it. I think the movie makers knew how hokey it was (they had to) and made it anyway. It was a fun adventure. I loved the male and female lead, and the geek and the Black scientist. The geek's role was dramatized to the last degree, but was fun to watch. I always like it when a geek plays an important role in a film or book. That's as much as I can say without spoilers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Core intrigued me originally, but it ultimately did not live up to my expectations. The cast, I actually quite liked, I liked Hilary Swank, and Eckhart, and Tucci, I thought they all had good chemistry together, and I enjoyed Alfre Woodward's performance too. The effects, as you can tell from the film's poster, run pretty rampant here. They are just fine when they are in the core and the audience is seeing lava and humongous crystals, and the ship flying looks fine too. There were however a few parts where the effects just didn't look all that good, even for 2003. So the effects are like a 70/30, so it leans in the right direction. The issue I take with The Core is that whenever an action packed/effects driven scene isn't going on, there just isn't any good dialogue or engaging characters. The actors really do give it their all, but the source material just is not that good or deep at all. The characters really do seem like cardboard cut outs, not much depth to them, some good cool depth behind the different characters would've been great to see! 6/10 for The Core. Not quite :/</fullReview>

Don't care about them. It has enough scientific 'stuff' to keep me following with interest but I wouldn't know how 'real' it is nor would I care much.

		<fullReview>After reading a few reviews saying "it's not that bad" and wanting to see a few "omg the earth will die please USA do something" movies... I dared to watch this one again. What a terrible idea. I now know why I could barely watch it until the end the first time. This movie is insulting your brain. It's an insult to science, an insult to pure logic at times. The acting is maybe the best thing here, I feel like they still try to do something (not all of them, not all the time), in spite of the awful story and script. Even the music is terrible. Oh yeah, some people will say (as they always do) "hey, it's a movie. What about star wars, they have droids, light sabers, spaceships, etc...". The difference is that star wars is not science fiction, star wars is a space opera. And they could be using technology that we just don't know or don't know yet. The "science" in "The core" is about things that we know. And almost everything is wrong or does not make sense at all. This movie is terrible, terrible to the core.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange things start happening around the Earth; everybody with a heart pacemaker in one area drops dead at the same time, the pigeons in Trafalgar Square start attacking people then the navigation systems for a space shuttle almost cause it to crash; only some quick thinking by the copilot, Major Rebecca Childs, prevent a tragedy. Government agencies summon Dr. Josh Keyes, a geologist to ask if it could be caused by an enemy weapon; he reassures them that it couldn't but further research gives a far more worrying reason? it would appear that the Earth's core has stopped rotating and if it can't be restarted in three months the planet is doomed! He believes this is impossible but a scientist, Dr. Edward Brazzelton, who has been working on a project by himself may have the answer; a craft that can travel through solid rock and molten magma to deliver a nuclear payload to the Earth's inner core! A team of six, which includes Keyes, Childs and Brazzelton, will take the craft, known as Virgil, into the centre of the Earth dealing with an assortment of problems on the way; inevitably not all of them would make it.The problem with most disaster movies it that they take themselves far too seriously? after seeing a shuttle being landed in the LA river I knew that wasn't going to be a problem here. The science on show is so far-fetched it is quite funny? one certainly has to be willing to put your brain in neutral to enjoy this but if you can it is rather fun. Once the more serious effects of the problem become apparent we gets some typical disaster movie scenes; Rome is destroyed in an electrical storm and the Golden Gate Bridge is microwaved to destruction These sort of things may be disaster movie clichés but at least we avoid the worst cliché of the genre? seeing ordinary people as main characters as they try to escape the problem? the only people dwelt on are those solving the problem. The cast do a decent enough job so we care enough about the characters. Overall this may not be a great movie but it is worth watching on TV or picking up if the DVD is in the bargain bin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disastrous disaster film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film the Earth's core stops spinning, which promises to cause chaos and put an end to life on Earth, so they need someone to go to the center of the Earth and bust some bombs to the core resume's spinning. Directed by Jon Amiel, the film has screenplay by Cooper Layne and John Rogers. The cast attended, among others, Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Bruce Greenwood and Stanley Tucci.This short presentation I wrote seems to suggest that this movie was somehow inspired by the Verne's novel "Journey to the Center of the Earth". I don't know if it was indeed but chances are yes, as the central idea of &#x200b;&#x200b;the plot is the journey to the core, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the idea is good and would have given an excellent movie if production had sought best scientific advisers to assist them. Yes, because the biggest problem with this film is the complete and utter lack of logic and plausibility.All right, when a scientific film is done there is always some mistakes but the production seems to think that the audience is totally stupid. In the past, the Earth's magnetic field has undergone changes that never led to mass extinctions, and the idea of &#x200b;&#x200b;"killers holes" in atmosphere, melting bridges thanks to solar radiation, is so absurd that fancy ask the writers if they think that we didn't go to school. There are other situations and stupid ideas in the film, which is an affront to the intelligence of those who perceive science or, at least, attended high school.In addition to these important details concerning credibility, its necessary to say that the cast didn't shine. Most actors complied well with its function but there was any notable interpretation or worthy of some spotlight. Conclusion: "The Core" is a great movie for stupid people, or those who want special effects without bothering with the plot. Everyone else, don't worry, there are always other movies to see.</fullReview>

The issue itself is probably that this was too much to pack into one short movie. The movie has presents some facts in the early stages that gives indication to some quality but it goes terribly wrong when it jumps between being a comedy and drama when presenting new characters and introducing their personalities. It all goes down the drain when they start their journey into the core of the earth. It feels like there has been no real research in what might happen when you drill into the core. Even if the viewer has no clue as to what that might look like there, you just know it's nothing like what you see in the movie. It seriously depreciates the viewer. Bottom line - no good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come on people. Sure the science in "The Core" is absurd and I have better relationships with my two dogs than the on-screen lack of depth in the characters in this movie. But there was another recent movie just as absurd and lacking in character depth. Yet it was a major blockbuster when released. It was "Armageddon" with Bruce Willis.It's all about entertainment and imagination which when nurtured can open amazing opportunities for all of us. Walt Disney built an empire with imagination and they didn't really worry too much about the science of a Ms. Poppins flying around using just an umbrella. Just as the 1960's Star Trek influenced the eventual technology towards flip-cell phones and iPads, imagination is really what we humans do best. Because without it we're back in the middle ages fighting wars over territory in the name of God who really didn't have a lot to do with the selfish personal interests of a few looking for power and conquest at the time.Most think that when humans became self-aware that was the big deal. Well it certainly helped but imagination is how we got to our current level of technology and it will advance us into our future for better or worse. So if you are at M.I.T. or John Hopkins frustrated because you can't finally nail down the solution for cancer then watching "The Core" might be upsetting scientifically. But you are missing the point. It's all about imagination and who knows maybe someone watching this silly movie might spark an idea off the wall that will change humanity forever. Tben again when that happens history tell us it is not usually a good thing! Could be this movie might advance the world or end it! Now that's scarry!</fullReview>

The movie is very plausible all the way up to the very end, but it is at the very end, that it gets unrealistic, but it doesn't spoil the movie, it just soils it ever so slightly. All the characters are cast near perfectly, especially the very arrogant and egotistical book-author "Conrad", played by Stanley Tucci. I really enjoyed the movie and is certainly a great 'disaster' movie similar to Armageddon, except instead of going into space, they go to the center of the earth. 8/10 rating, would have been 9/10 if it wasn't so far fetched at the very end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: The CoreDirected by: Jon Amiel Storyline: We see a guy in an office collapse along with tons more people outside, this whole reason is due to their pacemakers stopping. But I find it a coincidence that so many people have pacemakers in such a smaller area such as a fun fair. Or possibly there are just that many American's with pacemakers, I do not know. Also only older versions of pacemakers are effected by microwaves, modern versions are not. We're then introduced to Dr. Josh Keyes, who is teaching student about sound and how is travels through rock. He is interrupted by two FBI agents who want to talk to him but you don't find out straight away. We're then introduced to Serge who is friends with Dr Keyes, they are talking as they walk into the compound room with all of the bodies the military has collected. They are given some clues to what killed them by the military officer, Dr Keyes (Ok, I'm tired of writing out his formal name), Josh figures out that they all had pacemakers because Serge works in weapons and Josh works in electromagnetism. Josh hears about this and thinks of the worse so he gets his students to map out electromagnetic anomalies and also gives them a free pass go for their doctorate if they do so. Josh takes his notes to a famous scientist called Zimsky. He looks over the notes and realizes that he is right, but first passes his work off as wrong because his own work doesn't match it, but they find the northern light in LA and that is when the world realizes that something isn't right. Josh gets escorted to the pentagon by the FBI guys from before and has to explain along with Zimsky what is going on, so he does so by explaining the EM field and how the Earth's molten iron core works, they also find out that the EM field has stopped, so this is going to expose everyone to the sun's harsh radiation as the EM field normally filters this out.Josh gives details on why they can't get to the core, but Zimsky knows someone who has a machine which can by using laser technology. You will notice that later in the movie they use lasers to get down and dodge all the diamonds, but on the way back up they seemed to have displayed no further hazard. But they start working on plans to build this machine which can drill into the earth it is made of unobtainium and is an impossible feat of engineering. They plan to detonate 5 200 megaton nuclear bombs to get he core spinning again. They do not have enough bombs, just saying. They have to go out to cut the crystal out of the laser port, but they have let lava in which is slowly melting everything while they are trying to work. Serge incorrectly calls it lava, but it is actually magma as it is more thick and gooey. Lava is free running and liquid like whereas magma is thicker and more viscous. They are able to get the bombs in place while mot of the crew die. But the ship is still in the blast zone, but thankfully unobtainium can convert heat into energy so they are able to re-route the power and get out. But they are trapped at the bottom of the ocean, but they are then rescued by the navy as the whale song gives away their position.Acting: Dr Keyes is played by Aaron Eckhart, this man is a good actor and he continues to show that throughout this movie. The others are expendable characters, but they are well fleshed out expendable characters though. You can tell who is going to die and who will live. Noticeable Camera work: To show you the damage that is caused by people with pacemakers crashing the camera is one long panning crane shot, this is nice and creatively used to a good extent. Similar to the dolly shot for inside the office while following the business men. The camera angles for the shuttle landing are simple yet effective in getting the tense point across with their great framing. There are some instances of shaky cam, they don't last very long so I'll give them that. We also get a POV shot when they are trying to do the manual ejection. Graphics: We are thrown into the opening credits from the get go, these are actually not half bad for opening credits with nice CG to accompany it. The CGI of the birds was great, mainly as I couldn't tell it was CGI based on the quality of the pigeons. But sadly the space shuttle and Earth did look CGI, that is until the shuttle gets into the actual earth seen, it looks semi-realistic there. The CGI whales are the same as the CGI pigeons, very nicely done. CGI Magma nicely done too. Overall Feel: The science and engineering is bad, enough said. I have talked about it enough in the story. If you do not know a lot about science then this'll be just another action movie for you and it'll be a damn good action movie at that. everything else in this movie is great apart from the science of the story. Doesn't feel like two hours, mainly because the movie is good with how it paces itself. The CGI is good boarding on visually stunning for the time, mainly due to the artistic design of the core, for the most part that is. Along with the decent acting. The movie is predicable, but fun. As much as I ripped into this movie, I do love it, it is one of the greater disaster movies around even if is goes to the comic school of science.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than "Armageddon"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters are a bit arrogant and the USA is "of course" the only country, who can save the world. This movie could be more interesting or have a better atmosphere, which I think is quite important for a space movie. The science isn't so important for me since it's still a science- FICTION-movie, but this doesn't mean the producers can do whatever they want (like in "The Core")! I unfortunately miss a (deep) meaning to this movie.I don't know why people think "Armageddon" would be better. Has it more "cool" scenes? Because unlike it, "The Core" has more serious characters, some mysterious scenes and even a more interesting travel. Why should "Armageddon" deserve some Oscar-nominations and "The Core" not even a simple nomination?6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good stars in bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film three stars because the actors in it are great, and they do a good job here with what they have to work with. The PLOT however, and premise, are idiotic. I am no scientist, so I won't go into what others have written about that, but, it is about as hokey as a movie gets.And, on a side note, as a woman this bothers me -- they show a close up of Hillary Swank's legs, which are gorgeous, and then they pan up to show her in her military uniform. They don't do that to the guys and it ticks me off that a military woman (I am former military) is so objectified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about many impossible things. Things like building a bullet train to Hell. Hacking the internet with a virus or whistling in a cell phone with a gum wrapper to give you unlimited minutes. Successfully landing the space shuttle in a LA reservoir qualifies your team to pilot the bullet train to Hell. It should have been named "Mission Impossible" but that was taken.The story really is least of this movie bad points. The acting degrades as the story progresses. Bad sciences, poor acting, lousy character development, makes the movie stink on many levels. I will be kind and generous giving the movie a 4 out of 10. At least it wasn't shot in someone's garage with a shaky cam. Moral of the story... nothing can stop America from saving the day, not even science or the laws of physics!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hot, flowing liquid core of the Earth is slowing down more than a bit. It needs to be fixed or we will lose the EM field that protects us from Solar radiation. Dr. Brazzleton came up with two huge inventions allowing a ship to penetrate the crust and survive to go down to fix the liquid flowing part. Those would be a laser boring tool, and a hull material that becomes stronger with greater pressure. The US recruits Rat to help with information control: they ask him to hack the Internet, which he gleefully attempts with next to unlimitedThe Destiny project led by Dr Zimsky may have been the cause of this. This gets a passing mention early on.There's a great pressure to finish the probe in three months. The overt signs around the world get worse. The Marianas trench is chosen as the insertion point. The probe, which Braz named Virgil, makes a successful entry.It travels in 700 miles, then gets jammed in an unexpected open space in the mantle material. This is a giant geode full of huge crystals. They start the repair, only to find that the geode's shell has been breached. They get the jam cleared, but Bob dies from a red hot shard penetrating his helmet. They rev up and proceed.On day 2, they approach the mantle to core boundary. They encounter huge (multi-ton) diamonds, and one of them breaches the hull. They lose Serge, who sacrifices himself to save the mission (getting the nukes out of the afflicted compartment).As they get further in, they start going much faster (140 mph instead of 60 mph). This means that the nuclear charges they brought are insufficient to fix the problem. At this time the Destiny project (Deep Earth Seismic Trigger Initiative; DEST-INI, Destiny) is revealed a bit. Supposedly the 'other side' made one of these, so we made a better one. The entire problem was caused by our testing of Destiny.The rest of the film is about the team re-designing the original plan with the nukes and getting it done before Destiny is used again to try to fix things. The heroic efforts step up. ----Scores----Cinematography: 10/10 Excellent.Sound: 10/10 No problems.Acting: 10/10 The principal actors were quite good, the supporting actors more than adequate.Screenplay: 6/10 We just don't have this technology, or anything like it: the lasers, the hull, the communications system with the surface, or the ability to circumvent the whole Internet. This film should have been set in 2070 or 2110 or other year when such technology might be possible. So the film becomes a fantasy; that is, certainly contrary to fact. Also, the driver for the plot was Mutually Assured Destruction, which does not quite have the currency one might have seen in 1975. The US government being the culprit has more resonance today, perhaps, after the Snowden disclosures.SFX: 8/10 Still looks good in 2013, which is not bad for a 2003 effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really now, I am no geophysicist, but even I know the Crust, Outer and Inner Mantles revolve around the Core and the Core remains stationary, did the writers not realize that the only reason the Core is solid is because of the great pressure otherwise it would be molten. Waiting for someone to explain why the entire planet has not collapsed into a Blackhole from that much dense material at the center of the planet, is that not the pseudoscience that was being floated about the CERN Super Collider in Switzerland. Now how many more lines do I have to go before I can post my opinions about this annoying movie, yes I gave it a 4, guilty as all those who rave about the nonsense scripts for idiot Abrams version of Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness, I fell for the spectacular Special FX and/CG, of the Core that is, not Star Trek: Into Darkness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Very Best Bad Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Orwell used to write about "good bad books," a "good bad book" is "the kind of book that has no literary pretensions but which remains readable when more serious productions have perished." This is one of the very best bad movies ever. High production values, generally skillful, first-rate, acting. It's an adventure movie about saving the world from a preposterous cataclysm. I'ts as if a really smart teenager had listened to my friends and my playing when were seven or eight and made a movie about it. Not sure why this movie is not held in the same class as Armageddon, except that Aaron Eckhart is no Bruce Willis, and that Armageddon has funnier supporting characters and a better romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can turn your brain off, it's harmless entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The core of the Earth has stopped spinning, and will have to be started back up, by getting a team down to it. That's essentially all you need to know about the story, to know if it's your kind of flick, to know what it's about. The crew(composed of scientists, because who better to brutally violate the laws thereof?) contain the ultrasmart(on a ship of geniuses) astronaut Beck(Swank, possibly the only in the main cast, all kidnapped from some indie picture, who doesn't take this as camp(...to be fair, the film-makers have made the same mistake, this takes itself too seriously)), geophysicist Keyes(Eckhart, clearly having a hoot, given many intentionally bad jokes to tell) and the arrogant Zimsky(Tucci, especially over the top). DJ Qualls, the comic relief(the humor, by the way, is hit and miss), albeit having a role that suits him as an eccentric hacker, does not get that much screen time, sadly. Can they techno-babble their way through the various problems that arise? This has many of the same elements as Armageddon, in fact, there are those that would say it's almost an exact copy... I'd add that this is, y'know, tolerable. We don't have to suffer Bay's offensive stereotypes(admittedly, he hadn't delivered his worst when this came out), this isn't obnoxious or overstimulating, it keeps moving throughout(no long, supposedly, not actually, dramatic sequences that stop its pace dead... in fact, the 121 minutes sans credits, or 129 with, swim along quite nicely, and this is genuinely engaging) and the characters aren't too bad, if they are fairly thin. I doubt I'll remember this for long after my viewing, and it definitely seemed to have fewer(not no) flaws(you get carried away, what can I say) while watching it than thinking back to it, but it's exciting, dumb fun for the duration. The cinematography can be pretty nice, the FX(and we of course get destruction of various landmarks) are quite solid and while the CGI is great, they do not rely purely on it, realizing that mixing in practical(models, etc.) stuff is more convincing. Dialog can get fairly questionable. Christopher Young gives this an evocative score. There is a bit of disturbing content and violence, a little blood and brief strong language in this. The DVD comes with an interesting, informational director's commentary, a 19 minute deconstruction of the visual effects, 14 and a half minutes of good deleted/extended scenes(with the option of hearing Jon Amiel talk about them; it's compelling), and the 11 minute featurette To The Core and Back: The Making of The Core which I will review on its own page here on the site. I recommend this to any fan of enjoyable Hollywood B-movies. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The CoreThe film of my choice is "The Core". The movie is based upon the earth core and the actions that the core had stop spinning which would cause every living thing on earth to die. The theme is courage and protection. Signs in the beginning movie were examples of things to come such as 32 people dropping to their death and pigeons flying into things and dying. The main character in the movie Dr. John Keys (Aaron Eckhart) makes the astonishing discovery of the earth beginning to collapse by the magnetic field. The government in the movie was determined not allow this to happen. Dr. Keys and the government assemble a team of the brightest people in the world drill into the earth to stop the catastrophe from happening and restart the core. The main characters going on this journey were Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), Dr. Serge Levesque (Tcheky Karo), Major Rebecca "Beck" Childs (Hiliary Swank), and Dr. Ed "Braz" Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo). "The main characters build and pilot a vessel capable of drilling in to the center of the earth, where they have a plan to detonate a nuclear device whose shockwave will hopefully jump start the earth's core. Things don't go as well as planned, and our heroes have to race against time to find a solution while the military on the surface plans to use "plan B," a plan that is less likely to fix the core, and will also kill our heroes in the process". (The Core, 2003) This film reminds me also of Armageddon when they also had to land and drill into an asteroid and drop a nuclear bomb so it would shatter into pieces just like what they are trying to do in the core but it is only to start the core back up. Also the ending of both movies, where one person is left behind to save the world because the nuclear bomb does not go as plan in either movie. The lighting and angle in the movie was very well done especially when they were in the deep to the water and the whales were communicating with the ship and also when they gotten close to the inner core to see the giant diamonds. So the movie them of courage and protection of earth ended with them saving every person on earth from the catastrophe of the world demise. Braz saved the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hi-tech hokum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the world being threatened with destruction by errant asteroids, and saved by the self sacrifice of some or all of a motley crew of a specialist vessel engaged on a suicide mission, not once but twice (Armageddon, Deep Impact), it made a nice change for the threat of world destruction to come from within the planet rather than space. Saving the world still requires the self sacrifice of some or all of a motley crew of a specialist vessel engaged on a suicide mission, though.The problem is that the earth's heart has stopped, so to speak, and a kind of mole train which can swim through molten rock moles off down through the crust to apply defibrillation to the core by setting off atom bombs.The science here is, I think, absolute nonsense, but a good cast plays it straight faced, and decent effects help to ensure that there is a degree of panache in the execution of the mission and, indeed, the film.This is big, daft nonsense. It doesn't bear a second's serious consideration but, if approached on its own terms, it is quite good fun.</fullReview>

In one instance you have Aaron Eckart's character crying and whining literally like a 5 year old which pushed me very close to turning off the TV. This is one of those movies where there's a good cast assembled, but the writing and script of the movie is dirt-poor. Some budget has been expended, and it's sad that the dialog and clichés couldn't have been rewritten The concept and disaster is somewhat interesting even if not really believable, I can let bunk explanations slide for being a movie, but when there are cheese lines, especially those by the "scientists" between one another and every other character rollin your eyes becomes the norm.

		<fullReview>The premise of this film is of course fairly familiar and it offers little more in the way of entertainment from it's counterparts. Armageddon, for one is better than this film, and to be honest that's not saying much. This film, like the one just mentioned is humorous at points and also has a fair amount of tension as the crew encounter various obstacles along the way. The acting is fine, but some of the special effects a pretty lame and by the end of the movie the importance of starting the earth's core again takes a back seat to all of the problems that seem to arise along the way. Therefore, the movie begins to lose focus and subsequently I began to lose interest. So to conclude, the plot is highly improbable and it's an altogether unoriginal film but with some interesting dialogue and fairly charming characters it just about holds your interest through to the denouement. 4/10 (2*)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our intrepid heroes were halfway to the centre of Earth when I simply lost interest. I knew that Hilary Swank and Aaron Eckhart would get back home again, I knew they would succeed in their mission, I knew there would be several setbacks along the way, I knew that the rest of the crew would die and I knew that 'the mission would succeed'. I knew that because in Hollywood the mission always succeeds. What, I thought, is the bloody point of watching the rest of this dull film? Well, there wasn't one, but as I knew I would be writing a sort review for IMDb, I felt honour-bound the following night to slip the DVD back into my laptop and see if somehow I was wrong, that I was being just a little too cynical. But I wasn't wrong and I wasn't being too cynical. Anyone who has seen a disaster movie in these past few years will be in for no surprises. This is stock stuff: stock characters, stock scenarios, stock dialogue and stock ending. This is film-making by numbers. For what it is it isn't bad, but it isn't very good either. I know there is a vast audience out there willing to part with their hard-earned moolah to watch a stock disaster movie such as The Core, but I am not part of it. If you feel you are, you won't be disappointed. You might not be particularly thrilled, but you won't be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you like a little more characterisation, story, good dialogue, directorial innovation and that kind of thing, forget it. I bought this in a set of three movies for ?3 in my local superstore. On the strength of The Core I am not expecting too much from the other two films. But as ?3 will hardly buy you two litres of petrol in Britain at the time of writing, I don't really feel I have wasted my money. Just my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The subject is interesting. The topic is fascinating. The treatment is quite reassuring. But the ideology is hateful. Imagine some natural, geological or cosmic catastrophe meaning the end of the earth, hence of humanity. The loss of the magnetic field of the earth is one possibility since it has been going down for a few decades and no one can explain. If such a phenomenon were truly happening, the normal reaction would be to bring all scientists around the world together to find a solution. There cannot be any moral and acceptable salvation for humanity, or even a little part of humanity if it does not mobilize everyone, every country, every nation. The film is unluckily hijacked by the military that imposes the vision of some aggressive attack from an enemy. They seem to listen to the scientists and politicians for a while, but at the same time they have their own Plan B ready which is purely military. That is why the military should have no power whatsoever and their finances should be scrutinized constantly, for them not to be able to have their own plans. That's why the finances of the military are supposed to be voted by Congress, but is what Congress votes always clear? Certainly not and that is true in every country. There are some blind or invisible lines hidden in some other budgets. That is revealing about a lack of democracy in our countries: the armed forces are not 100% open to public scrutiny and they do things they have never been allowed to do. The film though takes a clear stand against this and manages to defeat Plan B, thanks to a hacker in the place. We could of course wonder why they brought that hacker into the sanctuary. But for the film he was needed and was able to fulfill his promise. I must say I did not like his nose. Too visible, too outstanding. A hacker is supposed to be absolutely invisible, hence just plain normal, average, banal, in no way conspicuous. Then the treatment of the volunteers in that last chance mission is quite flat after all. A little bit of rage but a lot of positive tension. A situation in which one must sacrifice after the other should create a real tension that could be and become negative, including the absolute loss of all reactivity in an individual who knows there is no way out. But It was a pleasant film after all.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard theories stating that this could be a cause for concern in the future, which is why I rented it, and to see what science fiction's take on the theory was. The special effects in this film were bad and they were a huge portion of the movie. The actors and actresses, while known, did not do a very good job at showing emotion, and it seemed as though it was just a paycheck to most of them. Aaron Eckhart has been good in films that I have seen in the past, but in this one he was not on top of his game. Why he was chosen for this role I do not know. They had to give background I understand that, but they had to set everything up so perfectly to make sense that it became cheesy. For instance they needed a ship to be able to go underground and withstand extreme heat so a ship that was supposed to take 10-15 years was developed in less than 3 months and it became stronger with pressure and extreme heat. I did however like the idea for the film it just wasn't executed correctly in my opinion. I also liked a part of the film were the ship landed in a giant geode of sorts that was pretty cool. They were in a pocket beneath the earths crust surrounded by cobalt and filled with enormous amethysts. Also the thought that there are diamonds the size of small countries under the earth is interesting to me as well. The ship was neat looking ; it reminded me of an antique locomotive crossed with the original Batmobile. So with that being said it's worth your time to watch at least once, but it's not something you'd be able to watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Hollywood formula action/sci-fi at its worst. You can almost hear the movie execs being sold on this one. "Well, it's kind of like Armageddon, except it occurs at the middle of the earth, and it's also kind of like..." Basically it borrows scenes from every disaster/action movie you'll ever see.I don't blame the actors. The cast is filled with decent talent for the most part. They didn't have much to work with given the cartoon-like script and paint-by-numbers storyline. This movie also completely misses the point of the "science" in sci-fi. In order for a sci-fi story to work, the science aspect has to at least seem somewhat plausible. Anyone who has ever studied anything about computers, physics, chemistry, or geology will find themselves laughing hysterically during this nonsense.Even the special effects are rather weak. It seems no one was really sure how to depict a journey to the center of the earth in a space-ship like vehicle. So we end up with a lot of shots where the ship seems to be traveling through a vague, nebulous electrical cloud. I won't even discuss the laughably bad destruction of Rome, Italy sequence.I know some will defend this as a mindless popcorn flick. But how many times can we watch the same old story unfold? How many times can we watch the same cookie-cutter characters go about their predictable business?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: Ridiculous but rather ridiculously entertaining. THE CORE once again aids the most brilliant minds of the planet to save the world from an untimely doom: The core of the Earth has (apparently) stopped turning, and everything from the very silliest of ideas that the writers of the movie can think about. THE CORE comes from the same kind as the movie Armageddon, which was about the world's collision with a deadly meteor. THE CORE is just about as silly, if not sillier, but its also amusing if seen in the "so-bad-it's-good" factor. Instead of the crew of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, the crew in this movie is composed of a brilliant science professor (Aaron Eckhart), "terranauts" Maj. "Beck" Childs (Hillary Swank) and Commander Iverson (Bruce Greenwood), a brilliant scientist (Stanley Tucci) and a crafty one (Delroy Lindo, surprisingly wacky). Their mission is to dig, via giant "Mole", and try to "restart" the core (somehow they have to!), while the world above goes up in flames (a lightning storm destroys the Roman Colosseum, a flock of pigeons go berserk and there's something about a couple of guys collapsing suddenly).The plot of the film, although is filled with modern technology and gadgetry, is simply a retread or rehash of those B-grade sci-fi abominations usually produced by Roger Corman. THE CORE will give Corman a run for his money with this film. It's a silly sci-fi adventure, with science that only could happen inside a mind of a crackpot. I'm not much of a scientist myself, but could you believe this! This film has so many crazy ideas, you'd wish they made this into a comedy. But it is what it is; an outrageous (both intentionally and unintentionally), and for most of the time, it doesn't really take itself seriously. The effects are uneven, ranging from good to occasionally terrible. The dialog, of course, is silly as is the whole crackpot story. Suspend your disbelief to the fullest and THE CORE is a real hoot, to be sure.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid Science, Funny Script, Decent Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a few exceptions the actors are doing a convincing job selling this silly sci-fi romp to the center of the Earth. The phony technical explanations are laughable in more than one place, but acceptable in the context of this outlandish tale. What is unforgivable is the editing (or the footage that the director handed to the editor to try to make sense out of). There are several disorienting instances of the scene "crossing the line" defying the audience to keep track of which way objects and people are facing.A sample of what you'll have to overlook: the notion that a mad scientist out in the desert constructs a subterranean ship able to withstand impossible atmospheres of pressure below the ocean in a few months, merely based on rough prototypes. The entire crew piles into the ship and pilots this never-before-seen technology like they'd been doing it all their lives.Still, the whole mess somehow is kind of watchable and entertaining for some intentional and unintentional laughs. Every professional in the science community must howl with laughter at this highly "fi" sci.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A recycled disaster movie that's still worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing in this movie that has not been done in Armageddon, Volcano, and The Day After Tomorrow. The story, the music, the writing... That being said, it is worth watching.If not for Delroy Lindo, Stanley Tucci, and Aaron Eckhart the recycled story and scientific hodgepodge would not sell. This movie is proof that good actors can make a B-movie entertaining.The special effects are decent but not stunning. Seeing the filmmakers' interpretation of our planet's core is pretty interesting. It is alien without being otherworldly. I never scoffed or thought anything looked ridiculous.If you are looking for something to watch while you eat a microwave dinner alone on your night off, this is the perfect movie for it. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd say half of the movie is Hollywood fiction, and the other half could be a remote possibility- only because I believe that the Earth's magnetic poles have shifted, in the distant past. However, I don't think jump-starting Earth's nickel-iron core, will resume proper rotation, preventing gravity failure from sucking every known object out into space.I was fascinated by the visual renderings of what may lie beneath the Earth's crust...especially the hot, hostile environment inside the Mantle. Can you imagine? I still laugh at the deep-burrowing craft developed for the mission itself....which is the mechanical equivalent of a Diamond/Carbide-toothed sea Lamprey(species of Leech).I agree the filmmakers opting for such a lofty objective, were obviously gunning for huge box-office receipts just like Deep Impact, and Armageddon. Nice try guys. At least get your science down right before making such an ambitious film, and don't cast Hilary Swank for such intellectual roles, like a Physicist anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite liked The Core as it was a nice revival or rather homage of 60s Sci-Fi B movies. So don't expect anything original. All in all I find it a well made and entertaining film. Special effects are indeed somewhat pedestrian but it is not a high budget major film. Hillary Swank does a good job as tomboy action heroine and one cannot help but feeling pleasantly reminded of The Fantastic Voyage or other classics. The Core will most certainly not be Jon Amiel's lasting legacy in film but if you want an entertaining 90 minutes of pure popcorn cinema this will do very nicely. What amazes me is how versatile Jon Amiel is as a director. I think the only genre he has not done is porn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Earth's inner core mysteriously stops spinning all sorts of increasingly destructive phenomena begin to occur. First an EMP wave sweeps through Boston, then birds go nuts in London, and soon entire cities are leveled. Of course, the only solution is to confide in a group of experts with assorted talents to jump start the Earth.Naturally in a science fiction adventure like this the first thing that gets annihilated is the city of Logicopolis. The Earth is so massive and has so many processes that even the most brilliant scientists can't predict 100% so a disaster that "shuts down" the whole Earth just cannot be logical. However, that doesn't make the movie any less fun. This is just a dose of classic Verne-style science fiction. There's action, there's adventure, there's a certain sense of wonder, though the by the end plot (as in many movies) brings up the idea of super-weapons, even a trailer hinted at this. While this "explanation" is not wholly bad, the whole "super-weapons" idea seems like too much of a cop out. This is science fiction, it doesn't need a total explanation. Much less one that has been used before too many times.However, the film is more than enough to entertain on a night off. --- 7/10Rated PG-13 for destruction and mayhem</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I wrote a review of this under a previous user name, and now can no longer find it. Having again seen THE CORE, this time on cable TV, I can positively state that you will do yourself no harm by watching he first half, which colorfully illustrates what happens when the earth's magnetic field is thrown out of whack. Planes and space craft are thrown off course. People drop dead. Cars collide. Bird attack people. By the second half, the government has put together a crack team of scientists and others to travel to the earth's core and jump-start it with a nuclear device. You may safely skip the second half. The first half, with divebombing birds, stopped watches and a shuttle landing on e Los Angeles freeway, is excellent in building up the mystery and tension.</fullReview>

Don't watch this movie unless you want to learn what to avoid in movie making.Acting is OK though, thankfully the movie has some good actors but it doesn't come close to compensating for this hopeless flick. Had it not been for the acceptable acting I would have given it a 2 instead of a four.Even most of the graphical wizardry, which today is a standard part of a lot of movies and no longer any great obstacle to create, is poor and it even seemed they re-used a lot of animated shots a couple of times.

		<fullReview>"The Core" is a corny borderline B Sci-fi movie that has everything needed for a good disaster movie. It has science with no seaming basis in reality, a cast of recognizable but lesser known actors, and the wanton destruction of recognizable land marks (the Colosium, the golden Gate Bridge, etc.).In the movie the earths core has stopped spinning due to some super secret government earth quake machine with the dubious name of "Project Destiny". To fix the problem a group of scientists and astronauts must drill down to the earths core and "jump start" it with nuclear bombs. Characters are killed off one by one trying to save the mission and instill some drama.The acting is not great, but then this isn't quite Shakespere. The effects are OK. They spend most of the movie drilling through the earth so there isn't a hole lot to see anyway.If you can take it for what it is (corny sci-fi) then I think you'll find it's a descent way to spend a few hours.

		<shortDescription>Poor Stanley Tucci</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, let me begin with my little summary. Of course Stanley Tucci is in this movie, and of course he plays with perfection the sniveling, obnoxious, arrogant pompous prick who just hope someone will kill. In watching this movie, he does not disappoint. But in watching it, and finding myself saying "will they please kill him off already?" I realized that I could really not remember a single movie with him in which I hoped he would be killed or fired or whatever. Then it dawned on me that this poor man is hated for a living in the characters he played. How depressing. However, he does it well, and I love to hate him. Anyways, back to The Core. Not that bad, could be better. Typical apocalypse tale where everything has to be decided this moment or the world ends. The special effects were pretty interesting and the story was somewhat original (after asteroids and comets of Armageddon and Deep Impact). All in all I didn't mind watching it on video (but I didn't pay for it, so maybe I am biased.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Core' is all bad science, and that makes it viewable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it about free DVDs, that we will watch it even though we know the movie is bad? 'The Core' was like that with me. It's saving grace is that ALL its science is bad science, the premise that a now stationary Earth's core will somehow trigger widespread destruction and allow the Sun's energy to roast us simply is absurd. But so are all the other 'scientific' elements of the story, so we don't spend any time really worrying about it. Any more than we wonder how Superman can fly or Spiderman can shoot webs. There are even web pages devoted to a detailed analysis of all the flaws. However, I was happy to see them use the term 'unobtainium' for a new metal with super properties. In the motorcycle brotherhood, for years we have jokingly called certain parts as made of 'unobtainium', which was a way of saying that the part was so hard to find. So, the movie is just mediocre, but can be a fun 2 hours for one that is in the right frame of mind. Or, an excellent viewing for a class of physics or geology students, as a forum to discuss the bad science.SPOILERS follow -- turns out the problem resulted from a military test of a new weapon based in Alaska. In a neat piece of movie magic, we see the sun's rays through a hole in the electromagnetic field (couldn't really happen) melt supports of the Golden Gate bridge, and we see it and vehicles fall into the bay. So this team of assorted guys and one gal plunge into the Earth's core carrying 5 nuclear bombs that their calculations show will start the core spinning once again if exploded just at the right places, at just the right times. One by one the Earthship encounters problems, crew members die in the Earth's crust, but the mission is pulled off, and the Earthship gets nuclear blast-propelled back to the surface, dodging obstacles and finding crevices, narrowly avoiding being crushed by a moving tectonic plate, and ending up on the ocean floor, where they were rescued after some whales help signal where they were. Just your typical disaster movie in the end. With funny, funny science.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't half bad. It's just that the part that was bad came at the end. In order to enjoy this movie at all, you of course have to abandon all sense of scientific reasoning you have. Okay, I can accept that in a popcorn disaster flick. The characters are barely fleshed out. Also a requirement for this genre. And you can guess from nearly the start, who's going to die, and starting when. Check and check. But there are some issues that put this a cut below the standard disaster movie. The first, as mentioned by a lot of people, is the sub-par f/x. These days you expect really good stuff getting destroyed. And they do deliver somewhat. Rome takes a beating, and so does the Golden Gate Bridge. But where a good disaster flick shows all of San Francisco going kaput, this one cuts off at the bridge, and then shows the aftermath. I'm reminded of the NBC movie 10.5, where they spent their money on one shot and then had the audience imagine the rest. Sorry, but if you expect me to turn off the rational part of my brain, my "make up the rest of the scene for you using my imagination" part of my brain turns off too.And then the ending. Okay, planet saved (like you couldn't guess), required people dead. Now what? The creative juices seemed to fail the writers at that point, they threw something together, gave the geeky kid one last thing to do besides looking stressed, and called it a day. It just fell way too flat for an ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern day disaster movies should be better than this.With today's CGI technology you have to think that it is possible to create any illusion and after the effects in Armageddon, Deep Impact,Independence Day and The Day after tomorrow not to name countless others, you should be half way to making a good movie.You then require a good story, a good screenplay and a good cast. Where The Core fails hopelessly is that apart from a few choice moments (above the ground only) it has non of the required ingredients to deliver a film worthwhile of your time and money. *spoilers follow*The film opens well, people with pacemakers die in a small area, all at the same time, the birds flying around the centre of London go haywire and the space shuttle crash lands in Los Angeles, a really good start and things look promising but it is all downhill from here and it's a big hill.Scientifically the film is either implausible or impossible. Every scene underground is excruciating to watch,it doesn't look realistic and the crew would certainly have been dead meat after a very short space of time. You can't expect great acting in a movie like this but what is on offer here is extremely poor and the normally reliable Stanley Tucci is third rate in a very irritating performance.A wasted opportunity to make a good disaster movie.It fails on every level conceivable, however I always believe any film should be given a chance and viewed once so give it a spin, just don't expect much, this movie is rotten to the core.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't recall this movie in the theatres - checked it out at the library. Know now why I don't remember it! Just an average every-day turn of the century low-budget SF movie. I think it would do well on TV - you could easily edit it for time and not miss a beat. Ditto on everyone's comments re: predictability and character roles - was able to figure out what was going to happen to who as soon as the "ship" launched. But, all that being aside, it does provide a margin of relief from the reality TV shows. Very glad I didn't have to rent it or waste money on it in the Box Office...would have been very disappointed.Good points: creative way to find a new capability for human kind to kill itself (story line) Bad points: starting with the shuttle landing in a spillway? give me a break!I hope they didn't spend too much money producing it! Bad acting, unbelievably poor plot realism (considering how "techy" everything else was, the best they could do for "Virgil's" progress to the core was a 2D graphic of the Earth?) and generally a waste of money...I expect we'll be seeing bits and pieces of this one in other low-grade knock-offs.</fullReview>

Neat!Spoilers ahead?The lead guy was so Scot Bakula I kept checking to see if it wasn't in fact-him. Quantom Leap guy. Tucci was the obvious Carl Sagan parody--they even forced a 'knock off the Sagan crap' line in there at him. That was rather odd. I liked best the astronaut who was knocked off halfway down, and Delroy Lindo-who as the inventor of the driller ship (Virgil)-does the typical self-sacrifice for the good of all routine. That was fun.Hilary Swank-well it was like seeing her as a cop in 'Insomniac'-not the most believable but she can act so I give her a pass. The F/x were right outta Harryhausen at times-lightning strikes in Rome anyone?-but I enjoyed the stuff at the core itself.Ignore the science--all typical cartoony B movie stuff you shouldn't waste your time getting worked up about. The casting is pretty good-Alfre Woodard wearing a headset is a strange under-usage of a fine talent-they weren't given that much to work with though, ya know?**1/2 outta **** if you like 70's type casts and 50's style disaster movies-you have seen this all before.

Who the hell ACTUALLY laughs at bad movies? maybe a giggle, but really people...its not side-splitting. I am a fan of disaster films no matter how bad they are. This movie for example had horrible accuracy when it came to information. Anyone who said this movie was like Armageddon, is basically wrong. Every disaster film you will see, is going to have something in the beginning of the movie that will show that something bad is going to happen, in every disaster film they are going to grab a whole bunch of smart-scientist people from around the world, In every disaster film it's going to be the exact same plot. Ok? get it through your heads, people. I did not like this movie very much. But don't exaggerate when you write a review and say "It was a retarted, cheesy, crappy, hilariously stupid movie!"

		<fullReview>The first impression when the film starts is that a great sci-fi film is taking place. Until the real mission will start (first half an hour), everything stands up to the initial promise, bringing in mind the classic sci-fi masterpiece "voyage to the center of the Earth" starring James Mason (based on Jule Verne's classic novel). But when the armored capsule named 'Virgil' sets off for his trip to the center, first disappointment emerges for the true sci-fi fan. Going deep into the ocean to hit at high speeds in the ocean's bottom, it becomes obvious that the film bypasses all elementary physics, making things totally unrealistic. In fact, even if the capsule could resist the terrible impact, all crew members would have instantly died from the awesome crash! (more than a 100 g's!!!)The use of special lasers to cut thru the Earth's crust is not realistic at all, as it would take time to cut even a few meters thru, making the descent too slow. Is this what we see? Boy, no! The ship speeds up even more, traveling to the center at incredible speeds! Goodbye elementary physics.The nice digital effects can't save the story. Untruthful events occur every once in a while. Just to mention a few more: one guy steps out from the capsule, 5000 km deep into the magma phase!) at a temperature of ca. 5500 oC (same as the surface of the Sun). Still, his uniform resists the heat. The film makers fail to mention anything about the incredible pressure that would have squeezed the man to the volume of a fly!On their trip back to the surface the ship continues to travel at incredible speeds, avoiding all collisions with rocks or other obstacles, even big as mountains. It steers automatically thru the obstacles, resembling a racing video game. (By comparison, the classic novel by Jule Verne, written more than a century ago, is far more realistic.)If you can swallow the unrealistic physics, the film's story is interesting and keeps you in agony (the mystery of the Earth's deeps is always awesome!)As a conclusion, see the film if you like good sci-fi scenarios, but bear in mind that the makers of the film had not bothered to check out the science of the story.Was it too expensive to consult a good college physics professor? We'll never know. (By the way, USC is a few miles away from Hollywood!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, at least it was a little more realistic than Jules Verne's classic "Journey to the Center of the Earth." I don't remember much about that novel (and movies made based on that novel), but weren't there creatures depicted living at the center of the earth!!!??? And they call that classic literature?I did have a problem with the scientific plausibility of this movie, but hey, it's a feature film, not a documentary! So I kept that in mind and suspended my disbelief, and I enjoyed the ride. But on that subject of plausibility, I'm not a geologist or scientist of any kind, but I did have the following issues with this movie:* I'm not sure how Project DESTINY would have caused the core to stop spinning. The movie doesn't really explain that.* If the core did stop spinning, and we had these EM problems that threatened all life, kiss your butt goodbye, because there's not any object on earth that could withstand the heat and the pressure.* Even if we could build such a thing, to me it would be wise NOT TO MAKE IT MANNED, but like a probe that you could control remotely like Voyager or the vehicle we sent to Mars. It's too risky to put humans into the center of the earth!* By the way, if the EM field was decaying and all electronic devices were failing, how could the nerd and all the govt. agents operate the computers!?* If you dropped a number of nuclear bombs in the center of the earth, and it made waves that rippled throughout the outer core and mantle, that ship would be GONE. Ripples that large through the whole earth would cause the earth to blow up, not just "heal itself" (I hate that term anyway) by multiple earthquakes all over the planet.* The ship builder (I forget his name) would not have survived going out into heat twice as hot as his suit was designed.* On that subject, I feel that even though Rebecca had to make "life or death" situations, some of those lives (particularly that of the ship builder) could have been saved. The navigator seemed to just push buttons and exterminate people at will.Final note - I wish the DVD had included the original theatrical trailer, because as I remember the trailer the movie was marketed with an almost totally different plot. The trailer emphasized the government project to cause earthquakes at various points on the planet, but it backfired to cause electrical anomalies so something had to be done about it. But in the final movie that aspect of the plot is only briefly talked about. It's like they decided to reverse the plot to emphasize the effect rather than the cause.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what people who saw this were expecting, but I thought it delivered, and I just watched it along with someone else, didn't even select it myself.First of all, look at the cast list. These are not people who normally appear in sci-fi films (although Alfre Woodard has), so you know it is not going to be your typical sci-fi fare. It is character driven. People who spend every scene overanaylzing what would actually possible and what would not are going to ruin it for themselves. These are great characters. Hilary Swank does not disappoint, although she is very subtle in her acting, which I like. (Stanley Tucci is not subtle. I normally LOVE him, but he does to this movie what Billy Zane did to "Titanic.") But the really great characters are Delroy Lindo's workaholic scientist and D.J. Qualls' computer hacker. Some of their comical moments that were cut from the film should have been left in. Also, Woodard and qualls should have had more screen time together, because they exhibit an odd sort of untapped chemistry (no, not that kind).Anyway, enough about the cast. The special effects are high quality and the inventions the filmmakers have, well, invented seem pretty real to me. This works as a sci-fi/fantasy as well as, if not better, than, many other possible-end-of-the-world themed films. (It's more like "Deep Impact" than "Armageddon", thank goodness.)But here is what stayed with me: the decisions faced by the crew members in this film. That is what resonates, life-or-death situations played out. Most of the best of the genre (like "Alien") touch on this, this film brings it to the forefront. It may be uncomfortable to watch, in fact, but so it should be. That is what I feel elevates this film and makes it A LOT better than many critics said it was. I went into it not expecting to like it, and went out of it wondering why anyone wouldn't. 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Science - swayed from hokey to just about plausible.Sterio-typed characters - yesPlot - paper thin.I enjoy movies of all kinds and knowing what to expect when I rented this out (a somewhat cheesy, implausible disaster-cum-save-the-earth movie) it's exactly what it says in the tin.This move was good because it didn't take itself seriously (like Armageddon). Lots of comenters have mentioned that film in the same breath as this - though they might as well have mentioned "Towering Inferno" or the other Irwin Allen disaster movies of that ilk.This film is an Irwin Allen for the modern day. Predictable. You kind of knew who was going to live or die, you knew who was gonna get socked on the jaw. These are the roadsigns of a disaster movie - it's supposed to be fun.This was fun - I enjoyed it so I give it 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much better than I'd expected. The Core has a good sense of humor, reasonably good FX, and surprisingly effective performances. The actors take their roles seriously enough to be relatively convincing (within the over-the-top plot parameters of the film), but not so seriously as to burst the screenplay at its seems. It's farfetched fun, in the spirit of 50s sci-fi: Downright silly at times, but I grew fond of the movie's willingness to cast aside plausibility in favor of thrills and action. In addition, the DVD includes an excellent Deleted Scenes section, with good director commentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mild spoiler As a Sci-Fi, it's a decent movie. Actually much better than I thought it would be, original perception was Armageddon in Reverse. What I really enjoyed about the movie was its lack of Hollywood. In these days where movies get their punctuation with gore, sex, profanity, and asinine cultural catch phrases, it was EXTREMELY refreshing to see a movie that stands tall on its own merits. Families, this movie has some language in it, but no one is having sex, engaging in destructive habits (except for one guy that smokes who pretty much the antagonist anyways), teaching "alternative lifestyles" or using the movie for the normal Hollywood, CA liberal agenda. My family and I found it very enjoyable especially since we didn't have to turn it off half way through because of its content. To the creators of this film, thank you for standing up and making a decent movie, I'm sure the pressure against this was extensive, but I rented the movie and am buying it tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I thought of this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad, but far from the likes of Armageddon. The story is exciting and in some party completely absorbing. It tries to be a big disaster movie, but is chronically let down by a couple of aspects. It's biggest let down is the characters, who at best are unrealistic and at worst plain ridiculous. The other big flaw is the technical side of things. Putting aside the fact that you can not travel into the centre of the earth for a moment, the way that the Internet is used is completely laughable and the construction of the 'make believe' ship just doesn't seem thought out (it seems to have been designed to fit what happens to it in the story rather than the way such a vehicle would actually be designed). There is practically no attention to detail. Overall I'd give this film 5/10 based on the rather gripping story line - I enjoyed watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, while supposedly short on "hard science" to back up its premises, is nonetheless full of action, interesting characters, excellent special effects, and a dynamite score...no, it doesn't have that. In fact, I'm not sure if there IS a score. But no matter. Watch this movie for sheer entertainment; leave all of your embedded formulas from high school at the door, and just let these quirky characters do their stuff. I liked Stanley Tucci as Dr. Zimsky (he HAD to have a name like that, you know), the egocentric genius and expert on THE CORE. Tucci plays this part full-bore, and it's fun to watch him shade the different sides of the Zimsky character. Brazzelton, played by Delroy Lindo, comes in second on my list. He lives through his "ship", and he's totally down to earth, so to speak. The guy who played Serge, I forget his real name, was interesting with all of his philosophical musings about everything, and his little family at home. Less memorable are Josh and Beck and Rat. The Josh guy (oops!) is pretty credible, but Hillary Swank is only so-so as Commander Beck Rogers, or whatever her character's name is. DJ Qualls as the hacker, Rat, is the King Kong of stereotypes in this movie, but like I said, they weren't filming this one to knock off "Citizen Kane" from its perch. Watch it for laughs and for some good lines and some curious situations.Oh, I liked the guy who played the top general, too. He carried himself well, and wasn't too stereotyped. MAYBE A SPOILER HERE -&gt;Best scene: Zimsky goes berserk and is bopped by Brazzelton. Best line: "Let's see, it's 9000 degrees in there, and our suits are good for how much? 4000? That means that whoever goes in there isn't coming out." Best looking woman: None. Swank is tooooo thin and angular for me. 2nd Best scene: Serge is flattened like a crepe. 3rd Best scene: The VIEW from the GEODE! How DO they do that? 4th Best scene: Iverson parts his hair with a crystal shard, then falls SLOWLY into the waiting million-degree magma!! Dumbest line: Most anything Swank utters.Entertainment value = 8.0/10.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite enjoyed this rather foreseeable movie. Certainly, the whole doomsday setup makes you think of Armageddon in that it is 'do or die' for planet Earth. But while Armageddon is clearly pretentious and *wants* to be the greatest doomsday flick ever made, The Core doesn't try to provide 3 1/2 hours of non-stop heart-pumping fun and drama. I enjoyed the absence military types, CIA agents or others who might threaten to take over the mission once it got started. There was a definite slant toward the scientific aspects of the mission. In my mind, clearly a different take on this genre. Vanilla, sure, but it tasted just fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible "Core"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't hate a film that throws out all sense of logic and plausibility and just tries to be entertaining. But how entertained can anyone be when a skinny nerd called Rat can infiltrate a government security system and demand Hot Pockets from a General? Story is about the Earths core that has stopped rotating and this causes the magnetic field around Earth to slowly start disappearing which will result in the Sun burning the planet very soon if we don't somehow get it spinning again. The government has put General Purcell (Richard Jenkins) in charge of finding the right minds to come up with a solution and he starts by recruiting a college teacher named Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) and a physicist called Serge (Tcheky Karyo). Also in the group is the author Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci) who knows a former colleague Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) who has created a giant laser that can cut through rock like butter. Brazzelton suggests a missile like ship that will bore through the Earth and into the core where a series of nuclear bombs will create a big enough ripple effect to get the core spinning again. They need someone to steer it and they get Beck (Hilary Swank) and Commander Richard Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) who are both shuttle pilots. The government also needs the best computer nerd to hack into and overtake the Internet for various reasons (!) and they get Rat (DJ Qualls). The crew boards the ship and they head for the Earth's core through the ocean bottom and they start their journey.*****SPOILER ALERT*****They continue to bore to the core but they get stuck at one point by crystals and have to hurry because of underground lava but Commander Iverson is killed just before they take off. Now Beck is steering the ship but when they refigure their data it appears that they don't have the right amount of nuclear bombs for the effect they need so mission control decides to go to plan "B" which means they have to turn around. But the crew votes and then decide to continue on! This film was directed by Jon Amiel who is a good director and he does keep the action flowing at a good pace although this film does take about 2 hours and 15 minutes to view. The premise is just like those science fiction films of the fifties like "The Day The Earth Caught Fire" and "When Worlds Collide" but while those actually tried to tell an interesting sci-fi story this film is more concerned with entertainment and it reminds one of "Armageddon" to a great degree. Everything about the script is silly like the government needing a nerd like Rat. They don't have a computer expert at NASA that can help out? Or that Unobtainium metal they use for the ship. They need this indestructible metal to build the ship but what is the windshield made out of? How convenient to have a window to see through while you bore the Earths crust and it's 9000 degree's! And when a compartment is shutting someone has to run back and try and save something which will lock them in. It happens in every one of these films! I think the film goes the right path with just ignoring logic and just allowing the audience to come along for a fun ride. But why does Hollywood spend so much time and money on something so silly and illogical? How many interesting and story driven films could have been made with this budget? I can only speak for myself and say that I'm not entertained by a big budget mess like this. I was entertained by some of it but my preferences are different than those younger and less educated viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome concept but lacks scientific thinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alertI am a big sci-fi lover. However, what really upsets me is that most science fiction movies contain nothing scientific (with the obvious exception of Star Trek). Take the Core for example, it has an interesting concept, "the core of earth has stopped spinning" then we get usual global destruction crap(lightning strike on Rome, Colosseum explored), end of mankind and so on.The movie contains so many fatal scientific errors. Suppose we somehow came up with a way of making superlasers and the indestructable "Unobtaintium". How the hell can one send or receive a signal from the center of the earth. (through trillions and trillions tons of molten rock and magma. Especially at the end of the movie, Nasa or NERA (national earth rock administration) detected that the core has start spinning again after the nuclear explosions. "Why couldn't they detect the core had stopped in the first place." Or taking a plutonium rod out of a nuclear reactor with bare hands, or linking the Project Destiny main power to the Internet (so a skinny computer hacker can access your weapon, that was really smart). Oh yeah, by the way diamonds can't form shape under ten thousands degrees, they turn into vapor.Apart from a million scientific errors, the movie was great. If you do not care about science in a science fiction. This movie is definitely a "must see".Sean</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just cannot believe that this movie passed all the preliminary production stages and that there were producers willing to invest millions of dollars in it! Do they actually read the scripts? This story is just about the most implausible story I have ever seen in a SF movie. It doesn't take more than a general education level of physics and geology to realize that the entire movie is just one big nonsense. The ignorance of the screenwriters goes so far as calling the material that the core is made of "lava" instead of "magma". If they didn't make any background reading about the whole set of the story, they could have just looked up in a dictionary such as Webster's, and learn that lava is magma erupted at the Earth's surface. I don't want this to be a spoiler, so I won't mention any factual flaws (and there would be too many to mention them all). I rarely write comments about movies, and my only motive for writing this one is hope not to see a movie like this ever again. Screenwriters, producers, directors, and other movie makers out there, when making a SF movie, please, please, please, do HIRE A SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR!!! After all, the genre is called SCIENCE fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Core" is entertaining and unique on many levels. As a sci-fi film, the special effects enhance the story, rather than become the story. As an action film, the characters are developed, so that you feel a connection with them and their adventures. As a disaster film, the characters are highly intelligent, which creates compassion for their mistakes, and the outcome is believable. As a thriller, the subtle humor helps relieve the built up tension of the unknown.Yes, there are times that information appears inaccurate, unreasonable, or incomplete.

		<shortDescription>An OK sci-fi flick - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was an OK sci-fi flick. The opening events were certainly interesting, tho the plot seemed to flag a bit at the end.Yeah OK, a literal "journey to the centre of the earth" seems a bit fanciful (along with cloned dinosaurs, time travel and stargates). In this respect I feel there is no point in trying to justify the movie's scientific assumptions, as do many of the comments which criticise the movie on this point. Given the stated consequences of the Earth's core stalling, a material which can stand unlimited heat and pressure, and a laser system which can bore through 10s of metres of rock in seconds, one has to examine whether the events that follow make reasonable sense. They do (the movie is quite particular on small points of logic and cause/effect, something I always like in a movie) but as always it is the drama of the events, for which the "science" is only a backdrop, which makes or breaks the movie.Perhaps its main flaw was relative predictability - the killing of the crew one after the other in regular sequence seemed to add to this. There was little I felt, to create seat gripping tension as our brave terranauts strove to save the earth. Even the revelation of the military's Project Destiny which had created the problem in the first place, seemed to be revealed in a ho-hum fashion.Still, an interesting sci-fi idea, great visuals, generally competently executed. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with "Armageddon" and "Deep Impact" (both 1998 - a bad year for rogue asteroids), a natural disaster threatens the end of the world, but science - and more specifically nuclear weapons - can save us. In this case, though, the source of the problem is inner space which requires a journey full of unknown hazards more reminiscent of 1966's "Fantastic Voyage". The physics is, of course, utter fantasy but then, if Jule Verne could get away with it in his novel "Journey to The Centre Of The Earth, maybe we shouldn't be too tough on director Jon Amiel.As we know from "Boys Don't Cry" and "Insominia", Hilary Swank is not just a (very) pretty face and can do much better than this. Less money has been spent on the cast or the script than on the special effects, some of which - such as the collapse of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge - looks better than others - for instance, the destruction of the Coliseum in Rome. The whole thing is totally formulaic, with the six-person crew including one woman, one black and one European, and it is pretty obvious who is going to survive the predictable mishaps but, if you enjoyed the disaster movies of the 1970s, this is brainless fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This grim and silly movie is about the imminent destruction of the earth. It seems our government has developed a secret weapon called 'Destiny' which can cause devastating earthquakes anywhere in the world. This has caused the earth's core to stop rotating which in turn has caused the radiation shield around the earth to stop functioning, thus allowing massive amounts of radiation to wipe out the west coast, Rome, and other places around the globe.Who will be chosen to go to the earth's core to detonate it and save mankind? Enter Hillary Swank as a terranaut and Aaron Eckheart as a noted physics professor. They and three other gifted scientists build and fly an earthship down, down, down, to the center of the earth carrying four nuclear bombs.Are you still with me? I, for one, was ready to bail at this point because it was just too unbelievable. The fact that the actors played it with poker faces made it even more absurd. Suffice it to say that the world is now safe thanks to these two brave heroes.The dialogue here is completely predictable, as is the action (what little there is.) The special effects ARE well done but there is never any sense of danger because the lead actors take it all in stride as just another day at the office. Neither Swank nor Eckheart were convincing in their roles, so despite a big-budget-look, the movie falls flat. I guess this is a 'guy movie'. A better movie to watch (of the same genre) would be the old James Mason's flick, 'Journey to the Center of the Earth'. That was a fantasy too but at least it had dinosaurs to entertain us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you go to the core of what Hollywood's latest disaster movie is all about it is the effects of mankind's interference with the forces of nature. When will we ever learn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jon Amiel's film The Core (M), now showing at Te Awamutu's Regent Theatre, explores what happens when the USA creates a seismic weapon capable of creating earthquakes or, more specifically, the unexpected side effects of the weapon. The core of the planet is destabilised threatening the world with natural disaster after natural disaster and eventual annihilation. Enter scientists Dr Joshua Keyes (Aaron Eckhart), Dr Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), Dr Ed Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) and Dr Serge Levenque (Tchéky Karvo) who come up with the ultimate solution - journeying to the planet's core with a series of nuclear weapons to restart the core. A crazy solution to a crazy problem. What's more interesting than the cataclysmic plot, which sees space shuttle pilot Major Beck Childs (Hilary Swank) take the helm of a specialised tunnelling ship, is the human drama that takes place between the characters. Keyes is married to his work but, probably for the first time in his life, is distracted by the brilliant Childs. Childs, the youngest person to go into space, learns a few hard lessons about the responsibility of leadership - taking responsibility for the failures as well as the successes. Zimsky has an ego the size of the core, and stole some of Brazzleton's work two decades before, while Levenque can't get his head around saving the world so, instead, focuses on saving his family. There's very little bad language (I remember one expletive) or violence (there's one unavoidable altercation). The Core is definitely not Shakespeare but then it's definitely not another Deep Impact or Armageddon either. It's more like Contact. The main characters, who must learn to overcome their weaknesses for the sake of their mission, act like real people rather than action heroes. Far superior to Matrix Reloaded, with a more definable message, The Core is a must for those who love science fiction as well as those who enjoy films that make them think. Don't wait for it to come out on video as this one is a must for the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Core.Constant Reader, I must make a confession. It may damage my credibility with you, but I hope not. I liked this movie. There it is. I said it. Some of you will no doubt use this confession as the final proof that I have absolutely no taste in movies. Some of you may find yourselves saying something like the following: `Why is he seeing crap like The Core when far better films, The Hours for instance, are at the local multiplex? This just shows that he knows nothing, not one goddamn thing, about film!' Maybe you are right. And if my hushed confession concerning The Core helps you to drop one more bit of reading from an already overstuffed schedule, great, good for you.The Core, I must say, is not what anyone might mistake for good film. It has an incredible amount going against it. For starters, the premise, well..it kind of sucks. The core of the earth has stopped spinning, but lets give it that. This is a disaster movie after all and something had to happen. The dialogue is sometimes as bad as the tagline that was on the movie's poster: The earth has a deadline. I am not kidding that is what it said. Go look at the poster if you don't believe me. The science is awful, no real surprise there eh? (Geologists may walk away happy, mildly anyway. The movie gets a few basics right. The earth is not flat, or hollow, and does not wobble erratically on its axis to the chagrin of lost advanced civilizations. The earth has a core, and mantle and crust. It has a magnetic field. Hooray for Geology! The rest of the sciences have absolutely nothing what so ever to be happy about.) The film is also peopled with all the usual character types that you find in disaster films. There is the cocky pilot (or firefighter or climber or whatever), the wise captain, the heroic scientist who discovers the Problem, his colleagues, and the eccentric (there maybe two of these in this film). So yeah, it has problems. However these points are problems only if you go in expecting something like a good, original film. And if you go into The Core expecting that, you deserve every miserable minute of the film you are able to endure.Now most disaster films are crap. No question about it. Deep impact? Volcano? Utter crap. But the good ones play like some sci-fi flick out the late 40s and 50s. They are high on energy, and excitement, and they work the clichés well, not so high other things. In the ones that work the actors are obviously having fun, giving the characters their full attention and skill.The Core is a tongue in cheek disaster film. It never takes itself too seriously (and with this material that is a good thing). While the disaster film is often not too concerned, even remotely, with say, the laws of physics, it does seem to hold sacred two truths about humans. The two holy truths in disaster films, good and bad, are: ingenuity and sacrifice. Disaster films are fascinated with the way we often can pull off the impossible, even when time is short and the stakes are quite high. The other truth, involves that willingness, almost thoughtless, to sacrifice oneself to save lives.Director Jon Amiel has pulled together an amazing cast for what amounts to a big-budget B movie. There is in fact not a bad actor in the bunch. Hillary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Delroy Lindo, Tchecky Kayro, and Stanley Tucci, have all been great films. In this film they bring a lot of energy, and enthusiasm to their parts, and are fun to watch. I got the feeling that everyone involved kind of knew they were making a big B movie. I hope that is the case. But even if it is not the result is still the same. The special effects are pretty good, and the script deliciously bad. So no it is not a great film, not even a good film. If however you are willing to check your brain at the door, it is a fun movie to watch. And sometimes that is better than enduring `great' cinema. Honesty requires that I give the film a 4/10. That is a pleasant and enjoyable 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An entertaining film, with especially in the beginning some rather nice effects at the beginning of the film.You don't need to see this movie for the story, it's entirely predictable, but still fun enough to see if you have nothing better to do.Admittedly, there are some loopholes in the plot, the characters do some pretty stupid things, but it seems that all that belongs in this kind of disaster movie. At least the pace stays quite rapid throughout the movie, but if I'd had my way, there would have been a different, more cynical ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7 out of 10THE CORE - Decent sci-fi flick with a competent cast of "nobodies" and an intelligent script full og adventure and suspense. Decent if not outstanding spfx. I'm pleased to report the absence of Ben Affleck branded testosterone in this movie. The ARMAGEDDON comparison is certainly not fair either: For example, THE CORE has space vehicles moving like space vehicles as opposed to X-wing fighters, and the production design is much more sober and free of the comic book logic, trite cliches and gratuitous BMW commercial style shots which plagued ARMAGEDDON. The plot is pretty straightforward: The Earth's core has mysteriously stopped rotating, which upsets the planet's magnetic field and threatens to cook all life on the surface in cosmic rays. What to do, what to do. Enter a team of brilliant clever people to build a fantastic vehicle which will take them to the center of the Earth, where they hope to jump start the core with ATOMIC POWER!In the best of sci-fi traditions the rules of the "universe" are established at the beginning of the movie ("Unobtainium", heh!) -- and the neat thing here is that the movie universe is internally consistent, and follows those rules. The planetary geophysics SOUNDS believable, and sci-fi fans should be happy that the whole thing feels 'true'. The characters in the movie are believable and their actions don't seem contrived. Even the hero is likeable and there's really no annoying bad guys being dicks for no reason. This is pretty rare in sci-fi, particularly the hollywood low-calorie brand. So all in all, it's an enjoyable piece. There are about two places in the movie where cheap f/x sort of looks cheesy, but that hardly detracts from an otherwise fine and interesting movie.</fullReview>

Oh sure, its not going to dethrone The Godfather or anything, but as a popcorn-muncher it is admirable. The science is murky and questionable, sure, but I didn't even find myself thinking about that until after the film was over. The effects are pretty good, though the model work is far superior to the CGI. Acting is nothing special, but workable enough considering the material and the film's focus. The overall feeling I got was just one of fun -- I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film and now eagerly await its release on DVD.

		<fullReview>THE CORE is one of those big budget Science Fiction extravaganzas that is so bereft of excitement and imagination that it becomes an endurance test for the audience to sit through. No doubt the filmmakers had every intention of making this into a taut, edge-of-your -seat thriller ; the film's promising first half hour consists of two spectacular set pieces guaranteed to whet the viewer's appetite. The opening segment in Boston is a spectacular display of instant chaos, where the camera pans from an executive dropping dead in a skyscraper boardroom to the outside street where over a score of drivers and pedestrians are simultaneously stricken by some unknown phenomena. An even more impressive segment follows with what seems like thousands of pigeons haphazardly flying into buildings and windows or dropping dead in mid flight in downtown London. The cause? Apparently the earth's core has stopped spinning, which results in turbulent conditions on the planet's surface (earthquakes, tidal waves and intense electrical storms.) To the rescue come an eclectic assortment of scholarly and scientific types to save the world from imminent disaster. These characters are played by A-list actors in roles more suited for a cast in a B Movie. My only guess is that the likes of Hilary Swank (pretty, quick-thinking Astronaut) , Aaron Eckhart (hunky, disheveled Geophysicist professor) and Stanley Tucci (obnoxious , attention-seeking scientist) had time on their hands before their next big projects. Along with veteran players Alfre Woodard, Bruce Greenwood and Delroy Lindo, the entire cast gives it a game try but can't overcome the kind of pedestrian dialog that induces voluble wisecracks from theater audiences. Jules Verne did it much more effectively with his novel JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (and the old Pat Boone movie is far more entertaining!) The actual journey to the earth's core in this new film is strictly standard stuff, punctuated by scenes of the crew being pinned under heavy equipment at the worst possible moments, a sure sign that the director and scenarist are desperate for ideas.Nondescript visual effects become visually monotonous very quickly ; granted, no one knows exactly what a journey like this would actually look like if it were even remotely possible, but a more fanciful imagination would have helped. Ironically, the only terror the movie produces in the audience is eerily unintentional.The film opens with a space shuttle in crisis just before landing. A later scene involving The Golden Gate Bridge invokes an unsettling feeling that has nothing to do with the suspense on screen. THE CORE is a product of miscalculation on several levels.</fullReview>

My main problem is that nowadays, a B Movie seems to be one that cost millions and makes no money. They are trying to pass B movie material off as an A-movie release. Hilary Swank obviously wanted a mega-crowd pleaser on her resume to bolster her price after winning an Oscar. Why else would she chose this. Why did she chose this one though... Stock dialogue, lot's of throw away characters. Standard fx. Nothing new, or groundbreaking here. The one exception would be Delroy Lindo.

		<fullReview>Before you see the movie clear your mind of any factual knowledge you may have about Earth and it's magnetic field, core and all other things. Then, look at the movie as if it were true.When you manage to do that you might see the movie the way I saw it. Much like Armageddon did a few years ago this movie plays around a possible disaster, but in a funny way, and surely by leaving science at the sideline for a good long bit. In this movie the disaster is the Earth's magnetic field that destables after the Earth's core stops spinning, and the heroes are the ones that travel to the Earth's core to kick start it. All the rest is various local disasters happening (some of them shown very nicely), people sweating to get the job done, and nothing more.In short, it's scientifically wrong. It might be true in a Universe where pigs fly and chicken have teeth. But when you look past that it's quite nice, easy to digest and worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check Reality at the Door for 'The Core'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers With eye candy like Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank in the lead roles, The Core, is surely and easy movie to watch - as long as you've suspended reality at the door. From beginning to end, The Core follows the Hollywood formula - hook the guys with effects and action, introduce an attractive love interest, kill a few dispensable good guys, make the token black a martyr, raise the music score and send the crowd home weeping. As a result, we know how each character is going to respond every step of the plot.In fact, the movie is so predictable, we know what they're going to say next. What keeps you, as the viewer, on the edge of your seat is wondering just exactly how they're going to do it. Crash-land the space shuttle in a flood canal - brilliant. Crazed lunatic pigeons in Trafalgar Square terrorizing tourist children - fantastic. A convicted internet hacker felon breaking in to the Department of Defense computer system, diverting the nation's power supply from Project Destiny in Alaska to Coney Island so the singing whales have time to save our madly in love hero and heroine trapped on the floor of the Pacific Ocean - simply sweet serendipity.Like a good 'Die Hard' thriller, 'The Core' is simply - real. Eckhart as Dr. Josh Keyes (he holds the key to saving the world) and Swank as Major Rebecca Childs (the youngest woman in space ever, she's just a child whose opinion we discount, because, well, she's just a Child) respond and react to every situation just as you would expect beautiful actors and actresses to react. Swank is appropriately cast for the role of Major Childs, a cutting edge role that literally transforms the greater role of women as heroines in action flicks. (Not surprising after for an Oscar-winning cross-gender performance in 'Boys Don't Cry'.)As characters go, Childs grows the most in the two hours and twenty minutes, transforming from a mere hotshot child into a responsible hotshot heroine. What's so groundbreaking about her performance is this is a role normally dedicated to a sweaty, slightly hairy and balding man. At the core of her transformation is her role model and adversarial mentor, Commander Richard Iverson (Bruce Greenwood), who delivers a father-like lecture to the Childs early in the movie, stamping his forehead for death once he expends his plot purpose. It's unfortunate Iverson has to fall into a vat of molten lava before Childs really hears his message. But the setup leaves for a poignant knuckle-biting moment as the entire cast has the opportunity for the tear-jerking 'Pause and Turn' - when a character stares in the face of eminent disaster, and yet, takes a moment to pause, mourn, and remember their fallen comrade right before the music score whisks them back into action. Oh, what a stronger person I could be if I had an orchestra of violins following me around.Dr. Josh Keyes (Eckhart), as the person who holds the key to saving the world - and thus the movie - delivers a solid performance that stays true to his character. His global knowledge of science, his understanding of politics, and his dedication to exploration and learning should boost admissions of attractive young males at liberal arts colleges this fall. As he lies there, in the arms of Childs, exhausted, having just saved the world and yet still uncertain of his own fate, Childs asks, 'So what's next for you?' as if stopping by Starbucks for a latte is foremost on her mind. `Pizza,' he says. He's saved the world, and he's going to get a pizza. What more could this movie accomplish? Roll the credits.I laughed. I cried. It was better than 'Cats'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Core lacks a core, but I enjoyed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see The Core because I had nothing better to do yesterday evening, I like science fiction and because I had heard that it has a sense of humor about itself.Jon Amiel's `The Core' is a thread spun by the Hollywood Action/Adventure machine that ends up as a quilt of characters and plotlines from other movies. It's warm, thin, flat and you may find that after the film your toes are cold, even despite the 9000 degree heat on the screen.As this quilt unfolds, you find the arrogant scientist from `Contact' (better developed in that movie by Tom Skerritt) who has, in the end, an epiphany spun from a few puffs on a Camel Light. You see the kid (and part of the plot) from War Games only updated with a Hot Pocket habit and a scarier neck. You find the French guy with the heart of gold from...well.France, whose character you think must have been something before the cutting room floor. To the film's credit, there is a warmer, less generic version of Ben Affleck's character in Armageddon, better played in this move by Aaron Echhart.There are many, ahem, quotations (to put it nicely) of plot and character from such epics as Journey To The Center of the Earth, Fantastic Voyage (although without the onboard treachery), EARTHQUAKE!, and even `The Birds,' along with many other film fragments, all served up on floating lake of hot magma.Now I'm not a scientist, and I'm hopeful that the geology was relatively accurate, but I have a real problem with someone reaching in to an active nuclear reactor, flipping a few circuit breakers, yanking out the control rods and dragging some distance. Okay, even if I could suspend my disbelief about that, I just can't make the leap when, thereafter, there is a) no melt down, and b) no physical side-effects other than a pair of bandaged hands. It was the nuclear science of Dr. Christmas Jones in `The World Is Not Enough' more attractively played in that film by a jump-suited Denise `If I don't get that plutonium back, somebody's gonna have my butt' Richards.Good news and bad news on the special effects: `The Birds' thing was good, but the exterior shots of the ship running through ocean, crust, mantle, etc., looked like Irwin Allen's 1961 `Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea' - you could almost see the strings! And a note to Hollywood: please stop destroying San Francisco. Couldn't you pick some other town to destroy? I know it's an easy target, but c'mon.As the Griffin Mill character says in Altman's stunning 1992 film "The Player:' "I was just thinking what an interesting concept it is to eliminate the writer from the artistic process. If we could just get rid of these actors and directors, maybe we've got something here." Although The Core has no core - no magnetic force of writing or art that keeps it together -- I admit I enjoyed it. And that's my irony, and I'm sticking to it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Core' is actually pretty scientifically accurate. The materials exist to easily withstand the temperatures and pressures ( in nuclear fission reactors etc ), and ultrasonic drilling is certainly possible. *Possible slight Spoilers* I had to laugh at the reviewer talking about a nuclear explosion having 'little or no' impact in the earth's core. How do you know? Underground nuclear explosions can cause massive impact, as witnessed when underground nuclear testing was carried out by the Pakistani government a few years ago ( literally making a mountain range 'shake' ). The testing was also allegedly responsible for the earthquakes in Afganistan at the same time ( around 8 on the Riecter scale ). So, scientifically at least, the film stands up. On the 'entertainment' scale, i'd rate this a solid 7. It's no masterpiece for sure, but a lot better than I had expected, with solid acting, and exciting scenes. It could have benefited by being, say, fifteen minutes longer, but all in all entertaining fare.</fullReview>

Hilary Swank is a surprising choice for the cast of this film yet she is great. No Oscars for this role but she's doing a fair job! Stanley Tucci as the "bad" professor is just funny. DJ Qualls as the "hacker" is hilarious!!So the cast is good, well on to the story... yeah you got me - the story is a bore (nice word joke...) and very predictable... but wasn't Armageddon (1998) that too? Just with a slightly bigger budget?The movie was fun because nobody can take the story serious! It's just a rollercoaster ride! The characters are fun. I just loved DJ Qualls as the "hacker" dude...Some jokes are really great... (minor spoiler!) I mean with the billion billion dollar cheque or credit card... or what about the "How many languages do you speak?

		<fullReview>I have a weakness for Hollywood blockbusters. Even more embarrassingly, I have an especially soft spot for special effects films. You know the kind, dominated largely by grandiose special effects with a ridiculously unbelievable "story" designed solely to string together the explosions and computer generated graphics.I saw Independence Day on opening weekend, Armageddon in the first week of its opening, etc., etc. I love these films. Every once in awhile they surprise me and are even pretty good. I can't think of an example of that off the top of my head but I'm sure there have been one or two. More often though, they are so bad they're good. The Core might be just such a film.Apocalypse movies are pretty fascinating from a sociological standpoint. In the seven-O's and eight-0's it was enough for us to fantasize about an airliner full of passengers or maybe an entire cruise ship being destroyed but at some point in the nine-0's we decided that just wasn't enough carnage. It became important for all of us to be killed. Whether we be disintegrated by aliens, wiped out by an unstoppable virus or destroyed by an asteroid, nothing short of biblical destruction of the entire human race would satisfy our collective blood/entertainment-lust.Continuing with this invigorating theme, The Core constructs a wonderfully bizarre morbid-fantasy about the rapidly spinning outer core of the earth stopping because of a doomsday machine made by the bad military men. We're told that the ill-effects of our global heart failure will include some wacky electro-magnetic disturbances and ultimately the failure of our entire electro-magnetic protection blanket that keeps out the nasty microwaves from the sun (or something like that, it's best not to pay too much attention to the scientific details when watching such a film).Well it wouldn't be nearly dramatic enough to just have some slow subtle build-up of these nasty EM problems. More importantly though, it wouldn't be in keeping with the template of these types of films. The formula dictates that we get to see some increasingly brutal scenes of devastation peppered with scenes of puny humans struggling desperately at some hail-mary solution to fend off armageddon.If you're planning to actually see this film and want to be surprised every now and again, stop reading now. I'm about to give away some big gags.The first failure in the movie is a quartz watch. It was probably about that time that I decided, "I think I'm gonna like this film." Next though, the pacemakers fail within a 10 block radius (I never had any idea how many pacemaker wearers there are! they're practically everywhere!). That's bad.After a little bit of plot unfolding (or perhaps it was character development?), the birds start freaking out and killing themselves. Something about their use of magnetic fields to guide their migratory patterns or some such. This was pretty silly and in the context of the rest of the movie that means it was fantastically silly. I mean so silly that it went right through the part of bad where it's actually good and broke through to the side where it's really bad again.Then we get into the plot big-time. Oh yeah, at some point the space shuttle has to land in one of those great big LA drainage ditches. You know, I'm convinced those ditches were just built to show up in movies. Whether they be the backdrop for Arnold jumping a Harley Davidson over a semi-truck, a drag racing duel with Travolta driving Greased Lightning or Kurt Russel surfing a tsunami, these damn ditches have seen it all. I can't really remember when the space shuttle crashed there but it served as the introduction to two of our heroes: a guy and a girl astronaut (don't worry, I won't bog you down with the names of these puny humans).So anyway, we also get introduced to some scientists (this movie has a lot of scientists in it, it must be really smart), some military guys (and girls), another scientist (who has issues with one of the other scientists, ooh the air was thick with drama) and a hacker (did you know that having a hacker hero is a prerequisite for a good effects film these days?). One of the scientists is a messy haired guy who's kinda cute so we instinctively cling to him as our hero of heroes. Oh yeah, the Nasa girl is kinda cute too.I think some other stuff happened at this point involving building a ship to tunnel into the center of the earth and plant some nuclear weapons or some such but more importantly, we get to see some really kick-ass lightning storms. These storms are so bad-ass that they level Rome in fact. No kidding. They blow up the coliseum and a lot of ancient Roman looking buildings. Destroying national, international and/or global symbols is very important in these films. It's a way of convincing our collective psyche that this is REALLY BIG STUFF. Really old and important stuff getting blown up makes it seem all the more, um, important or something.Now the effects are not really so great by modern CGI standards. I mean they were fine in a cartoonish sort of way but don't expect to really be convinced by any of them. When a rogue lightning bolt tears down the middle of a street (in Rome presumably) and throws giant chunks of asphalt everywhere as it goes, well, I dunno, it just didn't move me the way I really wanted it to. Perhaps I was distracted by thinking about our heroes in the laser-ultrasound-nuclear-powered-love-train tunneling to the center of the earth.So our wonder-worm, sole-hope-of-humanity vehicle is really flying through the solid rock and molten lava and crystal gardens and mazes of huge diamonds (not even a wonder worm can cut through diamond my friends!). I mean it is cruising. I don't know how fast a knot is, but it was doing hundreds of 'em, protected from the crushing pressure and tremendous heat only by its Unobtainium shell (how could I make that up?) and some occasional squirts of liquid nitrogen (or perhaps it was a continual mist? they never really showed how that worked).At one point our heroes do have to get out (in the crystal garden) but thankfully their tin-foil suits can take the pressure (whew! I was really worried for a second there!). Nevertheless, they do start getting picked off and wouldn't you know it? The poorly developed (and I mean even in relation to what passes for character development in this film) Nasa guy is the first to go! Of well, the worm must go on.So then some nonsense transpires about the outer core (of molten iron, that the ships cuts through like a hot knife) not being as dense as we thought (iron is tricky stuff apparently) so our heroes don't have enough nukes and the secret of the secret weapon (cleverly named: Destiny) comes out and the hacker has to save the day and another scientist dies, blah, blah, blah, but then we get to see the Golden Gate bridge get destroyed!Clearly this is what we've all been waiting for. No, we didn't know specifically what was going to get blown up in some grandiose fashion but, by golly, we knew our hard earned cash was going to buy us some destruct-ifaction and the Golden Gate bridge turns out to be the fatted calf at the alter of our morbid pleasure. And it was pretty great I gotta say.You might not know it (being that we all pretty much live in blissful ignorance of how badly the universe wants to squash/pummel/torch or otherwise squeeze the life out of us at every turn), but the EM field around our planet saves us all the time from the aerosol-can-flamethrower that is our sun. When the EM field breaks down, watch out, microwaves of hell (microwaves from the heavens doesn't sound as scary) will boil the water right in the sea, give you a really bad sunburn in seconds flat, melt your car tires and blow up the Golden Gate bridge like nobody's business!This scene was pretty darn good. My only complaint is that we only get to hear from the newscasters how half of San Francisco got destroyed. I would've gladly paid an extra $3.25 or so to see the Transamerica building blown up or my favorite taquerias go up in flames. I guess they wanted our imaginations to fill in the blanks. Whatever, if I wanted to use my imagination I'd read a damn book!So then our heroes develop some screwball plan to place there nukes in very specific places (accurate to within one inch!) with very specific timing (accurate to within a fraction of a second!) to get the shockwaves to compound itself or something. I dunno. Obviously this wasn't all that important because they forget about the time schedule pretty quickly (ejecting the cars/nukes seemingly at random, and darn close together plot-wise) and set the nukes' timers by hand (computers can't be trusted for such precise timing operations).What is important is that another scientist gets killed by walking into a part of the ship that is 9,000 degrees! His tin-foil suit only protects him long enough to disengage the auto-locking mechanism between the cars on the worm-train before his glasses shatter from the heat and he dies a (very painful) several seconds later. I don't know that he was in that much pain but the rest of us were anyway.The scientists are really dropping like flies now so I'm really appreciating how they stocked the movie up so throughly with them in the first place. Now there's only a couple of them left (and the girl astronaut).So anyway, another scientist gets trapped in one of the cars they have to eject (the only way they can deploy the nukes for some reason, I learned that word "deploy" from some other Hollywood gem I'm sure) by the massive nuke laying on top of him (the script writers weren't sure which scientist was going to get it at first so the messy haired scientist has the nuke laying on him for a brief moment too). Just before they eject his car off into the molten iron (which they are still just flying through!), he spits out something about needing more plutonium to make the last nuke go off big enough to fully jump start the earth's core (I'm not a scientist myself so the subleties of wave motion in molten iron went right over my head).Well, luckily all you have to do to supe-up a nuke is to throw some extra plutonium at it and they happen to have some extra plutonium in the worm-train's engine! Ok, it's not really extra plutonium as pulling it out shuts down the ship (not to mention the fact that it's super hot and they don't have any oven mits, just those damn tin-foil suit gloves) but apparently that's ok.Hmm, wait a second. If they pull out the plutonium and stop the ship so they can add the plutonium to the last bomb, how can they get away from it before it explodes? Maybe they were going fast enough that they could just glide through the lava for awhile after ejecting or something like that. I dunno, maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention. But anyway, they did it, the bombs all blow up, they don't get killed and guess what? The earth is saved!Some other stuff happens at this point (not the least of which is some groovy waves in the Sahara) to wrap things up and put a nice little bow on the plot, roll credits.This movie is possibly the most successful multi-million dollar B-movie I've seen in at least a few weeks. It was way more enjoyable than Phone Booth and almost as good as the last episode of Third Watch I saw (which wasn't all that great) and I highly recommend it for all fans of mindless science fiction, big-budget effects films which fixate on human carnage on a global scale. It is a flickering flourescent bulb, dimly glowing (periodically) in this venerable genre._john</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, just for the heck of it, I went to see this movie having nothing to do on a sunday. Well let me first start of by saying...I wasted 2 hours of my sunday. The Core is yet another special effects ladened mindless end-of-the-world film. And why do we need another one of these? The Core is a unbelieveable film that relies to heavily on the special effects to keep it going. The plot, if there is one at all, is yet another "save the world in a short time" bit and after seeing this movie, i wish the world would of ended right there. Of course there are the boring problems that arose several times during the film but you can predict that the heroes will pull something out to fix it no matter how crazy it is. To come to think of it, I cant remember one believeable moment in the film. To be fair, however, the special effects were pretty good with more hits than misses, but even when a horrible event started to happen, it would suddenly ended leaving you wanting more destruction and action. I even somehow became bored during some parts towards the end! So unless you like movies that dont involve and reason or thinking and just mindless action and things blowing up, then you will enjoy this. But if you are tired of "end of the world" movies as well as stupidity then avoid this at all costs.</fullReview>

If you love action movies, then I believe you'd appreciate the subtle campiness of the film. They even recycled the old LA ravine that has been used in countless car chases. It gleefully leaps through plot loopholes, trumpeting that it knows that you know whats going to happen next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Engaging performances by talented actors save this film from being nothing but a moronic excuse for some cool CGI. (Although in our age of war and disaster, making films where people suffer ad nauseum like this seems in poor taste.) You know you're in trouble when the first sequence involves ten or so people dropping dead because they have pace makers. Why would that many people with pace makers coincidentally be within the same 300 yard radius? Was there a pace maker convention? No...just the first of many preposterous plot elements.Amidst the mess, Eckhart, Swank, and their fellow actors manage gracefully to eke some humanity from their one-note, rather wooden roles--especially Eckhart who believably plays a sensitive college professor. And the always wonderful Afre Woodard is delightful if utterly wasted. But the dialogue and plot elements just get dumber and dumber. My favorite is when our heroes--trapped in a ship with limited oxygen and time running out to save the world--allow one guy to take a cigarette break. Hello? Did everyone's brain just fall out? Oh...right...we were supposed to check them in at the door.The movie, to its credit, does have a few of exciting action sequences. (Although some of them are silly and direct rip-offs of earlier films and one with dive-bombing birds is far too long and too sadistic--not unlike the movie in general.) And, again, what surrounds these bursts of frenetic energy is so poorly written it's not only amusing when it least intends to be but repeatedly sinks into boring clichés: whaddya know...on the journey, one by one the heroes die...just like every other Poseidon Adventure rip-off...but without Shelley Winters doing water ballet.Let's hope for better next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rotten to... the core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The major mistake of this movie is that it missed it's opportunity to be a great comedy. I don't even know where to start listing the reasons it was bad. Let's start with the fact that it was all absurdly illogical. Which made it very hard to take seriously.The beginning of the movie builds interest with bizarre happenings that remain unexplained until Boston Professor (Aaron Eckhart) realizes the common problem: electromagnetic charge. He develops a theory that all these happenings are due to the core of earth ceasing to spin which will eventually cause the earth to be fried of microwaves... the end of the world.Meanwhile a top Gun pilot (Hillary Swank) manages to chart a landing for a space shuttle in downtown L.A. which unltimately lands her the job of piloting the core voyaging craft dreamed up Delroy Lindo's character "Braz". Here's where the absurdities really begin.Their purpose being to travel to the center of the earth to get the core spinning, the team of scientists and military personel have a major stroke of luck when they find Braz out in the desert where he has developed not only an ultrasonic gun that can cut a perfect hole through a mountain (or the perhaps... the core of the earth?) but also has develped a compound that can withstand the gun and extremely high temperatures (like those of the earths core?) he calls "unobtainium." Our group of heroes finally head to the center of the earth without batting an eye after many failed mission simulations into the mostly theroretical environment of the center of the earth, where the viewer witnesses one absurdity after another. One scene stands out in my mind which mimics Hayden Christianson's "He's holding me back " where Eckhart's character throws a hissy fit when one of his friends dies in the ship. Perhaps the most frusterating part of the movie is a scene in which Hillary Swank's and Eckhart's characters (the hot potential couple) are alone and believe they have 12 minutes to live and they do nothing, not even kiss. I would liked to have seen a character with more sex drive like Sean William Scott in Eckhart's place. Perhaps he could have been rocking out to Slayer as the shot towards the center of the earth. I don't have to tell you that the world was saved and that the two hotties survive but I bet you didn't know whales had anything to do with it! Go and see it if you get kick out of absurdities but otherwise avoid it at all costs. -Jamie Perkins</fullReview>

HOWEVER, the dialogue was very witty ("And if I refuse?" "We have no sense of humor, sir. And we are armed."), the special effects were excellent (especially the giant geode), the characters were extremely likeable (especially Rat), and there were some very creative ideas to make the plot believable (Unobtanium, the lasers).

		<fullReview>Finally they got the disaster film formula right! The script is literate and somewhat thought provoking, and although we, the audience, may not totally believe a small crew of terra-nauts could ever expect to successfully journey to the center of the Earth, the audience is not treated to an excess of melodrama (the writer at least gets most of the science right).The drama is believable, however; it is "Armageddon" meets "Apollo 13" but without the excessive obsession with rescue scenes (as in Armageddon).In 'Core' there is no hodgepodge of lame set pieces, tired dialogue and thick-n-syrupy romance. The pace of the film is brisk and satisfying (although we are treated to yet another special-effect-destruction of world monuments as previously seen in similar visually appealing spectacles such as "Superman--The Movie" and "Meggido--Omega Code 2."The actors are pleasant enough to watch for as long as this adventure lasts, even the villain is not really a villain at all, just initially too self-absorbed to know better, but eventually pulls through for the rest of the film. Alfre Woodard is always a welcome addition in almost anything she agrees to appear in, and Hillary Swank is tolerably charismatic as the perfectionist who commandeers the bunch to the core of the problem.Make sure you watch this one in a really huge theater equipped with state of the art sound... rumble, rumble, rumble... Oh m'gosh, is that the whole of Rome collapsing!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, The Core is not perfect - but hey, when was the last time you saw a perfect film? At least it was entertaining, and that's really the point with this sort of movie, right? And anyways, what a relief to see a big, shiny, pretty action-adventure movie without a big, shiny, pretty uber-Hollywood star in it. I like the big Hollywood summer movies - they're fun - but it's nice to see one of those movies with just plain actors in it, instead of Bruce Willis, Tom Cruise, Ben Affleck, Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson ad infintium ad naseum, because those guys all suffer from same-guy-in-every-movie syndrome. Halfway through the movie, I suddenly wondered if a woman had directed it (no) because of the unusual amount of male emotiveness, the lack of a cliche romance, and the fact that we get a semi-beefcake scene (Aaron Eckhart topless) with no equivalent cheesecake scene. So I must give props to the very male director for not directing with his weenie (or pandering to an audience obsessed with their weenies). And maybe it's just me, but - having seen Boys Don't Cry - I can't look at Hillary Swank without noticing that she's awfully, well, boyish. If you liked Deep Impact but hated Armageddon, go see The Core.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally as I expected, but much more refreshing than most disaster films. 'The Core' is a success because of the interesting assembly of crew members and the fast paced storyline, which only temporarily threatens to drag in the middle when the metal mole, made of unobtanium, leaves the surface behind. There is humour, mostly intentional I'm sure, but the mood is such that this can be viewed as seriously as any such ludicrous Jules Verne-type adventure. I have a feeling that it will improve with a second viewing, which is always going to help when you didn't initially know if you were meant to be laughing with, or at, the cast. The effects are good, but cheesy, and the tension is high in parts, the best scene undoubtedly being the pigeons in Trafalgar Square going bananas. 6 out of 10. If there is a crowd of you deliberating about what to see outside the multiplex, I should take a leaf out of Hilary Swank's book, and say: 'We're going in'. You'll have fun, I bet.</fullReview>

I pretty much agree with that assessment. As such, it is a very entertaining movie to watch. There were several minor problems with the story and/or how it was presented; but the show was entertaining enough that I could overlook them (i.e. too much camera time on disasters (e.g. wacko birds), untested craft works first time, unpowered ascent at the end).The major problem with the movie was the whales. Yes, whales. Why do whales have to come and save the day for the protagonists at the end??? Why couldn't there have been some sort of battery powered emergency beacon that they could have used to signal the rescue ships? I guarantee you that whales wouldn't give a rat's you-know-what about another chunk of metal laying around in the ocean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you'll likely die from laughter, "The Core" and the recently released dreck "Dreamcatcher" are easily two of the most laughably awful big budget flicks in the past 10 years, but during "The Core" I certainly didn't feel for the characters or ever consider one frame of this good at any point.(Possible Spoilers) First off, the plot has to do with the Earth's core suddenly coming to a halt. This will ultimately cause the end of the world in about a year. This coming disaster needs to be stopped, so the government enlists the help of a college professor (Aaron Eckhart), a NASA pilot (Hilary Swank) a cocky scientist (Stanley Tucci) and finally a nutty scientist (Delroy Lindo) who has developed a metal that can withstand the intense pressure of the Earth's core, and he has the plans to build a ship out of it all he needs is $15 billion (or maybe it's $50 billion, I couldn't really tell), which the government gladly pays and thus the construction begins. Now I'm not much of a science wiz, but it seems pretty unlikely any type of scientist would be able to develop a metal that could withstand the intense pressure of the Earth's mantle and especially the core itself. But then again any disaster film has plenty of sizeable leaps in logic, which can provide some good, if somewhat cheap fun, ("Armageddon" comes to mind).However, "The Core" is such an obvious and badly acted movie that any possible fun is washed away in the first 30 minutes, then the movie goes on for about another 2 hours, which just becomes a major exercise in patience after the first hour. Now onto the acting, Eckhart is laughable as Dr. Keyes, however it's not his fault, Swank is just stone-faced as Major Rebecca 'Beck' Childs, Lindo is just there as Dr. Edward Brazleton and Tucci chews up the scenery (if you want to call it that) as Dr. Conrad Zimsky. Of and there's also Tcheky Karyo (the French soldier from "The Patriot") and DJ Qualls ("The New Guy"). The special effects are pretty lousy, especially during the shuttle landing sequence in the first 20 minutes of the movie and the whole movie seems way overdone, while not accomplishing much at the same time. Overall, "The Core" is a disaster (literally and figuratively) and will hopefully put the dying "world in peril" or "disaster" genre to rest until a decent movie can be made or even a fun one. 0 stars.</fullReview>

I admit it: I and a half dozen friends caught a matinee knowing that it would not be very good, but since we're all comedians we knew we could get a few laughs.

Then the movie follows some other predictable paths to the core of the Earth where some other predictable things happen. Then it gets predictable and ends.SPOILER ALERT! Like you need them...

I knew in the first 20 minutes which two of the characters were gonna be alive in the end!

		<fullReview>Yes, this is a special effects movie, which means that it is probably better to see on a big screen, but it really isn't worth the money. Some decent acting, with some mild humor at certain points throughout the movie are not enough to make me recomend this movie. The dialogue wasn't extreamly cheesy, but was pretty bad at times. Nothing really stands out in the film, not even the special effects, which you would expect from a movie like this. So, if you have to kill time, then by all means see this film, but if you are looking for a disaster flick, this should be nowhere near your first choice. Watch Deep Impact or Armagedon (And I didn't really like these movies either, but they are better than the Core), or better yet the Towering Inferno or the Posiedan Adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure science fiction that stretches the bounds of the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel the need to defend this movie. I liked it. With that said, I do have to admit that it is no Star Wars (any of them, which, by the way, I hated. Yes, all of them). It's certainly not even Star Trek, but it is a unique concept. It was somewhat formulaic with the disasters that befall the crew and the sacrifices they make, but I was entertained. It would have been helpful to know more of the backstory. Let's face it Star Wars has PLENTY of story. The visual effects were awesome and the surround sound in my theater even had the floor vibrating so that helped, but I still never felt like I was actually there. It seemed more like I was watching it from the outside, like a news program. Considering the inevitability of the main concept, it's helpful to think that someone's thinking about the end of the world from this end. After all, why do you think we're spending so much creative and actual energy in the exploration of outer space?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absurd and fun 85 million dollar Roger Corman flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally can't stand big budget Hollywood films, but I thoroughly enjoyed The Core. It's an 85 million dollar Roger Corman flick. Bad acting, unbelievable premise, Hollywood computer hacker-type guy, generic kinda-bad military guys...everyone knew it was a bad film when they shot it and everyone played it nudge-nudge wink-wink. Because of that I ended up laughing more and gasping in mock shock more than at any other movie I've seen lately (barring the Rings). A great example of this humor is during a super-storm in Rome as lightning is destroying the city. Someone along the line of producing this movie gave the thumbs up to have a lightning bolt POV shot, and we end up following a bolt of lightning from the sky into the Coliseum! Absolutely worthless and unoriginal, and the audience let out a big guffaw with the scene, but not really at the scene.I'll give it credit for another thing: Hillary Swank's character had a reason to be there, and it wasn't that she was a woman. There was no 'we were once lovers' and no 'but now I need a man to save the day'. She plays a navigator and any male actor could have played that role without changing a thing but her name. That's something you seldom see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Armageddon Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm reminded of an episode from the first season of "Futurama" where Fry suggests that people don't like to watch intelligent stuff because it makes them feel stupid. This film is an unfortunate testament to that statement. Would it totally kill the ratings to include some basis of hard core scientific fact in a sci-fi movie? Shoot out $1000 to a professor at a university somewhere and get his buy-in - would that blow the $85 million budget on the movie?Let's say that the Earth's core does actually spin, an electromagnetic weapon somehow has caused it to stop, an eccentric doctor has invented a substance that can withstand the pressures and heat of the mantle and the core, and that "men in black" actually walk around recruiting high profile scientists to save the world on occasion. (I'll give you all that.) Logical and scientific black-holes in the plot abound. For example:1. Dr. Brazelton, in 20 years in the desert, has not once contacted the department of energy regarding "unobtainium" which can withstand hundreds of times the amount of thermodynamic abuse as what our existing engineering standards can produce?2. Where did the government secure $50 billion from in THREE MONTHS to build the ship and the simulator, and why are we deploying NASA crews to pilot it? Wouldn't a submarine crew be much more adept? How about ANY military crew that does not scream at and bicker with each other at the helm?3. This film has utterly the WEAKEST excuse for a computer hacker role in any movie I've ever seen. Pretend that I'm the most notorious computer hacker known to the world - are you going to let ME sit at mission ops in a government facility during a mission to save the world?4. Why is the ship built in segments? If you lost one segment wouldn't you pretty much be dead anyway? Alternateively, why would you build more ship than you need?5. Are plutonium cells built in ISO regulated containers, such that you can just pull one out of a nuclear reaction engine and put it in a nuclear weapon? And if the heat-&gt;power thing was so obvious, why did the ship even use a nuclear reactor? Does anyone else have a problem with the overly simple "just touch the wires against the ship's skin and the reaction takes place" theory?6. 1 is not a prime number. Read a math book before you start spouting scientific cinema at us.I'm sure this will be the kind of film that will be first released on a bare-bones DVD and then a special edition DVD with 6 commentary tracks, 2 hours of removed footage, and 6 hours of special features. It is just pitiful that with the kind of movie budgets studios put out today, that there is such little attention to a movie's foundation, and it is insulting that Hollywood tries to appeal to viewers on such an unintelligent level.After Armageddon, I honestly believe this film is nothing more than an experiment to see what minimal level of writing Hollywood has to include in a movie to make it viewable to the public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Core" is a fun popcorn flick with a strong cast, bad Hollywood science, and cool special effects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really expecting to hate "The Core". The reason was because I don't like movies that feature bad science. Every film requires a certain degree of "suspension of disbelief", but films like "Armageddon", "The Core", and other disaster flicks all present realistic scenarios then try to get you to buy science that even a 5th grader could tell you is bogus. For example, the shuttle would never survive a crash landing like it does in the movie. You couldn't stop or start the Earth's core with any of today's technology. You couldn't create a suit that withstands 9000 degree temperatures. However, "The Core" makes you slowly accept the outrageous in a way that when the really unrealistic stuff starts happening, you're willing to go along for the ride. Like "Journey To The Center Of The Earth", it's all presented in a fantastic enough way that you're OK with the bad Hollywood science. After all, any movie that features a mad scientist can't be taken too seriously.What really makes the movie work is the cast. If they had used anyone else for the characters of this movie, it simply wouldn't have worked. None of them are big names, but they're all faces you recognize. Delroy Lindo is eccentric as the rogue scientist Dr. Edward Brazleton. When his character gets that mad look about him, you believe he could build a ship like this. Stanley Tucci is over the top as Dr. Conrad Zimsky. He's so arrogant and ruthless that you can't help but boo him during the film. Tchéky Karyo somehow manages to make the French lovable as Sergei Leveque. Aaron Eckhart brings a wild enthusiasm as the scientist Dr. Josh Keyes. Bruce Greenwood is heroic and wise as Col. Robert Iverson. Hilary Swank, in a rather muted performance, is good as Maj. Rebecca 'Beck' Childs. DJ Qualls steals the show early on as Rat even though his character has no real reason to be in the movie. All together the cast makes the characters lovable and believable.The effects are pretty good in the movie. It's interesting to see their interpretation of the Earth's core. Most of what is seen is through an X-ray sort of device that is surprisingly effective. Another scene takes place in a massive geode that they crash land into. That was a particularly nice touch. Another fun scene takes place when they're first diving through the ocean into the Marinas Trench. They encounter whales that chase the ship and it looks pretty cool though it's outrageous. The real highlight of the film is the space shuttle crash. The scenes look realistic and are pretty intense. Overall a nice job on the effects.If you're looking for a popcorn flick that's a throwback to B-movie disaster films, this should deliverWhile I was willing to accept a vast majority of the bogus science, there were a few moments where I had a hard time swallowing what they were serving. Why is it that nobody else in the world was able to figure out what was going on? If it was a global disaster, you'd think someone would have a clue beyond a professor at a little university. The "death by cosmic rays", while cool looking, was also a bit over the top. After all, why don't astronauts get cooked when they go out of the Earth's atmosphere? And would dozens of people in a very small area really all have pacemakers? They made it seem like 20% of the population had them. The final way they save the day is also a bit silly. Whether or not you forgive it will be up to you.I'm glad they kept the shuttle crash scene in the film. It looked cool, was intense, and helped the story. However, that didn't make it any easier to watch. Someone in Texas, I suppose would be a little more sensitive to it, but seeing the shuttle about to crash over a city is a little unsettling.Is the film silly? Yes. Does it have bad Hollywood science? Yes. Is it a good weekend escape from reality? Yes. I think you'll find it's worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes "The Core" looked trashy in its trailers and yes it is a pretty trashy movie. If you are a person that particularly enjoys the gung-ho 'save the world' genre then you still might be interested in this feature. Hillary Swank has no place in this movie that is teeming with B-grade actors turning in B-grade performances. She is utterly wasted in a role that should have never been hers in the first place. The Special Effects ofcourse were the high point of the film, and lived up to expectation. The direction on the other hand, lagged and dragged, and made it painful to watch the entire movie. The movie isnt paced well, and that as we all know is critical to action flicks, especially of this type. Thankfully there are no love angles, and the creative audacity is kept to a minimum. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ARMAGEDDON in Reverse!!! (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would happen if the earth's core just one day decided to stop spinning? Well, THE CORE answers that questions. Appeareantly people would die unexplainable deaths in synchronized unison, birds would lose all sense of direction, and gigantic waves of electric lightening would hover in the sky. Basically, everything as we know it would stop working.THE CORE is a B movie plot, not to mention the exact opposite of ARMAGEDDON. This time instead of flying out into space to land on an asteroid hurtling towards earth at 400,000mph, a crew of unlikely people travel to the center of the earth to jump start the core and save the world. Ok, I can go with that!Of course this is not a a movie trying to scientifically explain what a trip like this would be like, but the movie is so far fetched that you would think they just took advantage of every possible extreme they could. Earth's core has just stopped spinning and what is the likelihood that someone has been working on a machine to travel at depths that deep. Not likely, but ok they managed to do it in ARMAGEDDON, I will go with it!The real problem of this movie arises when the obvious does not play out. Characters come face to face with hot lava that in reality would sizzle through anything. The team is comprised of a smart but simple college prof, a hoakey and greedy scientist who would not last a minute in a venture of this matter, and a Russian dude. The only qualified person on this mission is the driver of the ship. Come on NASA, would you really send this sort of crew to save the world. Yet ARMAGEDDON's crew were not exactly astronauts of the year.Finally, the special effects are interesting but not all that great. At least ARMAGEDDON had stimulating visual effects and that is what made the movie. THE CORE does have some vivid city destruction scenes; however, they only take up about 10 minutes of this 2+hr movie. I think we can all realize how this movie stole from ARMAGEDDON and if your still not convinced, you should know that all the characters draw straws to see who will stay behind and sacrifice their life for all the others; sound familiar?!?!To wrap up, THE CORE is nothing new, but if you can get past all the falibility and just watch the movie for what it is, it is a good experience and fun never the less.While it does not reach the quality of ARMAGEDDON, THE CORE is still a ride and thus rates 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a sci-fi fan of the 1960s movie "Fantastic Voyage" you'll find this journey somewhat entertaining. Both films are about as silly and utterly implausible, but still OK adventure yarns. I really enjoyed the bouncy pace of this movie, which zip along with as much momentum as its earth-driller craft. Just be sure to throw away any concern over science accuracy, which is ignored far worse than that other Save-the-Earth tall-tale "Armageddon." The script is a bit of a self-parody, whether intentionally or not. One of my favorite lines is when the "terranauts" step out of their earth-driller ship, beneath presumably a zillion tons of pressure, and say "gee, I'm glad out pressure suits work!" doh! It's also a piece of poor timing to show a space shuttle crashing early in the film(so soon after the Columbia disaster)but fundamental to the story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great 1950s SF flick! If you're literate enough to remember John Campbell, you'll remember how he championed the kind of plot where science and intelligent heroics intertwine to solve the problem at hand. THE CORE could have been a Campbell-approved plot.Soap opera sideshows are minimized. We know enough about the characters to get the plot going. No meaningless sidetrips in needless romance (no time for that, for one thing!); this makes the flick a nice change from monstrosities like ARMAGEDDON.One thing that changed-- the hacker's demands. In the original TV spot, he demanded Star Trek tapes. In the current spot, he demanded Sponge Bob tapes. But in the flick he demands Xena tapes. I wonder how many more tapes he demanded?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A special effects spectacle. Worthy of seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie, "The Core", and was surprised about the special effects. The movie is worth watching just for the effects. The best effect was involving the space shuttle.I also saw "Independence Day" which was just special effects, and not much of a plot. That said, I now compare "The Core", which in addition to great special effects has a good story line.The movie was sort of a re-make of 2 other movies. "At the Earth's Core" and "Journey to the Center of the Earth". The plot in "The Core" and the previous movies were about the same quality. That quality being good. The big difference is "The Core" moves faster.Is this scenario, story possible? Not hardly but then again when was the last time you believed in civilizations living within the Earth's crust. Confused? Well you'll have to rent Journey and At the Earth's Core to get the gist. Just make sure you order a couple of coffees or cokes for Journey. It is longer and somewhat boring. Of course if you rent the video you can fast forward through a few parts in the first hour.Back to "The Core". It was like the producers saw "At the Earth's Core" and made this version even more exciting. At the Earth's Core is still one of my favorite sci-fi films.If you love sci-fi, you must see "The Core". Great acting, great special effects, good story. The kind of movie that the Academy Awards love to snub. If I was on the Academy, I would certainly nominate this one for Special Effects. Of course we have only seen the beginning of the "Big Summer Movies". It's possible "The Hulk" will have even better effects.Even so, I give this movie a 9 out of 10.My only suggestion is I would rather see movies without heavy duty politics.Hillary's character was just a bit over the top. An I am better than men character, stronger, smarter etc... which sends the message that men are mindless idiots. Come on Hollywood you can build up both women in the world without having to tear men down.The anti-corporate, anti-government and anti-tech concepts need to go away too. This movie showed that government, business and high tech was all wicked and bad.That said, I still liked this movie and you should all go see it, especially all you sci-fi fans.Thank you!</fullReview>

Unfortunately the movie just doesnt take advantage of the imagination that could have been used to make the core more exciting than it was, also the characters could of been developed more, I liked armaggeddon a lot because the characters are characters you like and you are sad when they die and suprised too because the first time u watch it you don't know who's gonna live or die. IN this movie right off the back you know who lives or dies and when someone dies you dont give a hoot its like whatever.

		<fullReview>This is one film you should not see without wearing Depends. You'll wet your pants with laughter at this silly, sappy, pseudo-scientific saga with its senseless script. (How's that for alliteration?) It breaks my heart to see actors like Hilary Swank (Boys Don't Cry), Aaron Eckhart (Possession) and Stanley Tucci (A Midsummer Night's Dream) having to recite such fatuous dialogue with a straight face. In Ms. Swank's case, boys don't cry -- but she should.Aside from the ridiculous story and script, I resent the blatant product placements. Within minutes of the opening credits, we are treated to, not one, but two ads for Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Oh, and keep your eyes open for the split-second flash of the Nike swoosh.Parts of "The Core" just scream for audience participation a la Rocky Horror. At one point, someone lands an uppercut on Stanley Tucci's chin. I could help blurting out, "Thanks -- I needed that!" And later in the film, the score was so reminiscent of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I started doing the boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom of "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" (also the theme of the "Wings of Man" commercial).It's ironic that the craft drilling its way into the Earth's core is named Virgil. Like Dante's Virgil, "The Core" leads us into two hours of pure hell.Perhaps there should be a sequel. They could always call it "Destiny's Child". (If you've seen the movie, you'll understand.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is science really that good? First we have to recognize there is a problem. Next, we have to figure out what the problem is. Then we have to determine if the problem can be resolved and if it can, how? Who is so good as to determine the earth's core has stopped spinning because of an unexplained electrical storm in California and an attack of birds gone wild in Rome. Who would just happen to have a vessel, named Vergil, that can actually surf through the earth's core of over 9000 degrees without disintegrating. What team of the worlds far most scientific, master minds would volunteer to journey to the center of the earth to jump start the core and what computer geek could stop a top military project dead in it's tracks within minutes of a request? Someone has an overactive imagination and was able to put it in writing and tastefully present it on the big screen.I must say, Jon Amiel did an excellent job of directing this movie into a suspenseful, action packed, science fiction thriller. I was entertained every step of this fantasy of a movie. A lot of research went into this story - it's almost believable as numbers are calculated, meetings are held by top brass, and billions are spent to turn a 10 year project into a 3 month project. Their plan to restart the earth's core even has a contingency plan called Destiny, which could turn out to be the death of the planet or our hero.The success of The core depends more on God than on science as we don't have the know how, equipment or power to deliver the resolution outlined in this movie. The special effects were excellent and the acting superb. The Core turned out to be a better movie than I thought it would be. 2 thumbs up for imagination and direction. 2 thumbs down if they think we bought it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some possible spoilers.... Ok, so did you hear the one about the 5 actors riding a phallic underground spaceship armed with nuclear warheads...? I won't say "The Core" is pure junk, because I like Hilary--really--but this film had too many inexcusable flaws to be saved even by Ms. Swank's amazingly durable lip-gloss. Basically, "The Core" tried to be either a sophisticated science-fiction flick or a kick-butt, feel-good action film ala "Volcano" or "Twister"-- and it failed miserable at both missions. This mess of bizarre peusdo-science and predictable outcomes seemed cobbled together from a clip-book for cheesy science-fiction movies--minus the gratifying shots of scantily clad women. The harrowing moments were disturbing without being exhilarating, the characters were stock without being charming and the story line? It was pointlessly obtuse. Do screenwriters have such a dearth of realistic scientific scenarios that they have to resort to the old "thingamajing unspinning the Earth's gravitational gazinktagzoink leading to a potentially deadly schpilkus in the whatsamabob" plot-line? If this crap had been built around a solid sub-plot, or perhaps more shots of Aaron's Eckhart's naked chest, that might have been fine, but there was nothing else going on here that justified demanding such a sheer level of disbelief on the part of any audience, least of all a suburban one. My friend aptly described the special effects as reminiscent of "The Miracle of Life", complete with endless, repeating shots of a snake-like ship plunging into a huge, throbbing, red placenta-thing. And what do these filmmakers have against Rome? What do they have against birds? Who were those people in the crowd scenes who were briefly followed then forgotten? But back to Hilary. Throughout the film, her hair, nails and lips were flawless--I don't know if the elegant Dr. Zimsky was responsible for make-up, but dammit, she held it together though the worst of times. Go. My favorite line; "It's the Whales, they're singing!"-- it's a great line to keep as an inside joke for those who actually paid money to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As end-of-the-world movie scenarios go, the core of the earth ceasing to spin as the result of top-secret seismic weapon testing is pretty unbelievable, but the solution devised to rectify this problem proves to be even more preposterous: a team of scientists are assembled to construct and pilot a craft capable of 'drilling' to the centre of the Earth, where a nuclear bomb can be detonated to set the core spinning again. Fortunately for the future of mankind, the technology required for such a machine already exists and a desperate mission is soon underway.Although this is one seriously idiotic movie, I have a sneaking admiration for its creators: you need some serious chutzpah to even pitch such a dumb idea, let alone actually get it made! What's even more amazing than the fact that The Core got a green light at all is that, for a while, the audacious, logic-free nature of the script even seems to work in its favour, delivering cheesy thrills and spills during some fun indicators of the impending apocalypse (the space shuttle landing in LA's storm drains; people dropping dead when their pacemakers quit; pigeons going crazy in London; a destructive lightning storm in Rome).Sadly, once the action finally heads underground, matters become far less interesting. The sight of nondescript blobs of CGI swirling around the craft soon becomes seriously monotonous, and there's a limit to the variety of obstacles that can be introduced miles beneath the planet's surface; one by one, the crew do the predictable 'heroic sacrifice' thing, strictly by-the-numbers disaster movie nonsense that is extremely repetitive and pretty dull. By the time the team (or what's left of them) have reached their target to carry out the final part of their explosive plan, you'll be yearning for them to just ditch their nuclear payload, get the hell out, and for the film to end (whether the mission is a success or not!).That would be too easy though... instead, we discover more about the government cover-up of 'Project Destini' (yawn), are subject to even more corny (or should that be 'core-ny'?) displays of heroism, suffer mind numbing plot contrivances (the craft generates energy from heat and sounds like a whale?very convenient, as it happens), and see waaay too much of bloody D.J. Qualls, who plays the irritating super-hacker helping our team from the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had so much fun watching this..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cmon.. it's as plausible as any R.Emmerich disaster movie and just as entertaining. Witch is exactly my point: mostly unbelievable, at times ridiculously stupid... but the more it gets stupid, the more fun it gets! And not in an unintentional way! It has a mini-romance, lots of disasters, tons of good sci-fi and good action. Acting is more than decent form this pretty strong cast. I think i have watched it like 3 times now simply for its entertaining value, Believe me... even if it needs some pretty hard "suspension of disbelief" in this one, it so geek fun and entertaining you wont even notice how absurd it sometimes is. Rent it / Buy it. Will make a fun 2h!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, this movie makes no sense. The core of the earth would never stop spinning, a team of scientists would never make it to it in just a couple of days, and a nuclear bomb would probably not solve the problem. But this is a sci-fi movie. Notice the little -fi, which stands for FICTION. Let's take a famous example, Planet Of The Apes. Do you really think that astronauts would ever find a mysterious planet and later realize it's the EARTH in the FUTURE and it's overtaken by APES?!? Come on, that could NEVER happen!This movie is very entertaining, has really good acting (especially Aaron Eckhart's performance, he's incredible) and also a really good epic movie score which I think makes the movie about 348% better. I don't think you should be whining about this movie, science fiction movies are supposed to entertain you, not educate you! Give The Core a break!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very silly action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An awe-inspiringly silly sci-fi thriller which squeezes itself inbetween The Abyss and Deep Impact on the genre's library shelf. The earth's in grave danger because the core has stoppezzz... zzz... well, it hardly matters really. All we need is a double-pronged drama: a hazardous race against time; and a baddie, or at least an intractable difference in opinion. This film comes up with both, serving the first with imaginative conceits and CGI and the second with Stanley Tucci.Tucci is very important to this film. A grandstanding slimeball called Zimsky, he's hectoring, self-interested and very funny. The film makes no attempt to conceal his having a parallel agenda on the mission. Happily, though it plays out according to the studio handbook on such blockbusters Tucci never lets his character get boxed in by this. All the rest of the cast are very good, Eckhardt particularly matching Tucci in playing the film with his tongue in his cheek. Nicely designed and cut the film thrills and I can remember it just long enough to write this. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure. Earth is in trouble yet again, but this time--instead of intergalactic woes--it appears the liquid which rotates around the planet's inner-core is no longer spinning, causing havoc for the globe (and an eventual breakdown of the shield which protects us from boiling to death). The Pentagon (apparently headed up by the most obstinate Armed Forces General in recent memory) recruits a wily, brilliant desert hermit to design a ship that will drill down to the Earth's inner core, taking him on the journey, as well as two Air Force pilots from NASA, two professors and the foremost authority of Geomagnetics. Perhaps Geophysicists would be the best audience to test the movie's scientific b.s. factor--but, if it's far-fetched, so what? It's a lot of fun just the way it is, and the camaraderie which develops between our heroes is not only surprising, but genuinely affecting. The special effects are quite admirable (with the possible exception of the destruction sequence in Rome, which feels hasty and plugged in). I'm not sure exactly where Space Station control-room engineer Alfre Woodard fits in here (she looks uncertain, too), and DJ Qualls is given far too much screen-time as a delinquent whiz-kid from M.I.T. addicted to Hot Pockets (ha ha), but the interaction on-board ship is bracing and orchestrated with a great deal of heart and humanity. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Core is a film that would have us quaking in our boots had it actually had something to say; it is also a film that would have us entertained if it weren't for the ludicrous scenes of mindless action and brainless logic. Yes, The Core is the filmic definition of brainless, disposable entertainment; the epitome of all things wrong with blockbusters these days and the reason you're going to get a child aged fourteen or below into a cinema in order to give them the feeling that they're seeing something 'epic'.Rather than be a 'disaster movie' of sorts, The Core more resembles a 'movie disaster' since we're not even given a political slant on the reasons the action in this film have to take place. People will be quick to point in the direction of The Day After Tomorrow, a film that came a year after this one and a film about global warming directed by a man who is something of an expert at portraying cataclysmic events that destroy the Western world (see Independence Day and Godzilla). So, with a magnetic field hovering around the Earth that one day decides to go all cock-eyed; it's up to a team of people to try and kick start the Earth's core that has stopped working due to this field not working all of a sudden. Let me just say that this film probably has about a million and two things wrong with it; something I am not going to do is merely list them all here but the most glaring will certainly get the nod.Firstly, character portrayal and characterisation: The experts of the subject matter visit Dr. Ed Brazzleton (Lindo); an African-American who lives on his own in the desert, in the middle of nowhere and yet has been spending the bulk of his life creating a drill of sorts that creates a perfect circle when activated at a rocky wall. It seems too perfect that this sort of technology is around and within days of becoming active thanks to a government loan ? the drill is also something the American government (or anyone else, naturally) couldn't come up with themselves in order to deal with the problem. My attention is drawn to Alien vs. Predator; a film released two years later: one such scene before they go down into the icy Antarctic pyramid has someone remark at the entrance: "It's a prefect circle; no one could've made this entrance with tools or drills on this planet." Well, give Ed Brazzleton a call next time.Then comes the horrific stereotyping of a computer nerd named 'Rat' Finch (Qualls) who himself contributes to one of the film's more unbelievable scenes when he gives one man a free service on his phone by blowing into a chewing gum wrapper up against the phone's mechanics ? a pitiful and accidentally humorous scene trying to get across the 'genius' of the character; again, do the American's (or any other country) not have anyone else? This brings me onto the actual portrayal of the Americans ? the American government seem to be in charge of everything with no mention of any other country; indeed when we do get to see abroad America the scenes consist of Rome getting obliterated and London coming in with its fair share of punishment ? credit here to the poster on the message boards who noticed that the Coliseum is made out of stone and thus; wouldn't have been struck by lightening. The scenes of America in peril seem added to create a counter balance so that no one would notice but it's all tongue in cheek since the shots of Rome and London are not required: if it is going to be America saving the world (with some very brief references to France in the form of Dr. Leveque (Karyo); but don't worry, he isn't around too long) then keep America in peril so that the whole war with the weather stays 'USA vs. the elements' and don't drag anyone else into it. It seems strange that director Jon Amiel, born in England, would agree to include such a thing in his film and portray every other nation as 'weak' and 'one that needs saving'.What especially reminded me that this was a brainless, dumb film was its attention to consistency. The team of absolute no-brainers, supported by their hacker cliché nerd on the surface, go down into the depths in a machine that is designed to detach its parts if one of them becomes breached so that nobody fries. My question is: what if one of the middle hulls becomes breached? Would it disconnect itself because if it did, any other hull behind it would also have to become detached. It just seems so sloppy that they would assume this wouldn't happen ? as it is; only the back hull at any particular moment in time ever gets breached. After the usual suspects have had their moment of glory, it's left to the hero and the herald to 'save the day' so to speak but wait a minute: it seems ground level have an ace: something called 'DESTINI' (It actually changes later on to 'Destiny' when Finch attempts to hack in) which will achieve what they're down there for anyway ? that was handy, why did they even go? Yes, The Core will infuriate and confuse simultaneously as it weaves in and out of un-believability; leaving a nasty taste in the mouth. Ironic how most of the more complicated things in this film are explained at a very basic level to highly ranked experts; now the screenwriter must explain to me exactly what he was thinking when he came up with this nonsense; and I won't accept an explanation with a peach and an aerosol can.</fullReview>

Of course if you were any good in school you'll know that some stuff isn't possible (but really, nobody knows - a lot of impossible things tend to happen), at least not in this Millennnium, but...WHAT IF? It IS interesting, it IS funny, it GIVES you plausible explanation What, When, Why and What we (they) gotta do to prevent the catastrophe (something some other movies lack). Plus it is all action-filled (starting from the VERY beginning, i absolutely loved first scene, it draws attention, all right!), no abracadabras but something substantial to explain things that were happening, and very creative and funny! I loved everything about this movie, impossibility AND possibility, story line, side plots, dialogues, beautiful shots, inner core and my favorite part - the empty spots!

		<fullReview>From start to finish, this film proudly defies logic in a very Flash Gordon fashion, and even occasionally tries to nod in the direction of Granpappy Jules Verne. Unfortunately, as the story also manages to contradict a whole heap of Physical Laws, it pretty well trips itself up and breaks its own nose.And that's what this film is - a big nasal hemorrhage. You can even see that thought in the actors' eyes.However, some of the special effects are really pretty cool, the Core Express itself is very cute and somehow Deco-like, and most everyone apart from Hilary Swank acts competently, at least. Hilary just looks and sounds painfully uncomfortable. And so she should.A special mention here for the wonderful Stanley Tucci, who combines his usual 'I'm the guy everyone wants to punch' role with a very funny take on Dr Strangelove.But in the end, this film is just too, too stupid for words. So I'll stop right there. Except to say it isn't AS stupid as Day After Tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Core" surprised me. I was expecting a sub-Emmerich disaster movie (and I HATED "The Day After Tomorrow") and I actually found myself wanting the movie's Terranauts to succeed after the first hour.Despite a glut of CGI (how else are you going to show a boring machine in the most hostile environment this side of the sun's surface?) there was enough science and humanity in "The Core" to grant it a sort of classic status. The movie harks back to 60s sci-fi gems like "Fantastic Voyage" in terms of concept and plot and it's a brave attempt.Unfortunately it's let down by odd details (such as London pigeons that sound like the monsters from "Pitch Black")and the fact that the script is a sort of underground re-tread of "Armageddon". However, the cast never lose their grip on reality and treat the script with respect, making "The Core" a workmanlike and reasonably entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Core will not be among the top 1000 films of all time. So what? It is a different twist on the disaster films that had not been much done before (unless you include the much inferior "Deep Core") It is a good steady film with workable performances from a less than stellar cast, but these people are believable even if the premise of the movie is not. I am an easily bored movie goer and it really takes a good film to keep me in my seat all the way through. This film did exactly that. The dialog was snappy with tons of irony and sarcasm, and the people made it work. Stanley Tucci stood out as the arrogant world famous scientist in love with himself.

The Core has a more than capable cast, a seriously flawed plot, tonnes of action, a cheesy script and a small dose of Drama.If you like to pick holes in movies then you will hate this, but if like me you like to enjoy a silly fun-filled action film from time to time then you just might think this is great.7/10</fullReview>

The premises reveals that in their endless tinkering with defense systems, the latest device created by the US called "Destiny" has inadvertently slowed the Earth's core and is now in danger of stopping it altogether. When that happens, the end of the world is imminent. Although there are several notable actors who imbue this story with adventure and excitement, it is Aaron 'Eckhart, as Josh Keyes, Tcheky Karyo, as Serge Leveque, Bruce Greenwood, as Cmdr. Iverson, Stanley Tucci, as Zimsky, Delroy Lindo, as "Braz" and DJ Qualls as "Rat" who transform it into a classic.

To be honest, a lot of movies are simply expectation games. I went into this film this evening expecting nothing, and yet was entertained.There are six basic ratings I use when deciding to see a movie. 1) Going to catch it in the theater. 2) Going to catch it on pay-per-view. 3) Going to rent it at the video store. 4) Going to watch it on cable. 5) Might watch it if there's nothing else on. 6) Pay me, and I'll watch it.This was definitely a good "wait until it's on cable" movie. Don't expect a lot going into it, and you'll have a good time. And nice to see Hilary Swank in her role as a space shuttle pilot. Hers was definitely the best role in the film.</fullReview>

And it has better special effects than its predecessors. To over-analyze this film is ludicrous and not worth the exertion.

The science blabber takes up 95% of the dialog and you never really get to know the characters. This is how the movie is built upScience talk --&gt; Nice effects --&gt; Problem --&gt; Science talk on how to solve the problem --&gt; Problem solved. Now, you would've though that after the problem was solved, that there be a bit of dialog that fleshes out the character, but nooooooooo. Instead it says "2 hours later" or "24 hours later". I think I saw a "35 hours later" and then it continues in the way I just described. They could've had real good character development, because there is space for it in the movie, during these "24 hours later" periods, but they skip it and jump to the next problem.Unfortunately, all the *mildly* interesting characters die (which you knew anyway). This movie also has possibly the greatest *smack-your-head-against-a-brickwall* moment I've ever seen. The hacker Rat (D.J Qualls) who's job is the hack the internet so word won't spread of what happening and people won't panic over it. Of course this is a disaster flick, so there must be some destruction. So there's the little problem Rome being annihilated and the Golden Gate Bridge collapsing and if the media in TV and newspapers were still working (as you see in the movie) what was then the point with this character? Great script writing I tell ya...Disappointing, even for a disaster-flick. Nice effects though, the Crystal Sea being the best part.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to see it or not. On one hand, it sounded cool. A sci-fi disaster movie where we go to the center of the Earth. (And there's no jungle down there. Sorry, Jules Verne.) On the other hand, it sounded too unbelievable. How can we build a ship that can withstand the heat and pressure of the Earth's core? What kind of "perils" could we expect to encounter down there? And we're planning to restart the core with...what else...nukes! But I finally saw it at a friend's house, and I loved it. Even my parents liked it (LIKED...not loved). If you put aside the unbelievable elements of the story and listen to your spirit of adventure, it becomes an enjoyable movie. There was a lot of good acting from the whole cast. Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank were a cute couple on screen. Stanley Tucci was an egomaniac and a real dirtbag, but he redeemed himself in the end, and we all got a laugh out of it.Their ship is called Virgil and its crewmen are called 'terranauts'. Terranauts, that sounds cool. But they probably won't be able to use that word again.This movie is not for everyone, but if you like a good sci-fi action adventure, give this one a try... and remember to keep an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must be out of touch, judging from the negative comments here. But I enjoyed this film tremendously. It's a genre film, so you have to accept a certain amount of fantasy and I thought they did it credibly enough to provide edge-of-the-seat excitement with no dull moments or sidebars. I've found so many recent sci-fi, end-of-the-world successes obnoxious or insulting enough in some aspects that they really marred my enjoyment. THE CORE was a hit all the way: the writing, the direction, the characters and performances (including hunky Arron Eckhart making a tough role work well), the cinematography (which was interestingwithout being too self-conscious), and the special effects, which onlyoccasionally were transparent. Given the ludicrous aspects of THE DAY AFTERTOMORROW, the mind-numbing editing of Armageddon, the kindergarten,stupid characters of INDEPENDENCE DAY. et.al. that audiences are willing toaccept, I don't understand why THE CORE wasn't a bigger hit. I thought itactually avoided clichés, or got around them graciously and believably. I got the full frame version for my mom and am going to buy the wide-screen version for myself to enjoy again sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterous fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the most preposterous scientific basis I've ever seen, this is one heck of an exciting fantasy adventure. Totally unbelievable, it still succeeds in boggling the mind with its sheer audacity of a fantastic journey to the molten center of the Earth.Scientifically, there are *so* many things wrong with this. The climatic effects of a lost planetary magnetic field would be nowhere near as dramatic as they claim here (they torch a peach to demonstrate what will happen to the Earth!). There would be a rise in UV radiation and a few other hazards, but it wouldn't wipe out all life, not even close, nor make the oceans boil.And the way they steer a vessel into the molten core is also just ridiculous. They might as well have gone into the sun. And the way they restore the rotation of the Earth's core is equally suspect. And then they suddenly discover that the vessel's "unobtainium" hull can be used to power it - well, if that were the case, why did it ever need a nuclear reactor to fuel it?! And the Destiny Project; how the hell did *that* work?! There are so many gaping plot holes. Yet, despite this it is still a fun movie.I grade it a 7 out of 10, because it IS an entertaining romp, but it could easily have been much more so. It's too bad they tried to play it straight, as if the science was anywhere near halfway acceptable. Many of the actors - esp. Hilary Swank - were far too serious for the material. Instead, there should have been swaggering, cussing, cardboard heroes with plenty of self-irony. This could have been a great, modern-day Flash Gordon style romp. Stanley Tucci's devious, self-centered Dr. Zimsky was right on target; the rest of the movie-making crew and cast would have done well to take some cues from him.Or, they should have set the movie 50 or 100 years in the future. This might have made the events depicted far more believable. Setting it in the present certainly does not work.Something of a wasted opportunity, but definitely still worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like an apple core, throw it away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Core" is a modern version of the disaster, end of the world movie genre of pre-CGI days, but is not much better than the B flics of the 50's and 60's. It is corny and extremely far fetched, and many elements of the film make no sense whatsoever. POSSIBLE SPOILERS: The film has an interesting premise, the earth's liquid core has stopped rotating and the world will be fried to a crisp because the earth's magnetic field will disappear. Got that? To stop this dire fate of mankind, an intrepid team of nerds must descend into the earth's core and jump start the liquid center's rotation with nuclear weapons. Still with me? Even though the world is set to end due to some ridiculous disaster, and the cities of Rome and San Francisco are destroyed (I told you there were spoilers), the amazing feats of daring by the nerds still manage to spill the tea being sipped by an old lady at an outdoor cafe in Paris! Oh the humanity!!! This is typical of 'The Core', the end of the world is not really that big a deal, cities are destroyed, and old ladies are still drinking tea at cafe's as if nothing is going on.  If your standards of popcorn movies aren't too high, rent 'The Core'. If you and your friends like to openly mock films as you watch them, definitely rent it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest disaster of the year! And I don't mean that the earth's core stopped spinning!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that The Core is a disaster movie is a little too descriptive of itself. My initial interest in seeing the movie stemmed from a piece of the preview in which the Golden Gate Bridge is destroyed, and for some reason I'm always interested in seeing movies in which major monuments are destroyed. Not that I'm interested in death and destruction, of course. Anyway, the means by which the Golden Gate ends up burning and crashing to the water below is the result of one of a great long line of massive fallacies of geologic and astronomical logic. I think that by this point, we've all heard about the fact that our air pollution is eroding the ozone layer, and that if it is completely worn away we will have no protection from the brutal direct rays of the sun. Basically you would be able to get a suntan in seconds, and if you weren't able to get out of the sun within seconds, your skin would be burning away because the ultraviolet light on your skin would have something of a similar effect as putting your arm in the microwave. Anyway, when I first heard about that years and years ago, I was maybe 9 or 10 years old and one of the majority of people who heard the story and immediately pictured a `hole in the ozone,' maybe the size of a dinner table or a small house or, in the worst case scenario, a parking lot or even a city block. As it turns out, this rumor had to be dispelled by the revelation that the `hole' was actually about the size of, you know, Arizona or something. Evidently those people involved in making The Core missed that last memo, as their ozone hole, granted one with slightly different causes, was about the size of a small parking lot, moving along nice and smoothly, roasting everything in its path. But then again, The Core is a movie about drilling to the Earth's core, in a MANNED ship, in order to plant a lot of nuclear bombs to reactivate the spin of the molten outer core and thereby save the entire planet. So logic is obviously not very high on the priority list here. That being said, let me just get to the drill bit really quick. This is one of the things that also originally inspired me to watch the movie, just because I wanted to see if they really expected us to believe that there is any drill bit on earth that can withstand the massive heat and pressure of the inside of the earth, but luckily they didn't (although they DO expect you to believe that it's possible to believe that they can build a SHIP to do that). Here's where it's important to acknowledge the suspension of disbelief in the movies, because this particular film is a test of the audience's capacity for the suspension of disbelief. Personally, I was struggling a little bit. So the `drill bit' turns out to be a lot of lasers set up on some machine that looks like the gat that Arnold used to shoot the police cars and helicopters out of the Cyberdine building in Terminator 2. Just a lot bigger. And apparently it has the ability not to drill through solid rock and turn it immediately to dust, as you might think, but it is actually able to turn it to NOTHING. For the first time in earth history, a means has been created to actually destroy matter, which is clear from the fact that they are able to drill instantly through solid rock (or, for most of the trip, MOLTEN rock and metal) and then travel through the space created. And since the matter that they drill has nowhere to go (it can hardly blow away in the wind), it follows then that it is rendered nonexistent.I had little expectation of the movie as far as logic. I've heard that some pretty bad things would happen if, for some reason, any amount of oxygen ever found it's way to the superheated core of the earth, I guess I was more curious as to how far they would go, what things they would expect the audience to buy. It turns out that they went pretty far. Particularly odd were the scenes where the ship is flying through molten rock at high speeds, zooming back and forth, avoiding collision with diamonds that must have been 500 or 600 yards across and, even better, the scene where they accidentally drill into the top of a geode (you know, one of those rocks that appear to be shells, hollow in the center, with all the crystals formed on the inside), fall for maybe a mile or so to the bottom of it, and then find themselves broken down and pulling manually at the crystal shards that are holding them there while molten rock drips in the hole they made at the top, threatening to bury them all if they don't get out soon enough.The movie actually does create a bit of suspense in such scenes as the badly botched space shuttle landing at the beginning of the film, the scene where one of the astronauts gets crushed near the end of the film, and the scene where Delroy Lindo finds himself in a space suit trying to save the rest of the cast by braving heat that is twice what the suit is designed to sustain (meaning he was in a suit with an interior temperature that, if I remember correctly, would have been something like 9,000 degrees). The problem is that these scenes create suspense because, I like to think, we have a natural dislike of seeing someone killed or in extreme pain, and rather than fear for their logical deaths, we fear for them more at the hands of the writers than reality. Lindo's character, for example, in the above-mentioned scene, finds himself struggling against heat so intense that it shatters his glasses on his face, but doesn't affect his body until his mission is accomplished. Thus the rest of the movie works, creating a whole different world and a whole different set of human limits and natural laws under which the characters operate and live. Interesting, but I really think that the movie would have been a lot more thrilling and much better received had the audience not had to learn the laws of a completely separate world before understanding the real plight of the cast, which was the survive the onslaught of the writers' ideas, a daunting task in itself, as anyone who has seen this movie can tell you since they've also experienced it, rather than survive and save the real world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fun I've had at the movies all year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How you you get award winning actors like Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, and Tchkey Karyo to sign up for a seemingly overdone disaster movie like "Core"? You dump a lot of cash on their doorstep. Well that and you offer them a role in a movie that's fun and doesn't take itself seriously. "Core" is the most fun I've had at the movie's all year, because it does what most films these days forget to do, and that's chuck the finer points of realism for the sake of a script that's built on shiny effects and light-hearted acting. Eckhart's character has the subtle cockiness and smarts you'd expect from a lead, Swank's got the resourcefulness and levity to provide balance, and Tucci is the genius with the self serving nature and the dark wit that really let's him ham it up, something a "serious" actor doesn't do much these days. Are there cliches and far fetched scientific developments that stab away at the continuity? yes, but the actual saving the world part is just a vehicle for these funny and interesting characters. "Core" doesn't revolutionize film or present the audience with a plot that explores some deeper aspect of humanity, but it is wildly entertaining nonetheless. In that it accomplishes what few other action films pull off these days, it's fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A look back at the old adventure stories of Vern, Wells and Burroughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many of Jules Vern's novels cloistered top scientific men in space ships whose interiors were made of finely polished wood and brass. These Victorian gents sipped Sherry as they blasted past the stratosphere. After a quick gourmet lunch of cucumber sandwiches and something eles very English, the men would arrive on the Moon and save the day.The Creator of TARZAN also built elegant vessels of transport too. Who can forget the Mole from 'At the Earth's Core". And though Wells was more scientific in his writing (i.e. The Time Machine and The Shape of things to Come) he still possessed that quantrum of elegance.THE CORE returns fans to that innocent age of storytelling.At the risk of sounding like the 'dreamer poet', this movie succeeds where an Armegeddon fails. It never assumes its anything other than a fast-paced, pseudo-science "Hey flip the Physiology determinator" jabberwocky, oh and "Where's my sonic screwdriver" adventure tale that makes no sense from the first frame kind-of-movie. Thankfully.Movies don't have to make sense -- life rarely makes sense, so why do we hunger for a rational in an area that is supposed to be fanciful at best?Hilary Swank and Aaron Erkhart were a wonderful couple. They believed everything they said and let me tell you they said some real whoopers and yet -- I bought it. The fall of Rome, the way in which the Goldengate bridge was handled and the bird scene were very good -- as was the diamond mine.A rip roaring popcorn-toting fun, fun, fun saturday night at the movies. Here's a toast to the cinema of Unobtanium!Dig it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Core" is a bore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much to say here except this so-called apocalyptic sci-fi "thriller" is a dreary rehash of too many other mediocre "end-of-the-world" hokum that's been thrown at us lately. The space movie "Red Planet" comes to mind, throwing all intelligence and reality (not to mention interest) out the window while supplanting us with a cast of usually top-notch actors in cardboard "Poseidon Adventure"-like roles spouting out unbelievable dialogue every which way.I mean, really! We have, for ultra-realism, Major Hilary Swank as an astronaut whose assigned to guide this missile "down" in stead of "up" this time, alongside fellow "terranaut" Colonel Bruce Greenwood. Eccentric genius Delroy Lindo, looking more like Morgan Freeman in the later reels of "Driving Miss Daisy," perfecting said craft (it's been a long and lonely 20-year project) to burrow past the earth's mantle to the core. With the glasses he wears, how could he even see to create or build such a thing? We have Stanley Tucci as a typically arrogant, supercilious scientist set up as a version of "Lost in Space" villain Dr. Smith. And we have brainy, unassuming (but still rumpled and cute) geophysicist Aaron Eckhardt plucked from college class one day to lead the expedition with French atomic weapons expert Tcheky Karyo in tow. The six-man crew here being swallowed up by the earth to save the world are hard to swallow period. Ouch!Not much credibility at the chain-of-command above ground either with a miscast Alfre Woodard going through the paces as a NASA Chief, grumpy General Richard Jenkins dishing out orders as ordered, and a computer nerd criminal named Rat (D.J. Squalls), using his expert hacking skills this time for the benefit of mankind. Double ouch!OK, plotwise it seems that some bizarre catastrophic occurrences are happening on earth (i.e., people dropping like flies, pigeons flying amok and committing suicide, etc.) After a few hours of deducing by the powers and minds that be, it seems that the earth's inner core has stopped rotating, which, in effect, is compromising the electromagnetic field, which is causing...blah, blah, blah.The effects look a tad flimsy...their travel excursion and diving about through solid rock and magma pits is one big giant computer ride on a large-scale screen a la Michael Jackson's "Captain EO." No action-packed thrills here. And, of course, one by one, the crew is predictably picked off as each new unforeseeable disaster comes to the surface. It's been done before and done better.Eckhardt is always watchable but he and Oscar winner Swank (who looks mighty uncomfortable here) don't click at all as a pair. Their one clinch after overcoming their final dilemma?...they should have just shook hands and patted each other on the back for a job well done. Tucci, who has the flashiest role, is in overdrive trying to instill some energy into this movie...all for nought.Forget this one? Oh, I see, you already have...!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rotten to The Core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This dis-jointed, overlong mishmash has 6 adventurers descend thousands of miles beneath the earth to activate its core, which is causing disasters topside. Birds go awry in London, faulty pacemakers kill dozens, Rome is all burnt up and San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge is ripped in half by weird phenomena. The destructive scenes are minimal, with most of the lengthy action subsurface sequences featuring a multitude of overused and dull CGI. Aaron Eckhart sports one of the worst hairstyles (or toupees) ever, a fake, bleached, out-of-date, floppy crown. His blossoming romance with a cosmonaut (Hilary Swank) is predictable. In fact, out of the 6, guess which two make it back alive? Hilary is ill-suited to this role, more like a college sorority student, then experienced engineer - rank Swank. And the creators on DVD documentary state movies never had a film that went to inner space, haven't they seen the exceptional "Journey to the Center of the Earth" (1959) and several others?</fullReview>

You want just some high-grade fun...THE CORE's about as good as it gets!Anyone prepared to nit-pick over a story that has a bunch of easily-unhinged terranauts, taking a cruise through molten lava, having no problems communicating with ground control...walking around outside in 5000 degrees and not even needing body work and a paint job after being in the proximity of a 200 megaton nuclear blast.....has a few screws loose themselves! Listen guys....James Mason, Pat Boone and a duck managed to WALK the 2000odd miles to the center (in barely 90 minutes)..through a ready-made series of shafts..lit up for the most part like a fairy-grotto. Heaps of take-away mushrooms on tap, natural bridges at just the right moments. They didn't even SEE any magma till they got to the center where lo and behold exists an ocean and a few geckos dressed up as dinosaurs. Having nothing else to do, they catch a ride to the surface up through a volcano no less, huddled up in an iffy piece of pottery-shell that wouldn't protect the average cocker spaniel. THAT explosion they set off with less gunpowder than you would need to blow the average plastic piggy-bank! ...and you know what my friends? they call JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH a classic?THE CORE is EVERYTHING "The Hulk" isn't - unpretentious, watchable, FUN, well paced, colorful AND ENTERTAINING! Sure its scientifically loopy...but anyone who walks out of THE CORE and feels they "did" their $12 or so...is a humorless, uncompromising and undeniably unforgiving viewer.

It is quality work as far as overly-produced Sci-Fi action films go, which are often doomed from script stage. No logic will reassure you that what you are seeing is plausible, but will give you 30 min. of pretty pictures that mostly go "boom," and 90 min. of actors desperately working to be in the same movie.

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst disaster flick to hit the multiplexes to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert: If you've never, ever, ever watched a disaster flick before in your life, some of the stuff in the review below may actually give things away. What would you get if you crossed Armageddon with Independence Day? The obvious answer would be, Hell. Hollywood's answer turns out to be, "big opening weekend grosses and a successful run on video." So, we're given The Core, quite possibly the worst disaster flick to hit the multiplexes to date. The Core would be laughably bad, if it didn't happen to be so bad that it was impossible to laugh at. The film starts so-so enough as to lead the unsuspecting viewer to believe that the movie will only, "kinda suck." Weird things are happening around the globe. Flocks of pigeons forget how to navigate, swooping down into crowds of unsuspecting citizens, as though they were auditioning for the next made-for-TV sequel to The Birds. A bunch of people's pacemakers stop working simultaneously, causing the poor folk to instantaneously drop dead. And then there's the whopper; a space shuttle has a heck of a time making its re-entry to earth. At this point, geophysicist Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) and this French dude (or should I say "Freedom dude?"), with a strong knowledge of weapons, are called in to Washington D.C., to find out what's going on. It turns out that the U.S. Government has created a device that would make Dr. Evil green with envy. What has been created is a weapon of mass destruction that works underground, in hopes of causing earthquakes in enemy territories. When the device of doom ends up not working, and instead causes the earth's core to stop spinning, a bunch of scientists and astronauts need to find a way down into the core, to start things spinning properly by detonating a nuclear weapon in the center of the planet (huh?!?). The select group is collectively known as "terranauts." The people playing the terranauts are a fairly large bunch of talented actors and actresses doing really bad work. With the screenplay they were given, it's no wonder actors of Academy caliber come off as being no more gifted than those child actors on that old The Land of the Lost television show, did.I'm actually going to give most of these actors their dignity, and refrain from using their names. There is no way any of them did this film to expand their artistic horizons. The stock characters, clichéd dialogue and predictable behavior found in the script could, in no way, appeal to them. Therefore, I'm assuming that they signed on for nothing more than a paycheck. As they will desperately be trying to do within a few months, let's forget their minor artistic discretions, and hope that they select better roles next time. For now, I will simply continue to call them, "terranauts." Going back to the preposterous plot at the center of The Core, the problem these, uh, "terranauts" have, is that they need some super fakey device to take them on their journey to the center of the earth. Thank god for those reclusive, but genius, scientists living out in the desert. Utah desert dweller, Dr. Ed "Braz" Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) has, presumably for lack of something better to do, been creating a craft for that special time when the earth's core stops rotating due to a doomsday weapon meant to cause earthquakes under "naughty" countries. His problem? He has another five or ten years before he could possibly get a working model of the submersible device built. In only a year's time, the entire earth will be destroyed, due to the fact that its electromagnetic field is falling apart. To add insult to injury, big storms of electricity and microwaves, will demolish buildings in much the same way that those alien ship thingies demolished them in Independence Day. Dr. Brazzelton gets cable out there in the desert, right? He must be aware of the kind of damage those alien blasts did in 1996's sci-fi destruction film. After being offered a ton of money from the Government, "Braz" decides he can have the whole ten year project completed in a few weeks (or was it months? Does anyone really care?). Brazzelton succeeds in building his earth submersible, and, before you know it, the terranauts are digging their way toward the planet's core at about 100 miles per hour. Numerous things get in their way, such as the earth, but they do eventually make it to their goal, but only after losing almost all of their fellow terranauts. But things aren't over yet (although, closing in on the two hour point, you sure wish they would be). Lots of last minute stuff goes wrong, and it looks like the terranauts may not be able to save the planet, after-all. GASP! I won't give away the ending, but I'll gladly tell you, right from the beginning, that this film is such a waste of your time, you'd be better off watching Armageddon again, and as much as I hated that movie, this is as far from a ringing endorsement that I could ever give.</fullReview>

In that case I would recognize the talent of playing GOD! Until then...

		<fullReview>but I thought it was pretty good, much better than another sci-fi film in this genre, Armaggadon, which was terrible. At least, in the Core, there is suspense and thrills and explanations are given, even though it sounds like things like that could never happen. And certainly there would never be some ship that could travel through lava that is thousands degrees hot and not melt and have everyone survive. And it really got ridiculous when they crash land on this spiky looking piece of ground and they get out of the ship and survive. I mean, wouldn't it have either been unbearablely hot or cold right there. And then they had to come up with another ridiculous idea to have a happy ending. And they had to have the usual snotty guy that you don't want to make it, but in this film, they even had all the good guys die except the 2 you knew would survive.Also, I wonder why Hillary Swank took this role. She has an Oscar and generally takes the dramatic roles. Maybe her career isn't going so great although she's getting acclaim for her recent movie directed by Clint Eastwood.FINAL VERDICT: I found the plot to be beyond absurd, but I didn't let that ruin the film. I thought it was fun and had some thrills, and certainly better than other natural disaster films like Armaggaden and Twister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What if the core is made of cheese?" (What do you mean, what if?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an episode of "The King of Queens," Doug and Carrie go to see a fictional movie called "Floaters" about the world's gravitational pull being nullified and everyone in danger of floating off the planet; the solution is to build a roof all over the world to keep everyone in, which the characters rightly define as idiotic. "The Core" isn't too plausible either (though to be honest, the matching of a slightly dim schlump like Doug and someone as sharp and sexy as Carrie isn't that much far removed from the realms of science fiction).The quote up there after "Subject:" comes from Stanley Tucci as a marvellously arrogant scientist, one of the ragtag band of experts (aren't they always?) called in to restart the earth's rotation by setting off nuclear bombs at the core. The logical response if someone proposes something like to you is to say "Okayyyyyy..." while edging away and looking for a phone to ring up the men in white coats. But while even a science-challenged man like me is sure this doesn't hold up to close scrutiny, Jon Amiel's movie is actually surprisingly entertaining, though it's not hard to see why a movie that theoretically has "summer" written all over it was delayed by Paramount until early 2003. (Also worth noting as one of the few major studio movies in recent years to have no soundtrack album, in spite of Christopher Young's fine work here.)The characters are a bit on the shallow side, it looks like it's been edited to within an inch of its life, the special effects go from unconvincing (especially the Rome lightning strikes and the animation of the core itself) to fine (like the snapping of the Golden Gate Bridge and the mass death of pigeons in Trafalgar Square - arguably the most convincing moment in the movie because, like the floating feather that bookends "Forrest Gump," it comes as a real shock to find that it's actually a special effect), and the whole thing is such a throwback to the 70s that it's hard not to keep a smile on your face for some of the wrong reasons (Tucci has a big secret file in his cabinet which we know is important becuase it has "SECRET" on it in big red letters. Twice).But unlike "Daylight," which was 100% laughable, writers Cooper Layne and John Rogers come up with a movie that ultimately strikes a good balance between humour and tension - it may have trailed "Deep Impact" and "Armageddon," but it blends the former's sincerity and the latter's refusal to stop the action coming. It would be nice to think that the craft used was named Virgil in honour of the pilot of Thunderbird 2 (who, of course, was entrusted with the Mole), but this is considerably better written than "Thunderbirds," sad to say. And the fact that the cast is made up of actors (Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Tcheky Karyo, Delroy Lindo, Richard Jenkins, Alfre Woodard...) instead of Stars is a plus - not only do they make the goings-on more palatable, but it means you can't immediately guess who'll make it to the end credits intact.It may have been a box office failure, but it's nonetheless the kind of movie that could be called good popcorn entertainment if I liked popcorn; impossible to take seriously, but it's entirely pretention-free. Thank goodness this wasn't directed by Jan de Bont; and while it may not be the kind of project you'd expect an Oscar-winner to star in, you must remember that Angelina Jolie went on to "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life." Thank heaven this wasn't directed by Jan de Bont...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CORE is an almost exact copy of ARMAGEDDON, which I really hate (see my review). The big difference with this movie is that is quieter and less epileptic. At least the producers of ARMAGEDDON knew they had a turkey on their hands; that's why they turned the noise level to 11 and editing was brain-numbingly superfast, as to give the illusion that the movie was cool and such when it was just to hide the fact that everything was pure crap. So watching THE CORE, without noise level at 11 or without epileptic editing, was quite a chore to sit through. Boring. Badly shot. A slew of good actors totally wasted. Really bad special effects. Predictable. Stale. It looked and felt like a TV movie. The idea of going under the surface of the earth always intrigues me but this movie was a waste of time. Don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Armageddon may not have been a dramatic masterpiece, but God dammit, it was moving and exciting and actually enjoyable to watch. The Core is none of those things, it's a horrible cliche of a sci fi movie with absolutely no redeeming features. This fifth rate sci fi "thriller" is worse than an episode of some cable TV rubbish.The premise is utterly ridiculous for a start, the casting token in every area (one black guy, one dumb female, one foreign guy, some scientist guy), the writing and dialogue and acting atrocious. The effects were mostly OK, but good effects do not come close to making a movie by themselves since they are ubiquitous these days.One note on the cast, Hilary Swank has to be the most unappealing "babe" in Hollywood since Kirsten Dunst. What's with her permanent look of indignance? Does she think that makes her look intense or something? She's absolutely horrid! Her acting is no saving face either, and with a face like that there'd be a lot to save.Avoid this movie and hope it dies a quick box office death. Filmmakers who churn out trash like this need to be taught a lesson, not even the dumbest, most gullible moviegoer would be fooled or entertained by this tripe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie addresses the theme of "the end of the world" in a new and interesting way - rather than a comet hitting the earth (as in Deep Impact), or a race of machines causing nuclear explosions that wipe out humanity as we know it (Terminator), the earth seemingly self destructs because it's inner magnetic core stops turning, resulting an all sorts of lovely exciting disasters up above!Full marks to the writers for coming up with this big idea - and for proposing and showing us the various possible knock-on effects. Pigeon-death anyone? ;-)I had to suspend my disbelief a mere 10 minutes into this film - disbelief not of the outlandish but intriguing plot, but rather of the fact that somebody somewhere pitched this movie to a studio successfully! Oh how they must have laughed!The "scientists" in the film also deserved full marks for having all the answers to all the problems they encountered on their mission to save mankind - 0h look! I just happen to have this device for burning holes in rocks, and this material that gets STRONGER with rising heat, and an x-ray machine that can "see" through lead lying around in my lab/batcave! How fortunate! Just what we need to get to the earths core and back!Give me a break mister!The acting is the only thing that matches the storyline in terms of quality here - PATHETIC.It was obvious this was never going to be a great movie from the word go - but I had hoped it would be an exciting journey to the center of the earth - instead it was a journey into extreme tedium! Somebody somewhere is laughing their head off having got this rubbish actually made into a "movie"Without doubt "The Core" will remain in my memory for many years to come - as the most sickeningly awful movie I have ever spent 133 minutes of my life watching. Watch "The Abyss" instead folks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"End Of the World" potboiler that deserves more respect than it got</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics who jumped all over this movie and dumped on it for having an 'unbelievable premise' and bad science seem to have forgotten the real important aspect of an escapist science fiction/adventure film like "The Core". It ain't about the 'science', it's about whether the director, the actors, the cinematographers and the SFX guys can put enough energy and polish into what they do to keep things entertaining and interesting. I'd say that the effort and polish that went into this movie lift make it a better movie than any brief description of the plot can cover."The Core" has been compared to "Armageddeon" with good reason, although one other reviewer was very astute in that it actually is much closer in feel to "Fantastic Voyage". But for my money, "The Core" is actually a superior effort and a more enjoyable movie. Let's face it, for all its success as a huge hit, "Armageddeon" was a hammy, overblown, overcooked Bruckheimer cliché-fest - every single scene, every shot, every bar of music, every line of dialog was delivered with the volume turned up to "11" and SCREAMED TO THE BACK ROW like Hamlet on crystal meth. In contrast, there are peaks and valleys to the script structure in "The Core" - there are quiet moments, contemplative moments, funny moments, and people actually talk like people instead of Olympic demigods. (Not counting Steve Buscemi's contributions to "Armageddeon").Don't get me wrong - Bruckheimer blockbusters have their place in the scheme of things, but so do more modest efforts like this one. I like the understated, relatively restrained performances here. I like Delroy Lindo playing against type as a engineering genius and recluse who is quite defensive about his ship. I like that Tucci's character is a pretty sly dig at/tribute to the late Carl Sagan. I like the little jokes and asides (such as calling the new metal composing the ship hull "unobtainium"). I like the portrayals of the group dynamics inside the ship, especially as Lindo and Tucci get on each other's nerves, and as Swank's commander tries to warn her about her inability to make the hard choices. I like that Karyo's character can't deal with the enormity of saving billions, but hopes that he can be strong enough and smart enough to save three people (his wife and daughters). I like that in the last seconds before the nuke goes off in his face, Tucci's character realizes how silly he is being (reflexively dictating pompous, pretentious notes for his new "Cosmos" style science popularization seconds before his death) and roars with laughter at himself. Anyway, not a terribly original movie, or a perfect movie, but an enjoyable one, good for a 'sci fi themed' movie night in front of the TV, or a pleasant way to kill a few hours any other time.</fullReview>

Personally I believe the Nuclear bomb promotion society should get out the business of making films such as this and Armageddon where nuclear bombs save the day instead of blowing everyone up and ruining the world for all,as would really happen. The one point I did give this film it only scores for the inventive use of a large fish in the opening sequence, as it is thrown trough a London café window as a replacement for a pigeon.

Now the threat of the earth core spin coming to a halt is as real as the moon falling on our head; it will happen, but not suddenly. You will see it coming. But the science used to get it going again is farther fetched than Piglet marrying Snowwhite.So i don't know what the idea behind this movie was ; at least i now know who did it so i can stay away from this production team.

It annoys the hell out of me when reviewers "analyse" films like this, picking holes in every minute detail. Of course it's a load of old toffee, whereas Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Monsters Inc, The Terminator are all perfectly plausible, 100% accurate depictions of reality. If you want real life, look out the window. Sure this film isn't in the same league as the aforementioned, but it doesn't make any pretensions about being something it isn't. Its two hours of brainless entertainment. If I want heavy duty, I'll watch Truffaut, Bunel, or some hard hitting drama. If I want to relax, kick back, and forget about a crappy day, this is exactly the sort of film to do that.Who says all films have to accurate? A group of reviewers with their heads so stuck in trying to scientifically unravel the film, while trying to pull their heads out of their own orifices (or is that orifi?).This film is great action, suitably silly, visually and sonically decent, and an excellent load of fun to watch with a load of mates, a decent pizza and a few beers. Sure I like serious drama; I like films that move me to tears, films that make me laugh, and sometimes films that just entertain the hell out of me.

I first watched it as a naughty internet download and then bought it on DVD as I liked it so much. I've now watched that DVD three times and have always enjoyed it. A few of the effects are a bit weak, one or two lines could be better but I see nothing to hate here.

		<shortDescription>A general warning:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The act of watching a movie and how it is taken by the viewer is very subjective. So, let me phrase this correctly: If you are able to ignore logic and science and the competent development of a premise; if you basically watch movies for explosions and movement on the screen... Well... I'd still only give it a five (of ten). Yet, if you have the pesky habit of listening to the words that people are saying and attempting to understand: You may not want to watch this movie. You may want to put it down and back away slowly. I'm trying my hardest not to completely bad-mouth this, but this is the first movie that I have had to force myself to finish in years. And I mean FORCE. I came beck to it three times. I was not a physics major, but the abuse of every common law of our known reality is evident in this film. The premise itself is skewed, which does not bother me. Many movies have been made with obviously flawed legs to stand on, as plot goes, but there is usually an equally obscure solution and implementation that leaves enough gray-zone of doubt to make it comprehensible. Either that or it is covered up with enough humor to make it light-hearted and watchable... Take the Armageddon example: With the resulting action and dialogue from Steve Buscemi, Bruce Willis, and that crazy Cosmonaut, and I really didn't care that the premise flopped a few times. In 'The Core' there is more room for error, since we are not dealing with the obvious unknowns that may occur on an asteroid; we are looking at the physical rules of this planet alone. On top of that the action was lame and dragging, with very little humor or believability. I'll make one example that peeved me the most: The movie did not even follow the laws of gravity. The cockpit of the 'drill' was a sphere on a swivel that kept it upright, yet when people left the cockpit to travel to other parts of the vehicle they were walking upright in the cabins, even though they should have been drawn 90 degrees downward. Pressure due to depth and gravity also was not uniform, making entire portions laughable at best. I have not had to shut a movie off halfway through this many time in my recollection... It's just that the errors made me grind my jaw to the point of pain. If you think that you could ignore physics, be my guest... But I usually can watch movie like this to laugh at, only this time it was just sad. Man... Oh... One other thing I have to note: If one is to write dialogue for a GENIUS, they must worry about how they sound... Maybe send the script around to the scientific community to see if any real genius would get caught dead saying half these lines. It is a difficult task to take on... don't think that you can do it alone. I should wrap this up, I could whine for an hour on various points, but who wants to read that? I am only trying to warn any watcher of movies that cares for similar things that I do when viewing films. Please put this down and walk away. Rent Event Horizon... Something that will make you happy, at least. Please. I wish that someone gave me a warning first.(even though with this warning I probably would have watched it anyways just to see how bad it actually was, oh well)</fullReview>

There was decent action and special effects and the story was fairly interesting. The whole idea of the world being in danger is not a new concept. There are many similarities to movies like "Armageddon" and "Deep Impact". If you enjoyed those movies, then you will likely enjoy this as well.

I mean aside from the obvious plot holes, and the typical let's knock off the supporting cast so surprise surprise the prettiest cast members live. It wasn't all that bad of a film.The premise was interesting however, albeit not entirely original, it did have it's own spin. The characters were a motley crew if nothing else. Like going to a family reunion where all the people in the world who would not normally get together, and normally shouldn't get together do.Really the simplest review would be to say that it is a disaster movie. Man must survive, while over coming impossible odds, and spouting off philosophical warm fuzzies.Everything goes swimmingly, until the unforeseen variable changes the plan, and man must not quit but instead sacrifice himself in order for the species to survive.In the end, it really is hard to find something bad about this movie.

You want real science, watch Discovery Channel. Accept this for what it is. Yes, it's junk food for the brain. Nothing wrong with the occasional bite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie "The Core". However, I thought they should have went ahead and detonated the "Project Destiny" facility. Similarily they should also do so with the clandestine subterranean Human Science facility of Grants Pass, Oregon. But the authorities are concerned about the ramifications of ending GPs for it would, much like the ending of the "beam" in the closing scenes of "They Live", expose much of "the lie". Grants Pass has a secret facility much like "Project tic-toc" in the 60's TV series "The Time Tunnel". The facility, a pentagon of Satan, controls all property transfers, marriages, employment etc. so as to affect an orderly society for the age-old excuse of "the betterment of man". But like most things it has run it's course. Nowadays all they do is cover-up their harsh and brutal psycho-subliminal past. They make sure that lab subjects do not talk and that their reassimulation into normalized society (if there really is such a thing) is controlled and that blowback and fallout is minimized. Again, I enjoyed "The Core". I just would've done it different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly preposterous plot, terrible script slightly redeemed by good performances and occasional humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People often defend wildly impossible sci-fi by pointing out that the bounds of reality and scientific fact are stretched in most films. Fair enough. But there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. Consistency is the key point. Get all your impossibilities out of the way quickly and then don't break the rules that you have set for yourself. The best sci-fi works because it extends or transforms a small amount of modern science and then explores the consequences. It entertains and carries us along because it reveals the details of it's assumptions in a way which makes us think we could have figured it out if we'd had more time, or were cleverer. Inherent in this process is that the revelations make sense within the parameters of the fictional world. That's the right way to do sci-fi.In "The Core", we have a pretty much perfect exposition of the wrong way to do it. Not much of what happens is connected to anything else, from a scientific point of view. There is just an interleaved sequence of shoddy science and hackneyed plot devices. There is no coherence or consistency to any of it. That's why it's a bad film. That the writing and editing are terrible too just adds to the misery. As I've read elsewhere, it's not a disaster movie, it's just a disaster!So why the 4 rating? It has a good cast, who play it completely straight. That helps. Hilary Swank adds a touch of class, Delroy Lindo is good, Alfre Woodward is never less than great. Stanley Tucci is a bit over the top, but is funny. The special effects are pretty good, even very good at times. The lava torrent in the geode is great, pity it didn't get more screen time. And finally, there is a little genuine comedy in the mainly dire script.Overall, it entertained me, and I might pause for a few minutes while channel surfing through it in the future. But not if there are repeats of Scrubs on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than Armageddon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not saying that The Core is a brilliant movie, neither is Armageddon, but after reading some of this comments here, i have to say that it's far better than the family-macho-drama on an earth-attacking comet. The cast of The Core is great, almost brilliant in compare with Armageddon and the story is almost more believable. (almost!). I think it's far less "stars and stripes"-propaganda, trying to take a much wider aspect on what "saving the earth" would mean (within the realms of an pop-corn-cinema adventure like this). There is really nice done CGI's and nice set-design and the overall look of the movie is well done, sexy and tasteful (and maybe a little bit too clean if you are not into that kind of neat CGI stuff). So i would recommend: Before watching Armageddon again, give The Core a try. It won't hurt your brain any harder and it looks much better :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Core...your standard "scientific movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is extremely predictable and cliché-ridden. You watch it for the first few minutes you know what is going to happen throughout the rest of the movie. And you will discover that all your predictions are painfully accurate, because nothing other than what you have predicted is happening. It follows the exact formula of Armageddon's: "disaster, random recruit, scientific-kind-of-rescue, unnecessary sacrifices, happy-ending". I don't need to say how bad and wooden the acting is; people here have complained already.The only thing that for me it earned three stars instead of one is because at least the female lead and the male lead did not fall in love and kiss at the end of the movie. THIS is slightly out of my disgruntled expectation, and that's a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The platform is obvious: "Armageddon" by way of "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", "Journey to the Center of the Earth" and "Fantastic Voyage". It starts off with a Hitchcockian excursion of the camera, pulling in "The Birds" and extractions from the "X Files". However, among its many problems, the farther into the narrative we go, the more constrained the vision becomes -- constrained by unimaginative techno-geekery and special effects units. What they should have done is kept a tight visual focus a la "Das Boot"; some good old-fashioned rivet-popping would have leveraged a feeling...this has no center, so they can only try to make us gasp at the twists and turns.And the evident hypocrisy: the subject matter of the story involves great risk; the way the movie is made and the choice of predecessors it derives from involve no risk at all. Like "Die Hard"'s many genre successors, all this can do in its own genre is huff and puff harder and harder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the Earth stood still, they made "The Core"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the starting idea was to sent somebody inside the Earth's core, why did nobody think about making a movie based on the famed book "Journey to the Center of the Earth" from Jules Verne? The only movie that has been released about this novel was a Disney family-oriented film with too many changes to the original story to be considered as valuable material.Instead, it has been decided that the concept of traveling to the core should be turned into a disaster movie. There's nothing wrong so far... But as professor Joshua Keyes says in that same movie: "After that it gets bad"."The Core" is one of the cheesiest disaster movies ever released, and that for many reasons. There are interesting moments in the movie, but the final result could be compared as a recipe involving both caviar and Kraft dinner.The most striking (and pitiful) aspect of the movie is the patchwork and corny dialog, which turn potential-full actors into walking parodies. You can easily see that lines are artificial and insane, which can only lead the viewer to laugh of the characters. There are countless examples of this, but some are unforgettable. The best (it means the worst) of the lot is the following one. General Percell (Richard Jenkins) asks Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo) how much would it cost to build his massive ship within three months. Brazzleton laughs and says it would cost fifty billion dollars. Percell answers by saying: "Will you take a check?" Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) replies by uttering: "Why don't you use a credit card? You get miles."It's only a single example of what forms "The Core". I could give you a full list of this kind of quotes but I don't have time.Characters are very different. They're either entertaining or simply ridiculous. For the latter, just take General Percell. You could see that he's involved in the dialog that I put above. So when you watch and listen to such an important military man, it doesn't take Einstein's brain to find out that he's a clown.For the entertaining part, something attracted me in Rat (DJ Qualls). He is an ultra-weird, bizarre and slightly paranoid computer genius who's assigned to the information exchange for the mission. But his situation is special because he's like the fish-out-of-water. He's a geek living in his small, computer-laden apartment, and he's almost addicted to Xena videotapes and Hot Pockets. And he's put with some of the world's leading scientists in order to save the Earth. That's pretty funny. And Rat also delivers some of the most interesting quotes of the movie, such as: "Your Kung-Fu is not strong", and the following one with professor Conrad Zimsky. Rat asks Zimsky: "How many languages do you speak?" Zimsky answers: "Five, actually." Rat adds: "I speak one. 1-0-1-0-0. With that I could steal your money, your secrets, your sexual fantasies, your whole life."Enough about the characters. Let's talk about the disasters themselves, because they're the core (allow me that wordplay) of the story. Because of the unique character of this movie, the catastrophes are unique, as well. We successively see 32 people instantly dying in Boston, which leads to a great mess. The most thrilling disaster is next. Massive hordes of birds go wild in London and create a chaos which reminisces "The Birds" from Hitchcock. There is also a static thunderstorm in Roma, with special effects which quality goes from low to high, and intense micro-wave radiation in San Francisco, another great moment.Generally, the disaster scenes are what makes this movie interesting in a sense. They're all thrilling in their own way and we must admit that it's a great deal of imagination. The only one that doesn't work is the Space Shuttle malfunction in Los Angeles.Actually, this movie is a very mixed bag. This is very hard to tell if it should be recommended. The disaster scenes definitely enthrall, but the screenplay and the lines are worth of a B-picture. So it's your choice. But you must accept the fact that watching this movie is turning your eyes on and your brain off and that it's a disaster movie at the same time that it's a self-parody.</fullReview>

Birds lose the ability to fly using their internal magnetic compass, violent lightning storms occur without warning, &amp; other unnatural disasters plague countries all over the world. College professor Dr. Josh Keyes &amp; his graduate staff discover that the strange happenings around the world are due to the Earth not spinning on its axis, causing the catastrophic events. Called upon by the military, Dr. Keyes &amp; friend Dr. Serge Leveque examine bodies confiscated for autopsy.

		<fullReview>The Core is an entertaining movie. Like the Computer Hacker who saves the world in the core I have come up with a military site called circe.chinalake.navy.mil that is restricted and cannot be accessed through the regular internet. If anyone can legally tell me what the site is about just write it into a The Core movie review. Relax I am the for real American Shadow Vice President not some spy. The American Shadow President is President Jack Fitzgerald Kennedy my boss. In a previous review I said that I would recognize a clone of President Jack Kennedy as the next American Shadow President if I remained American Shadow Vice President. I have been working on the Seventh Care Rank Ki Alien name. I think its Pres like President or Elvis Presley the King. The other six Care Rank Ki Alien names are Apophis-God, Demeter, Ra, Ptah, Memphis and Ramses. Imagine all the other Care Rank Ki aliens being clones of those seven. Honorary Doctor Jackson has identified the Seventh Symbol/sign, I have indeed. Of course those are names of the Care Rank Ki for Human comprehension. Seven is the highest Prime number between 1 and ten so that is clever. There used to be an American squadron of the President, Peacock, Hornet and Tom Bowline, add three prize ships and you could represent the 7 Care Rank Ki Alien Leaders. One way the budget of the Core was kept small was by skipping A list actors for the parts.</fullReview>

I was kind of surprised with this movie,because it's interesting,despite the unrealistic plot(I'm not a scientist,but if it could really happen,we would all be in very big,big trouble). Jon Amiel managed to do something good for us to see until the end and the casting was a very good one. After all,we don't see Hillary Swank or even Stanley Tucci making a "blockbuster" every day. The special effects could be more spectacular(although it's obvious that,like no one has never really seen it,we don't have means to compare the inside of the Earth),but I've seen worse. The soundtrack is at the same level that the movie. By this,I want to say that it does not pass the feelings that it should pass when we are watching the movie. It'just music that's playing while images are running. I also liked the fact that it had some "gags" throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Set not high expectations on it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I set not high expectations on action-movies. When i watch a movie like "Armageddon", "Die Hard", "Reign of Fire" or, in this case, "The Core", i expect only to be entertained. So a lot of plot-holes in movies likes this did not really disturbing for me. When i detect a plot hole, i say to myself a short "Come on, it is only a Hollywood entertaining movie" and it goes on. The same at "The Core". It starts with a lot of plot holes. A new matter, that withstands all temperatures, a new machine, that can reach the earth's core, a new laser-drill and so on... developed by one man living in an old hangar (perhaps is is a good idea to take a look in the garage of my old neighbor, perhaps he is working on a hyper drive-modul??). OK, i thought, this are probably the biggest plot holes in the movie, but it goes on, and on, and on. The holes got bigger and bigger, and in the last 30 min. runtime they got so big, that you can drive the whole earth through it without any problems, i.e. tuning A-bomb with the plutonium from the ships reactor! Come on, a A-bomb is not like some firecrackers, that you can tie together to get a bigger bang!The most disturbing for me was, that not only the title, but the entire main-plot of the movie was stolen from "Deep Core". OK, "Deep Core" was only a very cheap B-Movie (made in 2000), but the idea with the A-Bombs (in "Deep Core" there was only two of them) and the separation of the Modules (in "Deep Core" it was only one module) from the ship (including the one crew-member that remaining in the separated module) was without a doubt a rip off of "Deep Core"! All in all, forget any logic and see it as pure entertainment, the FX of "The Core" are not so bad. I will give mediocre 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

But then I guess you could say light-sabres are also implausible... It certainly is fast-paced enough to keep you entertained, and the opening scene is good, so be sure not to miss it as it is quite short. However there didn't seem to be anything in the plot-line to make this stand out over other every other Hollywood disaster movie. In fact, 'The Core' is a textbook example of a disaster movie. Don't watch it if you have a degree in geology or geography, instead watch it with an alcoholic beverage or three, and enjoy it as an innocent piece of fun.</fullReview>

She learns as she goes along--and then wants a shower when the adventure's over.Also, for such a silly story, the writers were smart enough not to allow their lead couple to get romantically or lustily involved with each other. We see them sort of getting' close at the end ... but, seems they just go their separate ways. And why not? But--that's about the most realistic touch in the film.

		<fullReview>What I liked most about the core were the characters, all of them! I think they made these people more realistic than in most movies I've seen. Conversations seemed real, like everyday conversing and on the level, not over the top, not too understated either. I didn't find the sci-fi part particularly hot. The journey itself was a bit boring. It seemed to be more about the people in the story than the story itself. And that's why I value it. I've heard that this movie totally sucked before I bought it (cheap), but I took the risk for a low price. And I liked it very much in general. I have a weak spot for sympathetic movies, and this is one of them. I loved the day after tomorrow for its grande scenes.. big picture stuff. I wouldn't go see The Core in the Theather, I think it works better in the familiarity of your livingroom. The characters are not underdeveloped in my opinion. It's the kind of information one would get spending time with each other in a confined craft like that. To me it is close enough to realistic character development. You do get to know these guys, and you'll probably all like them... they are very human in comparison to the blown up heroes in Armageddon, and like I said, really, in comparison to most movies. I think the scriptwriter and/or director have a knack for portraying real human beings... but it might strike better in a smaller story. Big things mostly call for Big characters to really leave an impression by the public. This was supposed to be a Big Thing, but the "boring journey" and the reallife acting made it come down a bit, so the insinuated Bang Bang , went poof poof with the public. Why it works that way exactly, I dunno, that's I guess why I don't make movies.. ;-) And in the end I liked the movie, so I can only say it's a matter of taste. Mainly I rent a movie to relax, so if a movie suits my purpose well, I guess I'll automatically rate it higher.</fullReview>

Stanley Tucchi for an example played his part as Zimsky very well.What is more enjoyable are the deleted scenes on the DVD. Like one that as taken out was testing out the heat suits. Braz (Delroy Lindo) Shoots Zimsky (Tucchi) with a flame thrower. An enjoyable deleted scene.The music score wasn't bad in the film, either. The overall film was decent.

For me, the interaction of the characters, not the dubious science -- or even the special effects -- is the heart of the story. I know someone like the Josh character that always looks on the bright side and is brilliant at deducing the obscure from remote clues. The maturation of the Bec character, the interplay between the Zimsky and the Braz characters, and the friendship of the Serge and the Josh characters are very well done.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining "what if"-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, about everything in this movie *is* based on 'Hollywood science', meaning that it's either a completely exaggerated version of the real thing, or just total fiction. But if you put your brain in 'low-power mode' as you should, this movie is quite entertaining. The assumption that this movie should stay in touch with reality is just plain wrong. For starters, it revolves around the feat of humans traveling to the earth's core. That should ring a bell already, and give you an idea of the implausibilities introduced.At one point one of the characters says "what if", and that is exactly the premise of this film. Of course it is impossible to 'see' anything down there, and of course nothing hollow could survive amidst a sea of high-pressure magma. But the movie starts out from the question "what if all these things *would* be possible after all?" This opens the doors to an alternative world, and within this alternative world this movie just works. The problem is most likely that the movie may seem to pretend that its science is real, while in other movies it's more obvious that pseudo-science or magic is involved. Just remember that this movie *is* based on pseudo-science and you'll have much less trouble enjoying it.The story is a pretty average disaster movie scenario, but not too predictable to become boring. Action is well spread over the movie so one neither gets exhausted nor waiting for the next big thing to happen. Acting is pretty average, with some good and some so-so performances. Add some quite nice special effects, and what you get is not the greatest cinema ever, but still a nice piece of popcorn entertainment to spend the evening in your favorite couch after a hard day's work. Just don't expect anything that will keep your brain busy. And stay clear of this movie if you don't like the idea of WMD's being used for a good cause.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening moments the clichés begin washing up around your feet, weighing you down and dragging you to the core of boredom. There are the mysterious military personnel. There are the shots of Washington architecture. There is the talk of "the academy". So many Sci-Fi films and so many academies Isn't there a synonym for them? The blonde, blue eyed, square jawed leading man with the foreign speaking buddy both full of serious intent and off the cuff jocularity. "Hey the planet's dying, but where's my pop tart?" This time the pencil neck computer geek was too much with his nose borrowed from Cyrano DeBergerac. Then there is the awful science, the horrible editing so choppy it is like reading a comic book where great leaps of logic are required to fill in the gaps in the storyline...you get the picture. Rather, don't get it and go watch some paint dry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BORE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the Hollywood pitch I imagined for this flick (slightly twisted): OK let's do a disaster flick like Armegeddon only we include every worn out, overcliched character archetype known to Hollywood. That way we can just cut and paste from the scripts of a dozen "B" movies and not have to pay anyone to write a script! Each character is perfectly predictable in their behavior just based on the fact you've seen these characters sooo many other times. I think the key to including these cornerstone characters without making people puke is to disguise them at least a little. Some movie-goers make a hobby out of analyzing each character to determine which archetype they are based on. This movie disguises nothing and the character interaction is made corny by the predictability of their actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like it... the special effects may be a bit naff, but the characterisation is brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't quite know what to expect - the science was a bit dodge in places, and lacking in logic. However, the characterisation is excellent.. and unlike many similar "disaster flicks", The Core didn't seem to have the need for a villainous character who'd sabotage the efforts of the others.The death toll was a bit predictable - I mean didn't we all know that the viewpoint character and the woman would end up as sole survivors? But even so, the overall impression of the movie was very good. The stand out actor was Tcheky Karyo - Hilary Swank was also excellent. Delroy Lindo as as Brazelton was also great - his death was one of the more hideous, but justified - and for once the black man was not the first to die! The vessel was one of the stars, and Rat's hacking, while a bit improbable, provided a few moments of great suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extreme Waste!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the worst natural disaster movie I've ever seen and the funny part is that it came far after most of the original ones did during the late-90's. One would figure that this would make it far superior since they could learn from the priors' mistakes but no, it just made it that much worse. The worst part of this film is that it was riddled with every cliché known to our civilization today. I don't want to get started on plot holes because that'd take forever and I wouldn't even know where to begin...however most of them were obvious anyway. The acting was decent, I'll give it that. I was actually thinking along the way that my hat goes off to these people since I wouldn't be able to concentrate like they did with such a bad script. I'd honestly burst out laughing if I had to say some of the crappy dialog; but they did it. The death sequences were terrible, not only in how they happened but how the other crew members reacted afterward. The whole concept of the story is a little far-fetched to begin with but the hacker character, members of the military, and a few of the scientists only exacerbate matters!Final Drill:Movies: This had to have bombed!DVD Purchase: Not one copy should've sold!Rental: Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Armageddon was unwillingly funny, THE CORE was not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what it is, a new ice-age or a giant meteorite, it seems that movies in which the earth is in danger are up-to-date. The newest example is THE CORE, which shows a journey to the earth's outer core, because this core had stopped it's rotation. The consequences were perturbations of the earth's magnetic field what could destroy the earth. I could not imagine that the rotation of the earth's outer core is independent from the rest of the earth's body, that means that it is improbable that the earth has a differential rotation like the planets Jupiter or Saturn have: And when it would be possible, why should the core stop its rotation? And a journey to the core is completely impossible: The pressure and temperature there is much too high for any material. But what about the movie itself? I gave him 5 points. Not boring, good actors, but long before the film ends you know who will survive and who will not. When I saw this film, it seems to me that it was a remake of Richard Fleischer's FANTASTIC VOYAGE (1965) through the human body. What can I finally say? Armageddon was unwillingly funny, THE CORE was not. The effects were good, but in directly comparison with the effects in FANTASTIC VOYAGE, almost 40 years earlier, I ask myself: Where is the progress? Regards, Hans-Dieter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive for a low-budget job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally saw this all the way through the other day, and was greatly impressed by the visuals, which were as striking as anything in the more recent, and similar, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW -- even though THE CORE cost a fraction of what TOMORROW did. In fact, I'll put THE CORE's hail storm in Japan and lightning storm in Rome against TOMORROW's flooding of Manhattan and tornado thumping of Los Angeles. Cheesy dialog and overemoting are par for the course in this genre, and THE CORE proves no exception. It is fun to watch Oscar winners Stanley Tucci and Hilary Swank chewing up the scenery in this knockoff of FANTASTIC VOYAGE and Armageddon, which you know they did for the paycheck and the opportunity to make a film the masses will see. Familiar faces Aaron Eckhart and Tcheky Karyo are much lower-key and amiable, and have some fun with their roles as stalwart heroes trying to save the planet. While endless shots of their earth-boring vehicle quickly grow tedious, this is more than made up for by an eye-popping sequence set inside a geode the size of Earth's moon. Also, for a PG-13 flick, there are some great death scenes. Clearly, the best of all these recent disaster epics is DEEP IMPACT, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this super cheesefest, especially when it can be had on video for $5 in Walmart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My All-Time Favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon the third time watching this movie, it has now become one of my all time favorites. I love the characters. I love the disaster effects. I love the trout bouncing off the window.When I first saw the movie in the theater on my birthday, I wasn't very excited. How good could a Journey to the Center of the Earth movie be with out monsters. But I was quite impressed with it. And it only gets better every time I watch it. The characters really drive this story. Delroy Lindo's Braz is great and seems so different from other Lindo characters. Tucci's Zimsky hits the mark well. Maniacal and devious yet worlds away from his character in Murder One. I can never get enough Tchéky Karyo, and here he plays another great character. I've been a big Bruce Greenwood fan ever since Nowhere Man, and it great to see him playing a heroic character. Having seen this, I now have to check out more Aaron Eckhart movies. Hilary Swank seems like a very odd choice for a leading lady in a summer popcorn movie, but after the movie my girlfriend complained about Swank being a skinny pretty girl like all Hollywood movies, so apparently she can pull this kind of role off too.The disaster effects above ground are spot on. The underground ones were different than I imagined but work well, and better than the 70's/80's psychedelic light tunnels used on just about every movie for those decades where travel happened else-wise. The DVD has great extras, but I'm hoping for another release. 10th Anniversary. Something. I just want to spend more money and get more stuff. Maybe some cheap direct to video sequels or a cartoon. They wouldn't quite make sense, but these sequels usually don't.This movie is just fun, and well worth your time.</fullReview>

Disater escalates.Loaded with a top-notch cast (albeit not as top-notch as Michael Bay's "Armageddon") this is bascially just a total waste of dialogue. Annoying characters, hokey dialogue and one of the most unbelievably lame and recycled plots ever committed to celluloid.It is (ah, this is ironic) a disaster. Shoulda figured, huh?2/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a good disaster movie. The Core wasn't one. It reminded me more of a low budget cable movie than the box office blockbuster it was billed as. Special effects were boring and unimaginative. There was no character development. The result of that was you really didn't care when someone was killed off. They killed off too many crew members, the ending would have been better with a third survivor. This movie just doesn't work. In a good movie of any genre the characters stay with you for several days after viewing it. The characters in the Core didn't even stay with me until the end of the movie. After seeing her in this movie I find it hard to believe Hilary Swank was even nominated for an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the description of this movie's plot and thought that it sounded rather good. Then, I made a tragic mistake: I actually watched it! This movie is a mess from start to finish.The plot is rather silly. A problem with the earth's outer core causes a breakdown in the electromagnetic field that basically means that we all have just a few months until we're fried by the sun's radiation. The movie never really explains what has caused this problem (except that it has something to do with a government experiment called "Destiny"). However, a rather unusual team of a young scientist (Aaron Echardt), his French friend (Tcheky Karyo), an arrogant older scientist who helped cause the problem in the first place (Stanley Tucci) an eccentric scientist/inventor (Delroy Lindo) and a hot-shot space shuttle pilot (Hilary Swank - I know, that piece of casting is worth a giggle) are called upon to save us all from destruction.Frankly, this movie is boring. I mercifully passed out for about a half an hour and awoke to discover that it hadn't become any more interesting in the interim. It is an absolute waste of time to watch this.I will in the end give it a rating of 2/10. It would have been 1, but it did teach me a little bit. Not being a scientist, I didn't know that the earth's outer core of molten lead rotated. So, for that bit of knowledge gained, it gets bumped up by a point. But it's still a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>silly but more importantly, dull and overlong (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you've seen the trailers and read the outline of 'The Core', it comes as no surprise that the movie is far-fetched, unbelievable, or even silly. So let's not go there. What the movie does lack is everything a disaster movie should have, namely pleasent characters (who ultimately become hero), good special effects and a nailbiting ending. 'The Core' has, well, none of the above really. I didn't find the two main heroes as sympathetic as they should be (especially Swank, who can do better), the effects are so-so but what really bugs me is the ending. After watching almost 2 hours (man this movie is too long) we see some unclear explosions on a computer screen, the controll-room-happy-and-cheering crap, and then the completely useless ocean bit (with the whales, - nature - saving them... yuk!). The only good part about it was that they didn't 'fall in love' as they always seem to do. In short: Skip this one, people! 2/10.</fullReview>

So to jump start the core again a team of researchers and tough guys have to drill down in the earth's crust, through several layers of magma in order to plant a few nukes near the core and so reactivate it again.Wow original I must admit, but scientifically so poorly executed. It's all science fiction of course but there is a limit before I start to say you are going over the top (And I like, better I love Armageddon!)Tension is kept high through the movie and the occasional disaster that strikes earth as the magnetic field fades is truly good cinema!

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the biggest piles I have ever seen. Despite the obviously huge budget spent, the producers obviously failed to spend more than minimum wage on a scientific advisor. If, unlike their advisor, you have a high school diploma from a reasonably decent school, you won't be able to watch this movie without being beaten with a scientific "inaccuracy" every three minutes. And by "inaccuracy", I am being quite generous. I realize that science fiction requires a suspension of disbelief, but this movie requires a suspension of brain matter. On top of all the voodoo they call science, the plot and acting are both contrived and pure non-dairy cheese. In closing, I am incredibly happy that I didn't spend any money on this film and I hope there are some extraordinarily p***ed investors out there who might be vengeful towards some shoddy movie makers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty good comedy, chiefly because the "hard science" in this flick contains so many mistakes that you can't help but laugh at it. Can lasers work underwater? They can't even work through rain! Can people in flimsy suits walk around in superheat, at 800,000 PSI? Can communications signals actually work through MILES of rock? Would it really be possible for a hacker to have done the stunts Rat does? Would air in a tank actually escape with a hissing noise when the exterior pressure is so high as to make such a thing physically impossible?As to the characters, they consist of every stereotype from such movies that you can imagine. Hunky scientist, brilliant female pilot, egotistical mad scientist, scrawny computer hacker (although I think the filmmakers did us a favor by NOT giving us a stereotyped preppy nerd- we get a physically hideous grunger instead.) And so on and so on.The only actor I really liked was Stanley Tucci. He's been one of my favorites since I saw him in the HBO film "Conspiracy." He turns up the acting full blast in an attempt to inject some excitement into the proceedings. Thank you, Mr. Tucci- at least YOU were looking out for us.The others were bland or pointless, while Rat is one of the ugliest, most unlikeable characters I've ever seen in a film.One of the writers, John Rogers, complained about someone attacking his film after the individual saw it at a pre-release screening; Rogers claims that it took him three years to get it made, which would certainly explain the fact that by the time of its release the market for this kind of disaster film had already dried up.</fullReview>

And, I didn't care for Armageddon either(see review). The plot concerns the deteriorating electromagnetic field of Earth. The special effects are not that special, and very little of the effects indicated that we were inside the Earth instead of on a computer drawing board for CGI. The best effects were in the beginning when we saw echos of The Birds. The script was one dimensional in that it focused entirely on the problem solving at hand, but almost never the characters' lives or relationships. Why not have cardboard cutouts of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck along for the ride? There were some bits of humor, but not enough. Other than one brief disagreement between the characters, there weren't any conflicts either. The obligatory one by one heroic deaths of characters for the good of mankind is a little too much at times also, sinking to acknowledged movie cliché level instead of being more humanly realistic. I mean doesn't anyone want to live any more? ** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

Personally my favorite scene was in the very beginning when the birds all begin to die and literally attack the city. But then again, that was the only well-done special effects (aside from the few ship scenes) because all of the lighting strikes looked terribly corny and stupid.All in all I would say that while your watching the movie you think its decent but by the time the entire movie sinks in you wonder why you decided to watch it in the first place.5.5\10</fullReview>

I enjoyed every minute of it. Excellent story, terrific cast, awesome special effects, those are the three phrases that describe this movie down to the core. There's a lot of famous actors that have alot of cameos. I think the one lady in here, she's the black woman for NASA or whatever it is, I haven't seen her since she starred in Scrooged with Bill Murray. Even DJ Qualls (Road Trip and The New Guy) had a very good part. This was a great movie down to THE CORE! By the way, if you wanna see this movie watch it on the big screen, or if you have 60" screen that will do good too. It makes it soooo much more intense, so much better. I watched it on a 27" screen and I thought it was awesome, so I am imagining a big screen would blow me out of this world. To sum it up, this movie is awesome down to the core!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***potential spoilers*** Some of you have said that you have to suspend belief to appreciate a film like this, and I agree. I don't mind letting some things go but here are a few that erk me.They designed the ship to eject a section of the hull when it has been "breeched". WHY did they expect that only the last section of the ship would be breeched. What would they do if the cockpit section was damaged?Why when there is an "EM tear" do the microwaves appear just in front of the Golden Gate bridge? On the computer screen it shows that is the only such occurance. Convenient that it just happens to appear in such a famous spot.Would it really be possible to communicate with people at the center of the earth? My cell phone sometimes doesn't work when I am on the surface?? We see no communication with the surface at all for a long section of the film and all of a sudden people are crying about the death of a crew member.The "space suites" were designed for HALF the temperature that it actually was down there. Not good planning! but miraculously they still work enough for a man to go out and turn a switch. Seems to me if it is TWICE as hot, you would be incapacitated pretty fast.Havent we seen too much of the super computer hacker who can do anything with his computers? An old bit to say the least.Having said all that I still saw the potential of the premise. The FX of the Golden Gate bridge were very well done. Stanley Tucci was excellent. The rest of the cast was quite good. The script was the failure. It sucked in every way! 4/10</fullReview>

While it is true that pigeons navigate over long distances with the help of earths magnetic field, they do have eyes to stear by as well and wouldn't go crazy like that... also how can you stay in radiocontact one gezillion miles down through solid rock.. the whole being able to jettison parts of the ship... hmm riiight... is it only me thinking, that if section 2 goes bad, by ejecting that part you then also say goodbye to every section behind it as well. Not to clever putting essential gear in the last section is it then...

		<fullReview>The Core (2003) D: Jon Amiel. Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, Tcheky Karyo, Richard Jenkins, Alfre Woodard, DJ Qualls, Bruce Greenwood. On present day Earth, scientists have discovered that the Earth's core will stop spinning shortly, causing death for all of the planet's inhabitants. The solution? To send several scientists who cover every single science fiction character cliché imaginable into the Earth's 1960's STAR TREK-looking inner core to fire nukes and restart Earth's spinning, while NASA's also clichéd characters watch, looking concerned at suspenseful moments and cheer when the heroes end up saving the day. Yup, that sums up this terrible, terrible film which contains some of the worst special effects in recent memory. NOTE: The only film I have ever walked out on. That tells you something! RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated for science-fiction fantasy and brief profanity.</fullReview>

To compare I'd have to birth a child between War Games and Armageddon. I was able to predict 3 out of the 4 crew deaths, and only missed on not getting the compulsory kiss between the male and female leads. Heck, I don't even know their names and I just watched it 10 minutes ago. I really wanted to see this movie in theaters, but missed it, too bad. The special effects were great on TV, probably rocked on the big screen. If you're looking for a good time this is your movie. Looking for almost 2 hours of unbelievable, but enjoyable entertainment, this is your movie. Do you believe a Jurassic Park is possible, this is your movie. Suspend disbelief and have the ride of the week. The title of my post is "Sweet Cheese", that is exactly what this movie is, it's totally BS and a rocking good time all at once.

I assume the scientific premise behind the story is nonsense but that doesn't matter, suspending belief is part of the fun of these movies. (I didn't quite understand how the computers kept working with all that electro-magnetic interference). It's the script where the film falls down badly.

Despite harsh feelings against this piece of crap, I actually payed to see this movie the week that it opened in theaters, and you know what? My initial distaste for this film was correct and justified. Occasionally the special affects are cool but other than that there are no likeable qualities about the movie whatsoever. Not even an Oscar winning actress in Hilary Swank could help this trash. It must have been the paycheck that drew her to this project because her previous choices since The Karate Kid 3 have been much better. Plain and simple this is not a good movie. The Core should never have been made. Obviously with the box office results that is evident. Hollywood complains about losses and copyright infringements but at the same time they dump 85,000,000 dollars into this crap. Go Figure.</fullReview>

You just wish the characters die fast, so that you can go home and watch something with more quality. Like a Steven Seagal-film, or even a porno-flick. (I bet it's not very hard to find a porno-movie with a better screenplay than "The Core".)As a norwegian film-rewiewer so wonderfully put it: "In the last scene I just waited for the camera to zoom out and show us the director with a sign that says "Just Kidding".

		<fullReview>For the life of me, I will NEVER understand why some people feel it necessary to judge a spectacle movie such as The Core like it was a character-driven Art House piece!Movies like this are the cinematic equivalent of a fireworks show: It's very pretty to watch, you "ooooh" and "aaaaaah" the the more spectacular shots, you clap after the big finale, and then you go about the rest of your life. And about all you ever remember is that you enjoyed the show. Movies like these are not meant to be life-changing, they are not meant to be avant-garde (unless you're making The Matrix), they are not meant to be a study in character flaws. They are meant to take your mind off your everyday life for a couple of hours and entertain you. And that is exactly what this movie does.I never judge a movie by how "original" it is. After thousands of years of storytelling, you can pretty much bet just about every story theme imaginable has been done. Rather, I judge on how well they tell the story they are telling. And I have to say that they told a pretty good story in this one. Sure, the characters are pretty much generic movie characters, but the roles are well filled with good character actors (except for the hacker kid played by DJ Qualls, that man has GOT to do something about that nose!) and they do their jobs so well that I found I actually cared about them and was saddened when they died.As for the scientific inaccuracies, two things: One, don't forget that it's called Science FICTION! Secondly, I saw this movie with a scientist (she works as a chemist), who granted that the ides of how our electromagnetic field is generated is mostly supposition. But the fact is that we really don't know how the field is generated, so why not a spinning core of liquid metal? She also liked that fact that the movie used science to resolve the problems encountered.The special effects were quite good in this movie, nothing spectacular or groundbreaking though.In the end this is a good popcorn flick, which is what it was meant to be.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Seven meets Armageddon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoilers warning !!!A quick word on the summary line. While examples are abundant in Hollywood movies, the recruiting of the seven (6 crew mambers plus wiz kid) is particularly reminiscent of The Magnificent Seven. Even more so is the fact that at the end, four are dead and three survive.The first half of the movie covers discovery of the imminent disaster, development of the recovery plan and recruitment of the team. The build-up of the excitement is quite well managed. The global magnitude of the disaster is depicted first in the mass death of pacemaker carriers in Boston and the blundering havoc of birds in London. The latter is particularly well filmed, and is slightly reminiscent of Hitchcock's classic. Rome is then chosen, as the site where the super magnetic storm unveils its full fury. The special effect in this one, however, is run-of-the-mill. When we get close to the end of the movie, the fourth movement of this "destruction symphony" is played out in the leaking "micro waves" melting down the Golden Gate Bridge.The second half, the real "core" of the film if you'll allow a feeble pun, is somewhat less gripping compared to many other movies in the same genre. One positive aspect is that the various "scientific" matters that lead to the verious tight situations is at least simple enough, and anyway, the audience has generally been educated to give little attention to them. The fairy tale final escape is accepted with a shrug. Doesn't every one love a happy ending?What makes the movie worth watching is the cast. There's something about Aaron Eckhart that makes him particularly suited to these academic roles, be it more serious drama like Possession or sci-fi as this one. Everybody says Hilary Swank is absolutely wasted here, but it's nice to have her around. Stanley Tucci does not have a Puck to play here (sorry hockey fans, I'm talking about Shakespeare) but still manages to bring some flare into the role of Doctor Zimsky. Delroy Lindo made a good switch from a gangster boss to a dedicated engineer.Finally, one chilling message, probably not treated too seriously in the movie, is the idea of MAD - mutually assured destruction. If something is to bring about the end of the world, it wouldn't be a natural disaster. It will be ourselves.</fullReview>

Another quote from the movie: 'Hang on - this isn't going to be subtle' sums up the movie more accurately though.This magma-churning budget-cgi spectacle is very average grade sci-fi, with the 'science' element sophisticated enough to pull in most twelve year old audiences or sci-fi fans / disaster movie fans who just want o rest the brain for a couple of hours. The 'world's' (i.e America's) top scientists come together on a journey to the centre of the earth to kick-start the it's molten core - after a failed cold war experiment has knocked it off kilter and so threatened the world. All the roles are fairly two-dimensional - it has about as much depth as a long episode of Startrek but without the cult enjoyment. Hilary Swank is quite good, if only to see her in a totally different character to her Oscar-winning performance in Boys Don't Cry (in Core she is a top NASA pilot, near genius, a capable captain, and also voluptuous, sensitive, feminine) but the part hardly stretches her abilities except to give her more experience is mainstream fare as a Ripley-with-sex-appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE COREThis movie starts with a brilliant landscape of science- fiction action and finishes with a dull defeat. It starts with a space shuttle having problems landing, so they land in the middle of Los Angeles. The action, the visual effects and the music is good. Then Bostonians are dropping dead because their pacemakers go haywire, a vast flock of pigeons going berserk in Trafalgar Square, the Golden Gate collapsing and Rome reduced to rubble. After that, it's pretty predictable, boring and irritating. It made me want to leave the theater many times. After that The Pentagon recruits a team of scientists, a female NASA pilot and a computer nerd and five of them board a special machine designed by a hardcore geographer to transport a payload of plutonium to the earth's center. With no major stars present we can't be sure who'll die first. It's pretty clear, though, that the French geologist isn't going to make it - he's the wrong nationality and has a photograph of his lovely kids in his wallet. As in most films of this kind, the impending disaster isn't just God's doing - Cold War scientists are also to blame. I do not recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a regular voter in this forum but having seen the movie despite the critics recommendations, i thought it important(!) to speak out. If the theme of extinction-level-events (ELE) and our ability to deal with it intrigues you, certainly, you will enjoy this movie. I agree somewhat with the few that have called this movie an Armageddon without the sentimental muck.The movie is well-paced and engaging throughout. The main characters are the best you can hope for in a movie of this genre/scope/ambition. While they have their share of predictable traits they do not come through as trite. Certainly a lot of that has to do with solid, restrained performances by solid actors. Swank, Tucci, Delroy Lindo are good as always. Eckhart is a revelation to me. That the dialogs are crisp and mature, helps. The exigency of the situation is not pressed on us with overwrought dialogues. In-fact, there is a refreshing amount of levity/skepticism to balance out the fancifulness of certain ideas. The characters are revealed to us to an appropriate degree. We are spared an overdose of idiosyncrasies. There are no ghosts of past happenings, hurts and failures and other haunting motivations driving them (as if it always takes something especially bad to make us especially good).The writers/director understand that what the characters seek to do is fairly heroic in itself and for the most part avoid the lure of cheap supplemental devices such as national anthems, fond farewells, distraught family, friends and lovers (how unpalatable are they?). Again, that is not to say that the movie is devoid of predictable plot elements. There's quite a few but that won't bother you unless you are expecting a ground breaking movie.A common criticism that this movie has been subject to is how far-fetched certain ideas are. Indeed, in the quest to save the planet, a lot of things come together and work successfully in a very short of time. But still, i did not find the ideas specially unacceptable/distracting. Though a student of science, i was unable to say that such-and-such thing in the happening/solving of this ELE can't happen or can't work. Besides, one suspects, that if we were faced by such an eventuality it actually might take a few fanciful ideas and a lot of luck/gumption to avoid the fate of the beloved dinosaurs.</fullReview>

And then at the crazy pigeons, especially the one that got run over! (No I am not emotionless it was really really corny!) This movie was the funniest movie I have seen all year!It was totally unbelievable and I was glad to see that it even made fun of itself. If you go in with a light heart you too will pee yourself laughing, if you go in expecting something sombre you still will pee yourself laughing!

		<fullReview>'The Core' is another "save the world" movie, attempting to change the genre a bit, by not going into outer space. Instead the concept revolves around the inner core of the earth and how it has stopped spinning. As usual a band of brave human beings are selected to deal and hopefully nuetralize the problem.'The Core' falls very short in the acting department, with Hillary Swank playing a role that never should have been given to her in the first place. Surrounded by B-Grade actors turning in B-Grade performances along with the fact that her role had only B-Grade scope to it anyways, results in an absolutely sub-par showing on her part. Aaron Eckhart played his role to the best of his ability, even though that ability is only so good.Direction is key in movies, as the director is expected to keep people on the edge of their seats, Jon Amiel had me looking around the room to see how many people were sleeping through his Lava explosions. If there is one saving grace to this film, its the special effects, the effects directors definately worked hard to bring the conception of the Core of the earth to life.Nevertheless, this is a weak movie, and I would only recommend it if you had nothing to do, and wanted some eye candy. 5/10</fullReview>

The Core is a really good FX flick with some great one-liners and humor, but it's really predictable in it's plot.My friends and I were saying lines before they happened, and even figured out that the ship would surface near Hawaii. We even guessed where they'd get the extra plutonium from (at least 10 minutes before it became a factor in the movie), and we were almost right on who died and in what sequence.As for the acting, DJ Qualls did a better job portraying a kid that was suffering from the stress and overwhelimng fear of doom than ANY of the characters in the ship.All in all a fun romp, but not very believable. 5/10</fullReview>

But when they decide to go into the world, it's just a lame rehash of another beat film, Armageddon. The acting is wooden or hysterical (Stanley Tucci especially), the part where they leave the ship inside the earth, oh it's only 8000 psi but the suits are protecting us is pure silliness.

		<fullReview>Uh-oh! The center of the earth has stopped spinning, and if we don't start it back up again, we may have to cancel `As the World Turns!'Dr. Josh Keyes, a geology professor (who just happens to be giving a lecture that corresponds to the imminent disaster), discovers that the electromagnetic field of the earth is breaking up, which can only mean one thing: a movie absolutely has to be made about this, and a hair piece will be necessary atop the dome of Stanley Tucci.Dr. Keyes goes straight to the White House with his information. A room full of Generals with confused, vacant stares listen as he uses such elevated language as, `Everybody on earth is dead in a year.' He needs to put it on their level, so he lights a peach on fire, thus convincing the Generals, and sparking protests from die-hard vegans.The problem is that there is no way to get the core spinning again, much less get to the center of the earth. Stanley Tucci responds with intelligence and a straight face: `What if we could?'`Well, a scientific expedition like that would definitely hurt sales of 'Journey to the Center of the Earth!' proclaims Jules Verne.Despite his protests, they travel to the center of nowhere, where Delroy Lindo has been building a ship that can travel to the center of the earth. What luck! Delroy explains that the ship is made of an element called `unobtainium.' I guess that "Unobtainium" represents THE CORE on the Periodic Table of Critical Acclaim!Dr. Keyes, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, and some French guy in a role that usually goes to a Russian decide that they need a pilot. Assuming that the center of the earth is probably a lot like outer space, they go to NASA. The best they could get was Hilary Swank, who narrowly escaped being fired for crash landing a space shuttle in the middle of LA. Good choice! Their plan is to drop 5 1000-megaton atomic bombs into the outer core of the earth, hoping the explosions will restart the motion of the core. They realize pretty quickly that these bombs aren't big enough, so they turn to THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH and WATERWORLD, the biggest bombs in history!On their way to the core, the super-nerds (excuse me, they prefer `terranauts') start dying one by one in acts of action-movie heroism. It's pretty formulaic, and, as always, the most attractive of the crew survive!THE CORE isn't a bad way to spend 2 hours, but it's a really bad way to spend $7.50. I suggest sneaking in.Rating --- Princess Leia (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with one review which stated that the first half hour is interesting. However, during that time you can see exactly how the movie is going to end. I've never seen a movie so predictable. If I was closer to the door I would have left about an hour in. I've also never heard a movie audience clap "sarcastically" before, but this one sure did. The teenagers behind me couldn't wait for it to get over with. Finally, I know the concept is just an excuse for an action flick, but it could still have been written so that you at least cared what happened. Cliche after cliche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Core: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being pushed back several times, The Core is finally in theaters. If anyone tells you that it is bad, see for yourself. It may not have great development in characters and plot, and it may not be the easiest to understand, but if fun is what you look for in movies, fun is what you'll get from this movie.Aaron Eckhart is Josh Keyes, a science teacher who is teaching his college students some of the same stuff we're talking about in eighth grade earth science. He gets called in to investigate odd deaths that occurred. Meanwhile, Rebecca `Beck' Childs (Hilary Swank) safely lands the space shuttle Endeavor after going more than 150 miles off target. They are both to help restart the earth's core spinning, since that is what caused the deaths and the shuttle to go off target, since it's destroying technology.Along with Josh and Beck, Dr. Brazleton (Delroy Lindo), who created the device that they are going into the earth with, and Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), a famous scientist, are going into the earth to trigger a nuclear device that will get the core to spin. Believe me, if you think this immediate plot is inconceivable, than you're in for two hours plus of things that don't make sense.To make a successful movie, you need many elements, but the major one is to keep the audience enthralled with whatever is on screen, whether it be a comedy, drama, horror, or an action movie. I was enjoying myself during the overlong runtime of The Core. I was entertained, which I feel is more important than convincing acting, a great script or plot, or perfect music cues. Of course, all of those are important, but without wanting to enjoy yourself, you can't see a successful movie.The special effects were numerous and amazing, although they don't really look like they'd be in the center of the earth. I mean, come on! Crystals? I couldn't help not believing what I was supposed to be seeing. And, during while the crew was in the crust, you could see the studio where it was being shot out of the window, not to mention other continuity errors, like the spelling of the secret project. As I've said before, there's not really and plot or character development, but when a movie's as entertaining as this, you won't mind.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for sci-fi life/death situations and brief strong language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... after having saw this movie. Sure you can't expect plausibility, science, acting, heck, even the rudimentary basics of writing with mindless popcorn films such as this, but please, if you are going to recycle a movie, try to make it a tad bit unique?The plot is the nearly the same as Armageddon (woefully horrible film itself but technically superior). The only difference now is that we no longer have the wrongfully portrayed dumb Americans trying an implausible method to stop a world destroyer from space, but instead wrongfully portrayed dumb Americans causing the world destroyer themselves and then using implausible method to stop it. I'm pretty sure one of the writers went to visit his kid in grade school one morning and somehow concocted this monstrosity there:Writer: "Son, I have absolutely no idea where I'm going in my life." Son: "Daddy, lookie what I drew with my crayons!"The characters in the movie are about as stiff and two-dimensional as that piece of paper dear son drew on. Once again, the fate of the entire world rests on a crew comprised of zany cartoon (for crying out loud) characters which also includes Bruce Willis-wannabe, hard-ass military-type person, and your typical computer geek. Why didn't they include a token black guy in the movie as well, or maybe Steve Buscemi?This movie is ridiculous. The more I saw what they pass for acting and movie-making, the more I hated it, and the angrier I got.-73/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever wonder why even the most horrible, horrible films seem to get glowing reviews anyway? Simple... people are paid to write them. I saw this movie, through somewhat of a "sneak preview", and I DON'T work as an intern or publicist in the industry, so I'm a little more apt to tell you the truth. The truth is: One... this movie SUCKS. I could go into detail but why, its awful on new levels. All standard disaster movies movies are pretty bottom of the barrel to begin with, but I tell you, this one takes the cake. People will be studying this trash for years just trying to get a grip on how it could actually be made. Two... don't listen to anyone trying to tell you that this movie is "campy" or "funny". They already smell the sweet stench of death on this intended action-packed epic turned comedy. Ever see that "Quick and the Dead" movie with Sharon Stone a few years ago? Exaaaactly. When the top brass realize that they've put out a colossally bad flick like this, and that no one will take it seriously, then they HAVE to spin it up. And three... take notice of the multitudes of TV spots, Trailers, even POPUPS among all the other advertising for this garbage. Who are they trying to kid, would they put this much effort into press if the movie was decent?</fullReview>

How can a pressure suit, made out of soft fabric, protect them against thousands of pounds of pressure? -- your mind will number faster than it would after 10 minutes of YuGiGo or reading a Grisham book.

Maybe it could have been saved with some cool effects, but they were simply awful. Maybe it would have worked if Eckhart and Swank would have played up the camp factor of such a ridiculous project, but instead the went for soap opera-level overacting.

		<fullReview>It's three years later and who still remembers or talks about this movie? It says something about the quality of the movie that's just plain poor. The story is implausible and filled with unlikely and yet at the same time also predictable events. "The Core" is a formulaic disaster flick with all the stereotypical and predictable events and characters in it you could expect. Yes, they even managed to put a love-story into the movie!I don't know what it is with Jon Amiel movies. I thought that his movie "Copycat" was great and is a bit of an underrated thriller but that movie also already was filled with unoriginal moments and 'borrowed' heavily from other movies. "The Core" does the same and its a terribly predictable and because of that also not so fun movie to watch. No, Mr. Amiel is not the most talented person in the business at the moment.The concept of the movie was already ridicules and the execution of it makes the story even more implausible. The movie is filled with unlikely and unoriginal events. Of course during the 'disasters', the national monuments of the countries are the first things to be destroyed. How original. And seriously, did every character had to die in a heroic sacrificing way?Another problem with the movie is that it doesn't have likable characters. We never really get to care about any of them and because of that also the emotional moments in the movie are flawed. Perhaps this is also due to the dialog that is just plain horrible at times. It's a waste of a great cast. Hilary Swank, Tchéky Karyo, Delroy Lindo, DJ Qualls, those are some good actors but their talent is wasted in the movie.From a movie like this you could at least expect some great special effects but also with that the movie disappoints. The special effects are below average and they never know to convince the viewer.I can think of no reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. Granted that it does have some entertainment value but the cheesy story and characters make this movie far from a must see.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: The earth's core stops spinning, causing deadly electromagnetic phenomena throughout the globe. The end result will be the destruction of all life on the planet by way of deadly cosmic radiation. The only hope for mankind is for a team of scientists and engineers to singlehandedly jumpstart the core, burrowing to the depths of the planet with an experimental, high-tech vehicle.Critique: If not taken the least bit seriously, "The Core" works as a mindless action movie. The science is plainly ridiculous (I'm willing to be corrected on this, but I don't think a few nukes would have any effect on the earth's core, and I'm not even going to ask how that ship was able to maintain contact with mission control). For the purposes of this film, however, it doesn't matter. In fact, I suspect that hacker subplot was deliberately put there as a signal that no one involved in this project took it seriously. The performances are earnest, though Alfre Woodward (whom I will always think of as Lily from "Star Trek: First Contact") is completely wasted and D.J. Qualls (the guy from "Road Trip," no less) simply doesn't belong here at all. Overall, I'd say that Hilary Swank and Stanley Tucci (as a brave astronaut and cocky scientist, respectively) come of best, or at least they made the biggest immediate impressions on me. On the other hand, leading man Aaron Eckhart didn't really impress me with his performance here, though he's game. I suspect he's more at home with character acting. Some of the special effects are obviously computer-generated, but overall this movie will adequately serve as summer escapism.Rating: 6/10 or (**1/2)Released by Paramount Pictures</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where I on earth or in earth do I begin to even try to give this incredible movie the kudos and recognition it deserves.Without doubt the greatest Hollywood world saving disaster flick of all time.The way the writer has taken real technology and scientific understanding that exists today and formed this all too realistic scenario into the movie we now have before us is chilling. The Oscar worthy performances combined with special effects that will turn your hair white make this high energy sci-fi roller-coaster of a movie for the whole family. So sit back make some popcorn and prepare yourself for the experience of a lifetime, and be rocked to your very core!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jules Verne meets Alfred Rosenberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Core is a boy meets girl journey to the centre of the earth in which the all American couple emerge triumphant from the bowels of the planet to continue the WASP gene pool ? Jules Verne meets Alfred Rosenberg. Along the way other male rivals are summarily dispatched which is a common theme in blockbusters but not often as blatantly racist as in The Core. The mad bad and dangerous to know scientist in the form of Stan Tucci at his camp best has stopped the earth's core rotating against the advice of his younger square jawed bumbling acolyte to whom the task of restarting it befalls. Fortunately they discover another scientist who has not only discovered a way of boring through solid rock but created molecules that can withstand even the most immense pressures and temperatures - work that would normally take years, huge teams and mega-budgets but which he has managed in a few years in a remote desert hanger funded by a few credit cards no doubt. His Rotating Rabbit type machine provides the phallic metaphor that will penetrate mother earth so the seduction and the sexual act are combined and interlinked in this film. The mission to save the world from catastrophe and the rivals in the mating game are a motley crew of fractious individuals whose personal agendas keep getting in the way of The Bigger Picture. The subterranean machine is driven by a female Space Shuttle pilot whose qualifications for "terranaut" other than being able to fly in outer space is to have crashed the shuttle on the wrong side of the continent and provide a much needed comedy moment as she pulls up short of a worker on some scaffolding who has hitherto been oblivious to the tons of screeching high technology hurtling towards him down the Los Angeles river. She is uber-woman and she drives her own phallus which pretty soon in the film she is guiding unerringly towards the hot molten yet stilled core. The drama, if we can forget the overall narrative of saving the world, which most of the cast have done anyway, involves which suitor will finally mate with Captain Childs ? yes, the child-woman. We already know that the square jawed guy is the one, but we first have to enact the symbolic ethnic and oedipal conflict where genius and race are excised from the equation. First to go is the father figure and I did enjoy the poetic way his mind was broken by a shard of crystal and his fall back to eternal rest in a stygian sea of glowing magma saved by his heat suit or a shortfall in the special effects budget from vanishing in a flash of vaporized flesh. The European, the African American and the camp, literate, intellectual would all follow before the final consummation. The climax of the mission is a series of carefully timed orgasms represented in CGI by spreading balls of light that privileges orgasm over impregnation. The diminished phallus rests on the seabed before being recovered?.. there is a thesis of subtext in this film that I have barely scratched the surface of ? scuse the pun - that doesn't diminish the central prominence of a nasty racist narrative that is the real core - surprising from a filmmaker like Jon Amiel. The producers managed to resist the kind of James Bond moment where he is discovered necking the co-star after saving the world. Did the world move for me? Not a jolt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At a single moment around the world, people with pacemakers drop dead on the spot. In London pigeons start smashing into buildings as they lose their ability to navigate. Dr Josh Keyes is called to the Government to present his theory that the liquid core of the earth is stopping spinning causing a breakdown of the earth's magnetic field. This will continue to cause small things before destroying all electronic equipment within months and then exposing the earth to the destructive effects of solar wind - scorching the earth of life in a year. In an attempt to kick-start the core a team of scientists are put together to launch a daring mission to the earth's core.By the time this film was made and released in the UK, the apocalyptic disaster movie bandwagon had pretty much passed and been forgotten; as a result I don't think it did that well at the box office and I didn't bother to give it a look. On video I give it a go even though I was aware that the small screen might well take away from the impact of the special effects on the big screen. The plot is nonsense of course, and the script reflects this with almost every line that is said. Whereas Armageddon and Deep Impact had a clear, easy to understand problem, The Core requires the total suspension of belief - a problem that takes away from every line of dialogue.The effects are good but the problems experienced in the inside of the earth are not as interesting as those experienced, say, in space. The film has several scenes of destruction at various points around the earth but these are weak compared to other sci-fi disaster movies. The scene in San Francisco was really good (despite being silly - a window that small in the sky) but my pleasure at seeing a London scene was spoilt when I saw it was simply a big bird attack! Basically I never fully got the impression of a planet on the edge of destruction.The crew die off one at a time but few of them really die with tension, rather the plot tries to wring sentimentality out of each death - something that doesn't really work because the characters are more just cardboard rather than real people. That said, it is a strength of the film that there are no obvious stars so, at the start, you're not sure who will die and who will live - however in reality if you guessed you'd probably be right.The effects are good but, because the core of the earth is not as much a part of reality in the same way as space is, the effects don't have that much of an impact even if they do look good. The cast are a less than stellar bunch but is full of well-known faces. Eckhart will be disappointed if he expected this to be his step to the mainstream, but he is quite good at turns - especially one scene where he lets rip at Childs. Swank is so-so, as indeed are most of the cast. Lindo takes the money and runs, Tucci is actually quite good, Greenwood is OK and Karyo is always an interesting proposition I find. Woodward is wasted in a control room role - she is far too talented for this stuff. Qualls is amusing but nothing more.Overall this is not an awful film - just a run-of-the-mill one. It fails to really do anything well and, while it has good moments, the lasting impression is one of mediocrity in a film that is rapidly leaving my memory barely hours after watching it.</fullReview>

The cast is game and the script by Cooper Layne and John Rogers provides enough tension and some unbalanced science that comes across thisclose as to being believable. (Dir: Jon Amiel)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The earth's inner core has stopped rotating, causing the planet's magnetic field to deteriorate. Life begins to change dramatically. 32 people with pacemakers, suddenly drop dead. The Golden Gate Bridge collapses, sending hundreds of people plunging to their deaths. In Trafalgar Square, pigeons lose their ability to navigate, flying into crowds, slamming into windshields and causing drivers to lose control of their cars. Scrambling to resolve the crisis, government and military officials call upon Dr. Josh Keyes and a team of scientists to travel into the earth's core in a subterranean craft to Detonate a nuclear device that will reactivate the core and save the world from sure destruction.....Five years after Bruce saved the earth with Armageddon, Jon Amiel decides to make a timely disaster movie with an amazing cast. Some of the actors here are brilliant, but blimey Charly, the script and the narrative are awful.The first act of the film isn't helped by such a turgid build up. The Pacemaker scene reminded me of The Happening and the other disasters just consisted of really bad special effects and bad music.Eckhart and Swank look bemused by the whole thing, and once they are all on board, the cast may as well have numbers on there back so they can spell it out for the audience who dies first, who sacrifices themselves, who lives, and who has the most surprising death.It's devoid of tension, or urgency, and you know it's going to be fine at the end. I just didn't expect the Moonraker type ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did this load of garbage really have a $60,000,000 budget? Absolutely scandalous! The pseudo-scientific poop on which this movie Is based Is an Insult to the intelligence of the entire human race. It would appear - If this trash Is anything to go by - that the Americans have run out of different ways they can save the world! They've saved us from Aliens countless times,disease,zombies,killer bees - you name It,the good old U.S. of A. have been there for us. But this Is really scraping the barrel. Anyone who remembers the laughable but entertaining 'Journey to the centre of the Earth'(with Doug McLure)will,I'm sure,consider THIS debacle to be far behind In believability. Just a few minutes In, we see Hilary Swank In the Space shuttle absolutely plastered In make up!Considering that It costs around 18 thousand dollars per person per hour for the shuttle crew to, I'm sure NASA would be quite happy for Its female crew members to spend an hour or two putting on make up - and not just ANY make-up,but special 'space make-up' that won't float around causing heaven-knows what problems! This movie makes a mockery of science and scientists and contains more falsehoods,inaccuracies and Scientific Mumbo-Jumbo than any film I've ever seen. Where In heavens name did the money go? One can only imagine that It went Into the pockets of the massively overpaid actors who crawl through this mire of a script. Instead of watching this, watch paint dry for a couple of hours. The kiddies will love the 'special effects', but only the under fives. A waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilary Swank looks like Matt Damon in a wig. You know it's true. Either they're twin brothers separated at birth, or Damon's got a secret career as a Oscar winning drag queen.Jon Amiel's "The Core" stars Matt Damon as Hilary Swank. He plays her playing Major Rebecca Childs, a hotshot pilot tasked with piloting a giant drill into the centre of the earth. Why? Because the earth's magnetic fields have gone crazy. It's Damon's job to fly into the earth's heart, plant a series of nuclear charges ? Americans love fixing things with bombs ? and get out, thereby restoring the earth's "proper magnetic fields".The film's unintentionally hilarious and totally anti-science; like watching Sarah Palin big up the Pope at a Flat Earth Convention. Some of the things it teaches us: intense heat melts metal but not human flesh, the earth's core is pretty cold, lightning is attracted to stone, and you can be a two time Oscar winner and still make bad choices.5/10 ? So bad its good, so long its bad or not bad enough to be good? Worth watching only for Matt Damon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a beautiful mess! From Stanley Tucci as a geologist hounded like any "rock star" (pun intended) by groupies and autograph seekers to Hilary Swank as a poor leader because -as she told by Bruce Greenwood's character - she has never failed (yes, only good leaders fail (uh, whut?)). The primary enjoyment of the movie comes from watching Eckhart and the cast try to emote and react on what is so obviously a cramped set to plot points don't even make theoretical sense (wouldn't it have been a lot quicker and less dangerous to just drill into the core from multiple points on the surface?). Props to Tucci who acts his heart out with Eckhart and Swank who can barely keep their snickering suppressed as they plow through what seems like an improvised script ("No, I am a boring college professor. Wrong place, wrong place.", "That was the bravest thing I've ever seen"). If the laugh-along script and story don't amuse then trying to answer questions such as: why exactly did the U.S. government hire an obviously disturbed hacker and give him control over the internet, if the mission depends on the actions of the weapons specialist, why send just 1 of those but 2 geology professors, and why can't you smoke on a common commercial aircraft but smoking on a highly experimental nuclear-powered craft on which the fate of the world lies is OK? In short, add this to "Point Break", "The Day After Tomorrow", and "The Abyss" as films that are awful but awful on so many levels that you have to ask if the director is just f-ing with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great B movie that could have been an A movie *spoilers inside*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well to me this movie is a classic, I watch it when I goto bed at night a lot, just for background noise. The movie is, it itself, a decent movie....as long as you don't know a lot of science. If they would have worked closer with some real scientists they could have fixed a few plot holes and science facts. If you don't want to read any spoilers, stop now and turn away. For the rest of you: 1. Some of the special effects shots for over dramatized without thinking them through, such as a scene where cars are melting but a guy is inside cool as a cucumber, getting a sunburn when he sticks his arm out in the same beam that is melting cables.2. The cobalt cocoon scene. I believe this was originally written to be in the Mantle where the average temp is 1600F give or take....in the movie, they talk about the outside temperature being 5000F which is almost DOUBLE the melting point of cobalt. THAT WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE.3. The whole concept of them dropping the bombs without being able to detach the compartments is crazy when they say that's how they were going to do it, but it never designed it that way and died having to engage the gear. I think they started reaching for ways to kill off main characters and had to get creative.4. Also has anyone considered what would happen if one of the upper compartments got damaged? The front is the control room, the only one with the front laser as well, so it would have to not get damaged and if the 2nd got damaged all of the rest would be lost too....and crushed since they would all be compromised still being connected. Not very well thought out.With all that said and a lot more I could nitpick this is still a very enjoyable movie. The acting is fantastic, most of the time, and their deaths can be moving. All in all well worth the watch, just leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Latterday 'science-fiction' fantasies like this make you realise just how good - especially for their time - similar movies were of 30, 40 or even 50 years ago. I hate to bang on about it, but a publisher did it to me. What ultimately matters - the core, if you will - of any scenario is STORY. And STORY is something that happens to people you care about. All the special-effects, CGI and pyrotechnics in the world won't help one jot if the characters fail to elicit your empathy.Just compare this twaddle with an oldie from 1959. 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' contained the same preposterous hokum. In fact, it contained more. A great ocean, and carnivorous prehistoric animals (with nothing to eat) at the centre of the Earth! Utterly ridiculous. But it worked as an adventure because we cared about the characters. Non of them had to demonstrate their worth by sacrificing themselves in implausibly contrived heroics. They didn't need to; we knew they would if called upon. They just got on with the job of drawing us into their dilemma with them. And we happily went. Their budget was limited. Special effects were primitive. CGI hadn't even been dreamt of. Yet the imaginative use of location, mirror painting, lighting and lizard prosthetics kept their respective generation enthralled. I know; I was there.'The Core' had nothing new to offer. Despite some 45 years of technical wizardry to draw upon, effects were cheap as cheap could be. The CGI was paralysingly obvious. Its academic 'expert' was about as believable and authoritative as a second-rate primary school teacher. The militarists and politicians just so many faces for their parts. Any science came out of 'Screwball Weekly'. A piece of incinerated fruit as the clincher? Go to the back of the class. And so many new ideas all at once - just when they were needed; A crush-proof substance, a sonic/laser/bonkers boring device, a heatproof (and thermally shockproof) material, and a cooling system that defied understanding. No wonder the cast have permanent expressions of confusion and doubt. They probably wondered if their pay-cheques were equally fantastic.I think I saw just about every disaster/fantasy adventure movie ripped-off somewhere or other here. We heard a script that was hardly worth listening to, delivered with the sort of transparent disbelief that would hardly have stretched the expressive strings of the Tracy family. I think I saw Hilary Swank as the now-obligatory smart-ass female. One or two other faces seemed familiar. Nothing heavy enough to sink below the mantle. Most of them got killed-off in ways that were suitably clichéd.And that's it. Don't waste your time here. Watch an oldie like '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea', or 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth'. Or check-out just about any episode of 'Thunderbirds'. At least with them; what you see is what you get. And the acting is much more believable. For any who may have wondered why drilling is sometimes referred to as boring; here's the explanation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before we start I gave it six just because i have soft spot for crappy action movies, speed 2 springs to mind, i think its great, anyway. (You'd be forgiven for stopping reading now) The core is actually not as bad as it could or indeed is made out to be, the effects are good the acting is good, you've gotta love Delroy Lindo and Aaron Eckhart but Swank is not on form, i think she needs to stay away from action movies and a good director to get the best out of her. The story, yes, is insane but that didn't bother me, we all need to suspend our disbelief more than usual sometimes.But if you've seen Armageddon you've seen pretty much everything in this film except better. And the amount of things in this film that seem to be taken straight from Armageddon I'm surprised Bay doesn't sue. You can tell Jon Amiel has a wee penchant for Michael Bay, he uses the silhouette against the setting sun shot that Bay loves so much.If you like s****y action flicks like myself you give it a watch otherwise... best steer clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually like disaster movies, you take the scenario with a pinch of salt and enjoy the action scenes and the suspense. With The Core however the imagination is stretched beyond acceptable limits as it is obviously so much rubbish that even a non technically minded person would twig it was twaddle. It's not as if the acting was well done, for it isn't, neither the script which is poor and even the effects are second rate. It must be difficult coming up with good ideas for new movies, but The Core scrapes the bottom of the barrel. Don't bother with this one, there are plenty others in the disaster genre that are much more credible.</fullReview>

I didn't find anything offensive about The Core, it was just another "end of the world" theme movie. But The Core has done something to me that no other "end of the world" movie has done. It has shown me that I most be claustrophobic. I watched this movie on a pay-per-view channel and decided to buy the film. But when I tried to watch the DVD again I found that I could only watch it in clips. It took me three days to watch the entire movie. I found it terribly intense. Armageddon doesn't do that to me although I like the theme. We know that Bruce Willis is going to save the world so we just sit back and see how he does it. But The Core really had suspense and I was impressed with the special effects. I don't think it's the worse movie ever made. I like it. For the worse movie ever made just pick out any! Steven Spielberg film. There really bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK people - 5.4?!? Wow. That's an EXTREMELY generous score for this 'cinematic' turd. I'm truly shocked to find The Core's rating is that high... after being here for 5 years, I thought IMDb was at least half-full of snobs and movie nerds (like myself). Maybe not.This is truly Bottom 500 material. The DVD cases should be labeled: "WARNING: Core is a noun and a verb. Exposure to this movie may result in the sensation of having your skull cored out." The reasons The Core more closely resembles the core of what's wrong with Hollyweird than a movie about the core of planet Earth are detailed everywhere else, so I won't repeat them here. Frankly, how anyone (even the "just turn off your brain and have fun!" apologists) can justify giving it anything above a 4 is beyond me... yet a significant number of voters must have given it 7s and 8s! I turned off my brain, wanted (and tried) to enjoy it and STILL feel my 3 vote is generous. You've heard the phrase "eye candy", right? The Core is eye arsenic.My only theory is that most people who actually possess brains have avoided this 'movie' entirely (unlike myself) and have not voted - while those who found it enjoyable are the same people who were unable to detect its stench from a mile away... thus, the above-average ranking. It gives me hope to think that if the same cross-section of viewers saw The Core as saw The Godfather, this video vomit would have the 3 it deserves.The Core: as in, "rotten to".</fullReview>

Serge we really didn't get to know all that much, so it didn't anger me as much when he died as everyone else. Dr. Zimsky was the antagonist of this whole movie. When two were dead and he saw it was almost impossible, he said to just go home. None of the others wanted to and the majority got it. Finally to Dr. Keyes.

A college professor, and some so called Wonder Brain Scientists tried to solve the problem by helping the US Government design and send a Earth ship into the bowels of the earth to stop an eruption of the earth's core. There are many problems in order to start this project and there are also many fights among the selected crew. There is a one woman aboard the ship and these men are so busy, the thought of sex is out of the question. This is a film that sent an Earth Ship directing past Hell into a big glob of Fire and Flames.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I couldn't sit through this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just unwatchable. I don't mind the fact that the "science" is utter nonsense. Though they could at least use scientific sounding explanations for things instead of dumbing their nonsense down to the level where any retarded 5 year old could grasp it. It actually made me laugh and think about how these people are Hollywood actors who don't know any more about the earth's geology than any guy you might meet at a bar on a Saturday night.What really, REALLY ruins this movie is the fact that one of the scientists is the most obnoxious a**hole I've ever seen portrayed on the screen. He goes into an absolute rant that the female scientist shut off a section of the ship after it was damaged (in order to save the crew and the rest of the ship), meaning that they couldn't save a guy who was trapped back there. He thrusts a picture of the guy's wife and kids in front of the woman's face, and generally acts like he's going to pee himself. Not one minute later, this same self-righteous prick is going on another pants-wetting rant about how some other scientist is even worse than the woman, accompanied by a bunch of technical gibberish that would make a high school dropout chuckle at the stupidity of it. I'm sorry, I just had to change the channel at that point. I've seen more level-headed people on the Jerry Springer show.The special effects were fairly good and there were some entertaining situations, but this central character was absolutely unbearable. It makes me wonder if there exists a more idiotic group of people on the face of the planet than can be found in the city known as Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mining for unobtainium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters are broadly sketched, of course. The science is ludicrous, but no one asks you to buy into it. Perhaps the film does seem to take itself a bit too seriously at times. However, in a film where the rules of the day are constructing phallic, earth-penetrating ships from a material known as "unobtanium" perhaps some of the common expectations we hold for films should be thrown aside.The easy comparison for the film is, of course, the lamentable Armageddon. One only has to look at how the characters are portrayed in the two films to realize that the makers of the Core see themselves as working on a higher level. The assembly of a squad of technicians almost always stands in for the squad of film-making technicians: whereas the heroes of Armageddon are working-class, unsophisticated, and rather haphazard, here we have scientists, engineer-dorks, a scientist who steals other peoples ideas and a tremendous NASA over-achiever.However, The Core reaches beyond even self-conscious winking at the audience, and works as actual poetic metaphor. The story itself, when they enter the magma, has sacrificial and cthonic connotations that are reminiscent of Ancient Greek tales of descent into the underworld. Indeed, at nearly every stage of the journey, a sacrifice is made, culminating with our scientist-heroes actually arguing over who gets to die for the cause.The first time I saw this film, I found the concept amusing - Hollywood guilt transformed into the wholesale slaughter of their screen surrogates. On returning to the film, I find that I can pick up on the subtleties of emotion. I deny the very idea that the film is bad then: the actors have absolute conviction. Aaron Eckhart, coming from a long-line of scumbag characters, makes for an authentically plebeian hero. When Stanley Tucci begins to crack under the high-pressure ending, one cannot help but wince and empathize. As Delroy Lindo becomes overwhelmed by the destructive light of magma,the effect is more than simply profoundly sad for this man who wishes to shed his own blood for his ship, but reaches the near-transcendental.Everyone (in movies, that is) has been to space. Space is easy. The Core takes us into a subterranean journey which, although occasionally wallowing in clichés, manages to be something quite a bit more. The use of rich purples and blacks as Eckhart carries fuel rods into a compartment near the end of the film carries striking emotional effect. The director more than winks at his audience, but plays a fair game of narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another cigarette commercial from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In THE CORE a character lovingly fondles a cigarette during an important meeting on what is happening to the Earth's core. It's obvious that it is a specific brand...one the shows up in MANY movies....when Harrison Ford looks through a suitcase in Frenzy the last item is a clearly marked carton of a certain cigarette.Did anyone from THE CORE accept "financial incentives" (kickback to some) from any of the the tobacco companies.Its bad enough the science in THE CORE is bad, but why turn it into a commercial for cigarettes. Tobacco advertising on TV is illegal but doing it this way ensures the tobacco companies will get the cigarette on TV when THE CORE is shown. A bad movie being used to advertise and encourage young people to a lifetime of addiction. I guess bad movies make money from Big Tobacco. THE CORE sucks for many reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It started of great.Quite a few people all around Boston unexpectedly dropped down dead.I thought I was in for some real mystery/adventure sequences.I however found out that was not true seconds after the bird incident in Londen.The movie went entirely downhill from there,and it stayed down until about an hour later an exciting lightning storm disaster appeared in Rome.Then,suffering another 45 minutes of boredom,The golden gate bridge in Sanfransisco falls down because of a huge heat wave.After that exciting part return your D.v.D back to the video store and don't watch the movie again.And if you really want to see what happens in the end,go ahead.It's just as stupid and as boring as the film itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate this movie!!! Yes, you read right, I hate this movie. From the bottom of my soul, I really really hate this movie! Why? Because it sucks that's why. From beginning till end! It is absolutely horrible. I can't believe that they think they have made a good movie when they were done with this. It seems like this movie lasts for about 3 hours and I feel like I have lost the will to live after seeing it. I really wish that all the people responsible for making this movie, would take a long walk on a very short pier. OK, so the effects are pretty good, but that is it. Nothing else is good in this movie, except the end credits, finally letting me know that my suffering has come to an end. I won't recommend this movie to anyone, although I know there are people out there that like this movie. So there you have it, that is my verdict of this movie. It sucks, plain and simple. The story is so full of plot holes that it should be a cheese, and the "actors" doesn't do anything to help make this movie suck any less. I rate this movie 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>where's Jerry Bruckhiemer when you need him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kind of was expecting this movie to be not so great considering the plot. But the cover of the dvd makes it look like Armageddon. The difference between that movie and the Core is that fact that Armageddon, even thought its about 20 minutes longer, is actually a good movie. As I was watching this I didnt know the running time but when I looked at the clock on my dvd player I realized that the credits started at 2 hours and 6 minutes. Thats 126 minutes of boring action, if you could even call it action. The most exciting part for me was watching the credits only for the cool name graphics, the decent song and the fact that i knew the movie was over. I dont know why Paramont didnt knock on Bruckhiemers door for this one. If J Bruckhiemer took this project on along with Michael Bay I can asure you that this movie would have been a whole lot different and a lot more exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A palm-sweating disturbing end-of-the-world movie. Yuck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I've also said for The Day After Tomorrow, disaster and/or end-of-the-world movies are definitely not my kind of movie. Although I haven't seen this movie in years, I do recall that my palms began sweating one minute into the movie.A few scientists and space pilot people team up to do through a large digging machine to dig down to the earth's core to set off explosives that will hopefully get it running again so that the earth won't overheat.I disliked the acting although I must commend Aaron Eckhart for his performance, the plot was just not for me, and the deaths were very sad and disturbing.If you really, really like end-of-the-world disaster movies, then this just might be for you, but it was more than the plot that made me give it a 1/10. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film of this genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film certainly had me on the edge of my seat. I consider it the best I have seen in a long time in this genre. The acting was superb. Regardless of the accuracy of the scientific data presented here, this movie was fun and exciting. It is, after all Sci-Fi. My husband who expected not to like it, put it on his favorite movies list. I found the screenplay to be excellent. The dialogue was good and the special effects were outstanding. I am rather surprised that this movie and the performers had not received more acclaim. In my opinion, this is a real sleeper. I highly recommend this movie for fun and thrills. I plan on buying it for my video library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, if you like science, you may very well think this is the funniest movie you've ever seen. I'm not sure there's a single scientific fact that they get right; it's like George Bush trying to explain why his policies on the environment are good for the planet: the dialog is great but you know it's all complete and total BS.Still, if you think of this as pure fantasy, it *IS* a thrilling movie; there's tons of stuff going on in every second of this movie. There are some great visuals. There's the terrific Sensurround effect on the subwoofer several times. And it's fun to sit there and catch the references: David Brin's "Earth", Verne's "Journey to the Center of the Earth", "Armageddon", every movie where you've ever watched where the digital timer on the nuke counts down, and on and on.So I guess if you're just trying to be entertained for about two hours, give it a whirl. But pray that no one ever assumes they've learned any actual Earth Science from this movie, not even George W. Bush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Sci-Fi. 'Armageddon' going downward.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the Earth's electromagnetic field begins to deteriorate in such a manner, the next best thing that humankind can do is to save itself from total destruction. When the core stopped spinning, the only way to save the Earth from being a microwave is to dive into hellish temperatures to start it again. 'Earth has a deadline' 'The only way out is in.' and this is true for the entirety of the filmWe learn that the government has implanted DESTINY, a nuclear weapon, into the center of the Earth. It therefore caused the earth to stop spinning, which in turn, is disintegrating the electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field is which gives the poles a magnetic force, and allows a compass to work the way it does. It, most importantly shields us from solar radiation.In any case, these fields are disintegrating by the moment and mankind must find a way to replace them, and destroying a nuclear weapon with a nuclear weapon is their only hope. An eye for an eye; a nuke for a nuke. Since electricity was becoming more and more scarce, and radiation was becoming more powerful. Everyone in certain areas with a pacemaker was killed by radiation. The radiation caused the pacemaker to stop working and the fields was allowing it. The birds no longer had the ability to navigate properly. Thunderstorms with on hundred bolts per square foot. People are dying instantly from intense radiation. There is nowhere on Earth to hide from it.So we must build a ship with 100 tons of warheads. How about we call it Virgil? Sound good? It better. Anyhow, we find the most diverse 'terranauts' (These don't exist. yet.) we can find: a Physics professor (Aaron Eckhart), an arrogant scientist (Stanley Tucci), a real NASA astronaut (Hilary Swank), a rocket scientist (Delroy Lindo), as well as other, less important characters. They all have on purpose. DESTINY must be blown up into little pieces.As the seemingly natural phenomenon's become deemed unnatural, the crew has only three months to build and deliver to the crust what they deem necessary. They will have to go inside the crust to destroy DESTINY. How to do it? Well, there is a new unobtanium, created by Braz (Delroy Lindo), which can withstand any temperature or heat. So they build Virgil, a massive ship that can sustain any amounts of pressure or heat. They will go underneath the crust of the Earth, and into the core, where they must destroy the nuke.But things, as always do go wrong. The density of the core was miscalculated, therefore needing more nukes to destroy Density, and they do not have enough. If they are not able to destroy DESTINY, DESTINY will destroy the world, and there will be no one to stop him.The special effects are awesome as they most often are in pictures such as these. Although, can you say 'Armageddon retread'? I liked this film a bit better then Armageddon, however, the plot is, at times a bit shaky, where Armageddon is strictly science. Besides, Armageddon drags at times. This seems to move quicker than your average sci-fi film.This film was excellently paced, and they use widescreen techniques to the grandest scale possible. The film uses science as a key element, and, unlike other film, does not often have 'personal' scenes. (I.E. a man saying bye to his wife, on satellite.Eckhart and Tucci are a great team and should most definitely be in another picture together. Tucci claims Zimsky as his own, and portrays him in a great way. I would like to see them reprise their characters in this film, also. They were the strongest character and it shows. Although many in the cast are unknowns at the moment, it is Eckhart and Tucci who will make it big within the next few years. (Eckhart already has some major projects scheduled for next year.)The only point that kills this film from getting a 8 is what happens to Keyes, and the NASA astronaut in the end. Everything looked so good for them.7/10 StarsRating: PG-13 My Rating: 11 and upThis film contains: Intense Sci-Fi life/death situations (All three cases the painfully die, such as heavy metal slamming oh heads, Etc.) Medium gore. (From Life/Death Situations.) Minimum sexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reasonable Adventure, With Non-Charismatic Characters and Total Lack of Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After some mysterious events with some pigeons, Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) concludes that the core of planet Earth stopped revolving, affecting the magnetic fields of the planet. The American government gathers a group of scientists with different specializations, and two experienced NASA pilots, to travel to the center of the Earth to rotate its core again using explosives. Although having a good cast, with Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, Tchéky Karyo, Delroy Lindo, Bruce Greenwood, Aaron Eckhart among others, something does not work in this movie. The story is full of clichés, like most of the films of this genre, and this theme was awfully presented in `Deep Core' (2000). But I believe that the greatest problem of this film is the lack of humor and charisma of the characters, which are not well developed, making the plot `too serious'. Only Josh Keyes has these characteristics, but he has no chemistry with Hilary Swank. The effects are reasonable and in the end, this film is only a reasonable and forgettable adventure. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): `O Núcleo' (`The Core')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>forget what you saw in the cheesy trailers. they tell you nothing about how entertaining fun campy this film is. i was invited to a press screening through my internship ("the core" doesn't come out nationwide until march 28th). i was totally expecting this movie to SUCK HARDCORE. like terrible. like "armageddon" terrible. like "joe's apartment" terrible. and i was proved seriously wrong. it runs a bit long, a little under two hours, but you don't feel it. the special effects are truly spectacular. the sets were huge. the stunts were insane. i have no idea what the budget was for this movie, but i'm sure it is approximately equal to the combined annual GDP of several small third world nations. the acting was bearable, dialogue was campy and the movie's producers didn't hold back at all in making fun of themselves. they knew it was an absurd idea that armageddon come from the stalling of the earth's core, but they definitely researched this film to the hilt. there's actually a bit of character development in the movie too, something you don't see often in action/scifi movies. one thing i have to warn you about though....SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE MOVIE THEATERS ON THE HUGEST HUGEST HUGEST SCREEN YOU CAN FIND. i was enthralled for the entire two hours i sat on my ass, but it would definitely not have had the same effect if i watched it on my dinky 20" tv screen at home. so hurry out and spend the $10 (if you're in NYC) to see this movie in theaters. PLEASE. it rocks. you won't regret it. honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the disaster movie ideas they've had, this is a good new approach to natural disaster, but the film is just not that realistic enough, even with many special effects. Basically the Earth's core of mantle stops rotating which if not sorted will cause catastrophic consequences, and it starts with birds accidentally attacking people, lightning storms and dramatic heat waves. Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) located the problem in the centre of the planet, Maj. Rebecca Childs (Insomnia's Hilary Swank) can pilot a ship, Dr. Ed 'Braz' Brazzleton (Ransom's Delroy Lindo) has the technology to build the ship equipped to resist high heat, and use it for power, Dr. Conrad Zimsky (The Terminal's Stanley Tucci) knows just as much as Josh about the core activity, and Theodore Donald 'Rat' Finch (Road Trip's DJ Qualls) can stop people from finding out any big news with his huge computer hacking intelligence. Along the way to the Earth's core to set off explosions to restart the rotation people die, but they would, even with a ridiculous story with a realistic incident. Also starring Richard Jenkins as Gen. Thomas Purcell, Tchéky Karyo as Dr. Serge Leveque, Bruce Greenwood as Cmdr. Robert Iverson and Alfre Woodard as Dr. Talma Stickley. Worth watching!</fullReview>
