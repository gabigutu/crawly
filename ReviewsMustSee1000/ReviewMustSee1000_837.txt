		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's ode to the closing of the American west.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the most controversial films ever made, the Wild Bunch was equally hated and admired upon it's release over 30 years ago. Even today, as proof of it's staying power, it is still widely debated if Sam Peckinpah made a masterpiece or a monstrosity. Personally, I'm of the firm belief that Peckinpah contributed one of the finest American films of the last century.The chemistry that Peckinpah was able to put on celluloid for this film is brilliant. William Holden and Ernest Borgnine as the leaders of the Bunch, play their roles with conviction and tenacity. Robert Ryan, once an outlaw with Holden, and now forced to hunt him down, portrays the tortured individual caught between an old friendship and the threat of incarceration in a vicious prison. Ben Johnson and Warren Oates are solidly believable as real life brothers as they depict their roles as Tector and Lyle Gorch, and finally Jaime Sanchez rounds out the gang as the fiercely patriotic Mexican, Angel.Also a Peckinpah movie wouldn't be complete without L.Q. Jones and Strother Martin portraying the cowardly, scheming, body robbing bounty hunters eager for the money on the heads of the Wild Bunch.This is a film that you can re-visit time and time again and relish the depth of the characters and feel their desperation as the west that they once knew has now become a distant memory.Apart from the great casting, the tight scripting , exciting stuntwork, wonderful cinematography, gripping dialogue, and first class editing of the gunfights, this movie will be continually looked upon as one of the most important films of American cinema.See it, enjoy it and experience great movie making!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive end of the west Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredible performance by Bill Holden is the high point of this sensational, landmark film. Holden made a whole career out of laid-back, easy-going, what-the-hell sort of characters but here, at his zenith, he departs from type and plays a character so mean and so embittered that in some ways he even out-Bronsons Bronson himself.The Wild Bunch is a group of disillusioned outlaws who are out of time and they know it. When Sykes says that they've got one of those things (a car) up north that can fly, they gloomily accept that this new-fangled 20th Century is not for them.It is a movie all about values and about a man's loyalty to his companions. Holden brilliantly declares that if you cannot stand by a man who rides with you, you are like some kind of animal. In the end, that is all these hunted men have: their loyalty to each other.And so they band together for one last walk to try and rescue their doomed Mexican comrade. The bloodbath that follows is an eloquent summary of their lives. They who live by the gun.....Superb performances by Holden in particular and also by O'Brien, Ryan, Borgnine, Oates and Johnson. Peckinpah's finest hour. Definitely ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's go.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this movie on DVD at the suggestion of my brother. I admit to knowing nothing about it's director and a complete lack of familiarity with most of it's actors or the mythology behind it's production (I was born years after it was made). I can, however, safely say this: this is one of the greatest movies ever made. Every aspect of the film is flawless, from the acting to the cinematography to the script.This is also the most truly macho of all macho movies. It's not cartoonish machismo, rather it's the kind of machismo you see in drywall hangers: no-nonsense comments like "We're after men" and "Let's go" predominate, the men don't swagger around and violence is approached (fairly) honestly. The reserved dialogue and physicality reminds me of "Seven Samaurai" (to which this film owes a great deal). To me, that is the highest praise that I can give a movie.The photography is amazing: the desert looks sweltering and parched, the close-ups of actor's faces outdoes Sergio Leone and the action is probably the best ever filmed. Scorcese and Tarantino obviously owe a lot to Peckinpaw. The scene during the opening credits of "Reservoir Dogs" is a direct lift from this movie, just to cite one of countless examples.The acting is on par with the direction. Robert Ryan steals the show and, c'mon, who doesn't love Ernest?Some would poo-poo the films treatment of women, and I am not going to get involved in that debate. Just go see it because, like the best movies, it immerses you in a time and place. Smell the sage!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wild Bunch" is one of those movies people don't agree on, even those that agree it's great. It's definitely complex, entertaining in a disturbing way, and manages to be at once nihilistic and moralistic, not an easy trick, especially for a cowboy film.The first problem we have to deal with when watching this film is the fact there's very quickly a gunfight going on and, against all movie convention, no one to root for. There's an all-star cast on one side, including William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Ben Johnson, and Warren Oates, but against all expectation, they turn out to be a pretty black crew. About the first thing out of Holden's mouth, said about a cowed group of innocents, is "If they move, kill 'em," and before the battle is over, we've seen him and his team commit all sorts of savagery. About the only reason we don't immediately see them as evil is that the people they battle are no better.Over time, we are encouraged to find something of value in Holden's Pike Bishop and his ruthless confederates, as they ride away, lick their wounds, and try to figure out how to get something else going, anything. The only problem is its 1913 and these outlaws are running out of time and options. "I'd like to make one good score and back off," is how Pike says it, to which Borgnine's faithful buddy Dutch exclaims: "Back off to what?!"Chasing the bunch, and offering the viewer the film's one sympathetic character, is Robert Ryan as Deke Thornton, a former partner of Pike's who doesn't want to go back to jail and for whom killing the bunch is the one unpleasant means of securing his freedom. Ryan, who died in 1973, is probably not as recognizable as the other leads today, but he lends a sad, elegiac presence to his on-screen moments that give the film much of its grace and warmth.The final star is director Sam Peckinpah, who made a truly revolutionary film that not only pushed the art of film forward but holds up today as a cinematic experience. Time has been kind to this film in a way it hasn't to other ground-breaking auteur moments from the same era, like "MASH" and "Easy Rider." When "The Wild Bunch" came out just as the 1960s were ending, people were truly shocked by the violence and cruel characters. Today, of course, such things are so common, and so mindlessly celebrated, that we find ourselves admiring what Peckinpah does for the surprisingly subtle and restrained way he goes about presenting us with mayhem and carnage, and his refusal to glorify it, however exciting and entertaining the overall package.Surprisingly for a director who had trouble getting work at the time, Peckinpah landed three Oscar winners in the cast, and a fourth, Ben Johnson, who'd win his a couple of years later. Obviously, the acting is strong, each player investing his spare lines with the right degree of space and spirit, but it's probably worked even better that the movie game in 1969 was in the process of passing the fuddy-duddy likes of Holden, Borgnine, and Edmond O'Brien behind. This makes them very believable as a group of hard-nosed has-beens. In that light, it's kind of cool how hip this film so quickly became when it was released.It's such a good film it's easy to overlook minor weaknesses. There's a nice bit of symbolism in the beginning, now famous, where the gang rides past a group of children tormenting scorpions and ants, but the point, once made, is beaten into the ground. There are some bits of convenience that stick out, like when a gunned-down outlaw rises and mows down his attackers with a few too-precise shotgun blasts. The general dislikeability of just about everything and everybody does feel a bit of a weight after a couple of viewings.But what's great is just awesome, especially that opening sequence and the final showdown at Bloody Porch. Such terrific punch-drunk ambiance, it's almost a shame to watch it sober. The feeling of a new era coming upon us, which we see in everything from the doughboy uniforms at the outset to the car General Mapache rides around in, is redoubled by the glorious splendor, even clarity of this picture. Is it too much to praise a movie for the quality of the film stock itself? This is a paradox film, one about obsolescence and growing old that remains startling new-looking and fresh 35 years on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dutch, there are just some people who can't stand to admit they're wrong"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply one of the best westerns, maybe overall best films ever made. Peckinpah's best by far. It is one of those films that grabs you by the thoat and doesn't let you go until it is over. Brilliant casting. I would be hard pressed to find someone who could have played Pike's part better than William Holden. But the rest of the cast for the main characters: Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Warren Oates Ben Johnson, Jaimie Sanchez and Edmund O'Brien are equally effective in their respective roles. Even the secondary actors, namely Strother Martin and LQ Jones are also great as the "gutter trash" bounty hunters Robert Ryan has to lead in chasing down Pike and his band.This movie deals with aging gunfighters who had outlived their era, and see their "code of conduct" now passe' in the early 20th Century on the eve of World War I. Technologyin the way of cars, planes, and machine guns has rendered living and dying more impersonal than in Pike's et. al day. In some ways, with the end of the millennium at hand and all the vast technological changes, and changes in values, habits, and lifestyles that have taken place, even in the last couple of decades, many of us viewing the picture can sense just a bit of empathy with the main characters... Although this movie is an action film, there is a sort of foreboding throughout the film that the end is near for them. Yet when it occurs it will happen on their terms. One of my favorite scenes is when Pike and Dutch are sitting in their bedrolls by the fire at Angel's village. Pike talks about the railroad man Harrigan and how "some people just can't stand to admit they're wrong... or learn by it!" And then Dutch asks Pike if he believes they had learned anything today, referring to the bloodbath in the opening scene in Starbuck, to which Pike replies "I sure hope to God we did." The movie when released in 1969 received a lot of criticism for the violence, which was indeed unparralelled at that time. But it is relatively tame by today's standards. Moreover, the violence is not gratuitious as we see in so many films today. You see consquences to the violence hence the "death ballet." the two children holding each other during the shootout in the opening scene, and Robert Ryan's agonizing chagrin at carnage in the street and noticing the young children emulating the gunfighters in the street, the dead bodies not yet removed.. A suprising number of people who have seen this film have not seen the Director's Cut which was re-released in 1994. It puts back in many key scenes, which develops Pike and Deke Thorton's past, which is crucial to tying the movie together and making it a brilliant film. Without these scenes, then it makes little or no sense.. Unfortunately, many television stations when showing this film show the "butchered" version........A 30th Anniversary addition has recently come out that includes a half-hour documentary "The Wild Bunch: A Portait in Montage, " which, made in 1996 received much acclaim, including an Oscar Nomination.. It makes the viewer even more appreciate Peckinpah's brilliant improvisational skill as well as the technical feats, such as the unforgettable Rio Grade river bridge scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's film marked the passing of the old West in an orgy of destruction, as its heroes go down with all guns blazing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "Shane" makes a myth of the West, "The Wild Bunch" demythologizes it... If "Shane" draws sharp moral distinctions that are, literally, black and white, "The Wild Bunch" spoils all moral distinctions, offering us only choices between different modes of immorality... If in "Shane" violence is viewed as a necessary evil only to be employed as a last resort, and killing is depicted as fast and pure, in "The Wild Bunch" violence is viewed with exaltation, and killing is prolonged, tormented, and bloody..."Shane" delivered an old traditional story, a legend, a fabulous hero who idealized the West... "The Wild Bunch" presents it stormy, disturbing, hard to control, and blood-thirsty... In short, within the genre of the Western, "The Wild Bunch" is the precise opposite of "Shane." Each film may be considered an artifact of a view of the American frontier... "Shane," made during the quietude of 1953, romanticizes and idealizes... "The Wild Bunch," made fifteen years later in a turbulent time, tells us that the American Dream is dead...The opening sequence of "The Wild Bunch" stakes out the virtue of the wild territory... A gang of desperadoes disguised as U. S. soldiers rides into a town, passing children torturing scorpions and adults attending a temperance meeting... The action starts inside the office when Pike, the leader of the bunch warns his men saying: 'If they move, kill'em!'The Bunch robs the railway office, then finds itself ambushed by a gang of bounty hunters working for the railroad... A savage gunfight erupts, many innocents people are killed, and in few minutes, we discover that we are in middle of a territory full of rage and fury, in a terrain that is beyond good or evil, where the abusing use of force is beyond any reason...Holden's group was never easy to handle... There is conflict and tension among them? They range from the more idealistic Mexican member, Jaime Sanchez, to the wild Gorch brothers, Warren Oates and Ben Johnson? But what binds them together in the last resort is their life-style and its demanding loyalty? Holden puts it this way: 'When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that, you're some kind of animal, you're finished. We're finished. All of us.'If there are any myths left unexploded in the film, they take place on the Mexican side of the border, where the bandits' departure from a village is staged as it might have been in "Shane." The time of the film is 1913, when the American frontier was closing fast... Mexico, on the other hand, was still a romantic era, the time of Pancho Villa and the Mexican Revolution...Peckinpah's reputation was well known... He was an expert in violence, offering furious scenes with intense emotion and anger, even immoderately beyond the limit, making his film more important, more powerful, and memorable... Peckinpah sacrificed some two hundred people, most of them accentuated in slow motion, men falling with exaggerated blood flowing out their body...We even witness the execution of one of Pike's man, seeing with astonishment how his throat is slashed with a knife... Mel Gibson carried it exactly and excessively, in his superb epic tale "Braveheart," when he showed us how a lovely bride is slain in the same way... His film was probably influenced by "The Wild Bunch" at least ? as I think ? with its technique and style...The 'savor' of violence in 'slow motion' makes us understand the passion of Peckinpah toward violence... This pleasure for killing, this irresistible exhibition, this 'performance of death' as Peckinpah expressed it himself, could be interpreted maybe as criticism to violence..."The Wild Bunch" is splendidly acted... William Holden as Pike, was never so magnificent since "Stalag 17" as I remember... It seems that Holden understood the message, specially in the brilliant scene when he clearly decides to rescue one of his men... This particular shot was outstanding because it involved Holden in a great embarrassment with zero dialog... Another proof was also the scene between Robert Ryan and Albert Dekker disputing about the bounty hunters, the 'trash' as Ryan called them...The climax of the motion picture is astonishing... After Pike had shot the general, he and his pals stood 'peaceful' for a moment facing the Mexican soldiers... The wild bunch was already condemned... Nobody will survive... They were aware of it, we were aware of it... But in their mind, there was a certain determination to take with them as many Mexicans as they can... The seconds passed and in the moment that Pike puts a bullet between the eyes of a German adviser, we were in front of the bloodiest slaughter ever seen on the silver screen... Too much blood for a picture filmed in 1969... Mel Gibson exhilarating fashioned epic, repeated it in the battlefield in "Braveheart."Now, if you consider "The Wild Bunch" a film against Classic Westerns, the action scenes are at its finest quality in the hijack of Pike's bunch to the army munitions train, and the long range shot, in slow motion, of the exploding bridge with Ryan and his bounty hunters..."The Wild Bunch" depicts the Mexican music, life in the villages, their special cult to the death, their drunken fiesta, their women, the keen look at the Mexican face, especially the faces of the children, sometimes observers, sometimes participating in the whole twisted ethic of violence?One last note: Desperation and death wish ride side by side in Peckinpah's motion picture... If the Bunch (Holden, Borgnine, Oates, Johnson, Sanchez and veteran outlaw Edmond O'Brien) are desperate, their bounty-hunter pursuers are no less so...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Let's go."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There comes a point at which every man reaches the end of the road and is forced to make a decision. Fade away, or go out in a blaze of glory. It goes without saying that the main characters of this film chose the latter. Sam Peckinpah's classic western is the tale of a gang of outlaws who see the world they know slipping away all around them. Scores are getting more dangerous. Technology is making killing too easy. Still they fight on, because they simply wouldn't have it any other way.William Holden plays a man named Pike Bishop. He and his gang of outlaws hit banks, trains, you name it. They stick together no matter how thick things get. After a failed attempt at a bank robbery in which nearly an entire town is gunned down, the gang sets out to steal a shipment of new guns from the US Army and sell them to a Mexican general. But this will not be an easy score. Not only will they have to fend of US soldiers, but the railroad has hired a former member of their gang named Deke Thornton and a bunch of sloppy bounty hunters to stop them. Also, the Mexican general is a dangerous man with hundreds of men at his disposal. Pancho Villa and his army are also in the area. Bullets are going to fly, and fly they do.From the opening shot of children torturing a couple scorpions to death by feeding them to a colony of ants, this film makes its point very thoroughly about violence. In this shot we see efficient killers overwhelmed by an army of a weaker species of animal. The scorpions are a metaphor for Pike and his gang. Outnumbered at every turn, they are still a handful for those who would try to hunt them down.Pike and his men are able to pull off the score and deliver the guns to the general. But they don't go riding off happily into the sunset like the heroes of a traditional western. Their story could never end that way. Knowing that their way of life is coming to an end, and knowing that one of the gang is being tortured by the general, Pike calls the remaining members together. "Let's go," he simply tells them. Each man knows what this means. They grab every gun they own and all the ammunition they can carry. Then they take a nice stroll down the main street of the general's compound to pay him and his army a little visit. The resulting gun battle has to be seen to be believed.Once the shooting stops, there is an odd; sad feeling that settles over the compound. The bounty hunters show up when the vultures do. The sight of his former companions' dead bodies slumped over the backs of horses is too much for Thornton to bear. You know he would have rather been there by their side during the battle, and now he cannot bring himself to claim the reward for their hides. He simply sits down in the dirt as the survivors of the compound quietly file out and an ominous wind begins blowing through the dusty streets. Moments later it's his turn to make a choice. You can't help but feel he made the right one.The Wild Bunch is an incredible film. If ever a film was ahead of it's time, this is it. See it! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great period western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics of Sam Peckinpah generally focus on the gore and violence in his films. "The Wild Bunch" will probably not assuage these critics, but the violence is not gratuitous. In fact, it is almost perfectly meshed in this story of a group of outlaws held together by some frail and some strong bonds who realize that their era - and probably their lives - are almost at an end. The story also deals with a man (Robert Ryan) who was wounded and forced out of the gang, and who must now capture and kill his friend (William Holden), with no option other than to succeed. This film is also about loyalty, choice and honor, and is carried by surprisingly strong acting and writing. Yes the violence is on a large scale (which seems to be commonplace for films portraying the Mexican Revolution), but it is completely in place with these characters and the era in which they live. This is not always a pleasant film to watch, but it is very rewarding, and may be the best film Peckinpah made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Cinema of Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peckinpah has a rep and this is the film which provided most of it. I had the privilege of actually seeing this on the big screen once, in the late seventies. As the beginning credits end, Pike (Holden) tells his bunch "If they move, Kill 'em!" Then Peckinpah's credit appears. A woman seated behind me gasped, whispering "oh, no..." Oh, my. It sounded like the lady didn't know she'd wandered into a Peckinpah film and she knew what she was in for. When you enter Peckinpah-land, you need to be prepared. There are no punches pulled, no sidestepping the unpleasant aspects of life. Peckinpah's characters are tough men; I mean, really tough, not phony-Hollywood tough. In this case, they are coarsened by what seems to be years on the trail, blasted by the sun, snapped at by rattlesnakes, and harassed by bandits. And at this point, they've pretty much had it.Not that they're complaining, mind you. They've lived their lives how they saw fit, this bunch, and they make no apologies for any of it. I believe the actual year is around 1913, just before World War I begins. Most of the action takes place in Mexico, where the Bunch becomes involved with a local general (Fernandez) with the usual delusions of grandeur. If you go by the name of the character Angel, the general can be viewed as a version of the devil. That would make the Bunch avenging angels at the end. But heroes? No, not at all. They have their own code, they know instinctively they're stronger together than on each own, but they reason this concept out also - Peckinpah wants to make sure it's clear these are not unthinking savages. They're just men, who've reached a point in history where they must make a crucial turn. History, it seems, has no real use for them anymore. It's quite simple - they either fade slowly or go out quickly. In a film such as this, with its now insurmountable rep, you tend to wait for those big set pieces, especially the climactic battle. Wait for it, wait for it... here it is. Bam! - you're in Peckinpah territory. You're a part of history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and elegiac masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outlaws led by Pike Bishop on the Mexican-U.S. frontier face not only the passing of time, but bounty hunters {led by a former partner of Pike, Deke Thornton} and the Mexican army as well.In 1969 Sam Peckinpah picked up the torch that Arthur Penn lit with 1967's Bonnie &amp; Clyde, and literally poured gasoline on it to impact on cinema to the point that the shock wave is still being felt today. The death of the Motion Picture Production Code in 1967 ushered in a new era for cinema goers, it was a time for brave and intelligent directors to step up to the plate to deliver stark and emotive thunder, and with The Wild Bunch, director Sam Peckinpah achieved this by the shed load.The Wild Bunch doesn't set out to be liked, it is a harsh eye opening perception of the Western genre, this is the other side of the coin to the millions of Westerns that whoop and holler as the hero gets the girl and rides off into the sunset. The Wild Bunch thematically is harshly sad for the protagonists, these are men out of their time, this is a despicable group of men, driven by greed and cynicism, they think of nothing to selling arms to a vile amoral army across the border.The film opens with a glorious credit sequence as we witness the Bunch riding into town, the picture freeze frames in black &amp; white for each credit offering, from here on in we know that we are to witness something different, and yes, something very special. The film is bookended by carnage, and sandwiched in the middle is an equally brilliant train robbery, yet the impact of these sequences is only enhanced because the quality of the writing is so good (Walon Green and Roy N. Sickner alongside Peckinpah). There's no pointless discussions or scene filling explanations of the obvious. Each passage, in each segment, is thought thru to gain credibility for the shattering and bloody climax. There is of course one massive and intriguing question that hangs over the film; how did Peckinpah make such low moral men appear as heroes? Well I'm not here to tell you that because you need to witness the film in its entirety for yourself. But it's merely one cheeky point of note in a truly majestic piece of work. A film that even today stands up as one of the greatest American films ever made. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gang of American outlaws steals a trainload of US Army guns for a Mexican general, and are tracked relentlessly by bounty hunters."The Wild Bunch" is the film which, more than any other, fixes the Peckinpah 'style' for posterity to marvel at ... guns, tequila, dust, whores - and more guns. Typically for a Peckinpah movie, it is a threnody to the death of the Old West, permeated with the odour of decay. Dutch and Pike talk of their life together as free-ranging outlaws, and Pike observes that "those days are closing fast". Gatling guns and automobiles are transforming the world, leaving no safe haven for ageing bushwhackers. During the opening credits we see children feeding scorpions into an ants' nest. The graceful predators are overrun by sheer numbers, and pulled down by the ants. So it must be with Pike and his Wild Bunch.Peckinpah's familiar theme of American-Mexican ambivalence is a current running through the film. The Mexicans are sometimes caricatures - there is plenty of "Muchachos, vamenos!" - but Angel (Jaime Sanchez) cuts a dignified figure and the humble people of Mexico are treated sympathetically. The action straddles the Texan-Mexican border, and in each country the true struggle is that of the free individual against the behemoth of federal government.The masculine values of the Western - courage in the face of danger and loyalty to one's companeros - are central to this movie. When Pike's team realise that they have pulled off the robbery, the slow passing around of the whisky bottle is a semi-religious libation to the brotherhood of fighting-men. Though Pike and Deke (Robert Ryan) have a troubled personal history, and are now enemies, there is an unspoken bond of respect and affection between them. When Dutch (Ernest Borgnine) succumbs to his wounds, he dies calling Pike's name.The film takes care to distinguish between the outlaw-heroes and the rabble. Pike, played by William Holden, is "the best". He runs his outfit with discipline and dignity. On the other hand, Thornton's motley crew are merely stupid scavengers. Like the vultures that they are, their one aim is to plunder corpses. In the Wild Bunch, even the unruly brothers, Lyle and Tector, have a noble side to their nature.Peckinpah is sometimes pilloried for his technical tricks, and they are all on display here. It has to be said, they are well done. Actors are wired with electric squibs which squirt gouts of blood when they get shot. Men squirm and die in slow motion, allowing us to relish the carnage.Other technical aspects of the film deserve commendation. The shot of a falling bridge depositing a company of mounted railroad deputies into the Rio Grande is outstanding, as are the compositions of men, dust and horses during the gunfights. Soft dunes of sand and sweeping rivers are filmed with loving rapture. The confusion of the soldiers under attack in the boxcar is conveyed powerfully by means of the then-unheard-of expedient of a handheld camera. Suspense is piled on skilfully during the railroad office attack, and extreme close-up is used throughout the film to heighten the moments of tension.Pike's men receive a touching send-off from the humble folk of the pueblo who, knowing the nobility of a life outside the law, admire and love these strong, brave men. The life is a fine one, but it can end only one way. When the reckoning comes, the Wild Bunch meet it without flinching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Wild Bunch, we see bodies riddled full of bullets in such agonizing slow motion that it would be painful to watch if it weren't so amazing to watch. Peckinpah stages his gunfights like a ballet. The initial shot that opens the piece is only a prelude to a dance that is filled with flying lead and blood. As we follow the exploits of a group of outlaws, running from time and their own fate, the action scenes become more elaborate than the prior scene. The train hijacking is suspenseful and far more convincing than any of the run of the mill action films being produced today. Peckinpah fuses the screen with images that foretell the fate of the Wild Bunch. You know that they will meet their end once Pike says "Let's go." The others know what they have to do, and they know that they won't come out of it alive, but that's the only way they know. The final shootout is alive with bullets flying everywhere. The screen literally explodes as the Bunch makes their final stand. To see this film is to be overwhelmed by it. Compared to today's violence in films, it almost seems tame. Those films lack a decent story, and thus the violence becomes gratuitous. With The Wild Bunch, you are seeing the last ride of a group of outlaws that only know one way of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's wild, all right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "old" West was changing, and director Sam Peckinpah recognized those changing times. By 1969, Sergio Leone and his "Spaghetti" westerns were the real deal, but when Peckinpah brought forth his film, "The Wild Bunch," that same year, it ushered in a whole new wave of films as its vision was simply landmark. Building on the violent stylistic template and chic of "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967), "The Wild Bunch" begins and ends with two of the bloodiest screen battles ever envisioned, and it tells the story of an aging group of outlaws, led by William Holden and Ernest Borgnine, as they attempt one last score, with Robert Ryan as an ex-Wild Bunch member in hot pursuit. They become involved with Mexican rebels and from that point on, we get an engaging story as the outlaws party with the Mexican army, their hookers, and their alcohol - all of this leading up to the notorious ending where the Wild Bunch man their guns and duke-it-out with their enemies. "The Wild Bunch" has obtained a notorious reputation for being one of the most violent movies ever made and is credited for being the movie that changed the way we looked at the "old" West and action cinema in general. Sam Peckinpah was a true revolutionary during a time when America was not so innocent, as proved by "Bonnie and Clyde" two years before it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch (1969) is director Sam Peckinpah's vivid and provocative rendition of the west in the early 20th century. It is a remarkable film, both famed for bringing to screen one of the most vivid and visceral recreations of the dying west and for its intense portrayal of violence and brutality. Shot in widescreen, it is a dark and unrelenting tale of the 9 outlaws - the 'Wild Bunch' - united in friendship and in their fight against the vastly changing world around them. As they see the sun go down on their own way of life, changing technology and the industrial revolution is getting a firm grip on society and they see the dawn of a new west.Other films of that period took a more anti-violence stance. Most notably is Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid (1969), which provided lighthearted action and adopted a more romanticised view of the American frontier. The Wild Bunch however is honest in its view on human nature and is not scared of the fact that people in society can sometimes be fascinated and attracted to violence. This theme is evident right from the outset. In the opening scene, two children are standing in the middle of the street while people around them are being shot. Their initial reaction is one of horror, but quickly they start watching the carnage, unable to turn away. Most notably though, is the final scene of the film, where the remaining members of the bunch are killed in a selfless and redemptive act. The entire scene is filmed as a slow motion dance - a grim but breathtaking rumination on the obliteration of human life. This can be likened to an act of god, for example the destroying of Pompeii or Sodom. Natural disasters undeniably cause immense destruction and pain, but are still beautiful in terms of scale and grandeur.The bunch themselves are not crusaders or misunderstood 'cookie cutter' outlaws out to get revenge; they are very much out there for themselves. Although they claim to live by a strict code of camaraderie and honour "when you side with a man you stick with him!" we continually see how they are willing to do anything in order to save their own skin. Pike is a very intelligent but deeply troubled character who espouses the aforementioned code of loyalty, however he rarely follows through on it until the end of the film. His selfish actions continually come back to haunt him, and he eventually condemns his actions and decides the most selfless thing he can do is to go back for Angel in a completely humanitarian gesture of loyalty and solidarity. He is cleansed in his death and it serves as the ultimate refusal to be tamed, and the acceptance that his way of life is at an end. Not only does this provide catharsis for Pike but also serves as a profound statement on the mentality of the criminal mind. He would rather purge his conscience and remain true to the life he has led than become a restrained and condemned prisoner of society.The fatal shot to Pike, delivered by a child, serves as an allegory for the death of the west as Pike knew it. The children of the new age of technology and industry are killing off the remnants of the ageing past. It also further illustrates the inherent bloodlust in society and the suggestion that if driven far enough, anyone is capable of some degree of violence ? a rather shocking truth that we are reminded of all too often in the news and media. The social commentary on human nature and its propensity for violence offered by "The Wild Bunch" still remains as relevant as ever.Although the film won no Academy Awards (the academy rarely gives the nod to films containing high levels of violence despite being works of art ? Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Exorcist), it was nominated in two categories - for Jerry Fielding's original musical score and for the film's story and screenplay (a collaboration between Walon Green and Sam Peckinpah). The Wild bunch is also responsible for increasing the acceptance and tolerance level for violence on the screen. This lasting effect can be seen in more recent work by directors such as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino and many others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Western was a staple of the movie industry from it's earliest beginnings until they started to fade from popularity by in the 60's and were becoming increasingly rare by decades end. They never really died of course but good ones became far and few between. This is one the most extravagantly violent shoot-em-up western's ever made. director Sam Peckinpaugh seeing they might be on their way out wanted them to go out with a bang in his film The Wild Bunch. A great ensemble cast here includes William Holden, Ernest Borginine, Robert Ryan, Edmund O' Brien, and Warren Oates with great character actors Strother Martin, Ben Johnson and Dub Taylor. Veteran cinematographer Lucien Ballard who would have a 55 year career as at his best here. Versatile art director ed Carrere worked on his final film in The Wild Bunch and Lou Lombardo who was given the complicated job of film editing this movie turned out a fine product. It received two Academy Award nominations for music, and screenplay but should have received more and especially for sound. May be to overboard on violence for some but I would give this epic western a 9.0 out of 10 and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Real Men in a No-where's Land of Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently my health took a turn for the worst, and on the 17th I ended watching two different films while recuperating. One was EXECUTIVE SUITE, and the other THE WILD BUNCH. Both were shown in commemoration of the birthday of Mr. William Franklin Beedle, one of the best movie actors of the period from 1940 and 1981. Of course that birthday was given under his better known acting name: William Holden. I have seen it mentioned that the flinty/slightly rocky tones of Holden's voice gives it a quality for honesty that few other film actors shared. He certainly sounded more modern in the film industry than the leading men of the 1930s. Their voices have a superiority in them, as opposed to the reality that Holden adds to his voice. He is able to mouth a truth with a cutting edge (frequently with bad results: witness his trying to get through to Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in SUNSET BLVD. only ends in his murder).He seemed at his best when confronting the truth. In THE WILD BUNCH he is Pike Bishop, leader of a gang of train and bank robbers who work with such military precision, that they frequently pull themselves out of hopeless traps. At the beginning of the film Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Jaime Sanchez, Warren Oates, and Ben Johnson attempt a bank robbery, not realizing it was a trap set by Albert Dekker, wherein the bank is also surrounded by an "army" under Robert Ryan. A massacre of innocent civilians results that Dekker will not acknowledge as something he'll sweat over. Also most of the men given to Ryan have been killed (Dekker is a high ranking railroad official - that's his key to settling everything and evading responsibility - and hires cheap psychotics and misfits like Strother Martin for his "army").Peckinpaugh worked frequently on the fly - he would innovate as went along. This gives his best work it's bite. Sometimes though one wishes he would have had luck to do some plot development. We eventually learn that the smart Ryan was Holden's partner but was wounded and captured and whipped (presumably at order of Dekker) until he agreed to help end "the Wild Bunch". This explains why the two never aim at each other, and also understand each other's perfect moves. But Dekker apparently hates Holden for some incident that left him looking like an ass. It's never explained what it was - because Dekker died (in a grotesque hanging accident) while the film was being made. I suspect the plot would have pulled him in a bit more (and possibly a second type of retribution might have caught up with him). Instead, Mr. Dekker's character "Harrigan" eventually drifts out of the film. Pity.With Rogers and his mongrel dog soldiers following Holden and his men, the latter enter Mexico. They catch up with Holden's other gang member, Edmond O'Brien. A grizzled old guy, apparently his past is as violent as the other members of the gang.But what comes across is that Holden, Borgnine, O'Brien, Johnson, Oates, and Sanchez are more complex than just violent. They'll use violence to win or gain a point, but they have strong senses of honor. They believe in loyalty to each other. There is an early scene where Holden has to kill another member who is blind from the wounds of battle, and they don't have the time to bury the poor guy. Everyone is upset by this (they'd like to do so) but time is of the essence - so his corpse is left out for the buzzards. Another matter is their sense of right and wrong. The American Capitalists are no better in this part of the world with their armies of the creepy than the Mexican Warlords like General Mapache (Emilio Fernandez - in an interesting villain part - he wants to beat Pancho Villa, making one appreciate that notorious "murderer and bigamist."as a relative rationalist*)*This quote on Villa is from Theodore Roosevelt, believe it or not!It's a world of the dead, but one gets a vision that the hideousness of the world of 1916 (with Pershing's troops adding their idiocies to the mess; so do two members of the Imperial German Military Commission to Mexico - the "Zimmermann Telegram" is coming up in a year) was headed that way from way back. Peckinpaugh frequently has Holden recall "happier times" (even though Borgnine quickly wonders what was so happy about them!). They were happy because everyone was younger, and had more time to smell the roses. Violence abounded in the 1890s, when Holden was nearly shot dead with his lover by her husband (who got away with it). Justice is a vague ideal - although "the Wild Bunch" seeks it. The one who most seeks it is Sanchez, who has seen his family, friends, neighbors slaughtered and robbed by Fernandez). Sanchez is determined to destroy the warlord, and free the people. The others realize this is useless, but in the end he turns out to be the final catalyst of the conclusion of the film.Yes, Peckinpaugh's artistic, slow motion violence is there too, but that is only technique. The issue is how the last real men of the West go out with a clean sweep of the society. And in the end they enter legend - their bodies reclaimed from the Martins and jackals who seek to use them for "proof of bounty".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American masterpiece; one of the greatest Westerns (and films) of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pike Bishop (William Holden) is the aging leader of a motley collection of outlaws (Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Edmond O'Brien, Jaime Sanchez, Bo Hopkins) who try to pull off one last score in 1913 Texas. But a robbery goes horribly wrong when bounty hunters led by railroad detective Harrigan (Albert Dekker) ambush them, leading to a bloody massacre. The Bunch flees into Mexico, pursued by a posse led by Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), Pike's ex-partner. The Bunch finds themselves working for bloodthirsty Federale Mapache (Emilio Fernandez), who is trying to suppress Pancho Villa's revolutionaries - but their loyalty is conflicted when Angel (Sanchez) turns out to be a member of an Indian tribe oppressed by Mapache. After robbing a US Army arms shipment, the Bunch allows Angel to take some guns for his tribe - but Angel is captured by Mapache and brutally tortured. Finally, Pike, "tired of being hunted" and sick of himself, leads the gang in a desperate last stand."The Wild Bunch" is an American masterpiece. Best-known for revolutionizing big-screen violence, Sam Peckinpah's magnum opus is far more than just a blood-soaked splatter-fest. It's the distillation of Peckinpah's world-view - corruption, moral ambiguity, changing times and men, the horror and glamor of violence, and the complex nature of honor and loyalty. Any misguided critic who views Westerns as outdated popular entertainment needs to watch this film; it has enough character, narrative and thematic depth to put many novels to shame.Indeed, The Wild Bunch is a cinematic novel. It portrays the theme of doomed men struggling to outlive their time, and the inherent impossibility of doing so. Men like Pike, Dutch, the Gorch Brothers, and Deke Thornton are products of their time - men who are clever and cunning but not particularly intelligent, who live by a Code, and who see violence as a way of life. In this new era, honor and loyalty are irrelevant; Harrigan and his scruffy bounty hunters are concerned only with personal profit, which, as Pike himself admits, "cuts an awful lot of family ties". Even the Bunch's unity is questionable: the surly Gorch Brothers dispute Pike's every move; grouchy old Sykes is a grumbling, cackling liability; and the idealistic Angel traps the Bunch into an unwitting death. Only Dutch remains unremittingly loyal to Pike, but ultimately, they HAVE to stick together in order to stay alive - they simply have no other choice.Pike Bishop is a fascinating creation, a tragic hero of Shakespearean proportions. He is a man trapped by his own sense of loyalty and honor - "When you side with a man, you stick with him" - but he repeatedly fails to live up to it. He leaves Crazy Lee to die, similarly betrays Sykes, lets Angel be captured by Mapache, and, we later learn, is responsible for Thornton's arrest. In spite of his bluster, he's really a selfish, petty man who's only happy when he's in control (see the train robbery, where Pike is able, albeit briefly, to recapture his youth). He has too many scars, too many betrayals and failures to simply move on; he's a haunted man who knows his time is up, and his attempts to "modernize" his gang are laughable. Ultimately, sick of himself, Pike makes a stand - and ultimately, by sacrificing his gang for Angel, he finally lives up to his code.Deke Thornton is Pike's mirror image. Thornton was Pike's partner whom he left to be captured. Offered a choice between continued imprisonment and hunting down his old gang ("30 Days to get Pike, or 30 Days back to Yuma"), Thornton chooses the latter; he knows the old days are over, and unlike Pike is willing to change. He, too, is trapped by his own sense of honor; he loathes the greedy, incompetent bounty hunters and longs to join his gang, but he gave Harrigan his word, and cannot break it. This is an agonizing compromise, often explored by Peckinpah; it's interesting to compare Thornton to Tyreen from "Major Dundee", or more pertinently "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" which plays as The Wild Bunch told by Deke Thornton.One would be remiss if they discussed the film without mentioning the violence. The movie features three scenes of horrifically graphic violence, with squibs and fake blood, rapid parallel editing, and slow motion. The violence isn't nearly as graphic as the spate of action and horror films since, and yet is infinitely more effective; if not actually realistic, its sheer visceral impact makes up for artificiality. Accused by ignorants of glamorizing violence, Peckinpah simply shows violence as it is; repulsive and horrific, but perversely thrilling. If this weren't the case, then why would violent Westerns and action movies be so popular? It's not exactly a subtle statement, but one of immense power; the violence is not gratuitous, but necessary to show a world where violence has become not only commonplace, but impersonal, cold, and acceptable.The movie features arguably the finest cast assembled for a Western. William Holden gives one of his best performances, using his own persona as a fading star to accentuate Pike's character. Ernest Borgnine's endlessly loyal Dutch and Robert Ryan's compromised Thornton complement Holden perfectly. Albert Dekker and Emilio Fernandez are both hiss-able villains who make it easier to sympathize with our protagonists. The supporting cast includes Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones as bounty hunters, Dub Taylor as a Bible-thumping preacher (was R.G. Armstrong unavailable?), and Bo Hopkins in a memorable bit as Crazy Lee. Only Edmond O'Brien's scenery-chewing as Sykes and Jaime Sanchez's theatrically "mannered" Angel are weak points, but neither is actively bad.This isn't to mention Lucien Ballard's gorgeous cinematography, or Jerry Fielding's beautiful, poignant score, or the subtle symbolism and supporting characters. The Wild Bunch is, simply put, an American masterpiece, and one of the great films of all time.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: Sam Peckinpah, Script: Walon Green, Peckinpah, Story: Roy N. Sickner, Cast: William Holden (Pike Bishop), Ernest Borgnine (Dutch Engstrom), Robert Ryon (Deke Thornton), Edmond O'Brian (Freddie Sykes), Warren Oates (Lyle Gorch), Ben Johnson (Tector Gorch), Jamie Sanchez (Angel), Emilo Fernandez (The General), Strather Martin(Coffer), L.Q. Jones (T.C.), Albert Dekker (Pat Harrigan)Peckinpah's Wild Bunch is one of the most compelling and moving of all westerns and perhaps all films. It is one of the all time greatest films. It is a movie about dignity and honour. The "Wild Bunch", led by Pike Bishop(Willam Holdon) and Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine), are a wild group of aging outlaws on a quest to get that one last chance 'to score' before they retire. This film symbolizes both the aging of the outlaws and the end of the 'traditional' west. Set in 1913, the old west has given way to the industrial revolution and these men want no part of it.The movie opens up with the group riding into town dressed as armed soldiers. They rob a train station but get ambushed in the process by a group of bounty hunters resulting in a bloody shoot-out where innocent people get killed. These bounty hunters are a bunch of low life criminals hired by the detective of the railroad to go after the Wild Bunch. The man leading the group of bounty hunters,Thornton (Robert Ryan)was once a member of the gang. He is forced by the detective to go after them or go back to prison. The group of men ride out of town and end up at a Mexican village across the Rio Grande. It is here where they open up their bags of gold only to discover that they are filled with metal washers. They where hoping to retire after this robbery. In this village, they meet up with a Mexican named Angel who becomes one of the bunch. Still hoping to get their gold, they get involved with a corrupt Mexican general. The general wants to have total control of northern Mexico and so he makes a deal with the bunch. The gang rob a train carrying army rifles. They agree to give the general 16 boxes of rifles from the robbery in exchange for $ 10,000 in gold. Angel wants to have arms for the people of his village so they can be protected. They give one of the sixteen boxes to Angel in lew of the gold. When they present the boxes to the general, they tell him that one box fell into the river. The general had found out otherwise, they accuse Angel of theft. The Mexican general and his men take Angel and something bad happens to him. The Wild Bunch go after Angel and a major shoot-out ensues resulting in a extremely violent and sad end.Much like Leone's Good Bad and Ugly, their is no "good" guy or "bad" guy. Their are no moral certainties in this film. Well their actually are some. These are honour and loyalty. Like Pike says " When you side with a man, you stay with him". "And if you can't do that, your some kind of animal, your finished". Peckinpah makes us feel for the characters in this movie, we get to know them. Which makes the ending all the more tragic. This loyalty also extends to Thornton. He has no choice but to go after the bunch and once being a member himself, he struggles with this. A lot goes on during the course of this film. One has to see it more than once because something new can be found each time. This film will stay with you long after you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film So Radical It Destroyed A Whole Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The western was very much a staple diet of American cinema . It's a genre that wasn't really popular with critics but was popular with the general public both sides of the Atlantic probably to do with the romantic ideals and values of the good guy always defeating the bad guy in a straight fight . Along comes Sam Peckinpah and turns the genre on its head It's important to realise what was happening when THE WILD BUNCH was being produced . The Hollywood studio system had given way to " The New Hollywood " where the director was given sole creative control while The Hays Code strictly forbidding on screen sex and violence had given way to a certification system widening moral ambiguity and explicit adult themes . Director Sam Peckinpah stampedes through these new found artistic freedoms The film gets off to a shocking opening and there's very much an influence of Eisenstein at play . As there's little internal logic to a woman remonstrating with Czarist troops in BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN there's equally little logic to the temperance society members continually walking in to the crossfire between the outlaws and the bounty hunters in a gun battle lasting four minutes . The emotional impact of the scene takes preference over logic and even today this remains a potent scene Much of this is down to the editing . No other colour film before it contained so much rapid cross cutting editing . Many scenes - most notably the bloody shoot out ending contain a shot length of less than one second . American film theorist David Bordwell calculated at the end of the century the average shot length was three to six seconds while it was becoming slightly longer , so for a film released in 1969 this type of fast paced editing style is absolutely phenomenal Peckinpah was a master of dubious morality and THE WILD BUNCH contains the theme of this amorality . The outlaws are desperate men but they have their own moral codes . When one of the outlaws wants to dispatch old timer Sykes anti-hero Pike Bishop self righteously dictates when you ride with a man it's for keeps , and the outlaws find a mortal redemption when they sacrifice their lives as an act of revenge for the execution of Angel The legacy of THE WILD BUNCH is that it effective destroyed the traditional western . Afterwards there were only revisionary westerns such as LITTLE BIG MAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES and anti westerns such as McCABE AND MRS MILLER and THE CULPEPPER CATTLE CO being produced but never again would the western be a long term prolific production . That's what you call radical</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming on the heels of Leone's westerns with Clint Eastwood, The Wild Bunch busted through the barriers that confined Hollywood westerns like a wrecking ball. While Leone made these stark westerns, Peckinpah dished up the sentimentality to go along with the slow motion gunfights adding a little soul to the mix and softening the starkness, especially with the cast of Borgnine, Holden, Oates, Johnson, O'Brien, and Sanchez. They're outlaws who rob trains and sell guns to Mexican revolutionaries, not the evil killers in Leone's films like Fonda and his gang in Once Upon A Time In The West. The feeling is heightened by Lucien Ballard's cinematography that captures the action and the landscape. What Leone lacked in sentimentality, he more than made up for in the killer soundtracks and stark imagery and loner characters. The Bunch were a team, brothers almost, who in the end die to save one of their own, going down fighting a losing battle with Oates especially impressive blasting away with the Gatling gun. The Wild Bunch is a film with gravity. It has the heaviness of John Ford's finest westerns, bathed in blood, booze, and golden light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the bitter experience that was to make "Major Dundee" in 1965, director Sam Peckinpah spent years without working on any theatrical film (although he did made a small TV movie in 1966), disenchanted with the studio actions over the film he thought was going to be his masterpiece. Fortunately, the years in silence payed off when in 1969, Peckinpah returned to film-making with a vengeance in the form of a film that would change the face of the Western genre for ever: "The Wild Bunch". Peckinpah was not a stranger to the genre, as he had directed several Western TV series and also already had a classic in his resum ("Ride the High Country", which in many ways predates the themes of "The Wild Bunch"); but it was with "The Wild Bunch" when he finally started a new stage for American Western movies, after the revolution that the Spaghetti Westerns meant in the mid part of the 60s.Set in 1917, "The Wild Bunch" is the story of an aging gang of outlaws and their attempts to make a final big score before retiring. Led by Pike (William Holden) and Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), the Bunch attempts to rob a bank in Texas where a vast amount of money is supposed to be kept. After the robbery becomes a savage massacre, only five members of the group manage to escape to Mexico: Pike, Dutch, the Gorch brothers (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson) and the Mexican ngel (Jaime Snchez). With their hopes broken after the failed robbery, Pike's gang decides to work for General Mapache (Emilio Fernndez), a Mexican general who hires them to steal a shipment of U.S. military equipment in order to have the upper hand in the Mexican Revolution. Without nothing to lose, and knowing that they are being followed after the shootout in Texas, the Bunch prepares for a last ride.Based on a story by Walon Green and Roy N. Sickner, the movie follows the themes that Peckinpah had already explored in his previous two films: aging outlaws facing change, the end of the Wild West, and most importantly, honor between friends. With a script written by Peckinpah and Green, the film is an epic story that, like Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West", deals with the arrival of civilization, the final taming of the West and the effects this had in the persons that made it what it was. However, unlike Leone's epic, "The Wild Bunch" gives special importance to the characters and the relationships between them. Not only every member of the Bunch is explored, but also the men pursuing them, and a lot of accurate background is given to the Mexican Revolution and their fighters. It's remarkable the way that the characters are written, in the sense that more than protagonists they become almost like living persons that one can easily sympathize with.Peckinpah once again proves that this was his favorite genre by making one of the most beautiful Westerns ever made. With an excellent use of slow-motion and a cinematography that shows the influence of Italian films, Peckinpah creates an opera of violence that fits perfectly the epic tone of the story. His care for realism and obvious respect for the many cultures present in his film sets the tone for what in the future would be called "revisionist Westerns". As he did previously in "Ride the High Country", Peckinpah focuses on the themes of redemption and adaptation to change, and his use of the 20th Century's modern machinery to imply change is considered one of "The Wild Bunch"'s main icons. The influence of this film in modern action films has probably been covered many times in other reviews, so I'll only state the obvious: it's enormous.The cast of the film is simply perfect, all giving a terrific performance and making the most of their characters. Story says that many big names were considered before William Holden, but honestly I can't see anyone delivering a better performance than him as Pike Bishop, the Bunch's leader. Ernest Borgnine as the complex Dutch Engstrom probably gave his best performance in this movie too, and makes an excellent counterpart to Holden's troubled character. Personally, I find Robert Ryan to be the highlight of the film, even when his character has very few screen time, he probably symbolizes the best what Peckinpah had in mind in this film. Finally, the performances by Oates, O'Brien, Johnson and Snchez as the rest of the bunch are definitely excellent. Legendary directors Emilio Fernndez and Chano Urueta appear in small roles, but both deliver unforgettable performances.Many words have been written about the visual violence of this movie and its influence in future films, but personally, what makes "The Wild Bunch" a unique Western, is the high quality of the script it has. Many films have quotable phrases or one-liners, but the brilliantly written dialogs of this movie have a power akin to the best works of literature, as often there is a deep meaning in every line and every scene. Peckinpah is very honest in his portrayal of the dying American West, and is not afraid of showing both the good and bad sides of the human soul. Like in spaghetti Westerns, there is not a defined "good" or "evil", but Peckinpah goes beyond the Italian films and completely demythologizes the concept of "heroes" and "villians", keeping his characters simply as "humans". It's certainly grim and nihilistic at first sight, but few films capture the concepts of true friendship and loyalty like this movie does. The Western genre is often misunderstood a simple stories of cowboys and Indians; but "The Wild Bunch" proves that there is more than that in the genre. With the possible exception of "Straw Dogs", Peckinpah never get the chance to make a movie the way he wanted after this classic, so "The Wild Bunch" proudly stands as the masterpiece of the rebel director. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic Peckinpah outing, with William Holden and Ernest Borgnine leading a outlaw crew south of the border in the immediate post-West period. Not really a "Western" per se, so much as a paean to masculinity, here seen in it's dying grandeur. An awesome movie, probably Peckinpah's masterpiece, manages to both endorse his world view and tell an exciting story, as his protagonists find their rationales running out and decide to end it in a blaze of glory. Avoids both the didacticism and sentimentality that mar other Peckinpah efforts. Holden is superb, as is Ben Johnson and Warren Oates. A must see that only improves with repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect masterpiece and a milestone in the history of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wild Bunch" is a perfect masterpiece and a milestone in the history of cinema. Sam Peckinpah's innovative ideas (slow-motion, squirts of blood etc.) have been so widely imitated afterwards that it is impossible to realize nowadays how impressive the movie was for a 1969 audience. Actually, furious gun-fights with extraneous, innocent people involved and killed, the "heroes" shooting to women, the bounty hunters spoliating the corpses of their own mates are tough stuff even for current standards in violent movies.When I saw the film for the first time in the early 70's, I was both shocked and enthusiast. After the long battle following the failed bank robbery, I thought that such a fantastic action scene by no means could be equalized. Thus I couldn't believe my eyes, seeing that the final slaughter at the Mapache's headquarters was even better! As a matter of fact, these two are by far the best action scenes ever filmed.The story is perfectly built, no scene is superfluous. For instance: a seemingly marginal episode, the murder of Teresa by the jealous Angel, is useful to the encounter of Mapache with the outlaws of the wild bunch and also has decisive consequence in the remainder of the plot.The whole cast works superbly. William Holden arguably gives the best performance of a luminous career. His Pike is the laconic boss, wholly aware of his charisma and authority. When he says "Let's go", we realize that no argument or hesitation is permitted. His character is rather complex. He appears to be a romantic out-cast, nostalgic of the faded good times of Old West. Nonetheless, he is cynical and ruthless, ready to sacrifice innocent people or to abandon his mates. Even when Pike decides to rescue Angel from Mapache's clutches, we don't forget that he cannot flee from Mapache's den, since the bounty hunters are expecting him.Strangely enough, the real romantic, nostalgic figure is Dutch (Ernest Borgnine). His deep manly friendship towards Pike is a theme taken from classic western movies. And his romantic attitude is emphasized by the shy kind-of-love-story he has with a Mexican woman of Angel's village. The flower she gives to Dutch is perhaps a metaphor of his old-fashioned respect for women. Also note that Dutch is the only one of the bunch who doesn't look for a prostitute, before the final mortal clash with Mapache and his soldiers. Another hint of his idealization of women. Borgnine acts splendidly, as he always does, in fact.The character of Thornton (Robert Ryan), the old friend of Pike, forced to chase him cruelly, is interesting and superbly interpreted, but somewhat conventional with respect to the previous ones.Excellent performances are given by Ben Johnson, Warren Oates, Jaime Sanchez, Edmund O' Brien, Strother Martin, and, especially, Emilio Fernandez (the scaring, loathsome Mapache, fantastic job!).In the movie we find many symbols of the decadence of the Old West and its legend. A significant one: the fire-arms of the out-laws. They no more use the classical Winchesters and single-action six-shooters, the paradigmatic weapons of West. They have modern, proficient, devastating pump-action shot-guns and semi-automatic Colt 45. In fact, Pike keeps a six-shooter in his holster, but he never draws it.What else is to be praised in "The Wild Bunch"? The magnificent photography, the outstanding care for details, the essential, powerful dialogue? Actually, everything is perfect in this masterpiece.Personally, I find just a fault in the film, a fault by no means artistic or technical: "The Wild Bunch" gave a (splendid but) decisive contribution to the death of the Western genre, which I love so much.A final remark. "The Wild Bunch" received much censure because in it all women are represented as greedy prostitutes. Let me say that this sort of criticism is utterly preposterous. I mean, these fellows are assassins more at ease with bullets than with words. Which kind of women are they supposed to associate with? Perhaps some radical intellectual with a Harvard Ph. D. in the "History of Feminism"? Please!  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's masterpiece... and possibly the finest western ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ground-breaking, revisionist western from Sam Peckinpah, The Wild Bunch is one of the most important films in the evolution of the cinema. Although violence existed in the cinema before this film, it was Peckinpah's treatment of violence that opened the gates for every subsequent film-maker to show graphic gunshot wounds, throat-slashing, and the like, with shocking realism. Moreover, The Wild Bunch also subtly shows how violence leaves a lasting and damaging effect upon children. Throughout the film, there are cleverly understated shots of children witnessing various acts of crime and killing - the kids tormenting the scorpion at the start; the two kids who cling together in the midst of the film's opening shootout; the kids in Mapache's town - culminating with the Wild Bunch's talismanic leader Pike being gunned down by a child in the climactic massacre.A gang of outlaws led by Pike Bishop (William Holden) ride into a town in 1913 and proceed to rob the railroad office. However, their getaway is jeopardised by a railroad company's hired bounty hunters, headed unwillingly by Pike's former friend Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), who has been offered the chance to earn a pardon if he can catch or kill his old comrade-in-arms. Following a massacre in the streets, Pike's gang escape and flee to Mexico where they are enlisted by a seedy general in Agua Verde to rob a weapons train. Pike and his surviving gang-members, Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), Lyle (Warren Oates), Tector (Ben Johnson) and Angel (Jaime Sanchez), agree to carry out the raid on behalf of the general, but they unwisely give one box of the stolen rifles to the local bandits, resulting in the general seeking retribution by taking Angel as his hostage. Believing that they should stand by Angel whatever the cost, Pike and the boys put up one last stand against the soldiers of Agua Verde.Audiences in '69 were suitably appalled by the film's nihilistic attitude, detailed violence, raw dialogue and relentless bleakness. Up to that point, westerns had been romanticised and bloodless tales with honourable heroes and detestable baddies. Here, Peckinpah blurs the line, giving us characters who are all bad in some way or other, but showing their many facets so as to get us to empathise with them. The story shows Pike's gang gradually realising that the days of the Wild West are drawing to a close and, knowing that the new civilised age holds nothing worth their time, they sacrifice themselves in a manner that befits the hell-raising lifestyles they have led. The final sequence is enormously moving (not to mention bloody) as these misguided, cold-blooded but strangely honourable men fight a hopeless battle for the values they stubbornly adhere to. Written, directed, scored and (especially) edited to perfection, The Wild Bunch is a classic in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glossy, outdated violence and not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah wants you to know that Hollywood is at last free of its self-imposed Hays Code. He sets out to create the most violent Western to date, and he succeeds. The body count here is higher than in some wars. Every death is captured in slow-motion and augmented with jets of blood. Perhaps these novel visuals were thrilling and shocking to moviegoers in the late 1960s, but decades later desensitization has long since set in. The violence in "The Wild Bunch" has not aged well, and there is little else of interest in the film. A thin storyline links one scene of carnage to the next, but the movie doesn't know what to do with its characters between the action. A sentimental musical score plays to the point of distraction throughout the film but should fool nobody into caring about any of the people on screen. It is, however, nice to see the underrated Robert Ryan in a starring role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing the Wild Bunch around the age of 16, I was merely watching movies. Some of those movies were acknowledged classics, while some of them were just trash ... However, only after seeing the Wild Bunch, I finally understood what movies are all about. It was an enlightening.Sam Peckinpah put a lot of heart into his movies. The Wild Bunch is the masterpiece where he got everything just about right, but the same themes and elements are echoed throughout his other work. In fact, all Peckinpah movies show his personal touch, something which is, sadly, lacking of 99% of the other movies made, especially nowadays.Interestingly, although many contemporary critics condemned his work, way too many movies have later copied or stolen Peckinpah's style, even individual scenes, and even decades later, without credit, and have still been called 'original'. In this sense, Peckinpah was way before his time. The Wild Bunch demonstrates the essence of his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dusky but highly overrated western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some people who aren't familiar with his work, the name of Sam Peckinpah remains associated with two films: The Wild Bunch (1969) and Straw Dogs (1971). These two pieces of world are linked with a feature that became a trademark in Peckinpah's cinema: violence. The filmmaker who signed remarkable westerns prior to the 1969 film always contended about The Wild Bunch that violence was the inevitable consequence of a world about to collapse. Although, it is usually revered as one of the most important westerns ever made, I do not think it's a work on a par with other unforgettable westerns made by Anthony Mann or John Ford.Numerous elements that pigeonhole "The Wild Bunch" as a pessimistic western are here. William Holden and his gang appear to be jaded men who only want to call it a day. They have a strong tendency for alcohol and prostitutes. Even if they are linked by a strong friendship, they are conscious they have no place to go or to be in a changing world: see the sequences with the car. Furthermore, the machine guns they have to snatch was just being invented. Without mentioning, of course, the famous opening sequence with the children playing cruelly with the scorpions being eaten by ants.So, why is The Wild Bunch ultimately underwhelming? Because if Peckinpah had focused and tightened all the aforementioned features instead of letting his taste for gratuitous violence explode, the result would have been much more palatable. Besides, the only real violent sequences are located at the beginning and at the end of this overlong film. The massacres end up looking like slaughters and they are superfluous filler with the rest of the film. Filming men being killed with massive amounts of blood in slow motion doesn't help matters. Claude Chabrol who sadly died three months ago said about it that it was an example of hateful violence.Between these two would-be pivotal sequences, the film loses its "raison d'etre" dealing with violence if we can put it this way. The action is often sluggish and the events aren't worth a good storytelling. And Robert Ryan's gang is particularly hateful.If you want blood, Peckinpah's film has got it. And as for me, the omnipresence of violence to epitomize the end of the western genre isn't proof of an artistic success. There are more subtle devices to express it. See Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven (1992).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Death of the Old West Myth, the Birth of Modern Violence ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wild Bunch" is more than an ode to the Old Western myth; it also vibrates as a thrilling and poignant swan song of a genre, of an era, of a mentality, that can be summarized in one word: loyalty. This is the movie about loyalty, the greatest masculine virtue. "The Wild Bunch" is the ultimate male-bonding film, depicting its noblest virtue through the main character, the leader of the bunch, Pyke, played by William Holden in one of his greatest performances.The beautiful landscapes, the settings are typical of a western, but there's an odd agonizing feeling all through the film. This is a recurrent theme in Peckinpah's filmography, the "end of the myth", illustrated by brief but symbolic occurrences of such oddities as machine-guns and cars (just like in his next film "The Ballad of Cable Hogue") ? and the most significant sign of this end-of-an-era is the presence of children. For such a brutal and ultra-violent film, children are omnipresent, and not like passive characters, as to show that the days of the bunch are numbered. Pyke, Dutch, his best friend played by the great Ernest Borgnine, and the Gorch brothers (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson) will go. No choice, go or vanish. The most repeated and powerful line in the film is "let's go", which beyond loyalty, shows the greatest virtue of a man: capability to choose his destiny, go as not to undergo. A man is a man when he chooses his path. "The Wild Bunch" is not nihilism but existentialism. Never let circumstances guiding you and act according to your principles.And the bunch moves forward for reasons, a railroad company put a price on their heads, and an expedition of trashy, low-life, bounty hunters track them, lead by Thornton, the most important character of the film after Pyke, played by Robert Ryan. Thornton appears at first as a redeemed version of Pyke, he chose to bring men to the bunch, not by betrayal, but by necessity, it's his mission, not to return to jail. You can feel that mutual respect between Pyke and Thornton who used to be partners, their relationship is a mountain rock that even the winds of time can hardly corrode. When Sykes, the oldest member of the bunch, played by Edmond O'Brien, is bullied by Tector, this leads to the most important statement of the film: "When you side with a man, you stay with a man and if you can't do that you're some kind of animal," Loyalty, moving forward AND together, respect and self-respect, these are the basic principles on which relies the human dignity.This virile philosophy had been spirited away by greed, ambition, prosperity. The bounty hunters are an allegory of the worst remains of this era, abandoning their dignity to act like human buzzards when they meet their victims. Thornton looks at them with disdain, feeling more respect to the men he's hunting. "The Wild Bunch" is about a philosophy of dignity transcending legal barriers. They are criminals, but the movie doesn't glorify crime but the morality within the bunch. And the brief moments where they're laughing together, having fun, sharing girls as they share a bottle of wine, you can't help but feel a profound empathy to these guys ? as a guy.Yes, it's a politically incorrect film. Is the treatment of women sexist? I think life was tough enough and Peckinpah did in fact respect women by not depicting them as pure and innocent victims: they also kill, betray, use their voluptuous body as ticket to live the great life, there's no innocence. Even children, in a shuddering sequence, are shown torturing two poor scorpions in the beginning of the film, sacrificing them to an army of red ants, a disturbing and significant sequence to demonstrate how violence is an inner part of our humanity. And children kill for fun, burning everything, scorpions and ants. The whole scene is a metaphor of the film, the ants are Mapache's army, the scorpions the bunch, the children the new era : Pyke is ironically killed by a kid during the climactic shootout.Thinking of the shootout, what a rewarding sequence! If anyone doubts Peckinpah's genius as a director and editor, just watch this scene and the first sequence, there's a kind of poetic choreography mixed with a thrilling gut-wrenching realism, blood splatters everywhere like the ultimate explosion of violence repressed since so many decades of westerns. Death isn't clean, innocent by-standers aren't spared, kids and women die, it's a refreshing orgy of blood almost shouting "at least, real violence" Lyle Gorch (Warren Oates) shouting while turning the machine gun on Mapache's men, powerfully illustrates the revolutionary aspect of the film. This movie paved the way to a new style of violence, with gore, harsh realism, and thrilling editing, Scorsese, De Palma, Tarantino, Woo ? all owe to Peckinpah.To conclude, "The Wild Bunch" is a nostalgic film showing how every man, even the bad ones wants to become a child again, when ironically, many children in the film acted as precocious soldiers. It's a movie about an age of disillusions, when you become old enough to realize that what matters isn't money or glory or women or power, but being faithful to your own idea of dignity, like Angel (Jaime Sanchez) with his people, like the bunch with Angel when they decide to walk to Mapache's headquarter : the most iconic image of the film. Bravery or suicide? Probably both, it was an act of courageous loyalty and a necessary suicide ? better to die in a blaze of glory like friends, than try to belong to an era you don't believe in anymore.It's a story about a death and a rebirth, and the movie is like its own allegory, the end of the Western myth, but the birth of modern cinematic violence ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Western, but not as deconstructionist as you may have been told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The passage of time can have an interesting effect on movies. Some films become more appreciated as time goes on. Some films that are initially hailed, suffer as they are reevaluated over time. The Wild Bunch is an unusual case. The things that garnered it such praise when it was first released no longer have much salience, but the fading of that hype and sensation hasn't hurt the movie at all. The passage of time has revealed it to be a very good story on a basic level.The Wild Bunch is about a gang of outlaws that has managed to fight and rob and kill all the way past the end of the Wild West era. They're still riding horses and robbing railroad company offices as automobiles and planes begin to spread across the world, as semi-automatic pistols and machine guns take the place of revolvers and rifles, as War threatens in Europe and Pancho Villa leads his rebels in Mexico. The gang is lead by Pike (William Holden), a smart man who can feel age sapping away the strength that used to carry him through life. Pike and some of the rest of his gang are looking for one more big score, so they can retire to a life of at least mediocre leisure . That big score isn't their latest robbery of a railroad office, though. That's an ambush that leaves several of the gang dead and the rest with nothing to show for their efforts. In addition, the railroad has freed Pike's former partner, Thornton (Robert Ryan), from prison. The railroad puts Thornton in charge of a posse of human scum and sends them after Pike's gang. Pike leads his gang into Mexico, where they encounter a general who gives them a chance for that one more big score. The gang is to steal weapons for the general from a U.S. Army train in exchange for 10,000 dollars in gold. But even though Thornton is able to anticipate or figure out everything Pike and his gang are planning, it's not the robbery that causes them any trouble. When one of the gang members, Angel (Jaime Sanchez), is taken prisoner by the general for Angel's work helping Mexican rebels, Pike and his men have to make a decision. They can take the money, abandon their compatriot and live. Or they can decide that there are some things they can't live with anymore.When the Wild Bunch first hit theaters, what caused a commotion was the level of graphic violence in the picture. When people get shot in this Western, they spurt blood and slow motion captures their death spasms. And they don't just get shot once, it might take two or three or six bullets to bring them down. And the final battle where dozens and dozens are killed by machine guns and grenades was pretty far beyond anything expected in the Western genre. Of course, all of that stuff is hardly shocking or that noteworthy by today's movie violence standards. Peckinpah's skill at portraying violence as chaos and frenzy is still striking. There's none of the careful and obvious choreography in his killings that you find so often in modern films. But while Peckinpah's bloodbaths were almost unprecedented in their day, it's all rather tame to anyone who's seen everything from Jaws to The Terminator to Saving Private Ryan.While its "cutting edge" has dulled, The Wild Bunch remains a really good movie. Holden gives a strong performance as a man who knows he's outlived his time, but still hopes for an ending he won't regret. Ernest Borgnine and Edmond O'Brien are also quite good as Pike's closest friends, O'Brien as the weak, old man that Holden could degenerate into and Borgnine as the contemporary who doesn't really understand the outlaw days are over. Robert Ryan is equally fine as a badman who's been caught and won't let himself go back to prison, even though he's disgusted and outraged at the behavior and attitudes of his "law abiding" masters and fellow bounty hunters.The plot is also imaginative, fast moving and realistic, for the most part. The action scenes are compelling and the story doesn't bog down in between, but it still takes time to let these characters show you who they are so the movie doesn't have to stop and tell you.Before I watched it, I remember hearing about The Wild Bunch as one of those Westerns that deconstructed the genre. But I don't think that's fundamentally true. Yes, the movie is much more realistic about the violence, sex, poverty, hardship and depravity of the Wild West. Yet in the end it embraces the conventions of the Western instead of exploding them. The Western was never really about its unrealistic clichs of shooting guns out of people's hand or singing cowboys and what not. They were stories defined and bounded by concepts of honor and right and wrong. They were stories of men choosing to do what they thought was right instead of what was easy. They were characters and adventures that may not have been true to their time period, but they were true to the way we wish the world would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Peckinpah Shoots Westerns Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" seems like a very ordinary story. The more realistic tone, and violent content, which heralded its arrival, are no longer new - it wasn't completely new in 1969, either - but, this was an obviously stylistic, staged vision, by a director who rode westerns into their saturation level of success, on television. During the previous decade, the "western" racked up more TV prime-time hours than any other genre; and, Mr. Peckinpah was a major contributor. He obviously had some horse sense. Alas, the preeminent western died a slow death, and never fully recovered. This film is almost a tombstone.Peckinpah, photographer Lucien Ballard, and musician Jerry Fielding are at their best. How great thou art. The ordinary-sounding storyline involves outlaw bank and train robber William Holden (as Pike Bishop), sidekick Ernest Borgnine (as Dutch Engstrom), and "The Wild Bunch" being pursued by law-minded old pal Robert Ryan (as Deke Thornton) and his group of "gutter trash." Things get complicated when Jaime Sanchez (as Angel), an Hispanic member of Mr. Holden's gang, tries to help his (assimilating Mexican) people. It's a multi-leveled story of lawlessness and loyalty. The more you scratch beneath the surface, the richer it gets.********* The Wild Bunch (6/18/69) Sam Peckinpah ~ William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Jaime Sanchez</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the vicious opening sequence, in which a circle of laughing and cruel children poke at a scorpion writhing in a sea of ants to the infamous blood-spurting finale, Sam Peckinpah completely rewrites John Ford's Western mythology - by looking at the passing of the Old West from the point of view of the marginalized outlaws rather than the law-abiding settlers. Though he spares us none of the callousness and brutality of Holden and his gang, the director nevertheless presents their macho code of loyalty as a positive value in a world increasingly dominated by corrupt railroad magnates and their mercenary killers. "The Wild Bunch" is a savagely beautiful and nihilistic spectacle with Lucien Ballard's gorgeous cinematography oozing from the screen.

		<shortDescription>The end of the West through the eyes of the late great Sam Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah was a person born in a wrong age. He lived with the ideal of the Old West in a time long past it. But cinema gave him a chance to recreate all the tales he grew up with, and it was here where he found solace. His vision was not the idealized, sugary concept of the Hawkes and Ford era, nor the operatic, anti-hero, Italian western this was an entirely new representation. Dark, violent, gritty yet so human and believable one could really accept that this was the way it was. "The Wild Bunch" remains as Peckinpah's most famous example of his "West". A multi-layered narrative that progresses so perfectly on all levels it becomes astounding to watch. It propelled modern action movies to a whole new direction even though it itself could hardly be considered action. Why? Because Peckinpah's idea of violence isn't an idealization of the act of killing, he doesn't glamorize it. Instead shows us the consequences it has on the people caught in the crossfire.The end of the Old West is drawing near. Vehicles have began replacing horses and semi-automatic weapons have started replacing the revolvers. It is at this fabled time, where our story takes place amidst the desert badlands of the U.S. ? Mexico border. A group of aging outlaws led by Pike Bishop (played by William Holden) scour through in hopes of completing one final job before retiring. They are relentlessly chased by a band of bounty hunters led by Deke Thornton (played by Robert Ryan) a former associate and friend of Pike who has been forced into to service against his old friend. The relationship between the two men plays a crucial part of the plot. The way it unfolds, we get a very clear indication of who these men are, what are they like. Setting their motivations clear and opening the path to the final realization of what has become of them."The Wild Bunch" is one of the most morally ambiguous movies I have ever seen. Peckinpah doesn't waste his time in telling us who is good or who is bad, he doesn't try to convince us what is morally right or wrong. Instead he just tells this story of a group of outlaws this Wild Bunch who face the reality of their actions leading up to the point where they no longer find what they do compelling and in a final gesture of conscience, they decide to do what's right. In those moments before the epic finale we see Pike question himself as he drinks from the nearly empty bottle of whiskey while sitting on an old bed in a run-down shack. He questions his whole life, practically comparing it with the empty bottle in hand. That moment seals it, he knows what he must do, he knows he won't live through it, but it doesn't matter his time is over. The land had changed but Pike couldn't, they all couldn't. In their last breathe of defiance the Bunch sacrifices itself, finally keeping up to their oath "never leave a man behind".Peckinpah's vision of the West becomes fully alive with the great performances by the cast. But it was Holden who made the biggest impression, his character is such a morally complex individual and yet he did with such precision, capturing the image of Pike Bishop in the fullest. I truly doubt anyone could have done it better than Holden. When it comes to the other aspects of the movie, Sam Peckinpah continues to excel. His direction is bloody and vicious, has more in common with an war movie. Action scenes are a battlefield where innocents are often caught in between the line of fire. It's not really meant to be entertaining or beautiful. Peckinpah wasn't searching for style when he used slow-motion during death scenes, he was trying to send a message, violence is not pretty. Yet somehow so many people misunderstood him.Whether people like it or not "The Wild Bunch" will remain a great movie. To this day no one has told the story of the end of the West better, and it's doubtful someone ever will. Peckinpah's masterpiece has been huge influence on cinema it opened the way for the modern action genre, inspiring dozens of directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of America's greatest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969) is a stunning and revolutionary experience not only in the western genre but especially in cinema in general. The film is set in 1913 Mexican border in which the new west is replacing the old one and cars, machine guns and "civilization" is arriving. A bunch of horse riding and charismatic bandits are about to retire because they know they cannot continue the old way of life now that everything is changing. Also, they are not as young as they used to be anymore. Pike Bishop (William Holden), Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine), Angel (Jaime Sanchez) and the rest of their little bunch is also chased by Pike's old friend Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan) who has some unsolved things with Pike in his history. As the bunch arrives to Mexico, they see a horribly brutal criminal General Mapache (Emilio Fernandez) terrorizing and killing people in his quest for power and domination. Violence is everywhere and everywhere where are human beings.The Wild Bunch could be considered as an example of perfect film making and thus a great masterpiece in the history of cinema. The two most powerful things in the film are the cinematography by Lucien Ballard and the editing by Lou Lombardo. The widescreen cinematography is gorgeously beautiful and the frames are filled with great care and consideration so there's nothing unnecessary or in vain there. The landscapes and the heat of the barren west are greatly captured so that it all almost comes through the screen and is easy to sense and feel in our side of reality, too. In the scene in which the bunch arrives in the violated Mexican village, there is some great shots of sun beams coming from the sky and through the trees creating the kind of atmosphere and "living mist" that could be expected from some Hong Kong talents like Ringo Lam (City on Fire, 1987) or Danny Lee &amp; Billy Tang (Dr. Lamb, 1992) to name just a few. Peckinpah did this all at the time when these makers were still a little children.Equally wonderful in the film is the editing which is world class and hasn't lost any of its power. The montage in the beginning, in the train robbing scene and in the final fierce gun fight is so incredible that the film desires to be seen over and over again just to learn from that editing and to learn how great cinema is created. The film could be chopped into pieces in order to study the bits and their elements and then watch how they work and complete the whole film as a piece of work. The Wild Bunch is quite simply a brilliant film of images and montage and also a great example of how suspense and tension is taken as far as possible in cinema.Much have been written about the film's violence and some writers have also suggested that "it has lost most of its power by today's standards" but how much more wrong could they be? Peckinpah was a very sensitive man and that's of course why his films are so violent. Why should a horrific thing like violence be depicted as some unreal and entertaining thing in cinema? Hollywood has produced a large amount of violent films of various genres in which violence is even a good thing and it is meant to be nice and it all may be accompanied by funny dialogue and other things that seem to justify the violence and make the film more entertaining. But cinema is meant to be much more. It is meant for makers like Peckinpah who express themselves through their art and depict things how they are and why they really are. Violence hides inside everyone of us but how many of the Hollywood blockbuster products dare to say it and depict it honestly without thinking about box office achievements and money? The Wild Bunch includes much merciless and brutal violence that is shot so coldly and harrowingly in slow motion that only few of the more recent films have managed to surpass the effect. In Peckinpah's films, bullets rip and tear people to shreds and only because someone fired the gun who spat the bullet. Why did he or she fire the gun at another is what Peckinpah wants to ask and depict by his usage of violence and perhaps that is also why not everyone accepts to understand his films and just wants to repeat the line "gratuitous violence, gratuitous violence" and shut the eyes off the reality.The acting and screenplay by Peckinpah and Walon Green in The Wild Bunch is also quite perfect. Holden, Borgnine and others have their own code of ethics and they are very loyal to each other (again one similar and important element found in many of the "heroic" Hong Kong action films) and they would never leave a friend no matter if it cost them their lives. They are wild and their bunch is wild but there's something much worse and mean in the world, something that doesn't necessarily have any sense of ethics and that comes in the form of General Mapache, the reality and so called civilization.The dialogue is striking and there's not a single word that wouldn't mean anything and nothing has been underlined or chewed ready for the viewer. The film includes many brief but effective lines of dialogue that say much more than tons of words, and strong characters don't need to talk. That element is at its greatest power in Japanese master Takeshi Kitano's films (Hana-Bi (1997), Sonatine (1993) etc.) as his films' power lies in the lack of dialogue and speech. It lies in the strong and real characters and incredible symbolism accompanied by the music of his composer, Joe Hisaishi. In The Wild Bunch, there are some very harrowing scenes depicting human relations and acts (like the choice of Angel's girl and the sadistic torture of the scorpion, committed by little children) and those scenes not only depict human nature's most rotten sides very intensively, but they only show how such a strong scenes and dramatic situations are created by the writer and the director.Music and soundtrack by Jerry Fielding in The Wild Bunch is also great and even the credits at the beginning are - like in all Peckinpah films - very memorable and are very "western like" in their style and reminded me also of the credits in Sergio Leone's spaghetti western classics accompanied by Ennio Morricone.I have always thought that there are only very few American and Hollywood directors who have achieved the same kinetic impact as the Hong Kong action directors, editors and choreographers have. Hong Kong makers like David Wu (the editor of films like Ronnie Yu's Bride With White Hair (1993) and John Woo's Hard-Boiled (1992)), Ching Siu Tung (the veteran action director and choreographer of films like A Chinese Ghost Story (1987), Terra-Cotta Warrior (1989), John Woo's incredible bullet spitting spectacle finale of A Better Tomorrow 2 (1987) among many others), Jackie Chan, Ringo Lam, John Woo and Kirk Wong belong to the names that have totally their own oriental style of editing and shooting and the result is practically always much greater than in any of the Western efforts. But in my opinion, at least Peckinpah and Kathryn Bigelow have managed to edit and direct their films in a way that they really come close to their Chinese colleagues' results. Bigelow's films like Point Break (1990) have wonderful cinematography and editing that really is as breath taking as in the films of those mentioned Hong Kong directors.The Wild Bunch is Peckinpah's masterpiece and perhaps the best of all his film. Even his lesser powerful and stunning films like The Getaway (1972), The Killer Elite (1975) or Cross of Iron (1977) have many unique elements that usually lie in the editing and visual expression. Of these mentioned films, Cross of Iron is the most noteworthy in my opinion and its violence and harrowing imagery is closest to that of The Wild Bunch's. The Straw Dogs (1971) is his another very great masterpiece and perhaps the bleakest and darkest of all his films about the brute living inside human being. Sam Peckinpah, one of America's greatest film makers, passed away in 1984 at the age of 59 but his films won't ever die. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The films of Sam Peckinpah: The perfect western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch (1969) has to be the perfect western. Sam Peckinpah's greatest film is also one of his most realized project. A gritty movie that pulls no punches in showing the dying days of the old west. William Holden stars Pike, a crusty old gunfighter who's in the waning days of life. His old running buddies Dutch (Ernest Borgnine) Angel (Jaime Sanchez)and the Gorch brothers (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson) have escaped a botched heist that was a set up to capture these wanted fugitives. They have been riding together for a long time. Just one more heist and they could have retired. But things like this never work out. The "wild bunch" is being chased by a gang of bounty hunters (L.Q. Jones, Strother Martin and Albert Dekker) lead by Pike's former friend Deke (Robert Ryan) he used to be a running buddy of Pike until he fled from a surprise attack by the local authorities. For an early release, Deke has to track down Pike and his cronies.The gang get's a new offer for a high profiled robbery. A Mexican general (Emilio Fernandez) will pay big money if the gang can steal a bunch of rifles from an U.S. Army supply train. He'll pay them in gold for those much needed arms. Pike and the boys plan the heist and steal the rifles. But they give a case to Angel so his people could fight of corrupt Generals like their employer. General Mapache (Emilio Fernandez) eventually gets word of the missing rifles and punishes Angel. Mapache doesn't care about the rest of the bunch, he's satisfied that he has Angel and tortures him morning, noon and night.The four buddies party all night and realize that giving the guns to Angel was worth the price of ripping off Mapache. Pike, Dutch and the Gorch brothers get their stuff together and meet with Mapache one last time. Pike asks for the release of Angel, Mapache grudged gives up Angel. He kills the nearly dead man by slicing his throat. When he does this disgusting act, Pike and the boys guns down who's ever in front of them. Bullets fly as blood and bodies are strewn everywhere. Pike notices the Maxim Machine Gun (the prize collection of the stolen arms) propped up in the center of the square. All four of the bunch have turns firing the deadly machine guns.Each man get's a turn to fire the gun before dying in a hail of bullets. After the Gorch brothers bite the big one, Dutch and Pike have their turns firing the gun. More bodies fall as the big gun rips through the Mexican soldiers. But their luck runs out as Dutch and Pike succumb to the deadly gunfire. When Deke and his boys finally reach Mapache's hide out, they find Pike's hand on the machine gun. The bounty hunters are so happy that they find the dead Wild Bunch. Their luck doesn't last long as they're ambushed as soon as they leave the city limits by Pike's auxiliary team of Freddie (Edmond O'Brien) and Angel's family members. Deke wasn't foolish enough to join the rest of the bounty hunters. Freddie asks Deke to join him and the aging crew. He accepts and wishes that Pike was still around.Awesome western that has the best ending to an action movie that you'll ever want to see. If you are ever planning to go out in a movie, you'll want to do it like the "Wild Bunch". Dying in a hail of bullets whilst taking out scores of people never looked so cool. The best western I have ever seen and the coolest action film as well. Co-stars Bo Hopkins, Alfonso Arau and Fernando Wagner.Highest recommended possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupendous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>was trying to think of a single word to describe this film. Incredible just doesn't seem to cut it, marvellous gives no kind of meaning to the sheer scale of it, wonderful is far too prissy for such a savage film. So I settled on stupendous! Which means - Amazingly large or great; huge and of astounding force, volume, degree, or excellence... Are you lot happy with that? What I witnessed last night was a real 'tour de force' from Peckinpah, an achievement that marries direction and editing of the likes I have seen in movies since 1969, but never before. The techniques employed in the action sequences, the frantic cutting, the slo-mo as people are flying through the air, the whole way it was put together seems to have set the standard for almost every actioner I've seen in my life. As a result, you could be quite easily mistaken for thinking "The Wild Bunch" was far more recently than 1969.That brings me to another point. I haven't seen many 70s westerns so forgive my ignorance, but I've seen plenty since. What happened to Westerns! I mean I am a huge, huge fan of the likes of Unforgiven. It's uncompromising grit has had me in awe of that film for many years, but has there ever been a western since "The Wild Bunch" that has been so much fun, with so much humour, yet so brutal? Not that I can remember. It's like a wiseguy gangster film set in the west! Pure genius, and I can't understand why I haven't seen anything like it since.The acting is of the highest calibre blended with characters that have fantastic chemistry. William Holden holds the screen like the star he is, and his "Let's go" scene where he rounds up the boys for one last showdown is some of the best acting I've ever seen. His blue eyes simply pierce the screen and look square at you. And the finale? Scarface eat your heart out! Clearly two massively different films, but has "The Wild Bunch" overtaken "Unforgiven" as my favourite western? It just might have you know!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That Sentence sums up the Wild Bunch in a nutshell. The Wild Bunch is led by a man named Pike and his loyal Sidekick Dutch. Just recently a fellow outlaw named Deke Thornton was caught by the cops and put into prison. Thornton was given a choice work for the railroad and bring in Pike's Wild Bunch or face thirty years at hard time Thornton doesn't want to do it but his self survival instinct kicks in and he agrees to track down the Wild Bunch for them. Thornton in his own way still harbors some loyality to Pike but Pike escaped while he was caught and never tried to rescue him. Pike meanwhile Rebulids his tattered bunch with a group of younger more wilder men. They pull off a Bank Job disguised as soldiers. And as Thornton and Co. Wait on the rooftops for the Bunch to exit guns at the ready. What follows is one of the most tense gunbattles in cinema history as the Wild Bunch fight their way to freedom. And Discover that this is not like the old days of the Wild West This is the dawning of the 20th century 1914. The West is becoming civilized and the old days are gone for good. Pike learns that the hard way when his older members had fast to old values and old beliefs. The Younger generation does not hold to any of this. Pike and Co. See the end is coming and at the advice of Angel one of the Youngest members of the Bunch they head to Mexico. Once there they realize the younger Angel is in fact a Mexican freedom fighter fighting against the tyranny of General Mapache and His Enemy PAnch Villa both men have torn Mexico apart.Mapache is gutting villages for anything he can use. Angels village was hit just as hard and his father and brothers are dead and his girlfriend is missing. He discovers Mapache has his Girlfriend and that Mapache is willing to deal with the Bunch to get a shipment of guns. Sixteen Crates Of guns and ammo. Angel forgoes his share to take one Crate of Guns and Ammo to give to his fellow freedom fighters. But Angel makes a Enemy out of Mapache when he kills his former girlfriend while she sits in Mapache's lap. The Bunch do a incredible amount of talking and free Angel. And Meet the train to rob it. As they do so they meet Thornton and a incredible gunbattle ensues and the bunch escapes. Once they return to Mapache they find things are not to their liking and that once you stand by someone wherever you like them or not once you side with him you stay on his side. Things go sour when Mapache takes Angel Prisoner. The bunch see their friend tortured and as Mapache indicates he will be tortured to death. Pike is angered willing to give up his share just to buy Angel's freedom and he is turned down. That Night Pike realizes things are coming to an end one way or another and plans one last gunbattle this time to free Angel and to redeem himself. Fantastic Story incredible Acting and sadness. Yes Sadness because it's always sad to see the end of one way of life and the values of that way go away. William Holden's acting is top notch nothing short of amazing as his Pike realizes that the end of everything is right here right now and he can only control the way he goes out and the reasons why. Ernest Borgine is strong as Dutch the loyal sidekick who sees the mistakes his leader is making and tries to remind him of the codes and values they once held close. It's Dutch who really is the glue holding them together. Robert Ryan's Relentless Deke Thornton is a conflicted man and Ryan does the greatest acting of his career in this movie his Thornton is a man who remembers what Pike forgot and lives his life by those rules. This movie is a sad reminder of what We Gained by making the West tame and what we lost in getting rid of real Men like Pike and others men who could've made a real difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Peckinpah's Bloody Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's sensational, elegiac western did for that genre what "Bonnie and Clyde" had done for the lovers-on-the-lam genre two years earlier.William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Edmond O'Brien and Robert Ryan -- all throwbacks to an earlier, more traditional style of Hollywood film-making -- star in this revisionist western about a group of over-the-hill outlaws looking to pull off one big last score before packing it in for good. Set in the days just before World War I, the film shows how technological progress gradually begins to make these outlaws obsolete. Cars replace horses; machine guns replace rifles. At the same time, the moral code that governed the wild west makes way for a newer, more chaotic moral order, where the good guys can no longer necessarily be separated from the bad.The literal story of aging gunfighters serves dual purposes under Peckinpah's direction. He's as much interested in the death of the traditional Hollywood western as he is the death of these specific characters. With Vietnam raging, the quaintness and black and white simplicity of John Wayne simply didn't fit in any longer with the reality of the times. Peckinpah gave us violence in "The Wild Bunch" that matched the grim images bleeding their way into families' homes via television. Therefore, in this film, when somebody gets shot, he doesn't fall neatly and bloodlessly into the dust. Wounds in this film spurt blood into the air; bullets tear through flesh. The violence in "The Wild Bunch" is tame when compared to the graphic violence in films today, but it shocks more, mostly because it seems to matter in a way that violence in today's films doesn't.Superbly edited as well as directed, "The Wild Bunch" is terribly exciting and quite disturbing. It's a high-water mark of 1960s film-making.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't have it any other way either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the most violent film that I actually like; I still call it a modern film. UK ITV first showed it 31st July 1976, a Saturday night so plenty of kids like me could see it - although they cut the goriest bits, and they obviously hadn't digested the bits where children copy and glorify the violence they'd just witnessed. Thanks to the relentless march of "progress" in acceptable taste the film-watching generations who have followed would probably think they'd been watching The Mild Bunch and have no idea of the fuss it created (and don't want to know either) when it was released in '69. Who needs well choreographed orgies of "ballet-like violence" when gratuitous violent deviancy force fed them by plot less horror film directors does so much more for them today? Peckinpah opened the floodgates for people with little discipline to make films for people with no discipline at all.An old fashioned storyline at least: a gang of bounty hunters chasing after a gang of railroad robbers out to make one last hit in a changing environment. However, the baddies get side tracked with internal Mexican politics to everyone's cost except the bounty hunters. A fine cast of Golden Age actors shoot it out amongst the guttertrash and Mexican army, in the first and last ten minutes leaving behind them countless corpses cut down in bloody slow motion chaos in the name of greed and revenge. There's a lot in here to savour apart from the ballets with the bullets: the good times between the trials and tribulations; William Holden's masterful portrayal of a man feeling the nets and the world closing in around him; Edmund O'Brien's sleazy eccentric, Ernest Borgnine's enigmatic supporting role for Holden, Robert Ryan's savage cynicism, Warren Oates and Ben Johnson's comedy act. After the ball was over there was a shot to pieces Oates screeching in slow motion rage, Borgnine pathetically trying to reach Holden's side, and Holden's outstretched hand on the machine gun - all are still powerful images.Well made and thought-provoking from start to finish, Peckinpah's best film, one of the best of the '60's and a signpost to the way all serious adult movies were going to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My journey to liking this wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I am going to be hard pressed to write a review saying something that has not already been said about this film. But here it goes:When I first saw this film I, like so many others, was struck by the bone-splintering harshness of the shoot-outs. I thought it was a bold movie, especially considering when it was made, but didn't really think it had many other merits. However, the sheer power of the ending made me eventually want to see it again. So after a while I did.The next time I saw it i found myself getting involved in what was happening in between the shooting. Why was this? As pointed out in several of the comments here there are no real plot twists. The dialogue is seemingly just bare-bones laconic exchanges of unpleasantries. And the actual storyline is not very rich. So what was the appeal?Now this movie had me curious. I started reading some reviews and analysis of Peckinpah's films. Some good, some bad. So I eventually sat myself down and saw it again. And again...I don't know how many times I've seen this film all in all. But it still keeps getting better every time I see it. There are new facets, ironies, meanings and subtleties that reveal themselves every time. And the ones I have familiarized myself with just keep getting stronger.My view of this film has changed quite a bit over time, and it probably will continue evolving. At this point I do not think I am overdoing it when I say that it is one of the absolute best pieces of artistic expression, regardless of medium, that I know of.There are no good-guys in this film, only guys. Peckinpah gives us a story of a gang of violent, thieving, whoring, boozing killers who hang on to whatever shred of dignity they have left by the rotting skin of their teeth. Both their time and their lives are coming to an end and they know it. The stench of death and the threat of violence hang with these moral degenerates like stink on a wet dog. But for all this, for all the filth and corruption in these men and that indeed surrounds them at all sides, they are not yet completely lost in it. Peckinpah still gives them a fighting chance. And when push comes to shove, when the final bell is tolling, they take that chance. They go to their blood-soaked, bullet-ridden deaths in a final push for redemption. Do they get or deserve this redemption? I don't know... I think I'll have to see it a few more times before I figure that out ;-)Do yourself a favor. Explore this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah, the actors, the script and the photography, made this a memorable film. Sam set another bench mark with this masterpiece. I haven't bought that many cd's, although an avid moviegoer for over 60 years. But one I play regularly is this one. I don't know what other films or actors were up for the Oscars that year. But The Wild Bunch should have walked away with a bevy. William Holden is superb, and Edmund O'Brien gave his best role, he is so convincing.All were guided along by a man whose conviction never faltered and when he called "Action." These actors acted. Robert Ryan, what can I say about this fine actor. He made it look so easy. But with so much screen presence by the truck load.

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's True Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best (although 1913) Western made, in my opinion. Peckinpah was really in his element with this epic tale of "closure" in the Old West with a marvellous cast and all versions of this one are excellent (with realistic and unappealing violence). All those great 50s actors winding down (as characters, most of them) into the NEW WORLD. William Holden, proud and tired, was never more authentic. Robert Ryan (one of my favorites) with similar feelings and almost gone (after THE ICEMAN COMETH, one his best) without achieving true respect in film history (with a wonderful stage career as well). Ernest Borgnine (one of the few left from this cast) as loyal Dutch with his own set of principles. Edmond O'Brien - crusty and smarter than most think, especially the Gorch Brothers played by two originals - Ben Johnson and Warren Oates - not too bright, but tough, and unaware until the closing door. Strother Martin, L. Q. Jones, Jaime Sanchez, Bo Hopkins, etc. - great cast.A 10 of out of 10. Best performance = Robert Ryan. Should have won Best Cinematography. It deserved more than it's two Oscar nominations. An epic of the changing times with dusty, windswept villages and horses looking for their riders. A beautiful film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If BONNIE AND CLYDE began the debate over graphic cinematic violence, then Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH took it across the threshold. This two and a half hour-long western epic remains brilliant to this day, even though Peckinpah's techniques of filming and editing violence have been imitated time and time again.But there is more to THE WILD BUNCH than just the violence. The acting is of paramount importance. And Peckinpah assembled the right cast at the right time. William Holden is at his usual best as Pike Bishop, the leader of the Bunch, with Ernest Borgnine equally good as his second in command. The film features longtime Peckinpah stalwarts Ben Johnson, Warren Oates, L.Q. Jones, Strother Martin, and Dub Taylor (the latter also appeared in BONNIE AND CLYDE).One actor's performance that needs to be spotlighted now with regards to this film is Robert Ryan's as Deke Thornton, the reluctant (and thus sympathetic) heavy of the piece. Ryan, whose performances frequently went unnoticed, really gives us a good sense as a man at odds with himself. He is forced to go after his old friend Pike in order to avoid a life sentence; but being given a group of bounty hunters he calls "gutter trash", he is frequently tempted to want to rejoin. It is an excellent role, brilliantly acted.It's interesting to note that THE WILD BUNCH came close to getting an 'X' rating back in 1969 for its violence. One scene that was reportedly cut out of the film was a very explicit disemboweling (!), which would certainly have meant an 'X'. As it was, the film got an 'R', but the violence still spawned a firestorm of controversy.It is the final battle, between the Bunch and the Mexican federales (led by Emilio Fernandez), that remains the touchstone of this film's controversial nature. At four minutes in length, but edited in a cascading montage style and filled with shockingly graphic bloodshed, it would remain the most intensely violent sequence captured on film, to be matched only by the D-Day carnage that opens SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Jerry Fielding's superb Mexican/western score and the screenplay by Peckinpah and Walon Green were both justly nominated for Oscars. And so, THE WILD BUNCH has managed to survive all the slings and arrows thrown at it, even by Peckinpah wanna-bes like Woo and Tarantino, to be a landmark film in American history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece. The graphic violence notwithstanding, this is one of the greatest westerns of all time. The violence is artisically done and is essential to the proper telling of the story.The casting is flawless. Holden and Borgnine are excellent as the leaders who realize that their time has passed and this caper may well be their last. Robert Ryan, one of the most gifted and underrated of screen actors, stands out as Deke Thornton the former partner of Pike. Edmond O'Brien is almost unrecognizable as Sykes, the oldtimer whose grandson had ridden into town in the ill-fated robbery attempt. Warren Oates and Ben Johnson as the Gorch brothers and L.Q. Jones and Strother Martin as the carcass picking bounty hunters also are good.When you see the film, try to watch the "director's cut" which runs 145 minutes. It contains additional footage that further develops the characters of Pike and Thornton by showing what caused the division between them and the character of Mapache showing more revolutionary footage which explains the desperate situation he is in and thereby his drunken behavior later in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of the apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films exemplify the passion and emotion entailed in the human need to validate one's own existence. "The Wild Bunch", a controversial film in its day, is still a masterpiece of modern filmmaking 30 years later precisely because it makes such a solid connection with the darker issues of the this mortal coil -- the art of death, the misunderstood passion of living your life to its fullest extent, the pain of living with mistakes, and the realization that, ultimately, all of the rapture will come to an end. The lead character, Pike, is the main focus of all of these issues, but it is only partially his story, just as the film is only in part a western. There are things here that are present in all films of the genre -- the macho camaraderie, the wild gunfights, the noble outlaw and the reluctant lawman -- but they are all placed in a film of such tremendous artistic detail that they become garnish to the dish, and not the dish itself.Few films made in the past 30 years have been so carefully constructed as "The Wild Bunch", for each frame is a diligent work of art, utilizing every last aspect of the craft of filmmaking. Arresting sound quality, detailed cinematography, precision editing, splendid performances and action sequences that even John Woo can envy all contribute to the simple tale of a group of aging men trying desperately to carry on with their "normal" way of life: that is, they want to keep robbing the banks in the style of the Old West outlaws, except that the new twentieth century will have nothing to do with them, and their time, as Pike correctly points out, is fading fast. The story focuses upon this groups involvement with a corrupt Mexican general and his attempt to purloin a shipment of U.S. guns so that he may effectively combat Pancho Villa; meanwhile, Thornton, an ex-member of the gang, is hot in pursuit of Pike and the others. Much of the development of the primary theme -- clinging to a dying way of life -- is personified in Pike, marvellously played by William Holden. Here is man who, in spite of his reputation for being "the best", has constantly made one mistake after another, mistakes that usually end up costing him the lives or friendships of those around him. These mistakes stem from his lifestyle, that of a professional outlaw, a lifestyle which, like the era in which it originated, is quickly fading out in 1913, the year in which the film is set. Technology beckons on the horizon, whether it be automobiles or machine guns, and there is simply no room for someone like Pike to be hanging about anymore. Through the film we learn of the mistakes he has made and lives he has inadvertently ended -- comrades, a lost love, the friendship of Thornton, who is now forced to hunt him. Pike, as a result of all of this, is himself dead in a certain respect, as dead as the mythical figure he represents, whether one interprets that figure to be the outlaw, the cowboy, or the Old West itself. Regardless, Pike is an ominous yet tired figure, locked into a corner by both his own choices and the progress of the world around him. In the end, there is little that he can do except take the only logical step forward. He is reminded one final time of the life he might have led has he not made a mistake and failed to save his lover's life, and, having come full circle, chooses to validate this mistaken lifestyle in the only way he knows how, and that is to die the outlaws death.What fascinates me about this film, as well as Pike's character, is how timeless it truly is. The image of Pike and his men marching into General Mapache's encampment, as well as the ensuing gunfight which follows (certainly the finest action sequence ever filmed) bears every mark and sign of the apocalypse, from its horrifying images of war to the dusty cinematography to the scene's seclusion and echoing sound. We ourselves are approaching the end of an era, or at least many of us would like to think so, just as Pike and his men were. The year 2000 may or may not be a terrible thing, but there are many who go forward towards the turn of the millennium feeling, I think, much like the Wild Bunch did as they strode, side by side, towards their own doom: resolved, determined, and certain of their fate, if for no other reason than because there are no alternatives left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Bunch: One of the best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1913 was the year. The Temperance union was protesting against alcohol and sexual promiscuity. Automobiles and airplanes were popping up, and the desperado, that wild, swearing, wandering, beer-sucking, whore-screwing, bank-robbing, six-gun shooting outlaw, was going to be the bedfellow of the dinosaur.But there were scrappy holdouts, the kind who would be cold before they were tamed. They called them?The Wild Bunch.After a bad fall with "Major Dundee" (a likable rough draft of "Bunch" in my view), being fired from the Steve McQueen vehicle "The Cincinnati Kid" (Norm Jewison took over as director) and work-scrounging in TV, maverick filmmaker Sam Peckinpah came back into theatrical film with a gun in one hand, a machete in the other, a blowtorch behind his back and a sense of honor in his heart, in the summer of 1969. Six men make up the gang: stern leader Pike Bishop (William Holden), gentlemanly Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine), raucous siblings Lyle (Warren Oates) and Tector Gorch (Ben Johnston), tempestuous but gallant Angel (Jaime Sanchez) and old, dirty, desert rat Freddie Sykes (Edmond O'Brien). A botched robbery of a railroad company, earning "a dollar's worth of steel holes", forces the men into Mexico, pursed by ex-pal Deke Thorton (a world weary Robert Ryan), who's freed from jail but manipulated by money-minded railroad magnate Pat Harrigan (Albert Dekker of the sci-fi cult film, "Dr. Cyclops") into leading a band of ad hoc bounty hunters, who used to be railroad hobos from the looks of them, and they are willing to kill for cash or junk. The wanted and unwanted aren't safe from them, and you'll wonder who the good guys are really.There's more trouble: the vile, delusional, drunk-as-a-skunk Mexican army general Mapache (Emilio Fernandez) hires the bunch to steal sixteen cases of guns and firepower from an US Army-guarded train to fight the Mexican Revolutionaries, led by the iconic Pancho Villa.In an interview for Playboy magazine, Western film star John Wayne despised the film because it sinisterly twisted the genre. He wasn't alone. Critics and moviegoers deplored the film's unflinching violence, misogynism (women were either chaste white Christians or voluptuous Mexican whores) and misanthropism, However, they couldn't be any more wrong about it. Sure, "Bunch" is book-ended by two beautiful, ballet-like gun plays, encrusted in blood, sweat, steel and fire, but the middle shows humanity, albeit flawed, in the killers. Pike holds loyalty to his heart, but is a hypocrite because (Spoilers) he left Thorton to get caught by the law in a bordello. Dutch (Borgnine, who's out of place yet fits because of his sitcom role of Lt. Cmdr. Quinton McHale of "McHale's Navy"), is a boy scout in terms of women, but in the end, he does the unthinkable. The Gorch brothers are "good old boys"; Tector being superior over Lyle due to age, but both barely have the sense of a mule. Angel dreams of a free Mexico, but gets over his head and Freddie, a profane parody of Western character actor George "Gabby" Hayes, is a fun-loving, reminiscent codger, but he forgets his age and stamina, dooming either his fellows or himself in heated situations.This is why the film matters a lot: a group of men whose era has passed them by, but they struggle to keep their individualism and humanity intact, even if they have to kill to retain them. How intriguingly, ironically and magnificently noble.Oscar-nominated for best original screenplay (It lost to the more friendly "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"), the story's unconventional for a Western, breaking out of the genre, thanks to Sam, Walon Green (he co-wrote "Robocop 2" with Peckinpah student/comic book visionary Frank Miller, and is currently an exec producer on "Law and Order") and Roy N. Sickner (a stuntman who worked on the film). The Oscar-nominated music score (lost to Butch and Sundance, too) by Jerry Fielding (blacklisted for hiring African-American musicians) ran around the emotional spectrum; the photography of Lucien Ballard echoes John Ford's work and the quick cuts and slow-action shots of editor Lou Lombardo (produced the first Cheech and Chong film, "Up In Smoke") perfectly note a connection between film and comic books (Sam was slated to direct the first Superman film, but his rep went south at the time). The actors and their characters, big and small, are glorious, from the bunch to Mapache's two underlings, Zamora (Jorge Russek) and Herrera (Alfonso Arau, who later directed the Oscar-winning foreign film "Like Water For Chocolate") and to Thorton's sleazy companions, particularly Coffer (Strother Martin) and T.C. (Peckinpah stock actor L.Q. Jones). As for Sam, he's subtle as a chainsaw with allegorical imagery (ants devouring scorpions in the beginning, suggested by Fernandez from a childhood memory and kids playing a mock gun play after a real one) and silent facial stares (Pike looking at the Gorches firmly before the group's last stand). He would have been a king in the silent movie area.When it was re-released (1994), the Motion Picture Association of America gave "Bunch" a NC-17. Warner Bros rightfully appealed for a R and won it, but the fact it could get a rating that's usually given to rarely made, sexually graphic films only proves "Bunch's" impact on the senses is still haunting to this day. Yet some of the pieces have blood, gun battles and nothing else, Sam's students made a mighty homage of films to him. My favorite "teacher's pets" are Miller, Rob Rodriquez, Quentin Tarantino, the Brothers Wachowski, Brian Helgeland, John McTiernan, Shinichiro Watanabe and Stephen J. Cannell.If anything, "Bunch" is a ballistic but romantic tale of honorable men in a dishonorable world, fighting to stay alive spiritually. The aforementioned "Sin City" (I'll review the SE DVD soon) comes very close to this Western that jumps out from being a Western like a jackrabbit on heroin, and, to quote Mr. Bishop, "I wouldn't have it any other way." Watch it while eating ketchup-drenched fried chicken, will ya?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece in the Western Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch(1969) opened new doors in cinematic violence and took the American Western into fresh territory. The Wild Bunch(1969) was one of many films which featured hidden symbols that grew from the Vietnam war. Before taking on this project, Sam Peckinpah had been on a four year blacklist due to the notorious confrontations he got into with the Producers on Major Dundee(1965) and Cincinnati Kid(1966). A groundbreaking affair for Sam Peckinpah who exhausted every ounce of energy in creating a prestige Western.When Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch came to theaters in 1969, a new era in motion picture history was born. Thus the film in a sense was the first modern action film that paved the way for a new brand of action in Hollywood during the next three decades. Took a realistic appoarch to violence that showed how agonizing and painful death really was. Another way it changed how people made films was with the innovative editing.The atmosphere and use of locations was influenced by the Westerns of John Ford. The characterizations of the outlaws in The Wild Bunch(1969) are patterned after the tough guy antics of John Huston's noir features. The battle scenes are in the manner of Akira Kurosawa samurai films such as Seven Samurai(1954) and The Hidden Fortress(1958). A filmmaker whose work influenced Sam Peckinpah the most was Don Siegal.Its a number one favorite of mine by my favorite director for a few reasons. First, The Wild Bunch(1969) showed me that a film can be both entertaining and provocative. Second, the outlaws led by Pike Bishop are people with redemptive qualities who are easy to side with. Finally, its my favorite film of all time because of the special moments that occur during the course of the story.The Wild Bunch(1969) is the second greatest film of all time right behind Citizen Kane(1941) which is the greatest of all time. Its in the top two of great films because every aspect that is crucial to the cinema comes together to form a near perfect feature film. This movie is filled with many scenes of absolute importance. The innovations are seen thoughout this flick, and the way they are depicted are fresh and original.The first scene of violence in The Wild Bunch takes place during an attempted robbery by the Bishop gang. The first time Sam Peckinpah employs his trademark slow motion shootouts is here with the help of some brilliant intercutting. An apptizer compared to the full course meal of violent imagery that follows two hours later. An unusual opening for a film of that time because most Westerns ended with the type of shootout that opens The Wild Bunch(1969).The movie expressed the director's knowledge of the late Wild West as a result of the director growing up in a Wild West environment. Shows the director's identification with the outlaws of the story for he was a Hollywood outlaw himself. The character of Pike Bishop was patterned after the mannerisms of Sam Peckinpah. Structured around the outmoded code of ethics for the bunch that was near its dear during Mexico circa 1913.Some of the best acting in a Western belongs to The Wild Bunch(1969) for every cast member gives a very good to great acting performance. William Holden and Robert Ryan lead the way with their complex and three dimensional portrayal of Pike Bishop and Deke Thorton. Sam Peckinpah directs both the action and dramatic sequences with sheer brilliance. The director added his own ideas to the screenplay which is one element that makes The Wild Bunch(1969) a Western masterpiece.Known as the Battle of Bloody Porch, this one moment created something awesome and new in depicting violence on the big screen that would be copied by many and many fillmakers. Although by today's standards the violence is tame, the way the violence is presented makes the images much more powerful then in many of today's action films. The Battle at Bloody Porch is a total triumph of innovative action, outstanding edition, suspenseful buildup, and mildblowing imagery. It was as a result of the Battle of Bloody Porch sequence among other scenes from the film that I became an admirer of The Wild Bunch(1969).The only disgusting fact about this motion picture is it wasn't nominated or won at the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor(William Holden), Best Supporting Actor(Robert Ryran) and six or seven more categories. Shows the outlaw protagonists slowly transforming from outlaws out for themseleves to heroes ready to die for a worthwhile cause. The Wild Bunch(19969) deals with themes that Sam Peckinpah explored during his career in films like Ride the High Country(1962), The Ballad of Cable Houge(1970), Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid(1973), Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia(1974), and Cross of Iron(1977). The next few years would see the Western genre come up with some greats before fading out after Unforgiven(1992).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "classic" that has aged very badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place in 1913. A group of outlaws (led by William Holden) are getting old and tired of always being chased and shot at. They decide to take one last big job and retire. Naturally everything goes wrong.This was considered a masterpiece in 1969. It was the first film to show what the Wild West was really like--dirty and very very violent. This was the first western to show people getting shot and plenty of blood pouring out. Often we see them fall down with blood pouring out in slow motion! It was done to "demythologize" the west. Storywise it was nothing new at all. Everybody spoke lines we've all heard before and ALL the characters were clichs. Since this film was made we've had plenty of westerns with explicit violence AND better stories and characters (Eastwood's "Unforgiven" comes to mind). The violence in this is almost tame compared to what we get today. Hard to believe it was almost rerated with an NC-17 back in 1993. Basically this just doesn't hold up and is not revolutionary like it once was. There's a big shootout at the beginning and an outright massacre at the end but it isn't shocking at all. It's pretty obvious all the actors have squibs under their clothes and the slow-motion dying looks pretty ridiculous. Also it's WAY too long for a movie with such familiar clichs and characters. On the upside it is well done with a great Oscar-nominated score and some excellent acting (especially by Holden and Ernest Borgnine). There's also an exciting train robbery and chase in here. But, all in all, I was bored and fast forwarding through a lot of it. This is no longer a classic. I give it a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rightful classic (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As bloody and violent as The Wild Bunch is, at heart it's a romantic film. It's a film that pines for an era where thieves stuck to a code of honour; it's a film that pines for an era where friendship was prized upon all else; it's a film that pines for an era where men died with their hand on the gun. It's more than just a horse opera.If you've grown up watching Westerns, it'll only take you a few seconds to realise that The Wild Bunch is different ? one of the opening images is of children gleefully encouraging a swarm of ants to attack a scorpion; there's no innocence here. And then you have the opening shoot-out where innocent people are blown away, a woman is trampled by a horse and a man is riddled with bullets in slow motion. This is a million miles away from John Ford. And then to ram the point home even further, Pike Bishop (William Holden), the 'hero' and leader of the Bunch, ruthlessly kills one of his own men when he's blinded and unable to ride ? he even ridicules the idea of giving the man a decent burial, knowing that sentimentality will get you killed.But this leads to a contradiction in the character ? as ruthless as Pike is, he is also very sentimental. And of course, it's this weakness that brings about his demise. But it's also what makes him great, because in the end he chooses loyalty and friendship above money. He and the Bunch are the last of an old order of thieves; men that will stick together and not stab each other in the back.Which is not to say that the Bunch always get along. There are some great scenes where the tensions in the group are brought out. But it always seems to be that whatever petty differences the Bunch have, they stick together when it comes to the big things. For instance, some of the guys moan above having old Sykes tag along (there's even a wonderful scene where one of the men throws a stick of dynamite at the old man as he's taking a leak), but when they're under attack they fight as one (another great scene is after the bridge explosion ? forgetting old differences, everyone shares a bottle of whisky. Well, everyone except Warren Oates).But going back to Pike and his sentimentality, he even says at one point: "When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal." And it's this attitude that ends up getting Pike killed. But Pike's death, and that of Bunch, is a glorious one. And again it's complex, because although the final shoot-out sees hundreds of people getting killed, it's motivated by this desire to not live like an animal ? one of the Bunch gets his throat slit by a Mexican general and the Bunch punish him and his army with a vengeance. So although you can sit back and marvel at the bullets, the slow motion and the blood, it's action that actually means something. It's the death rattle of an old ideal ? that men stick together to the death. And the end even sees Dutch (Ernest Borgnine) screaming Pike's name as both of them die. But there's nothing laughable in it ? the feeling are deep and genuine. And Pike even dies with his grip tight on the machine gun ? he wont back down, he wont make concessions and he wont change.Another one of the film's complexities is its portrayal of children. As already noted, the film begins with children torturing a scorpion. And there's a scene where Angel (a Mexican member of the Bunch who is taken by the general Mapache) is dragged along behind a car and ridden by kids. And Pike is even killed by a child soldier. But you also have the scene in Angel's village where children gleefully watch the Bunch dance with some senoritas. And an old man makes the quote: "We all dream of being a child again, even the worst of us. Perhaps the worst most of all." All the time there's a blur between good and evil and idealism and cynicism.One of my favourite dialogue exchanges in the film highlights this old-fashioned romanticism. Dutch can't believe that Pike's old pal has sold out to the railroad. "Gave his word to a railroad," he bemoans. "It's his word," counters Pike. "That ain't what counts. It's who you give it to." And making this scene even stronger is the undercurrent of despair ? the Bunch having done business with the scuzzy general Mapache, only for him to kidnap Angel. And only after this verbal battering does Pike resolve to do the right thing and put friendship before money.And in the final scenes, the Bunch even put friendship before women. In this film there's something transient about male/female relationships. Male relationships last longer and have more meaning. That's maybe macho BS, but in the end the Bunch seem determined to die for something more meaningful than money or pussy. And although none of them can really express what they're feeling ? "Let's go" is all Pike says ? they all seem to understand ? if they don't do what they've got to do, they wont be men any longer; they'll be animals just like all the other scum.And I love the final image in the film. The last thing we see is the back of the Bunch, surrounded by mist, leaving Angel's village. They're all dead but they live on as ghosts ? their story will endure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most over-rated movie of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One clich follows another, from the dress, language, buildings, action, plot, cinematography, pervading every aspect of the movie. I did like the way the river looked, with the horses entering it. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has so much more to offer. One problem with the Wild Bunch is the large number of characters, and the large amount of filler material, riding from one place to the next. There does not seem to be much original in this except the famous violence. The Mexican footage is as hackneyed as the rest of it. The only movie I can think of that is on a par with this, as far as overrated is The Searchers, which is slowly sinking in the West, and perhaps the same fate will gradually befall this awful, awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That shot of the scorpion and the ants alone gives this one an extra point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch probably has one of the best opening scenes in American cinema. We see a group of army men riding into town, a symbol of order in the once-chaotic American West, but at the same time there is a sense of foreboding, a sense confirmed by the nearby children playing with a pit of ants and scorpions. As it turns out, the soldiers are actually bank robbers in disguise, and the scruffy figures sitting on rooftops are what passes for the forces of law. But there are no heroes here, just violent animals scrambling for any advantage or momentary pleasure.And so the robbery ends in a violent shootout in which seemingly half the town is caught in the crossfire. This shootout is shocking both for the level of violence which it openly displays in a genre accustomed to bloodless shootouts in which the bad guy fell down clutching his chest and for the people to whom the violence was directed. Women and children are shot down in the street, with neither side displaying an ounce of compassion. There is none of the order of pistols at high noon, simply a wild hail of bullets that quickly becomes an end in itself.It's perhaps unrealistic to expect any film to maintain this level of brilliance and shock over two and a half hours (although the best can manage it). Shortly after the shootout, the titular wild bunch go down to Mexico, and the movie turns into something like Vera Cruz without as much charm. There are still some great sequences, and Peckinpah maintains a brilliant visual sensibility throughout, drawing on Sergio Leone's spaghetti Western style.At its root, The Wild Bunch is a critique of the Western hero and the idea of redemptive violence that drives both genre film and American foreign policy. Here violence always escapes the intent of its perpetrators, and becomes an entity in itself, a kind of free-floating virus that is both horrible and erotic. The film ultimately relents on the amorality of its heroes -- by the end we have the American outlaws avenging the good Mexican by shooting down the bad Mexican. It still turns into chaotic carnage, but this carnage is much easier to contain within the Western's moral tropes. Like many directors of his generation, Peckinpah sets out to critique violent masculinity, but can never really escape its orbit, and the aestheticized violence in the film seduces as much as it repulses.This is not a movie that everyone will like, but it's an important part of film history, and unlike many important parts of film history it still holds some of its power to surprise and shock today. At the very least, everybody should give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah at his Zenith!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah made his greatest western when he helmed "The Wild Bunch" with a stellar cast including William Holden, Ernst Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ben Johnson, and Warren Oaters. The Old West is living on borrowed time in this Tex/Mex border melodrama that finds a gang of weary outlaws who have outlived their time. Like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," "The Wild Bunch" concerns men who have lived beyond their guns. William Holden delivers a memorable performance as the gang leader and Robert Ryan is his old pal turned nemesis who is forced to track him down and kill him. Peckinpah loved to pit old friends against each other and he does it here splendidly. Remember, Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea tangled with each other in "Ride the High County," and James Caan and Robert Duvall went gunning for each other in "The Killer Elite." Ultimately, despite its landmark violence and gorgeous but gritty cinematography, "The Wild Bunch" is about the meaning of friendship. At one point, Pike Bishop (William Holden) says, "When you side with a man, you stay with him! And if you can't do that, you're like some animal, you're finished!" The action is rough and hard ridden and the shoot-outs are marvelously staged in slow motion. The finale is something to be seen. I cringe at the thought that somebody wants to remake this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Western genre was effectively killed off by Sam Peckinpah's bloody masterpiece, in which a band of aging outlaws unable to adapt to changing times decides to make their final exit with something more than a whimper. The film is concerned with nothing less than the death of the Old West itself, a theme Peckinpah approached more gently in 'Ride the High Country'; here the director redefines Western mythology by embracing its most destructive impulses. The action has been choreographed into a terrible, exhilarating ballet, from William Holden's terse command during the opening credits ("if they move, kill 'em") to the cathartic fury of the final bloodbath, which invented a whole new vocabulary for screen violence. Peckinpah's macho code of honor, primitive sense of humor, and often sloppy sentiment can be hard to stomach, but the influence the film has had is undeniable, and its impact when seen today (in particular the final shoot-out) is only slightly diminished by our current over-saturation in MTV shock editing techniques.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch is about a band of outlaws whose leader is William Holden and which are chased by Robert Ryan (who was betrayed by Holden) and his men.The beginning of the film is excellent, with Holden and his men arriving at a town where some children are burning scorpions, some people are campaigning against liquor, and they end up in quite a shootout. On their journey, Holden and his crowd meet some Mexican bandits with whom they also get in trouble. When each character is shown laughing, each scene a flashback, their laughter is a statement: they are the heroes, the "magnificent seven" coming back nine years after, after the spaghetti, the flower children, and soldiers dying in Vietnam. In nine years the public taste changed a great deal, and that also meant the eventual death of the western genre. The Wild Bunch is one of the last great westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The material may not be original, but Peckinpah's gory celebration of machismo may be the best of all theatrical Westerns. Starting with the border town robbery and ending with the slow-motion shootout, the movie contains at least five distinct set-pieces, all of which are superbly staged action scenes, including the Bunch's ennobling ride from the Mexican village. This slow, majestic procession reveals a poetic dimension amidst an otherwise chaotic world of casual cruelty. Like John Ford, Peckinpah is a poet at heart, but unlike Ford he does not prettify what he values. Rather, in this film as well as others, his sensitive side seems an embarrassment to a code that allows aggressive action as the only compensation for moments of sentimental weakness. Without the poetic touch, however, Peckinpah would remain just another action director; whereas, without the machismo, he could not express his compelling vision of a world among men. It's that struggle to articulate an acceptable version of an artist that drives much of this movie and Peckinpah's career. One way of looking at the film's depth lies in an often overlooked but pivotal moment that occurs near film's end. Despite the odds, the Bunch has finished off the brutal Mapache and his henchman. Then comes a momentary lull as the four gringos exult in their unexpected victory, while Mapache's foot soldiers hesitate to continue the slaughter. From a plot standpoint the pause is unnecessary, since it adds nothing to the outcome. From a thematic standpoint, however, the pause is pivotal. At this point, the Bunch could walk away with the gold and their honor intact, all their dreams fulfilled. But they don't. Instead, Pike shoots the German officer, restarting the gunplay and sealing their doom. Why does Pike sacrifice their dream for a hopeless shoot-out. The screenplay gives no reason. In my view, here as elsewhere there surfaces in the action the outline of what might be called the Bunch's moral progression from the survivalist world of scorpions and ants to the limited but nonetheless transcendent values of comradeship and national identity. These are expressed in the four's shoulder to shoulder march in behalf of a fallen comrade and Pike's killing of the foreign officer. I'm sure Peckinpah would hate this kind of analysis, but I think this is what he makes us feel in a very powerful way. In a movie filled with memorable moments, there's another one easily overlooked that is my favorite. During a brief battle around the train station, a uniformed messenger no older than twelve brings Mapache a message to retreat. With soldiers falling all around, this scurrilous and venal man stands suddenly erect amidst the hail of bullets, proud and defiant, totally unaware of the bravery of his act. But the boy sees, and in a gesture that echoes across generations, stands with him. In the exchange of glances that follows, we know the one has finally risen to the rank of general, if only for a moment, while the other has found a hero for life, even if a dubious one. It's sublime touches such as these that belie those critics who see in the film nothing more than a pointless, amoral violence. The Wild Bunch remains the director's masterpiece and a milestone in bringing greater realism to cinema violence. All in all, whatever his subsequent failings, on this one occasion, when confronted by the looming spectre of censorship, Peckinpah rose magnificently to meet the challenge. Just like the tarnished loners he so admired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling, bloody, but thrilling ride, with an amazing William Holden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch (1969)Sam Peckinpah's famous film doesn't look, from 2009, revolutionary. But that is its reputation, as part of the late 1960s revival of American Cinema that includes Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate (both 1967). The Wild Bunch is in many ways another violent western, shot widescreen, with a scree of familiar archetypes (good guy, bad guy, ditzy banker, pretty woman, and dull witted Mexican, and even more dull witted Texan losers, none of which are true in those cardboard terms). And it came out years after the more stunning (in many ways) Leone westerns such as The Good, The Bad, The Ugly and Fistful of Dollars. But I glossed over something important--the violence. There is a frank new use of language (swearing) or sexuality (in some totally improbable and ludicrous scenes in a winery, for example), but it is the relentless, almost comically excessive violence, amazing blood and guts killing and mayhem, that brands this film. Lots of innocent people die, lots of bad guys die, even some of the archetypal women in love with the bad guys get brutally shot. And this, all of it, without the John Ford sense of justice or propriety, is something new.Whether you think it marks a decline in values or a rise in cinema art (pushing boundaries, devaluing violence to the point that it becomes artful, and therefore oddly non-violent, a la Tarantino), it's also possible to see the movie as a superb tale of greed, vengeance, and tested loyalty. And corporate selfishness, certainly a new theme that fits the late 60s perfectly.This is William Holden's performance of a lifetime. He plays a bad man with scary resoluteness, and the cast of misfits and miscreants around him (including a terrific Ernest Borgnine) only solidify his stature on the screen. Seemingly cast opposite him is his ex-buddy, played by Robert Ryan, and the ragtag bums around him are meant to be partly comical, though tragedy is suggested for many right from the get go. The robberies and the long chases through beautiful Wild West country, leading across the border into Mexico, are terrific tropes for any moviemaker--and for the audience, which had seen, surely some of the big 1950s westerns, and probably some of the Leone ones, too. So, all the hedging above aside, and removing some aspects of the movie that are either offensive or just dumb (a few short scenes that will vary depending on the viewer), The Wild Bunch is a thrilling, intense ride. It's a ride, remember, an entertainment. It doesn't lack probing elements, but it plays into the drama of the setting and the big characters galloping through it, simple as that. On that level, it's one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Wild Bunch (1969)' is about the end of the Western era, a theme director Sam Peckinpah also explored in his first success, 'Ride the High Country (1962).' The year is 1913, and the aging gunslingers of yesteryear now find themselves strangers in a modern, civilised world: the once indispensable horse is being replaced by the automobile, and traditional firearm duels now play out with M1917 Browning machine guns, which belt out bullets at 450 rounds/minute. So advanced, in fact, has the American West become that its cowboys must seek out action over the national border in "primitive" Mexico, where oppressed civilians fight valiantly, with minimal resources, to overthrow the resident dictatorship of General Mapache (Emilio Fernndez); it is only in these revolutionists that the heroic spirit of the Old West survives. Aside from Angel (Jaime Snchez), who is fighting for an ideal, there is not a single noble character in the film, not even the law-enforcer (Albert Dekker), who arrogantly and cowardly bullies criminal bounty-hunters into doing his work.The surviving outlaws of the Old West ? William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien ? cling to the tattered vestiges of their former ways, embracing an outdated code of "honour" that feels woefully inadequate in the modern world: they are "unchanged men in a changing land. Out of step, out of place, and desperately out of time." But unlike 'Ride the High Country,' which featured genre stalwarts Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott as washed-up Western heroes, none of the "Wild Bunch" ever were heroes. Having always lived on the dark side of the law, as wanted outlaws, how can these men possibly recover any sense of nobility? They do, indeed, march wordlessly across General Mapache's headquarters to reclaim their captive member, but only after passively watching him endure hours of torture. Is it guilt that prompts Pike Bishop to come to the aid of his companion? With the old Western heroes long dead, must it fall to its villains to display some sort of decency? Is that what our society has come to?The stylisation of Sergio Leone (particularly 'Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)') was clearly an influence on 'The Wild Bunch,' but Peckinpah also makes the style his own. Unlike Leone, whose greatest mastery is in the prolonged build-up rather than the climax, Peckinpah simply prolongs the climax itself. The tempo of Lou Lombardo's editing seems to resemble, if anything, the spatter of machine gun fire, cutting ferociously from one shot to another ? often utilising almost balletic slow-motion ? and consciously mimicking the feverish confusion of a shootout. Though one might describe Peckinpah's use of violence as gratuitous (and many did in 1969, with the film almost landing an X-rating, and garnering plenty of controversy), there is a clear streak of disapproval running through the film's two major bloodbaths, in which the participants are seemingly depicted as immature children gunning each other with toy weapons; it is as though the anachronistic outlaws are merely grasping for their younger years, when their actions were considered significant, and their environment well within their control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah goes Wild.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah, or "Bloody Sam" as he is affectionately called, gives us one of the great Western experiences in his crazy, blood-filled saga about a group of men who are trying to adapt to a world they had ruled for many years but is now changing and turning on them. Indeed, they are being chased by an old group member, as well as the Mexican federal army.All this action comes together to give a remarkable experience that most people won't soon forget. The acting is superb, led by William Holden and Ernest Borgnine. The music also plays a very important role in leading up to the two incredibly photographed climaxes as well as setting the mood for the more serene parts. It may not be Sergio Leone, but it very well may be the best Western made by an American. Peckinpah was a genius at being able to show violence in a graphic, yet cinematic aesthetic way that was controversial, but not overly sickening like today's torture porn movies. It all comes together in this very violent, yet quality piece of film making that deserves its place among the greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Bunch Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wild Bunch" is not only my favorite Western of all time, it is also in my Top Ten favorite American movies of all time. This is Sam Peckinpaughs masterpiece. A band of ruthless outlaws, cunningly cast with aging stars, try for one last score before bowing out of the bandit game. Before this movie, Westerns were routinely sanitized of bloodshed and mayhem. In "The Wild Bunch", we finally get the feel of the era. This was a hard life and the movie does not flinch in showing its danger and sometime brutality. There are some moments of humor in the film also, so it is not all blood and gore.There is no doubt this is a movie depicting the end of an era, the death of the Wild West. From the sly introduction of the new technologies encroaching on our outlaws, even they begin to sense their obsolescence. Set during the backdrop of the Mexican Civil War, our "heroes" embark on a robbery of an arms shipment destined for the soldiers of the Amerian Expeditionary Force, then operating in Mexico. Of course, not everything goes as planned and the bunch is faced with new problems, not the least is being pursued by bounty hunters, Pancho Villa's troops and the U.S. Army.Without giving to much away, the death of the Wild West, at least to the "Wild Bunch, will be with a bang, not a whimper.Regarding Mr. Nixs' criticism of so called "Mexican stereotypes," I think he is living in a dreamworld. The border town in Mexico where much of the movie takes place, Agua Verde," is not exactly the nest of artists, poets, scholars and philosophers. It is a town with no law and order, run by murderers, bandits, prostitutes and all the unsavoriness that a village of that type would probably contain. Again Peckinpaugh is being brutally honest. Finally, the movie is acted in first class fashion by all of the aging cast. Particularly Edmund O,Brien. This is the best western of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmed in beautiful colours and with stunning backdrops, The Wild Bunch is a film that makes me love Westerns even more which are my favourite genre. You see The Wild Bunch is a film that back in 69 tested the censors, it marked the end of 60s Westerns. The thing I love most about The Wild Bunch is the editing, it's so ahead of it's time. The slow motion shots are done with true style and the movie shows examples of how to perfectly edit a movie in very simple ways. The movie explores the many styles and techniques used to make something special and it works perfectly.The silhouettes of the men as they walk across the open plain with the sun setting, is a memorable and haunting one. Right from the start you know that you are in for something special, with the opening gun fight. The movie has many morals about subjects such as greed and trust, these are all a very important messages for the viewer. The image of the kids pouring ants on a scorpion shows the cruelty and evil. Breathtaking visuals of the distant American Plains makes me remember Once Upon A Time In The West from my favourite director Sergio Leone. The dust sweeping over the plains creates a longing/nostalgic dimension to the movie. The men show their guilt, regret and longing to lead a different and more simple life. This is one of the greatest films ever made...The dialogue is very sharp and it gives a realistic tension of chemistry between the characters. It's written with a very gritty and tough attitude to it. The film feels so tense because it's as if it's through a barrel of a gun, not literally of course. The reason for this though is because everyone seems ready for a fight, which adds the beauty of not knowing what is going to happen next. The Wild Bunch is influential to so many movie especially heist movie like the train robbery scene which echoes parts of The Great Train Robbery.And then comes the tragic and now legendary final scenes, to put it simply it is the definition of "cool". The choreography is stunning...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like Westerns, you have to see The Wild Bunch. If you like violent films, you have to see The Wild Bunch. If you like movies with a compelling script, great characters and flawless acting, that's right, you just HAVE to see The Wild Bunch. Don't let the criticisms about its "pornographic" violence discourage or upset you. This essential '60s flick is both conventional and at the same time unlike anything you've ever seen. I saw it twice on TV in three months, and the second viewing affected me exactly the same way as the first did: I was so fascinated by its brilliance I didn't even think about the sudden moments of explicit, brutal carnage.The story is pretty classic: an outlaw gang reunites for one last glorious hit, while a lot of other people are on their trail, desperate to arrest, perhaps also kill, them. Somehow in Sam Peckinpah's hands the movie doesn't feel like a d?ja vu: while watching the film, I really shared these characters' emotions, maybe because I already knew they were doomed, and it is this connection that makes the violence hard to watch, not the graphic nature of the scenes themselves. And the actors are amazing, particularly Ernest Borgnine and, primarily, William Holden as the Bunch's leader. Just like his character, Holden (who I had previously seen and appreciated in Sunset Blvd.) returned for one final triumph.Moving and merciless, The Wild Bunch changed the way we look at Westerns forever. For that reason alone, it deserves a high rank in everyone's list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch, when I first saw its trailer, looked to me like a pretty cheap movie. But when I read a few reviews and then saw the actual movie itself, my opinion was quickly changed. This movie is a masterpiece. Definitely director Sam Peckinpah's greatest movie.The Wild Bunch is about a group of outlaws still thriving in the West some time in the early 20th century, when times are rapidly changing. After their last robbery turned out to be a setup and they get away with nothing, they head for Mexico and there, they strike a deal with a Spanish general to steal an enormous box of American-made firearms in exchange for a huge quantity of gold. They complete the job, but then the general takes one of them captive. And the others, refusing to abandon their comrade, gather up some guns and go right up to him, where....This movie is very famous for its incredible amount of Western violence. And I agree, it's got to be the most gory and violent motion picture of the 60s. And even more than some of the movies today. There is an enormous amount of blood that we see when characters get shot and the way it's portrayed gives out a very destructive atmosphere. Which was very much like how big shootouts between bounty hunters and outlaws were in the real West. There are two major shootouts in this movie. The first one's marvelous, stunningly magnificent. And the second one's even better! We have a cast full of familiar faces. William Holden plays the rough leader of the outlaw gang, who always has a habit of getting away and leaving a few bodies behind him. Ernest Borgnine plays his right-hand man and best friend, who will stick by him to the end. Robert Ryan plays an ex-member of the gang who is now hunting down his own friends to escape going back to prison. Warren Oates and Ben Johnson play wild brothers who are very spunky, short-tempered, and exotic. Jaime Sanchez plays a Native American who only wants to help his people, and he intends to do so with his share of the profits. Albert Dekker plays a harsh railroad man who has his sights set on capturing the outlaws, whatever the cost. And Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones play crazy killing bounty hunters who ride with Robery Ryan's character.All of these colorful cast members helped bring The Wild Bunch up, but the man who really made it a wonder is the director himself. Sam Peckinpah.The Wild Bunch is definitely one of the most violent and realistic Westerns ever and it will always be a landmark in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Western about the end of the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An aging band of western outlaws take one last job, stealing guns from the U.S. Army for a Mexican general, in this masterful western about the end of the west. This film is director Sam Peckinpah's true classic. It is a perfect mix of director, script, timing, and ultimately, casting. Since this is a film about men, Peckinpah's trademarked misogyny is less pronounced than many of his other films, and he never had a better canvas for his explicit yet poetic violence. It is, in some ways, an exploration of the nature of violence, and how it is handed from one generation to another ? as symbolized by the American children who replay the violent bank robbery in the bloody street, and the young Mexican boy who joyfully watches the battle at the side of the Mexican general Mapache.The script is wonderfully understated. It's truest and most brilliant moment comes when William Holden's character makes his suicidal decision to rescue his tortured comrade. He simply says, "Let's go." No speeches. No explanations. There is a certain grandeur in the simplicity of that moment. The timing of the film was important in two ways. This film was one of the first to be edited with tape rather than glue, and that innovation in and of itself made it much easier to edit. That, in no small part, can be credited for the frenetic cutting of the gun battles. The editing of this film was tremendously influential. Also, the film was relevant in terms of theme during the Vietnam era. Many saw this violent tale of armed Americans interfering in a third world civil war highly-symbolic of America's bloody loss of innocence. Still, despite any real or implied meaning, the film would be irrelevant if it didn't work. And it does ? thanks in no small part to the excellent cast led by William Holden.William Holden is truly stunning as Bishop Pike, the aging, disillusioned leader of the gang. He is a great actor, too little acknowledged today, and this is one of his very best performances. His character reminds me more of a film noir detective than a normal western character. Like a film noir anti-hero, (imagine, in comparison, Bogart in "The Maltese Falcon,") Pike lives outside society's corrupt morality yet maintains an inner dignity and superiority by living by his own ironclad code of conduct. There's only one problem: Pike really doesn't live by his code. He readily speaks of it, but he really only uses it to maintain a hold over his unruly bunch. Despite the code, he is willing to sacrifice member after member, even his old friend Sykes, in the shabby name of self-preservation. Pike, more intelligent than the other members of his gang, realizes his life is lie. His decision to rescue gang member Angel, or die trying, is a true moment of redemption that gives the ensuing orgy of violence meaning.The rest of the cast is very good too. Ernest Borgnine gives an excellent performance as Dutch, the conscience of the group. Ben Johnson and Warren Oates are excellent as the rowdy Gorsch brothers. Robert Ryan is also very good as a former outlaw compelled by the railroad to bring Pike back face down over a saddle.This is one of the truly great westerns. There would not be another truly great one until 1992's "Unforgiven." One complaint. The DVD only features the "director's cut." The theatrical version of the film was superior. None of the restored scenes were truly needed. They only slowed down the narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blood and guts thriller from Sam Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERTHIS REVIEW IS BASED UPON THE DVD 145 MINUTE DIRECTOR'S CUTSam Peckinpah's 1969 masterpiece `The Wild Bunch' must have turned a good deal of Hollywood and the movie-going public on their heads upon its release. This film, along with Sergio Leone's epic `Once Upon a Time in the West' brought new levels of sinister, violent evildoers to the screen that had never been seen before.As many before me have stated with regards to this film the plot is somewhat basic - a bunch of outlaws are finding that the ways of the old lawless west are dying and as the movie progresses they come to terms with the idea that their type of `man' is also dying. What makes Peckinpah's film so remarkable is not the plot as much as it is the characters and their development throughout the story - most films are lucky to have a couple of strong roles and actors, this film is blessed with many.Observing William Holden and Robert Ryan travel through the story is awesome. The former outlaw partners now find themselves a the opposite sides of the law and order business, but they have the utmost respect for each other - the unwritten code, or honor among thieves. Holden has an intense argument with his toady Dutch (Ernest Borginine) about respect and honor for a man's word. These poor souls truly believe they are living a moral life and that their standards are crumbling before them.Quality supporting roles abound in `The Wild Bunch.' Veteran character actors Edmund O'Brien, Dub Taylor, Albert Dekker, L.Q. Jones, Bo Hopkins, Ben Johnson (`The Last Picture Show' Oscar winner,) Warren Oates and Strother Martin (`Cool Hand Luke,' `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' `Slapshot') shine in this film. Strother Martin annunciates the most authentic western gibberish I have ever heard! As difficult as it was supposed to be working for Sam Peckinpah these actors apparently totally bought into the system and supported a timeless masterpiece. Other reviewers have commented on the homosexual themes in this movie and I must state that I missed them at first. However, Martin and Jones do play this angle brilliantly and I am somewhat intrigued by one reviewers comments on Dutch's (Borginine's) fascination and near worship of Pike (William Holden.)I have not seen many Peckinpah films but I consider this movie and `The Getaway' to be two of the best films around. Peckinpah's style is amazingly violent and frightening. The slow motion violence helps drive through the horror and reality of violence - this is an important step for a Hollywood that was starting to develop in the mid 1960s, but it needed the full throttle direction of Peckinpah to breakthrough to its new found limits. Movie violence is an important tool for a society to observe the inherently violent nature of man. While some of society is influenced in the wrong way by such depictions I feel that most see the horror that is part of their inner make up and choose to steer clear of the violent path. A `good' war film (Kubrick's `Full Metal Jacket' and `Paths to Glory') should make you abhor war, while a `bad' war film (`To Hell and Back') makes you enlist.I am still awestruck at the beauty and vivid clarity that Peckinpah and his cinematographer Lucien Ballard achieved in this film. The natural beauty of the southwestern and Mexican settings is magnificently juxtaposed against the raging violence that is at the heart of this story. I truly hope that one day I can see the 179 minute original version of this movie that so shocked the few audiences that saw it in Kansas City and in London.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all-time favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read somewhere that a good movie has three good scenes. The Wild Bunch has probably 10, including one where the band rides out of an Indian camp to the strains of a melancholy Mexican folk song. This scene is so deeply evocative that it is likely to stay with you for a good long time. Basically The Wild Bunch is about a band of train robbers whose future dims as technology closes in on them. Holden is the big surprise as Pike. This is an actor who can be gritty (Picnic) or sardonic (Bridge over the River Kwai) or romantically amusing (Sabrina), but in this movie he has a dark depth, passion and a deadly determination to live his life out on his own terms. He is a hard case, through with a sense of honor and friendship. You could easily call him an antihero, but in fact he is more like one of the doomed gods in Valhalla. The last of the movie added to director Peckinpah's reputation as a violence addict, but the violence is analagous to the burning of Valhalla in Goetterdammerung. Call it violence if you will, but it is the violence of a collision of worlds. Holden is awesome, but so are Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oats, the great western actor Ben Johnson,. Edmund O'Brien and the Latino actor who plays General Mapachi. Add to this a wonderful music track, realistic dialog, splendid camera work and you have a great movie. It is Number One on my all time favorites list and I have to watch it once a year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah would never recover from his work on The Wild Bunch, hands-down his best effort. His editing, cinematography, script, and music are all top-notch, but it is the actors themselves that sell this movie to us. All the cast, short of the Mexican soldiers, create characters (all of them lowlifes) ranging from scrappy and scavenger to rugged and leathery. William Holden is too deadpan for his part, but Ernest Borgnine makes up for it with his wide variety of expression. Warren Oates is phenomenal although his character is thin.The script is an interesting amalgamation of Old West lore and the new wave of filmmaking. Peckinpah was overrated, but, when he found something that struck him hard, he stuck with it. The sound work is amazing given the time of release, I was amazed at the clarity and use of overlapping effects to create scenes of absolute mayhem that have yet to be equaled. Peckinpah's camerawork is even better, making me up my ante towards this decade of filmmaking. It is interesting how the role of women is no more than prostitutes and temperance supporters, no schoolmarms in distress here. Political correctness gets perforated with hundreds of bullets in the first 10 minutes. I prefer that over the stereotypical Western in all its revolting cliches.Overall, an amazing film that has aged on varying levels. It presents violence in a brutal and unflinching manner (the final, five minute battle being a cacophony of shooting) that may shock modern action fans. However, the age of the cast may turn off younger viewers until they are old enough to appreciate them. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah: Fame through a few over-the-top scenes of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a Western version of "The Lord of the Rings" without a catalog of place names, the characters in this film travel, travel, travel, sandwiched between two epic Peckinpah gun battles. The motive for the final gun battle seems contrived--characters probably would not behave similarly in reality--so it comes off as nothing more than gratuitous violence.The film contains long stretches with no dialog. That's not necessarily a problem. However, when dialog does occur, it lacks acuity. Standard, stereotypical dialog for a Western. In Peckinpah fashion, the dialog mainly serves to give a mild sense of brutality or offensiveness (e.g. "Damn gringos").Does the film warrant a 2:24 run time? Depends upon the type of experience that a viewer wants. If a viewer prefers compact storytelling, lots of scenes should have hit the editing room floor. If a viewer prefers the full ambiance of traveling three days by horse, the original length satisfies.What's not unique? Standard, stereotypical events for a Western* Drinking and dancing around a campfire * Whores in a hotel room * Brief glimpses of redeeming qualities in bad guysWhat's unique? Everyday sights that are usually expunged from formulaic Westerns* Children in many scenes (they tend to look bored). A simplistic technique to accentuate the roughness of criminals and bounty hunters via contrast. * Breast-feeding Mexican woman who wears a bandoleer * Extended portrayal of Mexico. Lots of Spanish dialog; viewers might want a thorough English subtitles file to achieve the fullest comprehension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate "end of the road" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch: genre - Western, sub-genre - Road Movie, Morality Tale, Anti-hero heroes. Basic Plot: The Wild Bunch, a gang of outlaws around 1900, decide to go for one final large "score". They know that the days of the "Wild West" are rapidly coming to an end. They know that the alternative to retirement would ultimately be prison or death.This is a movie that men tend to love and women hate. It is overtly sexist (all female characters are either prostitutes or would betray you in a second). The film is subtly racist, and extremely violent. This is a movie that Nora Ephron would despise. When it was released in 1969 the movie effectively redefined the acceptable level of violence in a film. The film has no dialog for the first 5-10 minutes then the first words are "If they move, kill 'em". At that point the violence explodes at a breathless pace.However, a violent film doesn't make a great film, and this is a great film. Three things make this film great.First, like few films (e.g. Casablanca, The Third Man, Good, Band and Ugly) it is cast so perfectly it is hard to imagine that anyone else could have played the key roles. William Holden and Robert Ryan, their faces lined by years of alcohol abuse, look both worn down and tough at the same time. Edmond O'Brien in one of his last performances is superb. And, Warren Oates gives the best performance of his career. In the Wild Bunch the outlaws, as violent and callous as they are, are the good guys. The bad guys are 'egg sucking gutter trash' as Robert Ryan calls them. Second, what makes the Wild Bunch different from the "gutter trash" chasing them is a strong moral code. The moral code is that the group is larger than the sum of its individual members. No individual in the group can put the group as a whole in jeopardy without the explicit consent of all others. If a member is wounded and can't keep up he is left behind. The loyalty of the members of the Wild Bunch to the group is absolute. They have no loyalties outside the group. There is no concept of patriotism. They would betray their home country without a second thought. Ernest Borgnine is the group philosopher and keeper/interpreter of the moral code. Borgnine's pronouncements and application of the moral code provides some of the few moments of levity in the film. Third, the members of the Wild Bunch are extraordinarily brave and fully accept the consequences of their actions. Those characteristics, lacking in so many in real life, are what make The Wild Bunch admirable.</fullReview>

William Holden leads a rag tag group that is bordering on mutiny at times. These are not nice people but do have their code which will ultimately decide their fate. I won't discuss the story in detail as plenty of others have done it much better than I could. I can tell you it has one of the greatest endings in cinema history as the remaining members of the wild bunch take on an army. Sam Peckinpah was not called 'bloody Sam' for nothing and the movie ends as it begins - with a breathtaking blood soaked shootout. I can't recommend highly enough. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's identifiably a Western, full of familiar ingredients, but not quite like any other.The date is 1913, just before World War I, well past the end of the classic Western movie with its range wars and post-civil war animosities. The only remaining outlaw gang we see has a great cast: William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Edmund O'Brien, and some fine support from Robert Ryan and his bunch of cut throats who are in pursuit.What makes it as good a film as it is, is the way the elements are put together, with real dash, and some added and thoroughly unexpected touches from the director.Here are three examples of those touches, all involving children. The movie opens with some raggedy Mexican kids playing a game in the village. The game is setting a swarm of stinging ants on a frenzied scorpion, an animal for which the setting, Durango, is famous. (The locals don't even call it "escorpion" but "alacron.") When they tire of the game the little tykes set fire to the weeds in which the battle is taking place and all the animals burn to death. These are not your stereotypical charmers. It requires some sophisticated arguments to tell the children from the ants or the scorpion.Among the gang's enemies are the treacherous General Mapache and his ragged army of anti-Villistas. The villagers favor the forces of Pancho Villa. In one scene the Villistas are attacking Mapache's camp in the village of Agua Verde. An urgent telegram arrives and the telegrapher dispatches a boy of about eleven in an oversize army uniform and cap to run the message to the general. Now, given the greasy villainy of General Mapache and his toothy, ugly face, he ought to be hiding in a cellar somewhere and ordering his men to do the fighting. Not here. The unkempt miscreant is standing out on the railroad with his men, amid the blossoming explosions of cannon shells, ignoring the bullets whizzing past him. And when the child rushes up, salutes, and hands him the telegram with a big grin, the General looks down at him and smiles with what appears to be genuine warmth and admiration for his bravery. What happened to the lazy formula? There is a huge slow-motion shoot out at the end. The men of the gang are satiated on booze and whores and after paying their bills march to their deaths, outnumbered fifty to one. They slaughter dozens of those ragged soldiers and apparently some civilians. In some scenes we see the giggling village children caught up in the gun play, just as we adults sometimes are, taking pot shots with over-sized rifles at William Holden and his gang. Holden himself is shot in the back by a young lady before he blasts her to kingdom come with his shotgun. And these are the heroes? The slow-motion death scenes aren't original with Pekinpah but their extensive use is. They'd been used earlier by Arthur Penn in "Bonny and Clyde" and, before that, an incunabula, very effectively by Akira Kurosawa in "Seven Samurai." The violence and the slow motion were celebrated at the time of this movie's release. "A ballet of death," it was called. It's since become an annoying clich.The movie has its weak points. Too many times the men break into laughter at things or in situations that don't really call for it. This was used sparingly and appropriately at the end of "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre." Here, too often, it just makes a viewer wonder what's so damned funny.It also embodies values -- men of some honor, though crooks and murderers, against some even worse crooks and murders, as well as plenty of innocents who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The gang may demonstrate honor among thieves but there's more to life than Holden's pronouncement that, "When you run with a man you stick with him or you're some kind of animal." But we can overlook the flaws because the movie's virtues overwhelm them. Pekinpah made three good movies, and this is one of them. After "Straw Dogs" he seemed to throw his talent away and more or less drank himself to death at a relatively early age. This is one of the three good ones and well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If they move....Kill em</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can one say about the Wild Bunch? It is without a doubt the greatest western ever made. Peckinpah's editing technique has never been bettered. See men killing each other in a dance of death. Watch bullets tear in to flesh in slow motion. Witness the death of the west. I watched Walter Hill's Extreme Prejudice recently, Hill try's hard to emulate the blood ballet of the Wild Bunch and fails.What I enjoyed most about the film, apart from the violence is the characters. If you like films about men, and I mean real men, (Pearl Harbour this ain't) You should watch this. If only Eastwood had made a film with Peckinpah. Peckinpah was a unique film maker, a man of steel, a man with balls, he puts the modern day film makers to shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Film and AFI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a film as much as it is truly a seminal work of art. I was at the private Hollywood premier of the film due to the fact that my father was on the crew that worked on Peckinpah's next film, "The Ballad of Cable Hogue". The crew members and their families were all invited to this private screening upon the completion of the editing of TWB. As was the norm with Sam's films, after the screening and actual premiere of TWB, the film was edited to almost ruination. Sad, but the same thing had happened to Sam previously, "Major Dundee" being the most clear example.Thankfully, we are able to see the film now in it's entirety. TWB, holding an undeserved #80 on the AFI list-it should be at least in the top ten and more deservedly the top two-is, and I'm just spitballin' here, probably one of the greatest films ever made. It has influenced the craft of film making certainly more than any of the other films ahead of it, save for possibly "Citizen Kane" and certainly more than "Casablanca". Don't get me wrong, as I am a huge fan of the silly little Bogart flick that made good. TWB deserves a spot of it's own, much like Beethoven in the annals of music.Bless you, Sam...ya done good. RIP.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blood and guts thriller from Sam Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERTHIS REVIEW IS BASED UPON THE DVD 145 MINUTE DIRECTOR'S CUTSam Peckinpah's 1969 masterpiece `The Wild Bunch' must have turned a good deal of Hollywood and the movie-going public on their heads upon its release. This film, along with Sergio Leone's epic `Once Upon a Time in the West' brought new levels of sinister, violent evildoers to the screen that had never been seen before.As many before me have stated with regards to this film the plot is somewhat basic - a bunch of outlaws are finding that the ways of the old lawless west are dying and as the movie progresses they come to terms with the idea that their type of `man' is also dying. What makes Peckinpah's film so remarkable is not the plot as much as it is the characters and their development throughout the story - most films are lucky to have a couple of strong roles and actors, this film is blessed with many.Observing William Holden and Robert Ryan travel through the story is awesome. The former outlaw partners now find themselves a the opposite sides of the law and order business, but they have the utmost respect for each other - the unwritten code, or honor among thieves. Holden has an intense argument with his toady Dutch (Ernest Borginine) about respect and honor for a man's word. These poor souls truly believe they are living a moral life and that their standards are crumbling before them.Quality supporting roles abound in `The Wild Bunch.' Veteran character actors Edmund O'Brien, Dub Taylor, Albert Dekker, L.Q. Jones, Bo Hopkins, Ben Johnson (`The Last Picture Show' Oscar winner,) Warren Oates and Strother Martin (`Cool Hand Luke,' `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' `Slapshot') shine in this film. Strother Martin annunciates the most authentic western gibberish I have ever heard! As difficult as it was supposed to be working for Sam Peckinpah these actors apparently totally bought into the system and supported a timeless masterpiece. Other reviewers have commented on the homosexual themes in this movie and I must state that I missed them at first. However, Martin and Jones do play this angle brilliantly and I am somewhat intrigued by one reviewers comments on Dutch's (Borginine's) fascination and near worship of Pike (William Holden.)I have not seen many Peckinpah films but I consider this movie and `The Getaway' to be two of the best films around. Peckinpah's style is amazingly violent and frightening. The slow motion violence helps drive through the horror and reality of violence - this is an important step for a Hollywood that was starting to develop in the mid 1960s, but it needed the full throttle direction of Peckinpah to breakthrough to its new found limits. Movie violence is an important tool for a society to observe the inherently violent nature of man. While some of society is influenced in the wrong way by such depictions I feel that most see the horror that is part of their inner make up and choose to steer clear of the violent path. A `good' war film (Kubrick's `Full Metal Jacket' and `Paths to Glory') should make you abhor war, while a `bad' war film (`To Hell and Back') makes you enlist.I am still awestruck at the beauty and vivid clarity that Peckinpah and his cinematographer Lucien Ballard achieved in this film. The natural beauty of the southwestern and Mexican settings is magnificently juxtaposed against the raging violence that is at the heart of this story. I truly hope that one day I can see the 190 minute original version of this movie that so shocked the few audiences that saw it in Kansas City and in London.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers)"The Wild Bunch," while lacking the bubbly mass appeal of "The Getaway" or the deep character study of "Straw Dogs," is easily Peckinpah's greatest movie. This is the apex of the cinematic gunfight - the inspiration for every John Woo and Wachowski that ever walked the earth.From beginning to end, the film is packed with signs of a changing West. Everyone is ugly and dirty in this movie, but even the bad guys get a little redemption in their willingness to die for their friend. The final gunfight is simply ravishing, no bones about it - and that's why this belongs on the top ten westerns list - along with OUATIW, High Noon, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern masterpiece from one of Hollywood's most misunderstood directors. Simply one of THE great American movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to commenting about movie masterpieces like 'The Wild Bunch' or 'Vertigo' or 'Taxi Driver', that is, some of the greatest American movies ever made, I find it very difficult to convey just how powerful and life changing they can be. The cliche goes a picture is worth a thousand words, and if you sit down and watch 'The Wild Bunch' for yourself you will immediately see why it is so special. Sam Peckinpah was one of the most misunderstood and underrated directors of the modern era, and 'The Wild Bunch' is his single most accomplished and powerful movie. Peckinpah's critics focus on his use of violence, and there is no denying that the climax of this movie is still one of the bloodiest in movie history, but there is much more to his work than that. 'The Wild Bunch' is basically a story about ageing, about a changing world and how to cope with it, and about loyalty and comradeship. AND about violence. The late William Holden ('Network') gives one of the strongest performances of his career as Pike Bishop, and he is supported by a first rate cast of character actors, especially Ernest Borgnine ('Escape From New York'), Robert Ryan ('The Dirty Dozen'), Jaime Sanchez ('Carlito's Way'), and western legends Warren Oates ('Dillinger') and Ben Johnson ('One-Eyed Jacks') as the unforgettable Gorch brothers. Also keep an eye out for Bo Hopkins' debut as Crazy Lee, and the wonderful duo of Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones, all three being Peckinpah semi-regulars. Everything about this movie is brilliant, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music. If you haven't seen this movie you must do so. I believe your life will be richer for it. If you have already watch it I urge you to watch it again, as it is a deceptively complex film that is worth revisiting time and again. Every time I watch it I get something more out of it. Every time I am equally impressed. 'The Wild Bunch' is a haunting and beautiful and ugly and powerful experience, and is without doubt one or the three or four greatest movies ever made. A masterpiece pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent tribute to the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The western genre is one of the most popular movie genres of all cinema history. Excellent actors and directors always worked with stories that evolved around the Old West myth. And in 1969, when the genre was at the highest pitch of its popularity, Sam Peckinpah made 'The Wild Bunch'. The movie served more like a homage to the Old West, and is regarded even today as one of the best westerns of all time and one of the best Sam Peckinpah's flicks. It is, indeed, an excellent tribute tribute to the Old West.'The Wild Bunch' takes place right before the beginning of World War I and in the height of the Mexican Revolution. To be more precise, the movie is set in the year of 1913, just when the mythical Wild West comes to an end. The plot follows the story of an aging bandits gang, leaden by Pike Bishop (William Holden). After stealing a small town bank, the gang manages to escape, with several of its members dead after a shootout with the local police. But when they check the money, they realize that what they stole were mere stones, with no value at all. This fact alone makes the group realize that the Old West is changing, and that it doesn't have room for people like them anymore. With this feeling of being out of place, the gang heads over to Mexico, to try to have one last big score before retiring. But things aren't gonna as smooth as they tough, because a former member of the gang, Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan) is forced by the police to chase and capture them within a 30-day period - or else, he goes to prison. What follows then is a series of happenings, shootouts, and new characters appearing- all representing the changing of the Wild West. 'The Wild Bunch' Oscar-nominated screenplay was wrote by Sam Peckinpah himself, with the help of Walon Green and Roy N. Sickner. Even though the basic argument of the story feels a lot like other westerns, such as 1968's 'Bandolero!', with a smart guy chasing a bandits gang, 'The Wild Bunch' stills holds its originality because of the treatment the screenplay has. It's all done to make the audience believe that those characters simply don't belong to that place anymore. The scenes where the members of the gang start to laugh for no apparent reason is a great example of that. The dialogs here are a little antiquated, but quite nice. And I kinda enjoyed the way Peckinpah tied the whole story together. The shootouts are amazing, and they don't seem out of place at all, different than what happens to other westerns. It's all made to be a tribute to the Old West, but nothing is forced. An overall great script, incredibly well-written, and with some unforgettable lines.I think that 'The Wild Bunch' is very well-casted. With the exception of the always-great William Holden, which offered a nice performance as Pike Bishop, the gang leader, the acting here isn't what you may call top-notch, but it's not bad either. All the supporting cast does an average job, with Emilio Fernndez standing out. I personally thought he was great as General Huerta, one of Mexican revolutionaries to which the gang stumble across, and a character that gets more important over the course of the movie. In the supporting cast, you also have names such as Ben Johnson and Bo Hopkins, actors that worked other times with Sam Peckinpah. And in the main roles, I also enjoyed the work of Ernest Borgnine. But the biggest surprise of 'The Wild Bunch' in terms of acting was someone called Jaime Snchez. He played Angel, the youngest of the gang members. His work wasn't excellent, but he was far from bad. I can't really understand why his career didn't took off after this movie.'The Wild Bunch' has all the elements which a Sam Peckinpah movie needs. It has lots of blood and violence, specially for a 1969 movie. It even has nudity (!). As a matter of fact, I think it's the movie that has most of these elements, not only for the violence, but mostly because this movie is widely regarded as been the best directing work of Peckinpah, along with 'The Getaway'. Peckinpah really settled the bar for others movies to come, with a very interesting camera work and the fast-cutting action that made him famous. And this Peckinpah-style is in evidence right in the first scene of the movie, when the gang try to rob the bank and enter in a gunfight with the local police. The way Peckinpah films this scene and all others shootouts scenes in the movie is simply amazing, with lots of close-ups and short shots, what makes the gunfight even more frenetic than it is. But Peckinpah not only shows his style in the action scenes, but in the normal ones too. His use of open-shots and close-ups is excellent, and reminded me a lot of George Roy Hill's work in 1969's 'Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid', a movie that also utilizes these resources. One thing that I though was great in 'The Wild Bunch' was the editing work by Lou Lombardo. It really settled the mood of the picture, specially the opening credits. Very well done. But one thing bothered me about the movie. And it is the original music score by Jerry Fielding. It was quite weak for a western.Overall, 'The Wild Bunch' is a great western, but it has its problems. It serves as an excellent tribute to the Wild West, and it is the best Sam Peckinpah movie I've ever saw. His directing work here influenced lots of others directors, what makes this a classic in every sense of the word. The screenplay is great, along with an average acting. But the original music score could be better, though.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Woman's String</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By this time, westerns had become a collection of icons, the mere flash of which evoked deep memories and stories. All you needed was some confidence, the skill all in the confidence. There's a selfreferential aspect to the hero we'd often see, as he would himself be a paragon of confidence in delivering our referenced vision.This was thought to turn that on its head by having the avatar we share with the filmmaker be a bad guy. "Bonnie and Clyde" had played a similar game the year before, and in a genre with a similar mechanism. But the gangster picture was less richly iconic, the vocabulary relatively small, closed. "Butch Cassady" would come a few months later and turn the western into a refection of the present instead of past, foundation stories ? folding the "gang" into Sergeant Pepper. So when I watch this again, I do so looking at icons and watching how they've been tampered with. This comment addresses two.One is the women. I seem to remember criticism at the time that this was misogynist, though its hard to see how it could have been deemed worse than its predecessors. Its mighty hard to beat "The Quiet Man" where John Wayne, after serial episodes of recreational drunken fighting, drags his selected but reluctant sweetie by the hair through cow pies.In "Wild Bunch," the woman trigger everything. A woman is behind the chief crook's motivation, her death also causing a physical wound that haunts him. Another woman, the Mexican's girl friend, runs away with the murderer of his father. The encounter with her is what everything revolves around. A third woman, a presumably permanently alluring prostitute, is what causes the two best friends to be separated before the movie begins and one friend to hunt the other. Oh, there are armies and robberies and shootings, but these are embodiments of womenly encounters. It matters because by this time noir had permeated everything but the western. The only way to introduce it was obliquely, through a force that's offscreen, that western notion of romance that exists only at the demigod level.The second thing to look for is the key shot, the one scene around which everything is built. The one shot that it is in the filmmaker's mind as he first wakes up and remembers the work. Sometimes the filmmaker tells you what it is. You may be fooled into thinking it is the shot in the beginning where scorpions are tortured by children. For me it comes 43 minutes into the director's cut. There are two outlaws in the gang that are also outlaws within the gang, more bad than the others. They are with a Mexican girl, a teen, and quite pretty. She is working a cat's cradle. If you don't know it, its a string game played with a loop by on or two pairs of hands. Its quite ancient and probably evolved alongside the development of spoken language. Its really quite hardwired in our brains and a solid model of cinemagraphic qualities can be built and shared using this "string figures" notation. Their encounter with this pre-sexual woman and this graphical node is the anchor shot for me. Your's will be different of course because each of us ? I hope ? builds the world differently. But if that 30 seconds was missing, this would be a different film for me.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw "The Wild Bunch" I was in Vietnam, the war wason, and a bunch of us young GI's were watching a midnight showing at atheater on DaNang Air Base. When the film ended, we started walkingaround the flight line to get to our barracks on the other side of thebase. That meant that we were out by a swamp at 3 AM: a prime timefor a mortar attack from the NVA in the hills. We walked in cautioussilence until one of us called out "OK guys, tell the truth. Rightnow, what is shaking you up more: the NVA out there, or thoughts ofthe Wild Bunch?" The version we saw in DaNang in early 1970 did include the sceneswhich have theoretically only recently been reedited in. Theflashback scene which shows the loss of Pike's Mexican love as anexplanation of how he got the scar in his leg gives an added dimensionto Pike's character and poignant meaning to the scene when he pointsat Angel and says, "Either you learn to live with it or we'll leaveyou here." Thirty two years later, "The Wild Bunch" has even more humansignificance for me; since I am now the same age as Pike, have livedmy share of adventures, have had my share of scores and failures, andknow that, "it's not like it used to be. But it'll do."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of the label "classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 20th century, the west is being slowly tamed by law, order and big business. Against this backdrop, the aging Pike Bishop and his gang prepare to pull a bank job to set them up for retirement. The job turns out to be a trap set by a railroad company seeking revenge on Pike and helped by his former partner Deke Thornton. The gang flee the trap and head to Mexico to lie low in the village of one of their number, Angel. Wanting money they take a job from the corrupt and ruthless dictator General Mapache Juerta to steal a shipment of guns from the US army as it nears the border. Despite the protest from Angel and the morality of arming the General, Pike accepts. Meanwhile though, Deke sets out to hunt down the gang on behalf of his railroad employers and Pike finds his past catching up with him.Sometimes older films are overrated and deemed "classic" simply because they are old and reasonably memorable. However for western fans The Wild Bunch deserves its status as a modern classic because it is set in a wild west that, like Pike himself, is having its violent past catch up with it. Corruption in the south is evident in the form of the dictators while in the north it takes the form of business leaders. Against this violence we are not encouraged to take Pike's side but it is hard not to ? his gang's "moral code" may allow terrible acts of violence but they do so with honour. In this way I found the setting more interesting than the usual gleaming wild frontier that Ford and many others present us with. Peckinpah presents Pike as this place made human ? a man seeking peace after his violent life and birth but unable to shake off his roots. It has been done before and since but it has rarely been done as well as this. It is tough, violent, engaging and intelligent. The back story is hinted at enough to let us understand without bogging us down in narrative.Peckinpah's direction is as good as ever whether it be in the iconic opening sequence or the famous climatic shootout which says so much more about the characters than just being an action scene. The cast is impressive and headed up with a sterling performance from William Holden. Robert Ryan is a good bit of casting but he isn't used very well since the majority of the film is with Holden. Borgnine is impressive alongside Holden and the support cast includes good turns from Oates, Jones, O'Brien and others.From its cruel and violent opening then, right through to the famous bloodbath that sits as a fitting climax to the characters and their world, this is a great film that is well worth seeing. Those that don't see value in Peckinpah's work will not be won over by this but those that are new to him could hardly do better than starting here ? a film to which many will eagerly return. Worthy of the label "classic" and important viewing for anyone with an interest in American cinema and westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Peckinpah's Grand Slam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a Director's Cut of "The Wild Bunch" on the big screen a couple of nights ago and although 43 years have passed it's still one helluva kick in the gut. I could tell how deeply this film has touched people by the reactions from the audience and obviously with so many IMDb reviews "The Wild Bunch" has made a lasting impression. There's so much to praise from the great performances of William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ben Johnson, Warren Oates and Edmond O'Brien to the great work of cinematographer Lucien Ballard and editor Lou Lombardo; the intricate screenplay by Peckinpah and Walon Green and Sam Peckinpah's bold, uncompromising direction. "The Wild Bunch" belongs to a group of films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "Lonely Are the Brave" that depict the cowboy/gunslinger as an anachronism in the face of a rapidly advancing modernity. They know their time is running out but the lure of one last job; the bonds between them and their adversaries' commitment to bringing them to justice lock them in a life and death struggle. The machine gun that figures so prominently in the conclusion is a great symbol of the mechanized slaughter that would come to dominate the 20th century. I loved the allegorical imagery of the scorpions and the ants locked in a battle to the death under the eager, enthusiastic eyes of children and by extension, us. William Holden gives one of his best performances in the role of Bishop Pike, aging leader of the Bunch. Robert Ryan is memorable as Deke Thornton, his former partner and current pursuer. Thornton feels disdain for the greedy, incompetent, railroad bosses who hate Pike. They have even less concern for human life than the outlaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in every way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's masterful movie is an incredible piece of work; much as its main characters realize that the way of the Old West are changing, so too does his movie acknowledge the evolution of the whole Western genre. No longer were ideas of "good" and "bad" so clearly defined. No longer did people merely clutch themselves and fall over when fatally shot; here we see bloody bullet penetration in all of its Technicolor glory. And there is one constant and admirable theme running throughout, that of a man's need to stand by his fellow men. Loyalty means a lot to ageing outlaw Pike Bishop (William Holden, in a fantastic change of pace performance). He and his fellow outlaws - Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), the Gorch brothers (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson), and Angel (Jaime Sanchez) can see that things are changing all around them, as they are witness to the marvel of automobiles and even the variety of "car" that can fly. As they look to make one last big score before they pack it in, they're trailed by Pike's old comrade Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), not terribly happy to be pursuing his former friend, but having very little choice in the matter. The characters are all quite colourful and interesting, and each actor gets a chance to shine as the intricate, well written (by Peckinpah and Walon Green, based on Green's and Roy N. Sickner's story) plot plays itself out. And this is a true "man's" movie, one in which the female characters don't fare too well, so this may not be to all tastes, but it's hard to deny the punch that this movie packs. It's extremely tense and exciting, with excellently staged action scenes, and plenty of squibs going off. Technically, this movie is a marvel, scored (by Jerry Fielding), lit (by Lucien Ballard), and edited (by Lou Lombardo) to perfection. It's a very rich looking experience that makes full use of its Panavision aspect ratio. The opening robbery scene is wonderfully intense (and features that memorable line, "If they move, kill them."); it will have you on the edge of your seat. Many fine sequences, with the robbery of guns and ammo from a train and the climactic shootout definite standouts. In addition to those actors already mentioned, solid contributions are made by a number of great character players: Edmond O'Brien, Strother Martin, L.Q. Jones (those last two making for a priceless comedy relief duo), Albert Dekker, Bo Hopkins, Dub Taylor, Emilio Fernandez, and Alfonso Arau. Poignant moments are mixed with some sharp dialogue, some good laughs, thrilling moments, and a high fun factor to make this well worth watching for any film fan, not just Western aficionados. As it reaches its conclusion, it would be too hard not to cheer seeing four of our main characters march side by side, guns at the ready, as they prepare to meet their destiny. The result of all of this is something truly unforgettable. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Influential As Any Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best westerns ever. Certainly changed the face of screen violence forever. Anyone who saw this at the theater in 1969 came out of it with an awe and admiration for its "newness". It literally took your breath away. That cannot happen today because of the imitative nature of its now clichd compositional style. This is a classic in the true sense (look up the definition of this overused term).It turned movie montage in a completely new direction. Contained more editing cuts than any movie in history, that by the way can be seen today in any visual medium with multiple quick cuts and zooms proliferating, and used slow-motion and blood squibs (seen any of this in movies since) to solicit viewer response. This is a movie as influential as any film can be. Rugged, relentless, high-styled, poetic and unforgiving. The road weary westerners are handsomely homely and the musical score is top notch. It also, must be said, that there are quite a few scenes that evoke as much tenderness as possible in such a macho movie. It is a man's movie with no apologies for that, however, beneath all the gritty violence, and whore mongering, Sam Peckinpah, believe it or not, was a closet romantic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah Perfection....This Study In Red</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily the best Western ever made, The Wild Bunch is also one of the best movies of all time. Director Sam Peckinpah gives us "a study in red", and the body count is enormous. Yes, there are literally hundreds of people slayed in this 1969 Classic......yet I have never considered this to be a violent film. Peckinpah decides to give us everything in vast amounts. Bad guys ? Lets make everyone bad...People getting shot ? Lets use a big machine gun...Blood ? Lets have gallons of it...Entertainment ? We will do that in spades. It is truly a brave decision by Peckinpah...and it works brilliantly. The dialogue is incisive, the photography innovative, the acting first class. William Holden and Ernest Borgnines characters are well developed, and almost likable but they are... finally...a couple of ageing outlaws who have done their share of killing. Peckinpah directs this great movie with Tender Loving Care, and gives us an ending that is cinematic gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie about 15 years ago and was shocked that i didn't know about this film sooner. This movie is on par with the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, which were nothing short of magnificent. I remember reading an article from around 1970 that old west actors such as John Wayne were very angry with the way this movie depicted the old west. Are you kidding?! I suppose they never read history in the old west. It was never about just the good guys and the bad guys. There were bounty hunters who played both sides for their own benefit (Clint Eastwood's character was just such a person). This was how the west really was........Ultra Violent! That being said, this movie starts out in a way you don't expect; with the kind of shootout that usually comes at the end of a western. As the film progresses, you see these four men are truly loyal to each other regardless of what happens. They also have accepted the fact that they now live in a world where their kind just either don't fit in or don't belong.Near the very end, Pike(played by the great William Holden) looks at the prostitute he had spent the night with and sees her child in the next room, looks back at her, seeing how beautiful she is, he then comes to the realization that at some point in his life, this could have been his life ( wife, child or children...aka the peaceful life) and see that this is the only life he will ever have till he dies.When he goes to the room where the Gorch bros. (oats and Johnson) and simply says "LETS GO!", they know exactly his meaning behind that. Walking out, Holden looks at Borgnine who is sitting outside and without saying a word, borgnine knows exactly what they are going to do next and he seems to have been waiting for this moment to come.What follows next is possibly the greatest western shootout of all time. Simply put; you have to see it to believe it!9 out of 10 for me. Wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genre-defying Western with a few unforgettable (and violent) scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't get the sense you're watching a major piece of cinema in "The Wild Bunch" until just before the credits roll. With the exception of a few deliciously intense gunfights, the film rolls along like a tumbleweed or at times even a pig in slop, celebrating the guffaws of male camaraderie and delighting in prostitution and violence. Then you realize you're watching Hollywood's first gritty, no-apologies Western. The usual sugarcoated outlaw mythos has been shattered and Sam Peckinpah appears as groundbreaking of a filmmaker as they come."The Wild Bunch" stars William Holden in a timeless story of aging outlaws tying up lose ends just as with another classic Western released the same year of 1969 in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." And tying up loose ends means one last bloody job regardless of the consequences. Pike (Holden) and his buddies Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), Lyle (Warren Oates), and Gorch (Ben Johnson) along with the troublemaker Angel (Jaime Sanchez) and the slap-happy old Freddy (Edmond O'Brien) realize after shooting their way out of a robbery that the money they stole was fake, money they planned to retire on. Not only that, but it was also a set-up and Pike's old partner Deke (Robert Ryan) has been hired to go after them. They flee to Mexico where they strike a deal with a general named Mapache to steal numerous guns and ammo in exchange for the money they need to finally call it quits. This involves the second big sequence, a train heist, where the outlaws lift the weapons right from under the noses of Deke and his pathetic "army."It sounds like classic Western, but the execution is far from it. These outlaws, despite our rooting for them most of the time, are far from exemplary heroes. They demand their pick of women when lodging in Mexico and they get drunk and careless. An unspoken code of conduct between them seems to be the only guiding principle they have.Then there's the laughing. Somewhere from 6 to 10 scenes end in over-the-top male laughter. This recurring "symbol" of laughter represents "The Wild Bunch" accurately: It grows tedious and seems quite pointless, but by the time that last laugh graces the screen -- perfection. The ending is a powerful closing statement that turns "The Wild Bunch" from a simple R-rated Western to arguable masterpiece. Rarely does a conclusion make a film like this one does. Where does one rank a film in cinema history that passes for enjoyable during the process but impresses in hindsight? Most films drop hints of greatness along the way, but the end glues "The Wild Bunch" together. Before the climactic ending, only a couple superb and satisfying bloody action scenes (with a heck of a lot of cuts for a film made in the pre-digital era) are worth celebrating. With a wider lens, however, few films did their part better to challenge the Western genre better than "The Wild Bunch."~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I wouldn't have it any other way"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch begins with children and, throughout, children are an almost constant presence. They are not in any way part of the story as it is written, but they are figured in visually, through numerous, seemingly arbitrary, inserts. It's an example of what cinema can do for you ? manifest a theme without ever once having to refer to it out loud. With these kids in the picture, director Sam Peckinpah's message is clear ? casual violence involves the innocent bystander.This is, of course, a revisionist Western in a vein that the genre had been following since the late 1950s. Like most such pictures it is an elegiac portrait of a vanishing way of life. But more than any other it is full of the weariness and melancholy of the gunfighter's life, and completely lacking in any nostalgia or romantic homage. Again this is something that is stressed more visually than verbally. There is scarcely any beauty in The Wild Bunch, no inviting landscapes, little dignity to the characters. Although Peckinpah had a hand in writing this picture (along with Walon Green and Roy Sickner), he is a director who likes his own ideas writ large on the screen, and he took enough control over the production to ensure they got there.Like many such Hollywood renegades Peckinpah's pictures have been analysed to death. Inevitably he gets credited with far more than he deserves (especially by those gushing jokers who do his DVD commentaries), but worse still has some of the finer aspects of his talent overlooked. Everyone knows about Peckinpah's rapid editing patterns, which acknowledge just how quickly the human brain can absorb visual information. However, the actual quality of these flashing images is paramount. Peckinpah has really taken care to give each shot a plain and clear focus. In a seemingly random crowd shot the careful orchestration of the movement pulls our eye to whatever we are supposed to notice, be it a gunman rushing forward or a woman lying prone amid the carnage. Peckinpah's compositional style tends very much towards "organised chaos".Nevertheless Peckinpah's method is not without its drawbacks. One is that, what with all this speedy cutting, plus the fact that there is little in between gritty close-up and wild group shot, means the acting is not shown up especially well. William Holden gives a great performance here, or seems to, but all we get of it are split-second scowls and sound bites. Robert Ryan looks to be doing a superb job too, but as he is a far more passive character he really merits a bit of meditative focus. We may be able to process a visual message in an instant, but we don't get the emotional weight or full physicality of an acting performance when it is cut up into so many little pieces.But let's face it, Peckinpah never intended his cast to carry the movie. That was a job he strove to take upon himself, and it is indeed difficult to discuss any aspect of the picture without referring back to its director. And so I might as well make the most of it and come round to the most wonderful of Peckinpah's ways ? his approach to action. Any fool with the necessary gadgetry can do a slow motion death (see Keoma, 1976, for example). What's different is the way Peckinpah orchestrates the shots, rhyming similar motions, splitting a slow motion fall between several faster shots, drawing us into the excitement for one second, hitting us with an innocent face the next ? all done with such exquisite timing and arrangement, to remove one facet of it would make the whole thing fall apart. In short, Peckinpah makes violence poetic. Does this contradict his own pacifist intentions? Maybe. But this is good poetry, regardless of its subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Bunch remains one of the most powerful "last" westerns ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was controversial because of its graphic, bloody violence and its portrayal of the crude men attempting to survive by any available means. In 1914, Texas bandits are ambushed by an old enemy and die bloodily in defense of one of their number against a ruthless Mexican revolutionary.The Wild Bunch is arguably director Sam Peckinpah's best film, and one which set a fashion for blood-spurting violence in Westerns. Peckinpah made a point of dwelling on the violence in slow-motion, choreographed shootings - believed at the time to be a comment on the violence being inflicted in Vietnam. Yet it is also an elegy for the Old West, a mournful funeral rite for a way of life. Undeniably stylish, thoughtful, and in places very exciting.</fullReview>

Holden was one of the top 10 box office draws for the entire decade of the 1950s.Holden had a 42 year career as a lead. He was the lead in his first film "The Golden Boy" in 1939 and also the lead in his last film, "The S.O.B." in 1981. John Wayne and Clint Eastwood are the only actors who had lead roles for that length of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few films manage to seem to be perfect. "The Wild Bunch" is one of those films. I can't think of any flaw to the film. It is simply a masterpiece and one of the greatest American films ever made. It's also probably the last truly great western ever made, and one of the films that signified the death of the genre. The acting is fantastic all around, with the cast of both stars and supporting actors perfectly etching out their roles. Its ironic that none of these performances were nominated for an Oscar, but the winner of the best actor award the same year was John Wayne. Say what you will about Sam Peckinpah, he always managed to get his actors to create truly memorable and human characters. The screenplay and direction by Peckinpah are both perfect. When release, everyone commented on how bloody and violent the film was. What many overlooked was the fact that is was so beautifully poetic. The blood is never grotesque or over-the-top, but always essential to telling the story.The story is what matters the most in this film. The theme is loyalty in even the worst of situations. All of the characters are multi-dimensional and completely realistic. There is no outright good or bad guys in the film, which was something rare to westerns. You manage to sympathize with every character no matter how despicable they may become. This is a testament to the genius of Peckinpah. It's obvious that John Woo worships him. If you have to make an action movie, this is the way to make it. A masterpiece. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I'm afraid I cannot contain the exclamation of "Holy F***ing S***!" that so brazenly encapsulates the power and awe of this movie, and must be so exclaimed if, for nothing else, but to cleanse it from my system.That said, the story is easily one of the best of any medium I have been partial to, and resonates still every time I watch it. From its somewhat deceitful opening to its cynically heart-wrenching conclusion the movie leaves no trace of doubt present as to what you are to see and expect of these men: Dirty, Aged, Sullen, Chauvinistic, Cruel, Misanthropic Killers who epitomize everything of the criminal archetype and only watch out for themselves. Yet the believability of these characters are precisely what makes the film such a masterpiece; That is, you genuinely care about these men who become increasingly aware of the struggle of these men to accept the limitations impressed upon them by age and the unfortunately changing world that has no want or need for them. Men who personify the times past and gone, with customs dead and forgotten.While I could continuously drone forward and on about the levels and multitudes that this movie so brilliantly perfected, I won't bore you any further than that which has already transpired. So in quick note: The acting is amazing on all fronts, so rarely does a film engross you so completely that every character forces you to see them as that character. Peckinpah is shown here in fine form and beautifully renders the Mexico he so loved in all its glory and form, while simultaneously able to depict the gritty violence that follows the life of such men as a natural consequence, not a liberty to be glorified. I will briefly comment on the abuse of women, children and just about everything else in the movie by stating merely that it is best used and taken as element of character and in no way connotes Peckinpah's desires or loathing of women, which simply is a load of horse-s***.The climatic conclusion is easily one of the most memorable in movie history, though I would think that to appreciate it in even the most minute sense you would have to see the films entirety (unlike Casablanca or The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly which can be enjoyed even on its own standings.) If you have yet to see this movie I would strongly suggest doing so, as it is one of those films you will want to watch again and again long after the settling of the dust.10/10 Best Western Ever (Yes, beating out The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly, Rio Bravo, Once Upon A Time in The West, Ride The High Country, Man Who Shot Liberty Vance and a Score of others typically nominated for the top honors...All are fantastic films but none can match its scope, breadth and power, even if a few come damned close).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Final Gunfight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1969, during the turbulent revolution of Mexico, amid the vanishing decade of the Gunfighter, master filmmaker Sam Peckinpah, created a masterpiece. Assembling what has been described as the most notable group of western actors of the period, namely William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, and Jamie Sanchez, otherwise known as The Wild Bunch, Peckinpah enshrined their epitaph on the silver screen forever. Daring to epitomized the final years of a group of aging outlaws, he created a most virulent, action packed and certainly destructive episode of an fading era. The story is that of a band of gunfighters looking for one final score, which would lead to their retirement. Instead, the deeds of their past pursue them into a final explosive confrontation with lawmen, bounty-hunters, and revolutionary Jurastias. What transpires in the final explosive minutes of the film creates such pistol packing, bullet tearing and machine gun ripping scenes as to numb the viewer's mind. It will become unforgettable and certainly most memorable as to compare all future western films to this one. A more fitting tribute to the gunfighter, there never was. A superb film if ever there was one. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Holden is great as "Pike Bishop", the leader of the "bunch". He is a man who has lived a life outside the law and is approaching the time in life where he has seen and maybe done too much. He wants out of the outlaw life and if he can only have one last big score he can "pull back" and retire. But 'pull back" to what? All of the actors in the movie have great roles and add to the feeling that maybe they have experienced too much violence in life. Robert Ryan, Warren Oates, Ernest Borgnine, Ben Johnson, Edmond O'Brien all play old and experienced outlaws who, along with Holden's character, can see the sun setting on their outlaw world. The period setting for the movie is perfect cc 1910 with WWI on the horizon and the days of the wild west ebbing. If you saw this movie in 1970 it had to have an effect on you if only for the violence, and Holden being anything but the typical Holden leading man character. He played a bad guy who killed people seemingly without remorse. I think this is Peckinpah's best picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Masterpiece-The Restored Director's Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few movies have been so initially controversial and enduringly brilliant as Sam Peckinpah's film "The Wild Bunch" released by Warner Brothers Pictures in 1969. By the standards of today's films,the explicit violence that ignited firestorms of debate in 1969 seems less shocking. By any standard,the powerful tale of hang-dog desperados bound by a code of honor rates as one of the greatest Westerns,and perhaps the greatest of all action/adventure films ever made,despited the "X" rating that it received from the Motion Picture Association of America,but this wasn't the first film from Warners that had this rating. There were two films that were "X" rated that were released by the studio,the first was with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf"(Warner,1966),which was directed by Mike Nichols and was an Oscar winner,and the other was Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange"(Warner,1971),which starred Malcolm McDowell which was Oscar winner as well which came out during the early 1970's. By the end of the decade several studios followed with their versions of "X" rated films as well....United Artists followed with the Oscar winner "Midnight Cowboy",with Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman,and also Columbia Pictures as well with Natalie Wood and Robert Culp in "Bob,Carol,Ted and Alice". Both films were released in 1969. The Original Director's cut,now available on DVD and Video restores "The Wild Bunch" to a complete pristine condition that hasn't been unseen since its theatrical release when it exploded unto audiences in theatres in July of 1969. The image is letterboxed,the color renewed,and the stereo soundtrack remixed and reintegrated-all to blood and thunder effect,that way Sam Peckinpah meant for it to be seen. Watch for William Holden,Robert Ryan,Ernest Borgnine,Edmund O'Brien, Warren Oates,and Ben Johnson saddle up for the roles of a lifetime. "We've got to start thinking beyond our guns,"Holden advises his men. But they're trapped in the ways that got them there as they go up against an army of Mexican bandits and the film's violent ending is worth seeing and it is a classic within itself. But not of glory but in the hellfire of bullets. In 1999,Warners re-released this classic western back in selected theatres to a whole new generation of individuals who never had the chance to see this movie as it was never been seen before. A classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peckinpah loved to dissect violence by making it look both comical and realistic in the same shot. The slow motion death scenes, which are his trademark, are blunt reminders that death is not pretty and that every life somehow counts. Even the lowest form of scum. Some could argue this was an anti war piece disguised as a western but it stands up as solid pulp entertainment all on its own. William Holden (outside Stalag 17) has never been better, and Ernest Borgnine as usual is flawless, being, perhaps, one of Hollywood's most underappreciated actors. A stark and almost ugly picture, which at times, moves like a ballet; a ballet that is as directed by Billy the Kid. Spoiler??Climatic machine gun sequence is the stuff of legend</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take an aging group of outlaws looking for one last big score in an American West that is aging, add violence, ambiguous morality, and outstanding performances by William Holden and Ernest Borgnine, and you have one of the greatest Western ever filmed. This is not your standard (sometimes campy) Western. In my view, this movie is "Unforgiven", written and filmed 20-some years earlier. Throughout the movie, viewers are brought into the convictions and torments of the main characters. They are getting old, the West is changing, and everything they knew is disappearing. So brilliant is the writing and acting that we sympathize with (some would say pity) Pike Bishop (William Holden), yet we come to loathe the railroad which, we are told, represents "the law". In this movie, we see that there is honor among thieves and that not only does your word matter, but also to whom you give your word. I should also note that the gunfights and the landscape have been masterfully photographed. The cinematography is splendid! This is a must-see for any Western fan specifically, or any movie fan in general. P.S. - For those who are Country music fans, the Wild Bunch and William Holden's character Pike Bishop have been recently immortalized in a Willie Nelson - Kid Rock duet titled "Last Stand In Open Country" which can be found on Willie Nelson's new album "The Great Divide".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD Along with John Ford's THE SEARCHERS, Howard Hawkes' RED RIVER, Robert Altman's McCABE AND MRS MILLER and Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN, THE WILD BUNCH is one of the greatest acheivements in western moviemaking. It is a violent story of an old gang in the late 1910's who have outlived there time period. The wild west is dead, and yet they go on living. They travel to Mexico, where hopefully they will find a place to belong. But it's useless. All the find is a violent military government and sad people. William Holden plays Pike, the leader of the gang who rob a bank and flee to Mexico. Robert Ryan is a former gang member, hired to hunt them done. These two great actors give perhaps their best performances in this film. There are many great moments here. The opening robbery, the bridge blowing up and of course the final showdown. Before the showdown takes place, a quieter, scene takes place. Pike, sitting in a room of a whorehouse, looks at her and her baby. He then throws all his gold on the floor and walks over the next room where two other members are. He says two words "Let's go" and they both know immediately what he wants. They then walk outside, where Ernest Borgnine is waiting. One look at Holden and he knows what they have to do. The following shots are quiet, as these four men walk down a dusty street, towards their deaths. This is a sequence of devastating emotional power, matched by the closing battle and then the final scenes in the movie, where Robert Ryan, sits outside of town thinking for hours. He should have been there and died with his friends, not been trying to catch them. This is undoubtably the best movie master filmmaker Sam Peckinpah ever made. A violent, emotional masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Bunch - A true a highpoint in American Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Masterful storyteller &amp; filmmaker, Sam Peckinpah, created a masterpiece in THE WILD BUNCH. And as high artistic expression sometimes goes, he suffered for it.Producer, Phil Feldman's choice to edit out critical scenes in the original release (the flashback scenes and Mapache's battle with Pancho Villa) along with Warner Bros. choice to downgrade the level of publicity and their release method (rather then a grand "first run" theater release, they chose a "straight to secondary theater" type of distribution). Greatly misunderstood when the film was originally released, the Director brought us to look into the souls of men. Now, it seems, Peckinpah has finally received the attention he so deserves for this work of art.This film possesses the complete package of; excellent direction, with a solid story/script, the beautiful music score by Jerry Fielding, deep character development (as only the masters can obtain), Lucian Ballard's cinematography, editing, the cast and level of acting, make for one powerful cinema experience. It might just be the high water-mark of excellence for all who were associated with the making of this film.And the true test, it holds up. In fact after over one hundred viewings, it seems to only get better. Thank you Sam and company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wild Bunch" is an ultra-violent, intense, and amazingly deep thinking western that is arguably the best film of the outstanding genre. A gang of ruthless outlaws which includes the likes of William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, and Jaime Sanchez, among others, are after one last score at a Texas bank in the pre-World War I West. After the score does not go as planned, the group flees to the safety of Mexico to avoid American bounty hunters led by former partner and friend Robert Ryan. While in Mexico an unholy alliance forms with Emilio Fernandez, a key figure in Mexico's national military. He wishes for the outlaws to steal a shipment of "modern" weapons and give them to the Mexican army and he will pay them handsomely, of course. There seems to be no problem with the arrangement to the titled characters, but emotional troubles soon plague Sanchez as he realizes that his family and friends will be defenseless against the Mexican army. Double-crossing and triple-crossing soon occurs and as the landscape of the old west transforms so do all the key players. There is a blurred line between good and bad as the outlaws seem more civilized and caring than Ryan's group of bounty hunters or Fernandez's army. In short, all are bad and all are going to have to pay for their earthly sins in the end and the cost is not going to be cheap by any stretch of the imagination. "The Wild Bunch" is risk-taking film-making that was so prevalent in 1969. Along with important American films like "Midnight Cowboy", "Easy Rider", and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "The Wild Bunch" pushed the envelope on modern film-making. The film is well written and directed like a slow-motion opera of violence and intense spectacles by Sam Peckinpah. The editing, camera angles, and special effects are outstanding. However, the characters, the screenplay, and the direction are the factors that make "The Wild Bunch" easily one of the greatest films ever produced. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my new favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Westerns, especially Sergio Leones, but I never got around to seeing this film until recently when it was on AMC. It is now one of my favorite movies of all time. I think it would make a great companion to Once Upon A Time In The West. Both have the same theme, the decline of 'real men' at the hands of civilization, in both case represented by the railroad men. And both films use facial expressions, scenery, and music, in places of dialogue. Reading the trivia I see that a lot of people were offered Bishops part before William Holden. Sterling Hayden looks too much like Robert Ryan I think, and Jimmy Stewart, come on, couldnt be ruthless if he tried. Richard Boone, Robert Mitchum, Charlton Heston also wouldnt have been good. Gregory Peck, Burt Lancaster, and Lee Marvin could have done well though.The characters were great, every one them memorable in some way. I keep wondering what the thing with the Germans was? Why did Pike shoot the older one first at the beginning of the massacre?I could never get tired of seeing this movie. I gave it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its 1969 and you have no idea the film you are watching contains over 3,500 scene to scene edits (the most of any color film and perhaps of all time), had much of its staging done "off the cuff" as Peckinpah allowed the flow of the filming to lead his directorial eye, and is about to change the way violence and realism is portrayed in American film for the next twenty five years. Do you still like this movie? For those of us who saw it then, the answer was decidedly divided. The "Wild Bunch" was a true love it or hate it film. Certainly beyond the comprehension of most contemporary critics, its "classic" status was built over time as countless directors attempted to employ Peckinpah's vision to their films. If your first viewing of this film was in the last ten years, you probably didn't understand what all the fuss was about. So pervasive has the use of slow motion edits and graphic violence become, the "Wild Bunch" appears tame, if not a bit wooden. Yet as evidenced by the timeless action scenes in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "Bonnie and Clyde", and combined with the ode to General Mapache Juerta's stoic scene under fire from Villa rebels by Duvall's Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in "Apocalypse Now" the "Wild Bunch" shows its greatness and influence on American cinema. Fortunately for us all, the Director's Cut has been released with better than 15 minutes of footage restored to the film. The Juerta scene, and several flash back moments were on the cutting room floor in the version of the film viewed by most. I highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it and urge those that have to revisit the Director's Cut. Take the time to watch the WB, "The Getaway", and "Cross of Iron" and marvel at the master. It then becomes clear what countless directors of inane action/adventure films were attempting to imitate with big budgets, little imagination, and even less talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sam peckinpa's classic about a group of outlaws in the everchanging western civilisation. filled with incredible stunts and battle sequences, fine acting by great stars of the silver screen, and character and story development that draws the viewer in like none other, the wild bunch is without a doubt one of the finest films ever made. every character in this movie is realistic, and we get to know them all on a high level, so we care about what happens to them. although these men are criminals, we find ourselves engrossed in their stories, their pasts, and cheering them on. never has there been a more heroic scene than the final fight in the wild bunch. when holden enters the room, gives the gorch brothers a long stare and simply says "let's go", it sends shivers down your back. we have seen these men kill the innocent, steal, and abandon their friends to save themselves. these are bad men, but as they march down that road, shouldering their way through the mexican army, and facing certain death, these men become heroes. to try and save a friend, they walk into a gun-blazing hell.i have never seen a film more exciting, breathtaking, and ahead of its time. the wild bunch is a must see for movie watchers of all kinds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a movie that's full of action with a compelling story and strong characters, this is a good picture to see. However, this movie definitely earns its 'R' rating as it contains graphic violence, and is not something suitable for all viewers.In this movie, a group of outlaws band together to run one more caper before some of the members retire. Complicating matters is the fact that one of their former members has been released from prison to hunt them down.The acting, directing and script are all extraordinarily well done. This movie contains some very memorable sequences that will stay with you long after you have seen the film. I recommend it to any Western fan who can stomach the 'R' rated content.</fullReview>

I saw it as a child, didn't remember the name of it but I recently bought it on DVD and it seemed like I found a lost treasure.The action sequences were so incredibly brutal and breathtaking, yet honest. The scenes between Holden and Borgnine were without a doubt straight from the heart. I felt as if my grandfather helped out with the humorous scenes, and that is priceless. In my mind all great movies should end with the good guy dying, and this was no exception, even if they were all "gray" characters. I know spanish and I was extremely surprised in the detail Peckinpah put in the dialogue of the mexicans. He definitely went all out. A great story about honor, code, running out of time, and going out in a bang.Ok lets go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Bunch....... to much testosterone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the Wild Bunch, Mr. Peckinpah exposes us to the sadistic nature of living organisms, whether they are ants, young boys and girls, or men and women. Even the newly invented horseless carriage becomes an instrument of torture. His film punches all the right buttons to set feminists howling. Women are portrayed as Madonna like nursing mothers or sexual handmaidens for men. Near the end of the film he seems to combine both images. There are moments in the debauchery scenes when male actors seem to go beyond the revelry required in the script. Angel's actions personify the ambivalence which exit towards women in the film. He's a likable sort of outlaw who just wants to fit into the gang. At night in the small Mexican village he comes from, he gains our empathy as he gently strums his guitar and sings softly to the other members gathered around the campfire. The serenity of the moment is broken when the village sage tells Angel that the woman Angel pines for was not abducted but left willingly with the evil Mapache, the village's arch enemy. We discover that Angel subscribes to the macho male credo- if I can't have her no one else can. The scene in the clamorous dining hall that is filled with, whores, drunken soldiers, outlaws, foreign operatives, and Angel is one of the most poignant scenes in the movie. It is masterfully staged and is accusatory and outrageously humorous at the same time.Pike Bishop, the leader of Wild Bunch, periodically muses about the meaning of life. He seems bored, confused and bitter about his life and the changes in society he has no control over. His feeling of helplessness propel him into the final climatic violent scene of the film. The troublesome aspect of the last few minutes of the film is not the violence, but the glorification of the violence. No one should have to be reminded that this is just a movie but much criticism has made about this type of cinematic violence. Clint Eastwood's epic western Unforgiven makes a great counterpoint to this film.This is an extraordinary film made by an extraordinary filmmaker. A must see film that is thought provoking and ripe for debate. Sam Peckinpah holds a mirror up to society and dares us to take a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest American Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Homer had access to a movie camera he would have certainly directed his battles in the same way Peckinpah did in the "Wild Bunch", the first US feature that can be considered truly modern. An ode to the very nature of violence, the spectacle orchestrated by the director is still unsurpassed in its sheer monumentality. Just as the Greek sage's warriors took many lines to meet their doom, so do scores of victims here, toppling over in hundreds of frames per second (now of course, a mandatory cliche). Not even Hong Kong's notorious gunplay set-pieces can eclipse the two enveloping shootouts whose casualties rise into triple digits. William Holden and his five comrades are the participants of this "Odyssey", but the grave irony is that none have a home to return to. Besides, they're not even heroes. The basic premise of "The Wild Bunch" is confrontational from start to finish: anti-Western, anti-patriotic, anti-everything, it seems, but not exactly. Peckinpah manages to tell the story with an immense amount of fortitude and pathos, plus a good measure of humor and dramatic tension (the train-robbery scene alone is nail-biting suspense), in other words, all the ingredients of supreme cinematic merit. In a way, the film is a foremost embodiment of the American spirit, rebellious, restless and ultimately destructive, in all its glorious and frightening complexity (which is why I nominate it for the number one slot on the list). Two thirds of today's celluloid canon, from John Woo to Arnold, from Tarantino to Jabba the Hutt, has been spawned from the old cowboys' death throes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm ordinarily not a fan of Westerns. For the first 16 years of my life I saw a few westerns and didn't think much of them. Then a few years ago I saw The Wild Bunch. The most brutal savage violent western, if not movie, of all time. This movie blew me away and is now my 4th favorite of all time. The Wild Bunch has left such an impression on me that watch William Holden, Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oats, or Bo Hopkins in any other movies without seeing their Wild Bunch charecters. Only Hard Boiled can put up a body count to equal this movie's. The final body count can't be counted as the torrential flow of falling body's moves much to rapidly in a haze of ritualistic and stylized blood letting. This is the movie that changed movie violence forever. Want proof? Watch "violent movies" before 1969. Then mull over what has come since.The Godfather 72, A Clockwork Orange 72, Scarface 83, any teenhorror flick of the 80's, The Rambo trilogy, The Terminator 84, Platoon 86, etc........ But above and beyond the violence here there is still a great movie about a group of men on the fringes of society. A society that is changing and will soon make them obsolete. There is story of loyalty, honor, survival, and trust. As Pike (Holden) puts it during the movie in a conversation to Dutch (Borgnine) It's not your word that counts, it's who you give it to. This isn't just a good movie It's perfect. Pike, Dutch, Lyle, Tector, and Angelo establish screen characters that are some of the toughest tough guys in movie history. Watch carefully for the scene where Tector gets skipped in the drinking order. Sam Peckinpaugh should have got an Oscar for this movie. I LOVE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Westerns Ever Released</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch is a Western directed by Sam Peckinpah about an aging outlaw gang on the Texas-Mexico border, trying to exist in the changing modern world of 1913. The film was controversial because of its graphic violence and its portrayal of crude men attempting to survive by any available means.It features William Holden, Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, Ben Johnson and Warren Oates. The screenplay was by Peckinpah and Walon Green.It is noted for intricate, multi-angle editing, using normal and slow motion images, a revolutionary cinema technique during its time of release in 1969.After a failed payroll robbery, the outlaw Bunch, led by aging Pike Bishop and including Dutch, Angel, and Lyle and Tector Gorch, heads for Mexico pursued by the gang of Pike's friend-turned-nemesis Deke Thornton.Ultimately caught between the corruption of railroad fat cat Harrigan and Federal general Mapache, and without a frontier for escape, the Bunch opts for a final Pyrrhic victory, striding purposefully to confront Mapache and avenge their friend Angel. "If they move, kill 'em!" Beginning and ending with two of the bloodiest battles in screen history, Sam Peckinpah's classic revisionist Western ruthlessly takes apart the myths of the West. Released in the late '60s discord over Vietnam, in the wake of the controversial Bonnie and Clyde nihilism of the times, while the other reviled it as depraved. But nevertheless, it takes the basic elements of the Western movie myth, which once defined a simple, morally comprehensible world, and by bending them turns them into symbols of futility and aimless corruption. Also,credit Peckinpah's success in setting the scenes and the sketches of a dozen vividly individualized characters, and choreographs one of the most realistic, influential, brilliantly photographed shootouts under the pitiless sun. The cast is superb, the dialog crackling, the bitterly ambiguous moral of the story hard-earned.One of the best Westerns ever released on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah was a great director of actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch passed both the "I'll just watch this till I fall asleep, stay awake to the end" test AND the "still thinking about it the next evening" test.Hadn't seen it for years. Not since my thirties, and I've been old enough to stand for Prez for nearly a decade. But the elegaic Western is one of my favourite genres and this one is even more special than I'd appreciated before.Quibbles: some heavy handed imagery, some dated editing and SFX, plus what looked like very rough treatment of the horses.OK.What struck me was the depth and subtlety of the acting, the characterisation and the thoughtful dramatic development of Pike's (Bill Holden) journey from corruption back to the loyalty he espouses and inspires. The better known names in the cast all shine, particularly Holden and Ryan, but the less remembered actors such as O'Brien and Fernndez, are allowed to breathe in parts written with dapples of sunlight amongst the heavy shadows of Old Timer and Bandito with Bad Teeth.The pivotal character of Pike is shown over the course of the film to be an inspirational leader and man of integrity; he carries responsibility, and makes mainly good strategic decisions; but he also has lapses of concentration for which others, and he, pay a heavy price. The drama of the film is carried forward by his decisions and choices.The story of the film is framed by two well choreographed bloodbaths which echo each other, yet show how the characters have and haven't moved forward.And when you step back and appreciate the humanity and appeal of the actors, you have to recall I think, that such consistency comes from a screenplay and scenario that understands all its players and how they relate to each other, as well as a director able, willing and enabled to create the space and the environment for actors to thrive and relate. I get the impression that discussion was a big part of the process of making this movie, probably involving whisky and late nights.Hawks, Huston and Gilliam come to mind, and I'd be willing to bet that Peckinpah was modelling and aspiring to Shakespeare. The language ain't purty, but the elegance and humanity and attention to detail sure are.And do yourself a favour. Look up the Emilio Fernndez IMDb entry. Fascinating!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by admitting that you are not really going to get a balanced review of this movie from me. I have been a fan of this movie since stumbling across it as a teenager and always tried to watch it when it was on TV until I purchased it on DVD. Well imagine my delight when working away from home I see what is on at the local multiplex and they are showing this as part of 'The Times, Movies That Matter Season' with a nice restored print and some booming sounds I was chuffed to say the least. Does the film hold up on the big screen? The answer is a resounding yes. This is classic Peckenpah big bold characters set in the real dirt of a developing America where just like to day the emerging enemy is the corporation. Great performances all round at the bunch come across as a bunch of men whom time is passing by (I get the same feeling from 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) men who live their live by the gun knowing it could be over any day, so time is often drowned in women and whisky. We get magnificent direction where the camera lingers of the crevices of the mountain scenery as much as it does of the weathered faces of the actors. This all leads to the magnificent and blood thirsty conclusion which just got better on the big screen and the film has now gone up in my estimation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Best Western Ever - Bar None! I Recent re-watched this film for the first time in about a year, and not that i forgot how good it is, but it just gets better with age. Most western's since have either tried to copied or robbed parts of The Wild Bunch, but none have every got close to the rawness or the true violence, while at same time showing the emotions of what these group of Texas Bandits were going thought. The acting is more than top notch with Willian Holden,Robert Ryan, Warren Oates and the incredible Ernest Borgnine all putting in great performance's, ably supported by the rest of the cast. The directing is arguable Peckenpah best, from the moment those now famous words 'if they move kill 'em' are hissed, until the end of the now legendary final bloody battle,you just feel like your along for the ride. Peckenpah make's every gun-shot seem important and every death seem justified for these cowboys to get want they want, by the way Sam Peckenpah is probably one of greatest directors in cinema history. While the story it's self, i believe, it fairly irrelevant. A group of ageing ruthless bandits attempting one more daring mission before hanging up there spurs and watching the sunset. Things start to wrong when a former gang member is now a hire hand attempting to catch and ultimately kill this former friends. Add to this a Mexican General wanting a new Gatling gun and this leads to some great gun-fights, my particular favourite being the bank robbery at the start when the bandit first realise that their former partner is now hunting them. When one of the gang gets upset with general, this kicks in the most explosive gun battles cinema has every seen. The hairs on back my neck still raise every time i watch the four men walking to probable death. OK some of the special effects might now seem to a bit dated, but don't forget this film was made over 35 years ago. I strongly recommend any fans of western's who haven't yet watch The Wild Bunce, there can't be many, to take two and a half hours out of their life and watch it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of aging violent mercenaries steal US weapons for a Mexican General, all the while overlooking the despotic attitude of their employer towards his subjects. As they come to terms with their own physical decline and a world they can no longer keep up with, they search for a way to go out with a blaze of glory.Peckinpah had a fixation with the passing of eras, particularly that of the Old West where men really were men. His nostalgia and bitterness imbues each frame of this film and every fiber of his main characters. The whole story is mostly about four old men running away from their own deaths, before turning around to confront the idea. That these men are played by heavyweights such as William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan and Edmond O'Brien adds to the gravitas. Thes old lions are prone to sadness, cynicism... and occasionally very violent behavior. And this is where "The Wild Bunch" ceases to be a great Western to become a truly legendary film.Peckinpah always had an uncompromising way of showing violence, but here he exceeded his own standards and set new rules that would dominate cinema for decades. An opening bank robbery and a midway train attack are great moments of screen action, but nothing has prepared you for the final showdown, the big explosion after 2 hours of mounting tension. Crash-zooms, dynamite, slow-motion, bullets ripping through flesh and throwing people across rooms... "The Wild Bunch"'s epic gunfight is the nastiest bullet brawl ever shot.Peckinpah's ode to the West is a fusion of glorious parts (intricate characters, marvelous structure, humor, virtuoso violence) that unite to form a true myth of a motion picture.If you only see one Western in your life, make it this one!</fullReview>

William Holden is exciting in his role and I thought James Stewart would have been ideal for the role. It is on par with Ford's "The Searchers" and Hawks "Red River" as my all time favorite Western movies. William S.Hart, Joel McCrea, Gary Cooper, John Wayne, Randolph Scott, Clint Eastwood and Tom Mix are the Seven Wonders of Western Films and some beautiful films like the Virginian, the Westerner are not available in its original uncut version these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some while, I've been struggling to determine, what does one say about a classic that is so far beyond - and above - the norm, that, in a sense, anything one says of it would be superfluous? Of course it would have to be summed up in a quote from the film itself. For me, it's one of the first lines of spoken dialog in the film, that spoken by the railroad station manager to his clerk: "I don't care what it is you meant to do - it's what you did I don't like!" - and I don't even know if that's an exact quote, and somehow that's not important; this is how I hear it every time: the Wild bunch are not heroes; they are the damned; so was Adam; so are we all. And if we can't forgive them, who will ever forgive us?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when it first came out in 1969, when it apparently almost garnished an X-rating for it's "extreme" violence. (It was 1969, after all). People were shocked to see William "Golden Boy" Holden trampling a woman during the opening shootout.The key to understanding this film is a scene between Holden and Borgnine.Holden: He gave his word! Borgnine: To a railroad.. Holden: It was his word!! Borgnine: That ain't what counts! It's who you give it to!Even the worst of us need a sense of honor and loyalty, perhaps the worst of us most of all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah Directed many fine films but "THE WILD BUNCH" is so Outstanding that it became his greatest effort. You must see it in WIDESCREEN to see how he fills every inch of the screen with Movie Magic, that changed the way Modern Movies are made.His influence can be seen in every Action Film in the past 31 years.Made in 1969 it was so far ahead of his time that very few films can match it's IMPACT. He made you believe you were there. He could make the Actors believe they were the people they were playing.This AWESOME FILM is like taking a time machine back to the old west and shows you how it really was! The emotion feelings he created in this film have never been Duplicated even by him.You can watch this film hundreds of times and still be moved.Most of the people involved in this film are gone now,But "THE WILD BUNCH" has a life of it's own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is cinema!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's taut western masterpiece about the effect that the closing of the wild west had on criminals remains as gripping and as moving today as ever. The phenomenally sharp editing and the astounding complexity of the script makes it the leading rival to Ford's 'The Searchers' for the tital of finest western ever made. The casting is essential to the film's memorability, William Holden and Ernest Borgnine in tattered middle - age give daringly deep performances as the empathetic manly anti - heroes. For this reason alone, it is superior to the slightly naive 'Butch Cassidy...'. The Mexican folk score is as moving as ever and coupled with Peckinpah's excellent direction, 'The Wild Bunch' remains a true American classic despite its revisionist nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The western that ended all westerns or at least dramatically changed them. After a long period of great westerns by true masters of cinema like Ford, Hawks, and Griffith came the film that broke the mold which could never be returned to its original glory. Cowboys like John Wayne had outlived their time and had to face a new west with emerging industrialized cities. The Wild Bunch were the last remnants of men who could settle matters with a gun and take what they want before the law and the railroad took over.What makes this film so lasting and great is that the phenomenal ending doesn't overshadow the rest of the film. A feat which even emerging classics like "Barton Fink" and "Magnolia" can't pull-off as I find myself waiting for the one outstanding scene in each of them. But with "The Wild Bunch" there's not a single scene I don't enjoy watching. It opens with one bloody episode and ends with another. One act of appalling sin and another of beautiful redemption. Never have four words evoked such a variety of emotions in me as "Let's go," "Why not?" accompanied by the delighted smile on Borgnine's face. This film has it all, great actors, great director, great writing with real character development, symbolism all wrapped into a nice package that delivers. There's not a thing I'd change about this film. It's truly one of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the Wild Bunch, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch is an excellent story about the changing of the guard along America's borders and frontiers. It is perfectly cast, skillfully directed. But I have a few comments about the violence in this movie: 1. It is actually quite brutal, even by today's standards. A lot of women and other civilians get killed during the gunfights. 2. Squibs were NOT created for this film - just employed very effectively. Bonnie and Clyde predates Wild Bunch by two years, and has a great slow-mo shootout - with squibs. 3. No one talks about the composition of shots and the editing. That's what sets Wild Bunch apart from films by John Woo and pretenders like Antoine Fuqua (Replacement Killers) - the slow-mo is used to let us really examine the life-and-death struggle of a bitter shootout, to see the odd juxtapositions and little details. Not just to make for a "cool" shootout. Read Bloody Sam, by Marshall Fine (the local film critic in my area!) to learn more about Peckinpah's genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Oh my, what a bunch!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you have your revisionist Westerns, and I guess you have your revisionist reviews. I guess this is one of those. With the reputation of "The Wild Bunch", I'm just not seeing what all the fuss is about. The story is basically about two hard cases (Holden as Bishop, Borgnine as Dutch) teamed up with two relatively pragmatic brothers (Oates and Johnson as the Gorches), and a Mexican (Jaime Sanchez) along for the ride. They're a gang of outlaws, so it was never a question of this viewer finding anything remotely plausible to identify with regarding their circumstances. Their mission of running guns to the Mexicans is over long and tedious, and I just lost interest. When that happens, I just don't care about the outcome. With this film, that's saying a lot, because if you're a Western fan, you've probably heard about it before you've had a chance to see it. With the hype comes an expectation, and when that expectation isn't met, the result is a let down. Even the confrontation that's posited throughout the story, that of Deke Thornton tracking down the bad guys within thirty days or else - doesn't happen. There is no 'or else'. Presumably Harrigan (Albert Dekker) didn't have to pay up, and Robert Ryan's character goes home empty handed.Too bad really, it was a fine cast and something could have reasonably been done with the basic plot. But it was aimless, and took a long time getting there. In my estimation, along with "The Searchers", two of the most overrated movies of the Western genre. For the record though, "The Searchers" was better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam's Best Violence Ballet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scenes of that botched bank robbery until the final shootout with the outlaws taking on a whole army, The Wild Bunch is Sam Peckinpah's personal ode to the closing of the west. These outlaws may not have gone out with the same sense of dignity that John Bernard Books did in The Shootist, but they sure lacked nothing for style.William Holden heads an outlaw gang who's got a big price on his head and one of his former men, Robert Ryan, leading an effort to capture or kill him and his crew. Ryan isn't exactly given the best of help by the authorities in the persons of L.Q. Jones and Strother Martin. Still Ryan's determined to win his freedom.Holden also wants freedom, but if the west of John Bernard Books is gone in 1901, by 1911 it's really over and done with. In the tradition of many films and in real life, the total breakdown of federal authority in Mexico offered much opportunity for folks like Holden and his outlaw band. They go into the service of one of the local Generals, Emilio Fernandez who's not much better than Alfonso Bedoya in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, he's just got a much prettier uniform. The decades of hatred for the 'gringo' and the complexity of Mexican politics just bewilders and disgusts Holden and his crew. In the end they decide their time is over and have one lovely final battle.In the cast there are a couple of prominent survivors, but see the film if you want to know who. In real life Albert Dekker committed suicide while shooting this film. Dekker plays the railroad man who employs Ryan, I imagine his role was cut down and written around. That in itself was nothing to Sam Peckinpah who was legendary for improvising. Still it's a sad end for a great player, but Dekker did go out on a good film.The Wild Bunch with those two violence ballets that Sam Peckinpah was also legendary for make The Wild Bunch one of the best westerns ever. Not to be missed by any fan of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Misfire -- For Some Reason Comes Off Dated and a Little Contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film offering may be more geared toward die-hard western fans. You would think that "The Wild Bunch" would be a sure thing with a host of name talent including William Holden and Ernest Bourgnine directed by Sam Peckinpah. But for some reason, I never quite felt brought into this movie. It is certainly watchable but it never pulled me in the way that the Leone/Eastwood spaghetti westerns or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid did. To me, the problem did not lay with the brutality of the opening sequence in which townspeople are caught in the cross-fire between the outlaws and the bounty hunters. The problem I had was with the character development and the dialog.The script, particularly the dialog, comes off too contrived for its own good, often falling into the trap where the characters are constantly "discussing" the situation. The leaders in this movie yell a lot, particularly when they are making some speech concerning morality or motivation which occurs among both the outlaws and the bounty hunters out to get them. It was hard for me to swallow, particularly with William Holden as Pike Bishop, the leader of the outlaws. And the characters also were a little too cookie cutter to believe in them as real people. Some of them seemed they were there to fulfill the western story formula, like the old geezer with enough facial hair to catch a colony of flees, and it does. You know the one, with teeth missing and he has the most hideous high-pitched laugh. Would he really be with this gang of outlaws? One of the outlaws wants to put him out of his misery but Holden prevents him. I didn't buy it for a second. Lee van Cleef would have done him in long before the movie began!Holden's character is just to too much of a hot-head to believe that he is really the leader of a gang of outlaws. He doesn't really act like an outlaw, more like an over-worked sheriff. I would probably have believed in him more as the head of the bounty hunters than the outlaws. At one point he even says he is "the leader". Leaders would never say that! Such renegade groups usually choose the leader not only because of leadership capabilities but because there is something fearsome and enigmatic about him (or her). The best outlaw leaders, particularly in westerns, engender an air of mystery. They are not privy to instant anger at the drop of a hat. Instead, the most compelling leaders are the ones who are often soft-spoken but incredibly intense, never quite revealing what they're thinking or even who they are, which only enhances the mystery and fear about them, such as Indio in the Spaghetti Western "For a Few Dollars More". Indio is always slightly apart from the other outlaws, almost like a dictator, not easily accessed, which made him all the more fearsome. I never saw any mystery in Holden's character. It's not all his fault as a lot of it has to do with the script. To me, the writing was much better for him in Stalag 17 then in this movie.The story concerns a group of misfit outlaws who have been doing this for awhile headed by Holden. They're being hunted by a band of bounty hunters that make Lee van Cleef (from the Sergione Spaghetti Westerns) seem like a cultured gentleman. The outlaws flee to Mexico during the time of the Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa where the climactic episodes of the film take place. The recurring theme of loyalty vs criminality is maybe applied with a sledge hammer. A decent movie, but, in my opinion, cannot hold a candle to the likes of A Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and Once Upon a Time in America. Maybe because Leone's movies allowed the story to make its own point. Pekinpah's Wild Bunch seems a little bit too self-conscious to make it seem real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man shoot gun. Man frown.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ain't like it used to be ? but it'll do," says Freddie Sykes (Edmond O'Brien) before guffawing into the closing credits. If Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West was a eulogy to the classical Old West, Peckinpah's film must be the last hurrah. The Wild Bunch is a paean to masculinity for much of its (rather bloated) running time; an apocalyptic vision of a world where guns are both the most vital tools and the most precious currency.Everything Peckinpah throws at us is designed to jar ? from the scattered flashbacks, coming at us like buckshot, to the swathes of Spanish language, to the hack 'n' slash editing. But most of all the relentless callousness and misogyny of it all. On one hand it's refreshing to see modern liberal values not bestowed upon a West less Wild; and yet after two hours of scarlet-spattered human suffering, shot through with elements of farce (which would really come to the fore in the director's marginally superior follow-up, The Ballad of Cable Hogue), one abandons the notion that Peckinpah might have anything more interesting to say about his linear characters other than how many bullets they'll take when it comes to the final fandango. By which point, I might add, after so much lurid excess, there's only one finale the film can deliver: one in which the Bunch go the way of the scorpions in the opening scene, swarmed by red ants, stung, stung and stung again, leaving their corpses to the vultures of mankind.Clearly the editing, camera angles and sheer level of violence were revolutionary in 1969. But while an oddly-shaped vase may catch the eye, it can still go empty, and there isn't much here above style. Certainly nothing to match the real classics. None of the soul of Leone's aforementioned masterpiece; nothing of the allegory of High Noon; none of the wit and gusto of Rio Bravo. The Wild Bunch feels like a bruise on Western celluloid history: impactful, ugly and not altogether welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's all the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm certainly in the minority in not really liking this film. It is in the AFI's Top 100 list at #80. Why? The editing and color make it appealing to the eye, and the brutal violence was shocking for the time (due to Hays code being lifted in 1968). I can see why others find it fascinating. Just not me. I really like William Holden, Ernie Borg-9 (that's how he signed an autograph for me), and slow drawlin' Ben Johnson. But their talents were wasted. I kept getting the impression that Holden was trying to make the best of poor lines, and doing poorly. I usually don't like Robert Ryan, but he was almost likable. I wish he'd a shot the "gutter trash" early in the movie. If I had a gun, I'd a got Mr. "Black Liar" while he was happily running from corpse to corpse claiming guns, boots and other loots.Throughout the movie, I struggled to figure out what was going on and why. Why are they together? Why are they being pursued by the "gutter trash"? Why don't they mourn their own dead? Why are they in this town? How can they stay put for so long without Thornton catching up, yet when their out in the brush, Thornton's right on their trail? Ugh. I could go on... I've heard there is a version of this film with scenes deleted. I must have seen this version.I'm a huge fan of classic films. I find many movies made these days are splashy, flashy, "fresh", edgy, action-packed, and a big waste of 2 hrs. The Wild Bunch reminds me of a movie made these days, lots of flash and "style", but no substance, coherence, continuity, or reasonableness.If you want to see a high quality Western, try "Once Upon a Time in the West". If you want to see Holden's best, watch "Stalag 17". Rating 5/10</fullReview>

Bill has for the most part of his career if not all of it played a laid back can't be bothered who cares what the hell type of character. The wild bunch is a film about some outlaws who are fully aware that their time has run out. When somebody says he knows somebody with a new fangled flying car they know their time has passed and the new world is not for them. The film is all about the value of a man's loyalty to his companions. If you find it hard to like a person you ride with your nothing more than an animal because at the end of the day all they have is the loyalty toward each other. The try to rescue one of their Mexican comrades but it just goes to show that those who live by the gun die by the gun.

		<shortDescription>Violent and old fashioned, but still a good work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch certainly lives the hype of being the most violent western film ever. It really does. It makes any film in the genre looks like a Disney film in comparison. Being said, I don't liked the overall direction of this film. Sure, the story was very well told, it looks like a Distopyc sage that ends with an unpredictable satire of the 'system' in general. I also thought it was some kind of satire to the westerns in general, in some deep level. But I don't know. There is some pointless moments in the film, I admit is a bit difficult to stay focused on it. Don't get me wrong, I love slow paced films, I actually dig films who makes every single shot last forever, but it needs a purpose to do so. And in this film there is really no point for such thing. Firstly because they(e.g the train scene is way too long, the 'feast scenes are also way too long) add nothing to the film, I mean, this film would perfect with a few minutes less. I actually liked the editing on the massacre sequences, the scenes got pretty dynamic and actually much better than what it would be if using a generic scene transition... yeah. For me, it totally worked.I frankly don't have a word about the acting or cinematography. Do I? Well, if anything, I think that William Holden was pretty convincing as the bunch leader. The sets in the film were also very good, but the camera work is so...lame and cheesy. The zoom in and out were so amateur, and the texture of the video is typical from a late 60s- 70s film. In other words, bad. The music is good, but it sounds familiar with the magnificent seven(1960) score. Maybe I am just crazy, but I thought the music on both films are extremely similar.Anyway, I think it's a worth experience. Is arguable one of the best American westerns that i've ever seen, and is certainly an unique film in it's own way. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of the Uncut Version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960's has been heralded as the golden decade of western films, but by 1969 it was clearly evident that westerns were a dying breed. Then this film, the Wild Bunch was released. Going against cinema ethic values at the time, this film has became known for it's portrayal of violence. This film is indeed very violent and it even rivals today's films in amount of violence. But for this longer, uncut version, there have been several quiet scenes added and that adds for a greater, in-depth story of the leader of the Wild Bunch, Pike.Sam Peckinpah's film is almost like any other western thanks to the controversial amount of violence. This film also shows the theme of how evolving technology and modernity can change ones' lives. This film is about an aging group of outlaws who have just finished their last score before retirement. Before they can do so, one of their own was kidnapped by some Mexicans and despite knowing it may be a suicide attempt, the gang decides to possibly give their last hurrah rescuing their mate.This film is full of wonderful actors but the three main actors are why this film works. William Holden is perfectly cast as Pike and he effectively carries out this role with ease. His best mate Dutch, was played by Ernest Borgnine and he does great in this role. However, Robert Ryan steals the show of the former gang member turned bounty hunter. Every actor in this movie seems perfectly cast and unlike most movies, I have no qualm against anybody here.Overall, this is a crafty and rather risky western especially for the time period. Now, I am not a big fan of older westerns on a whole, but this film is better than most. It's certainly a little bit outdated, but it still features gorgeous camera work, a good script, a great score, and plenty of action. The opening and the finale, as well as the bridge scene, are all part of the greatest or I shall say relevant action scenes in cinema history. While not the best movie, it's certainly wants to be. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Born too late for their own times. Uncommonly significant for ours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1969, Sam Peckinpah's landmark western, The Wild Bunch, received critical acclaim and controversy throughout the nation. Some called it the best western ever made. Some trashed it because of its portrayal of graphic violence. The Wild Bunch tells the story of a group of outlaws, who are still living through the years of the American West. But, time is changing and the early 20th century is starting to take its toll on the American West. Pike Bishop, played William Holden, and his right-hand man, Dutch, played by Ernest Borgnine, and the rest of the gang, arrived in a small Texas town to rob a bank. While robbing the bank and holding the tellers and customers hostage, another outlaw group, headed by Deke Thornton, played by Robert Ryan, show up to ambush the Bunch. The attempt failed and the Bunch head to Mexico to pursue one last job. Once in Mexico, the Bunch start to work for a Mexican general, who wants them to rob an U.S. army train and supply his own regiment with the weapons they stole. Meanwhile, Ryan's gang of outlaws go after the Bunch when the local sheriff put a bounty on Holden's gang. The movie then turns around as the general betrays the Bunch when one of them is suspected of stealing the weapons. When one is left behind, the Bunch heroically walk into the Mexican village to get him. This leads to the most bloodiest, violent and brutally savage shootouts in movie history. The Wild Bunch tells its tale very well because it is based on morals. Normally, westerns tend to have a good guy and a bad guy. Not here. What you have here is two groups of outlaws, who kill and rob for a living and at the end of movie, the Bunch are the ones who are the heroes. Sam Peckinpah, who wrote and directed the movie, has a realistic vision of the dying West. This vision was something that we weren't familiar with. It is not a John Ford western, nor a John Wayne movie. It is nothing like that. As for the shootout at the end of the movie, I'll just say that it is well edited and well directed. It was shot in slow-motion and has shots of the camera, zooming into the shootout. The Wild Bunch is one of the best films of 1969. It also one of the best westerns ever made. An true classic. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No more heroes any more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gang of outlaws fail to rob a bank resulting in a bloodbath. They subsequently take on a job to steal a shipment of guns from a US Army train for a renegade Mexican general. Meanwhile the railroad has sent one of their ex members and a group of bounty hunters after them. It all ends in a blizzard of bullets.The Wild Bunch is about a group of men at the end of their road. Men out of time in a changing world full of new technology, some of which is deadly. They have the choice of slowly fading away or going out with a final bang. They choose the latter.With an excellent cast that includes William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan and Warren Oates, The Wild Bunch is a revisionist western that brutally dismantles the myths of the old west. Gone are the moral certainties of westerns of old and in their place is a cynicism and clouded morality. Like other late 60's counter-culture films such as Easy Rider and Bonnie and Clyde, it ends with the destruction of its protagonists. This wasn't a time for heroes. The times were a-changin' and this was reflected in the movie where the negative feelings surrounding America's involvement in the Vietnam War and the nihilism in the air were mirrored on screen.The film begins with a scene where children laugh as two scorpions helplessly fight against a swarm of ants who slowly and inevitably wear them down. The ending of the film mirrors this scene where the gunfighters are ultimately destroyed by the sheer numbers of lesser opponents. They find themselves in this position in the first place of course because they can see no other acceptable alternative. Their suicide mission is a final act of honour before their unavoidable destruction. They represent the death of something that can never return. In cinematic terms The Wild Bunch was in many ways the end of the western itself. After it, not so many were made. There was nowhere really to go after this. It would be impossible to go back to the old myths, while the alternative as shown here was utter destruction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was released in the same year as Midnight Cowboy, True Grit, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. While the rodeo walked away with Best Picture and two other Oscars, the absconding duo of Butch and Sundance grabbed 4 Oscars. The man who is an archetypal Western film lead actor won the long-due Oscar. However, it was 'The Wild Bunch' that drew the attention of critics and movie-goers.The movie is a landmark in Photography. The violence is intense even by today's standards and the scenes are brilliantly shot and edited in slow-motion giving a surreal effect. The movie is unlike previous western films that had little talking and less firing.The movie has symbolically shown how the West and the genre Western dwindled at an equal pace.With the emergence of arms and ammunition the West is no longer a place for bounty hunters. Gunslingers are umpteen in number and every plebeian has knowledge of arms and ammunition.Holden and his men are all set to rob a bank in a town. Their plan is thwarted by the outlaws of the town hired to wipe out the bank robbers. Holden spots his old crony Thornton in the other gang. They flee the town and realize their efforts were in vain. They ride to Mexico and are offered a handsome bounty for finishing a task for the local general. They succeed. They are, however, stalked by the other bunch who follow their tracks. Pike's men refuse to give up one of their men to the Mexicans and involve in a encounter, only to die.A movie worth the time and accolades.</fullReview>

I was fond of John Wayne's but they seemed to be rather similar to each other; he was the stoic, privately heartsick (for one reason or another) loner, I loved Clint's but same thing: too similar, he was an indestructible one-man army. I've watched many that were great. Acting, plot, cinematography etc. But the "Wild Bunch" just stuck out. Everything I've wanted to say about the movie, I see, has already been said here on IMDb. BTW, after getting rid of Mapache when everyone froze they couldn't just have walked away. I think Pike killed the German general because deep down he had an innate decency or morality and viewed the general as not only as his enemy but, more importantly, his country's enemy. As I've said before and, have also read in places here, the opening shootout would have been the climax to most (if not all) any other Western ever made. R.I.P. Ernie.From Dennis/Kim</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing I can add to other reviews other than to say this is one of the greatest and innovative movies of all time with possibly the greatest opening sequence ever.Yes is is brutally violent but it displayed violence as happened in real life and remember the Vietnam war was in full swing. The 'bang, bang your dead' nonsense of John Wayne movies was truly put to bed, and Peckinpah set the tone for many gritty and realistic movies that followed, in all genre.The only small fault I have with this is that it lags a bit in the middle, and maybe could have been shortened, but Peckinpah may have wanted to emphasise the male bonding stuff and to show there can be honesty and loyalty even amongst thieves.The casting is superb with the irony of course that many of the actors mirror in their own careers the inevitable decline of the bunch itself.Pikes 'If they move, kill em' line is right up there with 'At my signal, unleash hell', from Gladiator, and 'I have oodles of time' from Silence of the Lambs, as the best delivery in cinema.For serious collectors of cinema history, The Wild Bunch is a 'must have'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild indeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I should first mention that this movie wasn't the classic I expected it to be but I guess it just got a bit over-hyped to me, also by myself. This is a movie I have always wanted to see, for years now. I finally did so yesterday and was being left sort of disappointed that I wasn't as taken and in love with this movie as I expected to be. Having said that, it's of course far from a bad or disappointing movie itself! I guess I was just simply expecting a different kind of movie. I expected something more dramatic and heartfelt but as it turned out, the movie is more straight-forward and formulaic for a western, all in the best sense of the word.It's indeed a movie about the closure of the wild west era and a bunch of aging outlaws coming to terms with this. They decide to do one more big score together, for the last time, which of course however gets them in a whole lot of trouble. It's however not a movie that also marks the end of a genre. The classic western genre was indeed nearing its end at the time but it continued to exists, pretty much till the early '70's. This is not a movie that looks back on the genre and pays tribute to the classics and all of its usual clichs and typical genre ingredients.No, it's simply being a good old fashioned western, on its own. It comes down to it that this is a typical men film. Tough guys, doing what they think is right and sticking together, no matter what. It are all themes that speak out to men all over the world, which also makes it easy for them to relate with its characters and all of their actions, as well as motivations.This all gets combined with an heavy, raw and violent Peckinpah style, which means you can expect plenty of shootouts and see plenty of people getting gunned down, violently. The movie really isn't holding back, which also results into one of the most memorable, action filled and violent final shootouts, you will ever see in any film.It's a movie that pretty much got done in an old fashioned genre style but still with a bit more kick into it as well. It above all things remains an action movie, that is fast paced and features lots of quick editing techniques in it. It also makes this movie perfectly watchable for those who normally aren't really into the old fashioned sort of spaghetti westerns, of the '60's.And it still also really remains a movie about its characters and actors portraying them. I especially liked William Holden and thought it also was kind of funny to see Ernest Borgnine playing an old, aging outlaw, while now, almost 50 years later, he still is alive and playing in movies, at the age of 95. He probably could still appear in this movie and play the same role, if it got made tomorrow.I really liked it! Just wasn't as wild about it and in love with it as I expected to be.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" is more than just a western - it's a film about loyalty, trust, and knowing when to let go. The film follows a group of outlaws making their mark on the Texas/Mexican border, but greed, pride, and envy constantly put the bunch to the test. The film is violent, vulgar, and yet strangely heartfelt. Although, if it weren't for the strong performances, the film would fall flat as mere "shock" entertainment.The leader of the gang, played excellently by William Holden, is an aging gunman past his prime, struggling to mount his horse and still remain in control of the group. Ernest Borgnine is his second-in-command and keeps Holden's character in check. The rest of the cast delivers solid performances as well, especially Jaime Snchez as Angel, who picks up his own subplot and ultimately becomes the focal point of the story in a rousing climactic shootout.This is not John Ford's Old West; it is filthy, cruel, and bloody. There is plenty of swearing, nudity, and gunshot-gore to please today's younger audiences. It's an exciting and enthralling viewing experience not often found in the westerns of old (save Sergio Leone's masterpieces), and certainly stands the test of time. Of course, what was controversial then is now common-place, but still a bit shocking in terms of the amount of squibs that must have been used.This was my third attempt at watching the film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it this run. In the past, I never seemed to be able to get passed the 30-minute mark; perhaps I was too young. Overall, though, the Wild Bunch is an above average action film with many themes about friendship, the ghosts of our pasts, and the inevitable end of the line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Pretty Wild After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A once deliberate attempt to titillate it's audience with the once taboo combination of graphic, bloody violence, dangerously amoral protagonists, and a dash of nudity is now pretty much standard and not quite as shocking as it once was. Still, it's a first-rate, well-told action picture that holds up surprisingly well against the slew of contemporary films it undoubtedly influenced.Building on the familiar Sam Peckinpah theme, previously explored in Ride The High Country, of alienated old men in a changing times, this takes place farther along in the evolution of the west and the men are even more desperate. It also seems like this is Peckinpah's answer to the Italian westerns that were popular at the time.Lots of memorable scenes and moments include the opening sequence, Bo Hopkins taunting of his hostages, sticking his tongue in the ear of an older woman, the train robbery, it's aftermath involving Robert Ryan and company standing in the middle of an exploding bridge, and finally the climax and it's aftermath, with Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones bursting through the gates like two boys on Christmas morning, disturbing the other buzzards as they gleefully run to pick the bodies clean.For me, it's odd to see Edmond O'Brien as a whiskey-soaked old coot with tobacco-juice dripping from his mouth into his stained beard. In my mind's eye, he's always that tough but clean-cut guy from scores of film-noirs and gangster flicks of the 1940's and 1950's. He sure looks rough here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A group of fine men- directed by Sam Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the year 1913.Pike Bishop is the leader of the outlaws.In the beginning we see these men robbing a Texan bank.That robbery goes wrong.Now they are forced to flee to Mexico with Pike's ex-partner Deke Thornton behind them.There the gang agrees to steal a shipment of guns for General "Mapache" Juerta.Then these evil men capture Angel, the Mexican member of Pike's team.Their mission now is to get him back.The Wild Bunch (1969) is the movie people remember Sam Peckinpah from.That man really knew the west.Peckinpah, more than once, portrayed the dying of the old west.In his westerns, such as this one, we would see automobiles.And we see this group of men on horses, men who know the way of the west.They don't know of any other way and they are slowly becoming a group of outsiders.Alongside Sam the movie was written by Walon Green and Roy N. Sickner.What a group of fine men are seen in this movie.William Holden, what a great guy to play Pike.Ernest Borgine, who's still going on strong at 91 and is aiming for at least 200 movie roles, gives a top notch performance as Dutch Engstrom.Edmond O'Brien, who was made to look like an oldtimer, is amazing as Freddie Sykes.Warren Oates does a terrific job as Lyle Gorch.Ben Johnson is brilliant as Tector Gorch.Jaime Snchez is great as Angel.Robert Ryan plays the part of Deke Thornton and he does it real good.The villain of the story, Gen Mapache is brilliantly played by Emilio Fernndez.Alos great performances are given by people such as Strother Martin (Coffer), L.Q. Jones (T.C.), Albert Dekker (Pat Harrigan), Bo Hoskins (Clarence 'Crazy' Lee) and Dub Taylor (Rev.Wainscoat).The film was made 40 years ago.The years have done no harm to the movie.The movie contains a lot of violence.In the ending we see this huge bloodbath.It's pretty amazing to watch these men walking with their rifles while the Mexicans are singing a Mexican song.And the shooting begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Horrible People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A previous poster said that this film was pointless and simply was about whoring outlaws that murdered without remorse. Another poster admonished this person as having completely missed the point of the movie.First, this film is a technical and emotional masterpiece about the end of an era where heartless killers like Pike and Dutch roamed the West. Make no mistake, this film IS about soulless killers finding their existence threatened by the march of civilization. These men had no code of honor nor any moral qualms about killing. The only remorse these men have is when they realize how amoral they really are.This film, as John Wayne said, destroys the myth of the old West. It was not a place where men in white hats deal justice to men in black hats, where lawmen and lawbreakers use guns to reconcile differing social mores. It was a place of every man for himself, and in such places, men like Pike and Dutch go largely unmolested. Until they take on the Mexican army, and nearly win.In short, yes its a masterpiece, and yes, like the men it portrays, this film is savage and pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WILD BUNCH is a movie that transcends it's controversial release and initial critical and public attacks and in light of the violence that we often see on our streets today becomes a more potent statement of age and change.Is the world becoming a necessarily more violent place, or are there elements at work in it meaning to make it the way it should be? Are violent-at-heart individuals a product of their context or do they become so through their experiences? The band of renegade soldiers, led by ageing veteran Pike Bishop (William Holden) show dignity even in violence, but things to get hairy during a gigantic shoot-out and botched up stand-off whilst robbing a bank. Bystanders are shot and all hell break loose against the pursuers trying to claim credit for wrongful shootings. The robbery proves futile, as they have merely stolen bags of washers. Bishop decides to consider disbanding the gang, called 'The Wild Bunch', but also reminds his cohorts that there should be loyalty. They head off to Mexico for wine, women and song and are cajoled into robbing a train with weapons that revolutionaries are in need of using, but their sense of time catching up them and the net closing in them from the USA leads to the inevitable...THE WILD BUNCH has the look of earlier Westerns with a late 60's attitude to violence that some were probably not ready for at that time. As time goes on, the film becomes less violent by today's standards when film-makers have the desire to push the envelope that much further. What would Peckinpah make of today's epics like HOSTEL and ICHI THE KILLER is anybody's guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah is the fanatical director.This is the closing period of the old west. The days of the individual are numbered. The gunfight would become irrelevant.Now, conflict would be between armies and corporations. The machine gun and grenades foretell a new century of unsurpassed ferocity and slaughter.The survivors of the gang are hunted. In Mexico, these violent men choose a day to die. Four gunslingers against two hundred soldiers. And, it is a bloody and spectacular end.The romantic element consists of the fellowship of the bandits. It goes beyond an impersonal code (Pike and Dutch don't agree on what the code should be). It is an emotional bond and obligation."We're not gonna get rid of anybody. We're gonna stick together, just like it used to be. When you side with a man, you stay with him. And if you can't do that, you're like some animal, you're finished. We're finished. All of us." Pike These elements would become influential for later filmmakers, including some from Hong Kong. Contrast with the fratricides in Goodfella. Compare with the self-sufficiency of Shane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch are a great group of hard-drinking and whoring guys out on one last job! No loyalty to any nations or creed, they are still able to find some honor and live by a code of loyalty and camaraderie. Approaching an epic length (about 2 1/2 hours), it never seems long. Beautiful and grand scenery (I suggest watching on a big wide screen) and plenty of action and some brutal gunfire. This movie has important themes but never escapes a light-hearted tone. Definitely one of the late classics of the western genre. Its setting is far later than most westerns, approaching 20th century, and we see the effects of the industry pushing themselves into the west. This is up there with one of my favorite westerns and I love the characters, and the ending is particularly satisfying but there were a few character and angles I would have liked to have seen developed more. But I wouldn't want to compromise the movie's charm with such changes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most controversial movies and revolutionary movies ever. This movie is full of things never seen on screen. For example - in the first scene where you see the bunch ride down the railroad and they freeze the picture - totally new. Although most people would notice they battle afterwards more since it was the most violent scene ever made when this movie was released (and might still be).The plot is very good and you can really feel the characters desperation, which of course brings me to another thing - acting. The cast in this movie is brilliant - I personally like William Holden and Ernest Borgnine best but they are all good. The editing is brilliant which of course is seen in the amasing gun battles. The only downside of this movie (and a good sign of Peckinpahs presence) is the woman's role in the movie. Peckinpah is known for only giving women bad roles in his movies which kind of goes hand in hand with westerns. Despite this fact I can't say anything but that this movie is masterpiece. If you haven't seen it - You should!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dusty Western Noir in the Bright Sunshine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the sunset of both his career and the western age Pike sets out with his band of scoundrels to commit 'one last job'. A story cliche worked to death but needed to tell this tale. With bloody fervor Peckinpah lines em up and mows them down this what seems to be by numbers outlaw movie, ah but there is a twist....While Pike struggles with trying to remain in charge and make the best decisions, he is shown as a conflicted and flawed leader with only flashes of morality. Ready to die, he gambles with his life and the other's for the 'last' big score. The problem is, you can tell that his overall goals are aimless. He's the mastermind with no plans beyond the next move. A problem that will haunt him. What doesn't end in a spiral ends in a bright bloody flash of glory, this film needs to be seen to be believed.The film contains one of the bloodiest battle of the modern film age and is worth viewing for just that reason. The pacing is not perfect but it's serviceable. A few points and character actions are unnecessary but add to the sprawling nature of the film. The acting is top shelf and the action is pitch perfect. Humorous exchanges, sharp dialog and bright action keep the film from slipping into dusty noir. William Holden and Ernest Borgnine are perfect in this film. This film is an example of Borgnine's gritty charisma that would later make him one of the baddest of the bad film villains. (Emperor of the North Pole)This is a dark western with muddled morality in the bright sunshine. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You didn't mess around with Sam Peckinpah when he was making a picture. As Charlton Heston once said, "When you saw the rage in his eye, you ran for the dressing rooms (or at least tried to get a bottle)." Such devotion to mankind's greatest bonds is what made this filmmaker burn at the edges. If you watch the picture, you will see an array of splattered bodies and corpses falling in slow motion. Pieces of the craft that Tarantino and Woo have obviously used in their careers. Unfortunately, where modern directors can emulate Peckinpah's style, they cannot maintain his substance. THE WILD BUNCH represents a magic era in the making of movies. When loyalty mattered most and studio executives weren't plagued by blood and guts; a good time was a good time and whiskey wasn't just a cocktail, it was the first thing you had in the morning. To all those that love Ol Sammy, see you at the Alamo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed The Wild Bunch. A very different sort of western. It takes place in the very early 20th century, when technology and society is progressing and the West is losing its "Wild." It revolves around a group of men still trying to make it as traditional western outlaws. The times are different. There are cars, planes, and other modernizations in this world. The cowboys are armed with old '97 pump-action shotguns, semiautomatic pistols, and even a machinegun near the end instead of the traditional cowboy weapons. It's way more gory and violent than your average western and the combat is much more realistic, it's messy, it's rough, and it isn't noble. Nobody in this film is a John Wayne-like hero. They're tough sons of bitches that will not hesitate to shoot anyone that gets in their way or even use a woman as a human shield. It's kind of like the Magnificent Seven with all the glory and goodness taken out of it. The final battle, by the way, is awesome. Those crazy mothers take on pretty much every son of a bitch in Mexico.A very good take on the western genre, and a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern action starts here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Bonnie and Clyde the Wild Bunch is the first modern action picture. It is one of the first movies to show that when someone gets shot, bad stuff happens, they don't just hold their stomach and keel over. The last shoot out is perhaps the most influential gun sceen in the history of cinema. It's hard for me to believe that this movie was made in 1969, because there is simple nothing else like it, in terms of action or westerns. Along with B&amp;C it pioneered the slow motion gun fight. It also is the first movie in which there was the use of unlimited ammo, which is now seen in almost every action movie with guns. The story is also really good. It is a lot different from other westerns, in which it is clear who is good, who is bad, and who is ugly (pun intended). In this movie everyone is ugly (that's for sure) and maybe everyone is bad? It has a strong message about the passage of violence from one generation to the next, and shows how people are trapped in the paths they have chosen for themselves. There is no riding off happy into the sunset in this movie, just one of the best shootouts ever filmed. A MUST SEE for people interested in action movies or westerns. Zoopansick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be my all time favorite western, and possibly #1! "The Wild Bunch" is not just all about the violence. Just like Quentin Tarrintino's films (there is homage paid to this movie when the theme begins on "Pulp Fiction"), there are themes to this film. Redemption is just one of them. The protagonist, Pike Bishop, is the prime example of some one who tries to get it. All performances are excellent. William Holden is excellent as Bishop and Robert Ryan has probably his best performance as his former partner. Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Edmond O'Brien, Jaimie Sanchez, and Ben Johnson are great as the outlaws Bishop leads. Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones are also great as a comic duel as the bounty hunters. Sam Peckinpah should have been nominated for his directing and his writing he did with Walon Green. Excellent editing, musical score, and sound. This is a must see for those who love the Western genre and the anti hero movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You probably know that this is a great film. You probably know it is a very (by 1969 standards) violent film. I can't add a great deal to what has already been said, but I will say this: "The Wild Bunch" is the seminal testament to the dying West, and stands alongside "Monte Walsh" as the two or three best efforts to capture the deep sense of loss we still feel when contemplating the closing of the frontier and the death of the free, wild country west of the Mississippi. Yes, it's about villains shooting one another. But look past that, and see what is really being said. Hard, brave men are hunted down by morons and incompetents and, just like when the scorpion dies when it's consumed by ants at the beginning of the film, the end is tragic and inevitable. As the great western artist Charles Russell said on the closing of the American frontier and the end of the open, free west: "The West is gone! Bid her farewell! You may lose a sweetheart, but you won't forget her!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that has so influenced everything that has come since, when you see it you might not recognize how groundbreaking it was. It's not just that the bad guys get shot and fall down in slow motion. It's not just that Holden and Borgnine and Oates and Ryan give some of the best performances of the great careers. It's all those things and a lot more, the celebration of the anti-hero, the bizarre balance of comic relief with pure horror, and an unblinking look at a moment in time when everything had just changed forever, through the eyes of men who had seen it all and done it all and decide to go out with one hell of a bang, because It's the Right Thing To Do. The best moments come at the end: When the Bunch assembles for one last walk into the shadow, and all the fissures and disagreements fall aside as they recognize their common destiny and rise to stand together; when Bill Holden fires 300 bullets from the Gatling Gun and kills 320 guys, when the Bunch finds itself at the center of 2 million armed soldiers and not one person knows what the hell to do for a minute (except for Ernest Borgnine, who drinks it all in and laughs his ass off), and when Robert Ryan finally lets us all see what he has known for the last hour of the picture, and what he has been waiting for. See it, buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action-packed western that was quite ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah went to the extreme with violence in his action-Western hybrid THE WILD BUNCH. The late 60's only had a handful of violent action flix not unlike this one (others include BULLITT, COOGAN'S BLUFF, and BONNIE AND CLYDE), and audiences and critics alike weren't quite ready for relentless action. Sounds quite primitive to people of this generation, but THE WILD BUNCH made a big contribution to the new wave of thriller movies that paved the way for even bigger additions later on. THE WILD BUNCH concerns a ragtag gang of aging crooks (led by William Holden and Ernest Borgnine) who find it hard to accept the changing times as the Old West suddenly became the New West, filled with automatic machine guns and cars rather than scatter-types and horses. The gang, looking to acheive another score, have to learn to accept the changes as the take up an offer to steal guns for some Mexican revolutions. At the same time, they try to stay one step ahead of a former member of their faction (Robert Ryan).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning of this movie you are sucked into a world that is at once both familiar and totally original. If you think you've seen westerns but you've never seen this one, than you haven't seen anything. Sam Peckinpah's daring use of slow motion camera shots and his careful direction of action sequences added so much to the art of filmmaking it would be difficult to picture what nearly all action movies that have come out since would have been like without this movie having been made.WIlliam holden's performance of the character of "Pike" is stunning. Ernest borgnine is perfect for the movie. There isn't a weak actor in the whole of the movie. But I think what is most striking about the film is that it doesn't pussyfoot it's way around anything. It tells you exactly who these characters are. The script dynamically portrays the dark side of humanity and yet you truly sympathize with these characters. In fact it is the "good" guys (the posse) who you end up hating in the end of this movie. As they fight over the bodies of the "bad" guys (william holden's bunch), you feel compassion towards the fallen thieves lives. You wished things could've been different, and indeed the characters in the movie cease to be characters but rather historical figures that seem to have been the plot of something they could not comprehend themselves. I give this movie the highest recomendation. Anyone who likes westerns should see this movie, and anyone who likes movies should watch this movie dilligently. Sam peckinpah was awesome and this is the proof.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody and Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" was a true product of the late 60's. It was in the late 1960's the production codes started to dissolve and filmmakers really started to experiment with sexuality, language, and violence. "The Wild Bunch" falls into the latter- and it's one of the best movies ever made (and the last great western).The violence of "The Wild Bunch" is bloody, brutal, and unrelenting.It is its presentation that is unique. Violence shown in slow motion was first used on "Bonnie &amp; Clyde" but "The Wild Bunch" takes that and multiplies it exponentially. Its influence can be felt today however, in the works of John Woo, "Reservoir Dogs", "The Matrix", and "Saving Private Ryan".The story take place in the early 20th century with the old west meeting its death. A group of outlaws plan one last score. Through that their loyalty, integrity, and friendships are tested. That's all I'll let you in on.The casting is Brilliant. Older, grizzled, actors play the Wild Bunch. William Holden looks like he's been through hell and back. There is one scene he rides away from the camera on a horse. The story goes that Peckinpah was heard to say "look at that back- it's a tired back!". Ernest Borgnine shows his skills in one of last great roles. I get the feeling that if "The Wild Bunch" was made today, it would star young, cool, pretty boys (along with obligatory love interests).There is one other part of "The Wild Bunch" that was inspiring- the opening credits. Opening credits today are well- non existent. Flash the title and jump into the movie. Opening credits can be to a movie what an Overture is to an opera. "The Wild Bunch" knows this. Each credit at the opening paints a picture. Sometimes it's a picture of beauty, sometimes it's a picture of death but it sets up wonderfully the main theme of the movie: a loss of innocence and entrance into a bloody violent world.One last thing- "The Wild Bunch" proves once again what I call the "Gatling Gun rule" (any movie with a Gatling gun can't be all bad).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE best western?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it was released. WOW! I'd never seen anything like it. It was easily the most bloody film I'd ever seen at that time. Only Peckinpah could make bloody shootouts a 'dance'. This film runs close to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly as my favorite. They are two different story-line/types, but both are exceptionally good. One begins to sympathize with the Wild Bunch, and with Robert Ryan, who reluctantly pursues them. They are riding the caboose on a train of 'what-was'. The west is changing, and there is no place for them in the new version. The final scene, the battle, is the best I've seen outside of 'Cross of Iron'. Being a Peckinpah fan biases me, but, so be it. As for Peckinpah's treatment of women; I imagine the film's depiction of women was pretty accurate, given the story line and the circumstances. These were ruthless outlaws, and the only use they had for women was in a 'soliciting' capacity and to cook. Sorry, ladies, that's the way women fit in to this film. It is entirely too politically correct to portray them any differently in THIS movie. If you want non-stop action, and are not too gender-sensitive, this is the movie for you. Who cares what Peckinpah thought of women? He made damn good movies, and this is one of his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many great westerns, such as "High Noon", "The Searchers", and "Shane", but this movie ranks up to the top alongside Howard Hawks' "Red River" (1948). It has a level of realism that most westerns lack tremendously. The wild west was just like it says..."wild". There was nothing "pretty" about it at all when you consider that the United States went through a major civil war during the 1800s. I loved the character study with this movie. It should have won a ton of Oscars, but as everyone knows, it went through a ton of criticism over its treatment of violence. Only three years later, Francis Coppola would create "The Godfather" with a level of violence comparable to this movie. I almost felt that I was watching a variation on "The Godfather" because, in that movie, Coppola let the audience eavesdrop into the lives of a crime family. Sam Peckinpah is doing the same here. This is a movie that will stand the test of time forever. Its message is clear - all humans are equally capable of being good as well as violent. Score: 10+ (out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>brilliant action scenes, specially the train scene where the camera is vibrating as to express motion of the train. Nice shots from below of Angel as he walks between two cars. Does remind a little of Sergio Leone virtuosity with the camera, but the story contents does not. While Leone's movies never or very seldomly use women as part of the story's fabric, this one does. In Leone's movies, men fight for the honor by other men, or for money, but not for a woman. And seldom there are women in the story. In this movie, there are plenty of women, but they are delegated to a lower status, either as prostitutes or servants. And if they are too old, as care-giving mothers. Not a total break with Hollywoodism, such as the scene in which the men get drunk with the prostitutes in the wine cellars, with a traditional music fun theme, but nonetheless, the level of violence broke new ground for Hollywood westerns. By comparison of comparisons, if "Solaris" was the Soviet's answer to Kubrik's "2001 a Space Odyssey", "The Wild Bunch" was Hollywood's answer to Leone's spaghetti westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a unique study of violence and morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ranks along with "The Magnificent Seven" and "High Noon" as one of the finest westerns ever produced.Mankind's capacity for violence stands out as its main theme. Early in the film, a group of children torture a scorpion by placing it in a mound of angry ants, implying that violence lives inherently within us all, even the young. What distinguishes the good from the bad is not the purity of thought, rather the ability to resist action based on impure thought. Completely at odds with the philosophy of traditional westerns, "The Wild Bunch" gains its status as a revisionist western.Ironically, Pike and his men find redemption in a moment of utter human destruction, as they unleash a Gatlin gun on a group of Mexican soldiers who tortured one of their comrades. This scene, along with several subtle comparisons to the corruption of other supposed champions of justice (governments and business), reveals a depth lacking in other westerns. Highly valuable for both entertainment and contemplation. Wonderful use of sound, music, editing and photography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If any scene exemplifies this film's excellence, it is the prelude to the final shootout. Pike Bishop finishes with his Mexican muchacha, and the disgust on his face (over their betrayal of gang member Angel) is palpable. He stands in the doorway to the next room and looks at the Gorch brothers...and looks...and looks. Finally, he says, "Let's go." After a few seconds' pause, Warren Oates replies, "Why not." They walk outside, where Ernest Borgnine smiles and joins them to arm up. Not a word is spoken.This scene is a majestic demonstration of how far the art of film has fallen -- today's directors/screenwriters would have used a five minute soliloquy to explain the incredible depth of emotion, comraderie, and experience Peckinpah conveys with four words and a camera. They know they're going off to die for their friend, and for honor's sake. Wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peckinpah's classic western is considered a masterpiece by many, but time has dulled the sheen a tad. It's not the equal of Once Upon a Time in the West or The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. It doesn't have any scenes that pack the same kind of emotional punch. Mostly it is about epic displays of gun fire: many people in large spaces shooting each other and dying.Plot details are lost in the fracas. Why did Pike leave the young man behind at the beginning of the movie? If he did it deliberately, why did he even bring him along in the first place?I also missed seeing Pike die in the end.It is unquestionably very well made, and perfectly cast.

The direction that was made by Sam Peckinpah was simply magnificent. And also I liked a lot the interpretation of William Holden who played as Pike Bishop and he was very good at it. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Ernest Borgnine's who played as Dutch Engstrom.Finally I believe that "The Wild Bunch" is a must see movie for everyone but especially for the western movie fans because it represents the end of an era.

		<fullReview>The Sam Peckinpah classic that effectively changed the way westerns, and action movies, were made. Set the trend for graphic (but necessary for the plot) violence and gritty, edgy story lines. Also one of the first movies to blur the lines between good guys and bad guys - which was which? Were there any good guys?You can see the influence of this movie in much of the work of many modern-day directors, especially Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.Great direction by Sam Peckinpah. The opening and closing action scenes are among the greatest action sequences in cinematic history.Good performance by William Holden plus decent support from a host of actors.Not perfect though. Plot is not entirely watertight. Some scenes seem unnecessary and the movie loses focus from time to time. Production values are a bit lacking at times, making the movie feel rough around the edges. Some of this helps, giving the movie a gritty, unpolished feel. However, some degree of polish is required, I feel.Still, every bit the classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...death. That's the moral of Sam Peckinpah's classic 1969 Western about a group of aging and meandering outlaws who ride into Mexico in 1913 to flee a posse led by a former member, Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan). The outlaws, led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), eventually take refuge with a Mexican "general" and his hundreds of soldiers. When the Mexican member of the gang, Angel, is taken captive by the general for his revolutionary interests the rest of the gang have to decide whether to ignore it or make a bold stand.The Director's Cut of "The Wild Bunch" (1969) runs 145 minutes and features a great opening shootout and an outstanding closing shootout, a catharsis of blood; in the middle is a compelling train robbery. The material in between these three sequences isn't all that engrossing due to the fact that the characters aren't noble, likable or even redeemable, which is the film's weakness. I get the pessimistic message, but it doesn't change the fact that practically every character is an immoral or amoral dirtbag.Speaking of which, Deke Thornton has the audacity to repeatedly call the members of his posse "gutter trash" and the like. Well, what is he? A freed-on-condition prisoner who was once a member of the very outlaw scum he's chasing. At least the posse members -- lowlifes that they are -- are on the right side of the law. What hypocrisy.As noted above, a lot of dialogue and drama is devoted to character development, but who cares about a bunch of criminal scumbags? How can you devote "character development" to people who have no character? That's the problem with the film.That said, if you can accept the de-glorification of the Old West and the unlikable characters, "The Wild Bunch" is a solid Western with three thrilling sequences, including the unforgettable ending. There's a good message about the boldness of taking a stand and sticking by one's comrades, but that's the extent of the depth.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the dying days of the old west...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is unlike most westerns, there is nothing glamorous about the protagonists, they are just an ageing bunch of outlaws who have outlived their time. In 1913 the old wild west is rapidly being tamed and there is no place left for men like them.The film opens with a group of US soldiers entering a town in Texas and going to the railroad office and robbing it. As they leave they are ambushed by bounty hunters employed by the railroad. In the ensuing shoot out members of both sides are killed along with several townsfolk who were taking part in a parade at the time. The surviving gang members flee the town and are shocked when they find that they have just stolen bags filled with washers instead of the money they thought they could retire on. Their leader Pike takes them to Mexico, pursued by former friend Deke Thornton. They plan to lay low for a while however when there they meet Gen. Mapache who has wronged Angel, one of their group, by seducing the girl he loves. Angel shoots the girl dead and a confrontation ensues. Luckily for them it doesn't escalate and the gang are asked to steal a shipment of guns from the US Army. They do this but when they come to be paid the general seizes Angel which leads to one of the most famous battles in cinema history.The top quality acting and Peckinpah's direction make this one of the great westerns, don't expect wholesome heroes and dastardly villains, almost all of the protagonists are in it for themselves, they are quite happy to hide behind women when the shooting starts. Also don't expected people to fall to the grounds without bleeding when shot, blood spurts as bullets rip into people in slow motion. If you are a fan of westerns or classic cinema in general then this film is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Western made in an existential crisis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this is a very good Western indeed, and though probably not in the top 10 of the best, it is probably one of the most important for the genre. Wayne was right when he said that this ruined the myth of the old west; it updated the Western into a modern context. Whereas in the 50s we all had this idea of morally upright characters, just battles, and indomitable wills, the late 60s was a time in which the Vietnam war had shattered America, and the Western world, to the core. After the seemingly just victory over Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, there was a sense of justice in the world, helped by the fact that the coverage of the war came through propaganda films. In Vietnam the war was wholly politically, and by the late 60s the world had seen how brutal war really is through television footage, and how morally bankrupt it was. The world was thrown back into an existential crisis which stripped away all of our feelings about the way the world is, and our mythos for how the world was. And thus we have the Wild Bunch. At the start we feel that good will be done as Ernest Borgnine and William Holden, traditional heroes of cinema, ride forward in army gear. We expect them to bring order to a lawless town. Instead they rob a bank in one of the most bloody sequences in cinema. In this movie there are no good guys. The Mexican army are bad, the Wild Bunch are bad, and "the law", the railroad companies, are bad. In the middle are two guys, Holden and Ryan, trying to make sense of all this. In this way I think the characters and the story are very interesting, and well thought out. But this is the WILD west, not Wayne's good 'ol West, where men were men, women were kept quiet, and homosexuals and non-white people were laughed out, or chased out of town. This movie showed not just that the West was violent, but that it was morally bankrupt. The only morals are what people made for themselves. Having said that the editing was not fantastic, and sometimes the directing was obvious and heavy-handed. But these points are easy looked over, as the action carries the story anyway. A brutal movie, but a great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often misrepresented as merely a violent movie, The Wild Bunch was years ahead of its time. It merged the developing sentiment of the anti-hero with a grit and realism now regularly seen in such movies as Saving Private Ryan. Those that state this is a gore film or that it is overly violent miss the point. It was not intended to glorify violence but to explode the Hollywood myth of the typical Western Hero, a living symbol of American culture. It upholds virtues of loyalty and determination and puts these virtues in men of suspect character. It shows the reality that all humans are capable of both greatness, yet equally capable of a great fall. The concept of unadaptable men in changing times that have passed them by is worth watching the movie. Yet, if you can take the time to see past the bloodshed, there are so many other layers of depth to be found in Sams movie. Sam takes the pro to-typical Western Hero, pulls out the virtues he holds as essential, disposes of the Hollywood crap, gives him some developing 1960's themes, and puts him to work in this movie. I highly recommend it, for whatever that is worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking at some of the comments written by people who didn't like"The Wild Bunch" you wonder what kind of western they do like,if any. This Western is far superior to any Sergio Leone Western mainly because these men are far closer to reality than the Man with No Name ever was. They are for better or for worse symbols of the American Dream. Ruthless in attaining it, unable to to pull away from the path they've decided on and too damn proud to face the fact that times are changing and they are no longer the young hellions of a now distant American Past. Jesse James and Billy the Kid were having sweet myths made up about them as just lovable farm and ranch hands done wrong by Easterners, particularly since they're thirty years dead. Pike and Co. are still on the trail, still predators. Pike and Dutch find it ironic when the villagers serenade them when in their own country they've gave a demonstration of what a real raid in the West meant: sudden terror and/or death and some poor slobs uninsured money stolen. Pike is determined above all to get this last thing done right. He's lost a friend Deke Thornton to his arrogance and the woman he loved to being in her house when hubby came back. Even his last moment with a woman is flawed when leaves cash for time that the senorita would have given up willingly in the hope that this hombre would be the one in her and her babys' life. But Pike is on a final mission he's not abandoning noone now as he had to to do Deke. Even if Angel dies on the way out he will be with his compadres. I believe in a Ford movie If Pike shot Mapache he would pass on the leadership to the second in command and ride out to surrender to Deke. Maybe in a Hawke or Walsh film he'd of went up against the Federales by himself. In either films the emphasis would of been on the lack of place for this epitome of the wide open wildness of the West. Cars, machine guns,mass slaughter, monopolies are the future, and these men the opposite of the ex-lawman Joel McCrae and Randy Scott played in "Ride the High Country"have no way or inclination to fit in.

No sympathy except at the end when the four are killed in a shoot out.It's dog eat dog and the group stick together not because they really like each but they have no other choice.

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's spiritual release on the male ethic according to him. It's great to see a powerful filmmaking personality speak his mind, particularly when it's as skillfully done as THE WILD BUNCH. This is pivotal, pictorially splendid genre filmmaking. Groundbreaking, and coming at a time in American filmmaking when it actually had like competition (in the form of films like THE GRADUATE, BONNIE AND CLYDE, FIVE EASY PIECES, MASH and ROSEMARY'S BABY). A great film that served as a prelude to Peckinpah's full-throttle psyche release, and ultimately his truer masterpiece, STRAW DOGS. THE WILD BUNCH is film art in one of it's purest forms, a Western right up there with THE SEARCHERS. All Hail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In an age of violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was the west ultra-violent, or did Sam Peckinpah only see it that way? The wild bunch is a highly formal movie with excessive violence. Peckinpah's original intent was to make a film that would "wake up" the a culture who grew up seeing the horror the vietnam war on TV. His fear that people were becoming desensitized to the violence that pervaded the late '60s. With the wild bunch, he attempted to break this growing trend. Peckinpah's use of the action montage and slow motion violence are derivatives of the films by Kurosawa (and ultimately Eisenstein). He saw what Kurisawa and Penn (in Bonny and Clyde) and been doing, was well aware of it, and wanted to exceed it to drive his message home. The violence, however, becomes too stylized, and too formal to be truly effective. Many who saw the film were shocked by the violence they saw portrayed, but many were also intrigued. For all of the exploding squibs, and slow motion shots of men falling off roofs, people saw how "cool" it could be. It would be somewhat like a contemporary audience seeing keanu reeves shoot up an office building at the end of the Matrix. Ultimately the loss of life, and horrible violence become secondary factors to the high stylization, and aesthetic qualities of the violence. Peckinpah's fascination with the body in motion, therefore, gets expressed to the audience and we're never really taken aback by what we see. The final battle scene is very fun to watch, it is energetic and exciting, but it is so far from any reality that the message of shocking violence can easily be lost.Nonetheless, the wild bunch is a good western. I've never really liked westerns, but the stylized violence makes it all the more intriguing as an audience member. It's a fun movie to watch. The photography is really remarkable, and there is a certain lyrical quality to it, though it doesn't really compare to Ford's masterpieces. The performances are well done, and the effects are dead on. Watching the film one can see where modern screen violence came from, the late great Peckinpah.If you like westerns and you like action films with screen violence that are really well photographed, check this one out. It does a lot of good things, and can be called the father of modern screen violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RATING: 10A truly revolutionary motion picture and an undisputed landmark in cinematic history, `The Wild Bunch' is often looked at as one of the first films to portray violence in an utterly vicious and realistic manner. It's a film that examines the very nature of violence in an immensely effective style. We observe hundreds of people being brutally ripped to shreds by bullets, but we are forced to ponder exactly what makes human beings capable of such intolerance and brutality.`The Wild Bunch' is a remarkably thought-provoking experience, but even if one dismisses its complexity, the film is still fascinating to watch. The movie successfully combines action, pathos, and humor to maintain the viewer's interest. Sam Peckinpah's direction is marvelous, the dialogue is intelligent, and the cinematography (particularly in widescreen format) is beautiful.The film's most memorable element, however, is the editing. The highly controversial battle sequences during the film's opening and climax have become justifiably famous for their rapid editing technique, which creates a relentlessly intense montage of fatalities and bloodletting. The train-robbery scene alone is a tour-de-force of editing, which is skillfully used to create suspense.This is an example of perfect filmmaking, in which the viewer is entertained, moved, thrilled, and left thinking. `The Wild Bunch' is, overall, an achievement of indescribable monumentality and artistic merit, making it one of cinema's crowning achievements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tense but absolutely entertaining thriller about a small tandem of aging outlaws who decide to make one final heist before retiring for good despite being sought after by desperate bounty hunters. How co-writer/director Sam Peckinpah could assemble such a star-studded cast (William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Edmund O'Brien, Jaime Snachez, etc.) for a movie like this is certainly beyond my imagination. Not only do the performances here make up this gem hold up, the story, Jerry Fielding's upbeat score, and Lucien Ballard's irriestible cimenatography also deserve some mention, too. The shootouts here standout alone as the best moments of Peckinpah's movie and he shows how to make the suspense worth watching. Besides this film, it's a terrible shame that there haven't been any great movies made in this genre. Well, Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" could be one exception. "The Wild Bunch" is a truly cinematic treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, pity about the sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with all the praise above and don't need to add to it.There are only two "buts" for me:But #1: I'd love to see a sound re-edit with more realistic gunshot effects inserted over the old-style "bang bang" stuff used here. One the same subject, some of the dialogue recording is awful quality.But #2: The flashback scene (where Pike's girlfriend is killed) is too blandly lit. It is so different to the rest of the film, it must have been an add-on. No wonder it was deleted from TV releases. I think it actually detracts from the film.All these criticisms are only because I love this film, and sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind.No-one had mentioned Edmond O'Brien's role of Sykes. Ed O'Brien was once a glamor boy of romantic films: handsome, debonair and manly. In this film he is a filty, tobacco-stained, foul-mouthed, publicly-defecating, grizzly old has-been.. yet it is to his character that the baton of fighting for a free Mexico is passed (along with Robert Ryan's Deke Thornton). O'Brien was almost physically unrecognizable in this film: a tribute to his professionalism and courage in taking the role. A brilliant performance.And can we remember his famous "They" soliloquoy? (when the Bunch discover that their robbery at the start of the film had yielded 8 bags of steel-washers). Someone says, "They tricked us". "Who's they?" questions someone else..O'Brien answers it (laughing and wheezing as he spits his reply):`They'?...... Why they's just plain-n'-fancy `They'. That's who `They' is... Caught ya, didn' they, uh? Tied a tin can to your tail, led'ya in and waltzed'ya right out again!....Oh MY!... whadda Bunch!...Big TOUGH ones, eh?...Here y'a with a handful o'holes, a slug up yer ass and a big grin to pass the time o'day with.`They'?...Who the HELL is... `They'?Brilliant, but fix those FX.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Western by the Last Great Western Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch came to theaters in 1969, a new era in motion picture history was born. It's not only my favorite film by my favorite director, but is also the second greatest film of all time(Citizen Kane is the best). It's in the top two of great films because every aspect that is crucial to the Cinema comes together to form a near perfect feature film. Second, this movie is filled with many scenes of absolute importance. Third, the innovations are seen throughout this flick, and the the way it is depicted is fresh.The only disgusting fact about this motion picture is it wasn't nominated or won at the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor(William Holden), Best Supporting Actor(Robert Ryan), and six or seven more categories. Although the violence by today's standards is tame, the way the violence is presented makes the images much more powerful then many of today's action films. The Wild Bunch(1969) deals with themes that Sam Peckinpah explored during his career in films like Ride The High Country(1962), The Ballad of Cable Hogue(1970), Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid(1973), Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia(1974), and Cross of Iron(1977). This movie expressed his knowledge of the late Wild West, and shows his identification with the Outlaws of the story for his was a Hollywood outlaw himself. The Wild Bunch(1969) is also about the passing of one generation who kill for honor to another generation who murders for fun and games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an Ending!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you don't grow up with movies of a certain generation it can be difficult and challenging to gain full appreciation for what they meant at their time when you happen to see them decades later. I grew up with movies of the eighties and found the transition of trying to watch movies from the decades of the seventies, sixties, and fifties increasingly more difficult the farther I went back. Sure there are going to be your Citizen Kanes, Taxi Drivers, and other great films that gleam brightly no matter what year they were born out of. But those movies are few and far between. In the continuation of this endless search for decade crossing films I came across The Wild Bunch. I have one word for you and that is an emphatic WOW!! I don't watch too many Westerns because many don't really turn my entertainment bug on but this movie never felt like a Western. From the first scene to the climatic last this movie packed as much punch, heart, and soul as any of today's ground breaking films. The gun fighting scenes were incredible. Nobody just standing out in the street with facial twitches and one hand on a gun. These battles were brutal and to my surprise reminded me of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and other gun blazing action packed movies that have great scripts to go along with them. William Holden and Earnest Borgnine played classic characters that allow them to fully display their great acting talent. The cinematography was top notch and the script had great dialog. The story of a band of bank robbers who need one more heist (sounds a little like Heat doesn't it?) has more twists and turns that make the two plus hours it comes in at seem to fly right by. I have to talk about the ending scene although no specific details can be provided. It is worth watching the whole movie to wait for that scene. Powerful! I could see smoke coming from the television screen and my eyes watched with locked intensity. After it was over one thought ran through my mind. I have finally found an equal to Pacino's rebellious fiery concluding battle with the scrappy gang of Columbians in the king of violent movies which is Scarface. I never thought I would utter those words but there is no other way to describe it. It leaves your jaw hanging and your heart pumping so fast you could start a Buick. And if that isn't a ringing endorsement then I don't know what is. I tip my hat to a great Western, a great action movie, and most importantly a great movie. It's movies like this that keep me searching for other older movies like I was looking for ancient artifacts. I found one in The Wild Bunch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful film. The violence is negligible. The storyline follows the classic western formula. Right from the beginning you know this isn't going to be a boring film.The summary line refers to the section of the film where Angel shoots his old girlfriend who's gone over to the "dark" side after the corrupting influences of the federals in Mexico have swept over and destroyed the Mexican countryside. The General to whom she's jumped into bed with isn't even officially a real general. She's given up the reality of Angel's love for her for the sensualism of whoring and the empty lawyer promises of money and power to be gained by giving the "Man" what he wants. That pretty much sums up the crux of this movie: is money and power really worth all that you have to give up in order for you to take possession of them? (And of course the implied answer is obviously: No).The disc is not dual layered but the movie is so good that it doesn't matter. On side two there is a documentary included about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not wild about this bunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stunningly photographed by Lucien Ballard, The Wild Bunch is a gorgeous looking and stunningly directed bore, yes, bore. Pacing is sorely lacking, and the direction, accomplished as it is, is sometimes undercut by the splintered editing. Despite the hyperactive editing, the film drags, and talk, most of it insignificant, fills the time between scenes of abstract violence. I didn't really care for or about the characters as I did in Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai or Pechnipah's Ride the High Country hence 21/2 hrs with them was too much. Sure the set pieces are terrific and worth watching, but pieces do not translate into a satisfactory whole. The acting is good, particularly Borgnine, Ryan, and Holden talented actors relegated to forgettable films during the 60's so The Wild Bunch was a last hurrah for them as well. The supporting cast has a convincing look and feel as does the film. Released the same year as the far more traditional Oscar-winning westerns Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and True Grit, The Wild Bunch was nominated for 2 Oscars, for Original Screenplay and Score, though it's the direction, editing and cinematography that are outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You knew that western films were going out of style with this trash of 1969.You knew you were in for it when Sam Peckinpah was associated with western films. This guy was one of the most violent directors on film. He'd show the bullet enter through the eye, or other parts of the body with blood gushing forth. I often found myself cringing during those shoot up scenes.Such is the case with this overly violent film. It starts with an ambush of the bunch by bounty hunters and others during a temperance meeting in a small western town. Everyone is shot up during the m?le. There is definitely no discrimination on that account.We have the timely clichs of old western films. Corrupt Mexican generals, spitfire Mexican women. (although with Peckinpah at the helm, they take the bullets as well)The one saving grace of the film is the loyalty shown by Bill Holden and his men when their fellow Mexican hombre is turned in by his own mother. The battle scene that rages could roughly be compared with that of the Alamo. Problem is that by this time, you're tired of the violence as you sit there waiting for the next person to catch a bullet. It was wonderful when the final credits started rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey partner, where's my Viagra?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Complete masculinity and stupidity are often indistinguishable." ? Henry Louis "The Wild Bunch" is another violent opera by Sam Peckinpah, a director who habitually paints with blood. Though a western, the film takes the format of the "heist movie", a gang of ageing outlaws banding together to pillage, plunder and steal as much silver as they can. Unfortunately a group of bounty hunters (led by a former accomplice) are hot on their hooves, which leads to the genre's usual assortment of gunfights, chases and showdowns.John Ford released the melancholic "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" in 1962. Since then, most westerns have sported an equally nostalgic, wistful or elegiac tone. These films all mourn the "passing of time", the "intrusion of modernity" and the death of the old west and its assorted values, demarcations and cinematic referents. As postmodernism, which began in cinema somewhere between Godard and Leone's work in the 1960s, is inherently nostalgic, most of these post-"Valance" films simply became an exercise in violence and nostalgia, amping up Ford's lamentations and gunfights whilst nostalgically resurrecting cinematic moments of the past. Whatever its merits, Leone's "Once Upon A Time In The West" is the film most guilty of this, whilst a western like Altman's "McCabe and Mrs Miller" exists on the other end of the spectrum. A bloodless but brutal film, about a pragmatic prostitute and the businessman who naively loves her, Altman's western isn't about the death of the West, but the death of the romantic idealism which directors like Leone and Ford routinely lacquer the genre in. In contrast, most other westerns released during the 1960s and 70s mourn the supposed passing of an era, and glorify those "last of a kind" romantic heroes who either go out in a blaze of glory or fade off into the horizon.Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" exists somewhere in the middle. It's a supremely elegiac film, its world-weary cast all moaning about their old age, the passage of time and bickering with youngsters who question their authority and view them as being outdated. And like most of these films, there's an emphasis on black and white photographs, and sepia stained cinematography, suggesting a fading image, the last twilight of the West. But like "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid" and "Midnight Cowboy", two other westerns released in 1969, Peckinpah's film is obsessed with issues of male bonding, macho codes and male trust. And like John Voight's male prostitute in "Midnight Cowboy", the film is rife with, not only homo-eroticism, but masculine inferiority complexes and corresponding acts of sexual overcompensation.Whilst John Voight's character in "Midnight Cowboy" evoked Western mythology in a feeble attempt to assert his masculinity, virtually every character in Peckinpah's film is a guy who wishes to prove his "usefulness" and "virility" in a world in which he is either too young, too old, no longer needed or can no longer function. In short, everyone in this film wants either bigger genitals, bigger guns or a bottle of Viagra. And with the phallic arrival of steam engines, machine guns and a more genteel form of civilisation, comes a kind of gender crisis in which our band of ageing and emasculated outlaws grab the biggest guns they can find in order to prove their manliness by going down, like Butch and Sundance, in the most awesomely massive blazes of glory they can muster. It's no surprise that Peckinpah's climactic blood bath so resembles the ending of De Palma's "Scarface": the majority of De Palma's films deal with male impotency and various gender wars. And of course Peckinpah's next film starred Dustin Hoffman - fresh off the set of "Midnight Cowboy" - as an impotent husband and emasculated cowboy.It's important to remember that the sixties weren't just an era of civil rights for racial minorities. The period also ushered in a new generation of feminists, and much literature has charted the way in which feminism, and the assertion or "threats" of female independence, caused a corresponding transformation in masculinity. And so as femininity began to be redefined, so to was masculinity. The result of all this is that the 1960s were filled with films which either villainize women or move them to the extreme edge of male experience. Hollywood also witnessed a deliberate shift in focus to male-male rather than male-female relationships, which reached its zenith in the 1980s with the super stardom of muscular, monosyllabic cavemen like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, bloated parodies of masculinity who strutted about like swollen phalluses. Today, we see the consequences of such gender battles. Gender, informed by patriarchy, was fundamental to social identity under savagery and despotism. Under capitalism, however, gender identity becomes mutable, fluid or "neutered". With the ascension of "male" rationality and the subordination of everything to the instrumental "principles" of the public world (everything indiscriminately interchangeable and exchangeable etc) you also get a situation in which "masculinity", which is not innate, and was constituted in opposition to everything deemed "traditionally feminine", is now constituted in opposition to a "new femininity" that is itself "masculine", and vice versa. Men thus become softer, women harder, and techno capitalism increasingly redefines gender in terms of flexibility, amorphism, and a kind of faux individuality. End result: "Brokeback Mountain", a film which is in many ways much less queer and/or insecure than "The Wild Bunch".8/10 ? "Bunch" has faced much criticism for aestheticizing violence. But there's no violence in this film. Think of it as interior decorating, Ernest Borgine and William Holden a flamboyantly gay couple giddily splashing red paint about.</fullReview>

Saddle up and join the bloodbath.THE WILD BUNCH features a who's who of the genre; some arguably doing their best work ever: William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Edmond O'Brien, Ben Johnson, Warren Oates, L.Q.

		<shortDescription>The Wild Bunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wild Bunch" starts with a scene that could rival the legendary "Once Upon A Time in the West" scene, and only gets better from there. The scene begins with a group of what seems to be soldiers strolling into a town on horses. The camera follows the soldiers around the town as we observe the setting along with them. We don't yet know why we're following them, but we know they're important. They run into an old lady, apologize, pick up her stuff for her, and continue to help her around. They seem like good people. They walk into a bank, and suddenly they grab the people in the bank, pull out their guns, and it cuts to William Holden as Pike Bishop as he says "If they move, kill them".A firefight ensues between them and bounty hunters hired by the town. By that scene I'm sure that you'd think they would be the bad guys, right? But as the film continues we learn they are actually just the lesser of many evils, and they never meant for any citizens to be killed. This grey morality of the film, as well as this scene, is only one of the many great parts of it.The film is not only a fantastic western, it's an ode to the dying era of the wild west, both historically and in film. There are many references to the evolving technology outside of the wild west, and the fact that the characters seem to be realizing that they can't keep on doing this forever, and they're getting pretty old. In one great scene Pike is reminded that he can't keep on doing this forever, but one of the members in his crew simply passes him the whiskey as they all take a swig and enjoy it while they can.The action scenes in this film use a technique used most recently in "Mad Max: Fury Road", in which there are frequent cuts, to show the fast pace and chaos of the firefights, but the action is always kept in the center of the frame, so the viewer's can always comprehend what's going on, and it uses this to great effect.The film has a great opening scene, and a great one in the middle involving a train, but the final scene is one of the greatest action scenes of all time. Beforehand, the men are in a whorehouse when Pike seems to be recalling his former girlfriend that was murdered. He sits there and seems to realize that he can't recreate what it was like back then, and he walks into the other room to find the other men equally as distracted. They decide to go out with a bang rather than a whimper as Pike says "Let's go". To which Lyle responds "Why not?".What follows that is one of the greatest endings to one of the greatest westerns of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If they move, kill em'!" exclaims Pike Bishop, leader of an ageing band of outlaws who are in the midst of holding up a railroad payroll office in a small Texas town. However the "wild" west is no more and it's inhabitants are becoming more civilised. Deke Thornton(a former associate of Pike's who is now working for the railroad)and his posse ambush the gang resulting in a bloody shootout which needlessly claims many innocent lives. The robbery a failure, Pike and the surviving members of the gang flee across the border into revolution-torn Mexico pursued by Thornton and his posse. It isn't long before Pike and the bunch fall in with ruthless bandit chief Mapache, who coerces them into stealing arms from the U.S army in return for thousands of dollars in gold. Pike and his compatriots become increasingly disillusioned with life as they know it and end up betraying Mapache, ultimately deciding to go out all guns blazing in one of the most spectacular bloodbaths Hollywood has ever seen!.Sam Peckinpah's savage essay on the decline of the American frontier disgusted critics of the day solely due to the extremity of the violence, even at a time when audiences of the world were being increasingly desensitised by horrific images of the Vietnam war. The Wild Bunch has since become a highly respected cult film which, despite the brutality of it's content, explores the more tender issues of friendship, honour and redemption. It can also be interpreted as a comment on the dying(or dead)western genre itself. Peckinpah conveys his thoughts and feelings in an aggressively overt way, which is what makes the film all the more fantastic. The lives of the main characters are epitomised by greed, murder and other forms of amoral self indulgence, although the movie depicts brilliantly how deep reflection coupled with fate can alter the moral compass of even such violent individuals and instil in them a sense of dignity and self-respect to the point where they attempt to put things right(which is ironically represented in the brutal climax). William Holden gave a superb performance as Pike Bishop, leader of The Wild Bunch. Ernest Borgnine was equally impressive as his second-in-command, Dutch as were Warren Oates and Ben Johnson as the Gorch brothers, not to mention Robert Ryan as Pike's former ally Deke Thornton. I think Edmond O'Brien gave the best performance in the film next to William Holden, as cranky old timer Freddie Sykes. Peckinpah also co-wrote the great script and excellent lines are in abundance, I also detected a few pinches of terrifically cynical black comedy.The Wild Bunch is bookended with two magnificent but vicious shootouts. The first which opens the movie is a rollicking warm up for what is to come. Taut slow motion intercutting would appear as a rudimentary manifestation in Peckinpah's subsequent efforts but it is here that the chilling technique makes it's amazing debut. Almost baroque in execution, the riotous climax is nothing more than totally unashamed chaos!. The bodycount in this sequence alone is stratospheric and watching Pike and the bunch get torn apart by unrelenting gunfire as they fight for control of the machine gun is a truly spectacular sight!. The bunch seem almost indestructible for the duration of this excessively violent orgy until their bodies are literally blasted away from the machine gun, with Pike still gripping hold of it's trigger and spraying bullets as he dies!.It can be said that this Peckinpah classic is the western to end all westerns(with stiff competition from Leone's The Good, The Bad And The Ugly!).This scabrous homage to tough men who have become relics of a blood stained chapter in American history is as harsh as it needs to be. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Wild Western Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch (1969): Dir: Sam Peckinpah / Cast: William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oats, Ben Johnson, Robert Ryan: Symbolic western masterpiece wherein the term "wild" regards our declining attitude towards violence. The film introduces four aged gunfighters who obey a code. They do not believe in torture but stress that getting in the way of fire is a bad idea. It opens with children huddled around to the delight of seeing two scorpions being tortured by ants. The scorpions symbolize the Bunch while the ants are the rebels they will engage in graphic gunfire. Director Sam Peckinpah brought violent cinema to a whole new level as well as creates one of the greatest and most sincere westerns ever made. William Holden is flawless as the leader joined by Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oats and Ben Johnson, all of whom are effective. They are also being pursued by a bounty hunter who was formerly one of them. He is played by Robert Ryan who knows them and can counter their moves. They have witnessed the very core of violent nature and can only foresee a future of brutal consequence. There are three gunfights that involve severe civilian casualties but the film is really about violence through generations particularly when children joyfully chase after a jeep dragging an Indian behind it. "Boy, do I hate to see that," reserves the worn men who have seen it all before. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been looking forward to this one a long time, expecting a brutal western full of senseless bloodshed and what not... and I can't really say I'm disappointed!Putting William Holden in the lead was a great idea - looking like a civil enough guy. Ernest Borgnine has always been one of my favorites 'old-timers' anyway, so it was fun to see him here as well. Warren Oates played a terrific role, even if (or exactly because) he got the short end of the stick here all the time.The opening scene is instantly classic. I don't know if anyone had done such a thing before (freezing frames and switching between present and past), but I'm sure lots of directors got their inspiration here.Apparently, some people don't care for the heavily accentuated characters and humour at times (who gets that last drop of whiskey?), but it didn't feel out of place to me. The finale could be dismissed for the same reasons, but I don't think it deserves to be - at all.A big 8 - or a small 9 out of 10... what do you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly not a TV movie; and, it is certainly not for those who fear the sight of blood. In other words, it's not "The Apple Dumpling Gang!"This is a no-nonsense, shoot-em-up, hardcore western about a gang of bank and train robbers called "The Wild Bunch" who make outlaws in most other movies look like "The Brady Bunch." It was the first movie of its kind in this genre, and, many movie-goers were shocked and/or amazed when they saw this for the first time. I know I was!Directed by the ultra-violent ex-US Marine, Sam Peckinpah; and, with an all-star cast lead by veteran actors William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, and, Robert Ryan; this movie is 'still' held in very high regards by both directors and actors of today...as well as lovers of westerns, crime-dramas, and, high-adrenaline action flix. I've never met any guy who didn't like this. It will never lose its luster!I read that the DVD includes all or most (can't remember which) of the edited footage that wasn't in the original release.If you like westerns-with-a-kick like "The Long Riders" (1980) (directed by Sam Peckinpah's protg, Walter Hill);" or, crime-dramas like "The Getaway" (1972) (directed by Sam Peckinpah) - you'll like this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Sam Peckinpah is riding the wave to usher in ultra violence into the movies. The action style is completely modern. It opens with the gang riding into town in uniform. They rob the town bank but finds themselves cornered by a ground of bounty hunters.Sam Peckinpah is forewarning the audience the vicious and cruel world they are able to enter. We see a group of children torturing scorpions by placing them with a bunch of ants. And then they place a load of twigs on top and put the whole thing on fire.Sam is putting the film world on fire. He starts the movie off with some crazy action. Who can forget the iconic horsemen falling through the blown bridge stunt? The rapid cut editing and the blood splatter will be the new standard for violence.William Holden and Ernest Borgnine lead a cast of veteran western actors. While the action holds up, the scenes in between do drag sometimes. The characters are your basic good bad guys. I just wish it was trimmed down and have not so many flashbacks. The fact is a big backstory isn't really needed and isn't the most important part of the movie anyways. Sam has to know the action is what this movie is about. The new era of Hollywood violence is truly underway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why You Might Like It: If you are a fan of Westerns, then you will likely enjoy this movie. It is a bit different than your traditional Western as it is action-packed at times and has an over the top shoot em up fill to it. The acting is great and the directing by Peckinpah is very fresh to this genre of movies and makes for a fun watch.Why You Might Not Like It: As most Westerns do, it has its slow spots that will make some lose interest. Also, this film is rated very high, so many will go into it with lofty expectations that it may or may not live up to.Acting/Casting: 8* - There is no shortage of great acting and cast members in this film. I am a huge fan of both William Holden and Robert Ryan in particular.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 8* - Peckinpah does a fantastic job and many of the gun fight scenes are something to marvel for the film being made in 1969.Plot/Characters: 7* - The story has many layers and is pretty impressive. It starts out with a robbery, progresses into bounty hunting, and ends up being about loyalty.Entertainment Value: 7* - I really enjoyed this movie and was extremely impressed by the gun fight scenes, which are the highlight of the movie in my opinion. I would recommend this to fans of Western films and will likely watch again some time down the road.My Score: 8+8+7+7 = 30/4 = 7.5 Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unsparing vision of the dream of innocence, and of human failure. . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can ride with a gang that seems to share a rough code of honour, but you'll be pursued by a former friend who's betraying you to stay out of prison. You can try to earn an easy score through the bloody hard work of robbing a bank, or a railroad, and cross the river into the freedom of a country where no law applies to you, but once you've crossed the river you'll be consumed by the chaos that always flourishes in the absence of law. You can try to rescue a friend, but your gesture will be rendered useless by a knife blade's flash. Then, when there's no more running, and nowhere to run to, when you've given your word and found that no one values it, when you've played out your string right to the end, what will you do? The Wild Bunch is Sam Peckinpah's exploration of that question. An artist who knew and loved life on the land, who knew well, and hated, the corruptions of 'civilization', and was compelled to cross the border into lawless territory, to seek a freedom which his own knowledge could never let him inhabit, Peckinpah made this marvellous film. It's set in a physical and spiritual landscape that any thinking middle-aged man is appallingly familiar with - the world of turning a blind eye to one's own cruelty, of watching one's hopes trashed by malevolence and stupidity, of being betrayed by friends, of fantasizing about the stroke of good luck that will let a man walk away from his compromises and failures. And Peckinpah's refusal to accept false sentiment reflects a middle-aged man's knowledge that self-interest and cruelty tempt even the very young, that even the powerful dream of being a child again is an illusion promising no peace. The children dream of being as brave and powerful as the adults whose violent actions are so seductively exciting. In the film's penultimate cathartic moment, it's a child who pulls the rifle's trigger. So, in the face of the disintegration of his world, and the impossibility of returning to innocence, what must a man do? No, the characters in this film are not honourable. But they dream of honourable actions - helping one's countrymen, one's village, one's friends. Yes, the idea of the frontier as an escape, and a new beginning, dies, in a welter of bullets after a man is dragged by technology across the abrasive landscape of his failure to see the consequences of his own actions. But the freedom of the frontier is its uncompromising offer of a chance to assess what's really true about existence. Sam Peckinpah knew that the assessment was the important thing. Death will happen. . . the important thing is to be ready to face death honestly, and so be able to live truly. The Wild Bunch isn't a young person's film, but for people who are ready to live in the minute details of existence faced honestly, ready to face the inevitable truth of death, The Wild Bunch is the necessary film. Peckinpah's clear vision cost him his happiness, and his health, finally, but left the rest of us a tough, miraculous, work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Sam Peckinpah (Straw Dogs, Junior Bonner), from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die this sounded like a worthy title to be included, and I was certainly looking forward to watching it. Basically set in 1913, at the time before World War I, a gang of ageing outlaws are seeking one final score, as leader Pike Bishop (William Holden) is planning retirement, mainly the robbery of stash of silver in the railroad office. They are ambushed however by Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), Pike's former partner with his posse of bounty hunters, he is guarding the railroad to be pardoned for his past, and soon enough it turns into a bloody shootout killing many gang members and innocent people in the battle. The surviving gang members Pike, Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine), the Gorch brothers Lyle (Warren Oates) and Tector (Ben Johnson) and Angel (Jaime Snchez) find out that the robbery was a decoy, and they head for Mexico reuniting with Freddie Sykes (Edmond O'Brien). Crossing the Rio Grande they camp in the village where Angel was born, where the townspeople are ruled by Mexican Federal Army General Mapache (Emilio Fernndez), who resorts to stealing to fill the stomachs of his troops. In the town of Agua Verde, Pike and his gang get to meet Mapache and his army, and the general is angered when jealous Angel shoots dead his former lover who is now with the general, but the situation is defused. German military adviser Mohr (Fernando Wagner) wants to obtain samples of American weapons, so Pike's gang steal some to appease him, and a share of gold from Angel to make this deal final, but Mapache betrays them and makes a booby trap for them that they almost get caught in. Pike and his men plan to get their own back, but after Sykes is injured they return to Agua Verde to hide out, and they also try to get Mapache to release an injured Angel, but his throat is cut instead. After some more negotiation attempts and whatever there is another large shoot out, where Pike and his men, and most of the troops in the army are killed in the battle, Sykes kills any people left, and Deke rides away into the distance. Also starring Strother Martin as Coffer and L.Q. Jones as T.C. I will be honest and say that I did not understand the full extent of what was going on, and the reasons for the big shoot outs, but Holden gives a good lead performances, and Borgonine gets his moments too, to be honest the big shoot out scenes are the best parts, because it changed the way films can be made, made around the same time as Bonnie and Clyde it allowed more bloody violence, it is a terrific classic western. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Jerry Fielding and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Material Not Previously Published or Produced. It was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 69 on 100 Movies, 100 Thrills. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good western that mostly revolve around a band of outlaws, just not as amazing as I thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie doesn't go in the generic western direction where it has that generic western feel to it. Although this movie was made in 1969 the action and cinematography is still pretty good. The movie takes place in a wild west where outlaws roam easily and money is worth more than the worth of human lives. This applies to present times somewhat but it was more open about it during this era. Like most movies of this type though, it's the one last score a person or a group of people look for which causes a great conflict. The story shows the perspective of the robbers in the wild west and a group of bounty hunters that are trailing them. When it comes to some moral code it applies to the outlaws to some degree which makes the character development go in the direction where you will sort of care for the outlaws and what happens to them. Also for a movie that came out in 1969 the shootouts and cinematography is still good. It isn't as exciting of a western as I thought it would be but it still a western worth seeing at least once. It's a good western but just didn't seem as amazing as most critics are claiming. Maybe I missed something or this isn't the type and style of western that interest me or something. The ending however is very well don't and ends the movie almost perfectly.7.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" was greeted with controversy when it originally appeared in 1969. The film was so violent that in 1993, when prepping a re-release, Warner Bros. was handed an NC-17 rating by the MPAA. While that was an overreaction you can imagine the impact that the film had on moviegoers during its original run.The story concerns a group of aging outlaws struggling to maintain their way of life in a West that's steadily becoming less and less wild. Realizing their time is coming to an end, they plot one last big score. The film builds to a climax that represents perhaps the most explosive showdown in the history of Westerns.A big part of the film's strength is in the acting. The titular 'wild bunch' includes Oscar winners William Holden, Ernest Borgnine &amp; Ben Johnson. The supporting cast includes another Oscar winner in Edmond O'Brien along with other distinguished actors like Warren Oates &amp; Robert Ryan. None of the actors were recognized with Oscar nominations but all did fine work.Sam Peckinpah's direction may not have gotten much awards attention either but it has come to be regarded as highly influential. There are antecedents to his style but certainly no-one took it as far as he did. Meanwhile, Jerry Fielding's score garnered one of the film's two Oscar nominations (the other being for the original screenplay).In the end, I don't think that the film's perfect, though. There are a few scenes that play like something out of a lesser, more conventional movie and the film doesn't really take off until the second half. Frankly, I was beginning to fear that this might be one of those films whose supposed greatness is measured in influence rather than quality. Thankfully, that didn't turn out to be the case. I'd have to say, despite some relatively minor flaws, "The Wild Bunch" deserves its spot among the top Westerns of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty solid classic western, but with that comes a flaw that I feel with every classic western...it can be insanely dull. I don't know why this is, but I find myself completely engaged and involved with modern westerns; and it's the complete opposite for more aged ones. The action scenes are pretty incredible; they're well choreographed and certainly compelling. But it just drags so much between them, aside from a few conversations that had me really drawn; and it always gives me goosebumps when I hear an iconic line like "If they move, kill 'em". The technical aspects are also very well done; the score and cinematography are superb and the script is solid with some classic dialogue. Performance-wise it's pretty solid across the board with William Holden being the only real standout. He has a commanding presence that had my eyes glued to him whenever he was on screen. Just like his character, he took charge of the scene every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I use the term shocking because the film is a tremendous departure from the typical western produced in the 60's. It remains a standard by which great westerns are measured today, and virtually all great shoot-em-up action films steal/borrow the cinematic techniques that Peckinpah and his team improvised in this film.There is both a camaraderie and a hard-edged tension among the Wild Bunch band. They are led by the steely resolve of Dutch (William Holden) into an adventure that is the last, best game they can find. Every great heroic film requires a great villain. This movie highlights 2 sets of "villains" - the rag-tag railroad detectives chasing the bunch for the reward they'll fetch in the US, and the Mexican militia army general who commands through torture. Every element of the cast excels at revealing the sordid nature of war, domination and conquest.I've watched this movie perhaps 10 times and never tire of the adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Holden and Ernest Borgnine really look the part as leaders of a disaffected group of misfits, dissipates at best, who are marauders running between Mexico and the United States. They are pursued by a former member of the gang, (played by Frank Ryan), whose heart is in it only for the money and an old grudge that quickly fades the longer he is exposed to the idiots that he is saddled with in his pursuit. The music in the film is appropriate, exciting and helps the movie along. The characters are engaging in this thoroughly enjoyable and gripping film.The violence in the film is appropriate and not overdone as the critics of the day once thought it was. Without it, the film would lose its lustre and edge. The gusto that these men exhibit in the natural settings from village to town to country is realistic as it makes you feel a part of the group itself, experiencing the gang life first hand in an interesting and positive way. You have compassion for these outlaws which does show skillful direction. These men drink and cavort with loose women in a realistic depiction of life on the run in Mexico a hundred years ago. Edmond O'Brien makes a wonderful appearance as an old debauched attachment to the gang. The story line is good and it holds up throughout.I highly recommend this film. Get it and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloody touchstone in western cinema history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late 60's was an era when events occurred that made it impossible to return to a simpler time. Likewise, this movie (along with others from a similar period, such as "Bonnie and Clyde") took film-making to a new tolerance level for violence and the western to a stark, bloody level that made other films seem quaint by comparison. The line can be drawn right up to today's market where people are still trying to out-do one another (with films like "300", "Saw", "Apocolyto", etc...) That's not to suggest that "The Wild Bunch" is only about the violence, but it set a bar that eventually others would attempt to jump across, and have. Holden plays the ringleader of a gang of robbers who descend on a small western town with plans to steal from the bank. Unbeknownst to him, his old nemesis Ryan is lying in wait with a sizable crew of his own, recruited by authoritarian Dekker, with the task of thwarting Holden at any cost. Following a frenetic massacre, Holden and his remaining men realize their take wasn't what they had expected and decide to pull one last job before splitting up and moving on. They agree to steal rifles from the US Army in exchange for gold from a corrupt Mexican General (Fernandez.) Unfortunately, Fernandez has greatly wronged one of Holden's own (Sanchez) and that leads to complications which threaten to destroy everyone involved. A protracted finale with bullets and blood flying in equal measure punctuates this farewell to the traditional western. Holden is excellent as the weary, resigned head of the Wild Bunch. He manages to make the audience care about a figure who tends to be quite mercenary in his activities. Ryan is equally good as his hunter, trying to repay a debt he feels is owed him for a past wrong. Borgnine doesn't get a great deal to do, but he's perfectly solid and restrained. Oates and Johnson aptly portray boozing brothers who are always on the lookout for a roll in the hay (or whatever's handy!) with a senorita or three. Fernandez comes off as intimidating and unstable, making his villain (of villains) quite disturbing. Ryan's gang includes those stalwart western ragamuffins Jones and Martin, who blessed many a film and TV project with their distinctive brand of sagebrush characters. A nearly unrecognizable O'Brien is exceptional as a filthy, leather-faced old bum who aids Holden on his criminal exploits. Other notable cast members include Hopkins, as a half-witted member of the bank hold-up gang and Taylor as a fiery temperance preacher. This is a long, deliberate, but beautifully filmed and well-realized piece of cinema. It may not be everyone's cup of tea due to the frank, explosive violence or the laconic way in which much of it unfolds, but it is a film rich with fine acting and authentic characterizations as well as an indictment of society's failure to realize the impact its misdeeds have on its children and their way of thinking. Surely it's a film that benefits from repeat viewings, enabling one to see the little touches that may have been missed the first time or to identify the players a bit more easily since, at first, there are so many of them it's not always easy to tell who's who.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ground Breaking Western Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film in its' entirety for the first time this week. I had seen small portions of this action packed western on television previously, but had never viewed enough of the storyline to form a prior opinion of this critically acclaimed drama. IMDb web site voters have made the film one of the Top 250 IMDb rated films. While I would have no problem in rating it as one of my Top 25 Westerns, it would be somewhat of a stretch for me to rate it as one of my Top 250 all time films. I do feel that it was an era transitional and ground breaking production. It would be difficult to find other period films which included members of the outstanding cast, headed up by William Holden, Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine and Edmund O'Brien, that contained bare breasted women or the level of graphic violence that are in this film. The nudity is handled in relatively good taste, but the blood shed might have been toned down a little in my opinion. Fans of current vintage violent action or grizzly horror films, may disagree with that assessment.The absorbing film, tells the story of a group of aging desperadoes, who are unsure of what the future holds for them as they approach the end of their unlawful careers. The leader and master-mind of the group, creatively portrayed by William Holden, holds the band of outlaws together while providing them with both a sense of discipline and their own unique form of ethics. The climactic scenes, although excessively violent, should be loved by most fans of action westerns. I felt that the script, like the outlaw band, wasn't sure where it was taking us and how it should all end. Although I might have chosen a somewhat different conclusion, I think the film was a very insightful and entertaining classic that could easily qualify for an IMDb rating of between 6 and 9. I gave it a 7 out of 10 and would certainly recommend it for western film lovers and fans of the superb cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch is surely the finest, defining and almost the ending moment of Hollywood's love affair with the Old West. I have no hesitation in categorically stating this is the best Western I've ever seen, the only other that comes close is Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, ironically the film that probably rescued the Western from the early grave the Wild Bunch plunged it into. In the real West, Butch and Sundance's gang were known as the Wild Bunch and thats not where the similarities end.*SPOILERS****** Both sets are train robbers and all meet their bloody end, hopelessly outnumbered, at the hands of a Latin American Army. Despite the similarities though, these films are polar opposites. There is no sign of the jokey relationship between the male leads. No tomfoolery and certainly no laughs. While Butch and Sundance wins us over with Burt Bacharach's score and Raindrops keep falling on my head, the Wild Bunch mentally tortures you through Jerry Fieldings haunting music. Scenes of death are treated by Peckinpah with some cold realism and bloodshed that you wonder how this passed the censors in 1969! Both films are staged around the 1900-10 period, the end of the West. Progress comes to both, in the form of the bicycle in Butch's case and in the form of the motor car in the Wild Bunch. Progress comes and all who cannot adjust are swept before it like the tide of ants swamping the scorpion. Not a single Oscar nomination in sight for Peckinpah or any of his superb cast. A travesty, not the first and certainly not the last. Very few films move me, the Wild Bunch does so perhaps more than any other.</fullReview>

This movie is worth seeing, It's just that it left me feeling as if I'd wasted my time. But it has a great story and interesting characters and intense gunfighting. Good movie, just not one of my favorites.

		<shortDescription>controversial film was edited in 1969.....some spoilers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first films to use SQUIB effects to simulate bullet hits on people. When characters get shot in this movie, the audience sees the simulated bullet hit and fake blood spurting out. This is merely special effects and is common today in most action films. However, in 1969 this was unheard of. Some reports from back then had people getting sick to their stomachs and fleeing movie theatres. Many scenes from this film were cut by the studio due to the controversy and later restored in a video/dvd version. Peckinpah wanted to go for realism, he got realism but also a controversial outcry from movie reviewers and the general public. This film also features one of the longest running machine gun sequences on film. THE WILD BUNCH, ushered in a new era of action movies. A era that has led to the violent overstatement we see in many contemporary action films. (ie. people getting dismembered for entertainments sake etc.) I understand Peckinpah's artistic vision...and the violence in this movie is tame by today's standards. However, I wonder....was it needed? Today acts of graphic violence have become a way of life for the Hollywood film world. For some reason this sells. I love action movies like the next guy but, I wonder where will it stop? Where's the dividing line between art and the ultimate gross out? People have been arguing that question ever since this film came out....and there are no easy answers. As long as the general public has a appetite for it....well, it's the law of supply and demand: where there's a demand there will be a supply.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond brilliant tale of ageing outlaws, galvanised by an old fashioned sense of loyalty and the more simplistic motivation of greed and survival, tracked by one of their own (Ryan), following a brazen, bloody daylight bank robbery, double-crossed at every turn, yet still able to enjoy a laugh or brutal gunfight as the need arises. Director Peckinpah's marathon sags briefly in the middle, but its the blood-pumping bookends that make this film unforgettable.Superior casting, Edmond O'Brien in particular showing his versatility as the wily old salt of the bunch, while Robert Ryan is understated as the bunch's nemesis, a former member tortured into submission and reluctant turncoat. Even supporting players LQ Jones, Strother Martin, Albert Dekker and Bo Hopkins stand-out (Hopkins' Crazy Lee cameo is two minutes of pure adrenalin). A truly ensemble effort.Jerry Fielding's suspenseful, pulsating rhythms, arid landscapes, costumes, dialogue and special effects (the slow motion bullet ballets are the type of scenes you can rewind and re-watch over and over) all deliver with purpose and impact. It's a great western, but equally, an impressive film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the western genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a huge fan of westerns, but there have been a lot that I have liked. The Wild Bunch is certainly one of my favourites of the genre. While quite elegiac, Sam Peckinpah is also practically re-inventing a genre. The Wild Bunch is violent, gritty and bloody, but that is in no way a bad thing, quite the contrary.The Wild Bunch has the exquisite images usually found in Peckinpah's movies- the scenery is just gorgeous and the cinematography is just amazing. Fielding's score is very good and quite poignant to say the least. I also loved how The Wild Bunch was paced, it may be slow but to add to the elegiac quality of the movie the slow pacing was necessary I feel.Also apparent in The Wild Bunch are some great script-writing, a highly compelling story, great characters and some surrealistically choreographed gunfights. Peckinpah's direction is right on the money, and the acting is superb. William Holden gives one of his best performances, and I was equally blown away by Ernest Borgnine.All in all, a superb film and one of the best of the western genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This bloody extravaganza made Sam Peckinpah's reputation. A kind of fantasy of machismo set along the Texas-Mexico border around 1913--yes, very late for a Western--The Wild Bunch has thrilled adolescent boys and twentysomethings for almost four decades. The slowmo shots of horses falling awkwardly, of bodies squirting blood as they fall off of roof tops or cliffs, of tough hombres talking tough while they grab loose women and bottles of booze replete with numerous other bits of acrobatic mayhem amid some fantastic scenery makes this a non-cerebral feast for the eyes. The stars, William Holden (Pike Bishop), Ernest Borgnine (Dutch Engstrom), Robert Ryan (Deke Thornton), Edmund O'Brien (Freddie Sykes), etc. are first rate and on form. The plot is a variant of the old "one last job" story which begins with Pike's not-quite over-the-hill gang doing one last bank robbery.Needless to say something goes wrong. Interspersed between the opening credits we see Pike's gang ride into town dressed as members of the US Army Calvary. On roof tops are some rascals and scallywags with rifles, missing teeth, and murderous gleams in their eyes. They are led by Deke Thornton, who it turns out is working for the railroad. What follows is a good old fashioned shoot 'em up of rather unlikely proportions as Pike's gang exists the bank with bags of loot, dodging and slinging bullets with abandon.Turns out...well, no I won't say because I don't want to spoil the surprise. Suffice it to say, they need to do another job, this one a good old-fashioned train robbery with a few tricks and extras, like blowing up a bridge and running a locomotive at full throttle backwards. And then across the border into Mexico and some fun and games with Mexican generals, senoritas, banditos and such.Been there, done that. But Peckinpah's colorful yarn has a few things you might not have seen before, and some of those things that you have seen, he did first and better. The Mexican color with a lot of authentic-looking extras doing authentic-looking Mexican activities was good. The fact that the Spanish spoken was not translated (and didn't need to be translated) was good. General Mapache (Emilio Fernandez) as the drunken, power-hungry warlord bandito was good. The kids feeding scorpions to the ants and then burning them was good. Edmund O'Brien as a degenerate Gabby Hayes kind of character was a hoot and a holler. But mostly this was about grim-faced men, toughened by long hours in saddle under the hot sun who, after decades of outlawing, finally ride gloriously into that last battle. Next stop: boot hill.I watched the "original director's cut" that runs 145 minutes. At no time was my brain involved, but my eyes couldn't stop watching.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>Has aged a little in some of the line readings, and Peckinpah is ham-fisted in making his points. Still, a groundbreaking film that paved the way for Tarantino, Spielberg, Scorcese... Over these, Peckinpah has a more unrelenting willingness to tackle head-on the moral contradictions and ambiguities that mine all the main characters. Helping the cause, The Wild Bunch is a feat of individual and group acting, and cinematography. In the director's cut, the added scenes make the movie even longer but pay off, as they ensure that the main characters' motivations eventually fall into place.</fullReview>

This movie may have the highest body count of any movie ever. Screen violence was practically invented in this movie.

I'm not generally against flashbacks, but I didn't like how Mr. Peckinpah made them in this movie.But besides from those two minor flaws is this one of the best western out there.

I saw the first half of this movie not under the influence of any drug and I thought it was horrible.. an old movie which is thought to be good just cause its been thought to be good for so many years - such as Deer Hunter, Gone With the Wind, etc. The second half: I get really high and see all the minute details of the movie in a different context. This gave me a different view of what to think when old movies I watch suck.. you have to think of what the people were like in the time and place where the movie came out, such as this movie in the 60s when everyone was always high. This movie puts first person view angles and fade outs to good use.. Its as if it has its own personality.. going through comedic scenes fast as to let you know it was just a joke to lighten the mood or fading out slowly for a stealthy creeping feel. Other instances that help this movie stand out are extensive speaking in Spanish (without subtitles?) which sacrifices the happiness of the movie's publisher for added realism. The time couldn't be more perfect... taking place during the death of the oldest and its merging with the modern world and the insight of Mexicans couldn't be more perfect.. after all these are the people that brought marijuana into this country around the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah proves his worth as a great director from the second half of the 20th century with The Wild Bunch, a film that breathes life as one of the 60's best, a blockbuster caliber picture that gives its audience what it wants - a cast of famous old-timers and some newcomers as well (lest not forget Ernest Borgnine) set the stage for the tale of robbers and killers in 1913 who want a large final score after getting screwed over, even as bounty hunters follow ominously. Even the slower moments are elegantly staged; there is always something to look for on the screen and Peckinpah brings the violence so thick that while it doesn't compare to today's big-budgeters, has all the reality in girth. The characters are generally well-rounded, the suspense fierce, and the violence is handled with the same kind of precision as the ones with just straight-on dialog. Masterfully directed and acted with the great flair of old-school character acting, The Wild Bunch is a brash, essential Western that's a worthy watch for the fans from when it was released and people from later generations as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching so many great films on Turner Classic Movie's month long marathon of "every great Western (except Shane)", and particularly, after tonight's airing of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, this movie really stood out for what wasn't there.To be honest, I couldn't watch more than 25 minutes before getting bored out of my mind. Yokels and Nazi-stereotypes, white trash... I hardly think it bespeaks a great film for a director to portray the South/West as backwards and evil. I mean, what could be more fundamentally orthodox these days?I find myself fully agreeing with Critical Eye UK about this work. I might compare what it seemed to have done for the Western genre, as what Scorsese's nihilist GOODFELLAS and CASINO did for the mob genre.We live in a senseless age, I gather, and an history-ignorant one tooso films like THE WILD BUNCH make it easy for us to trash all the character depth and ideals of the real people in eras bygone. We can't conceive of violence being anything other than the total war the 20th century wrought time and again, so of course, back in the West, they cared as little about "collateral damage" as modern states do. The thing is, though, that in frontier towns, any gang that acts like modern Hollywood villains do, will quickly find the blowback stops them in their tracks. Wars were more private, and more limited, with rules and conventions, because it was all too obvious that collective security is a myth.Well, eh. I mightn't be opening my mouth, having seen so little, but as I said, the portion I saw left a real bad taste in my mouth.Oh. Also. The opening scene. I suppose most viewers, accustomed to this style of filmmaking, managed to piece together what happened, and by and large appreciate the realism of the chaos. I reckon I've just about lost my understanding of the benefits of this style. If you want to feel what violence is like, go join the Army, or a gang, et al. If you want to see a good story, on the other hand, I should much rather know what the heck's going on, in some degree.(To be clear, I love a good detective story, or suspense, etc., as much as anyone. But deliberate omissions of facts done by selecting certain scenes or dialogues for focus, is much more like real-life experience of knowledge-gaps, than the nihilism of, say, the opening scene of THE WILD BUNCH.)</fullReview>

You get grizzled veterans like William Holden, Robert Ryan and the like who could get all the GDs out of their system they had held back so many years, and you have a ridiculous amount of gratuitous profanity, violence and bloodshed that you hadn't seen in previous westerns. That's supposed to automatically make this a classic, according to critics, I guess.Well, the movie sucks. It's a simple as that so don't believe all the national film "experts" (the Eberts, Maltins, etc.) who just love anything that shocks. There are so many excellent westerns over the years, it is ridiculous to praise this one. Also, this was a portend of things to come regarding way overlong violent scenes where the action loses its impact because it goes on and on and on (see "Van Helsing").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is going to be tough writing a review to film that A: Is already regarded as the finest of it's type and B: Do it any kind of justice. So to simply sum up, 'The Wild Bunch' is not just the best western ever made but also a super strong candidate for the finest motion picture. Peckinpah directed this almost as if laying down a gauntlet, which said beat this if you can?! Obviously no one did, or possibly could. To see the restored version (in 1994) on the big screen (at the N.F.T), was both a revelation and an awesome experience. I will not accept any negative criticism of 'The Wild Bunch' and maybe it's a little too violent for your tastes but (on the other hand) if you are unable to appreciate the work of a cinematic genius at the top of his game, then sadly you know nothing about films or film-making (Go back to watching 'Jaws', 'E.T' or 'Batman'). 'The Bunch' took the world by storm and is both the birth and the death of the western rolled into one. Check out the that red motorcar, now that's what I call cool ride.

		<fullReview>This is the Best Movie Ever Made, pure and simple. To me, that is. Because deep inside I am a Man, the alfa male, the animal. I consider all other men my rivals, competitors, territorial threats. I do have an absolute respect and caring for all other living things in this planet: women, children, animals, plants... but not men. Of them only strong should survive, or step the hell aside. Be a slave. This is how I see the message of this movie: the gang members are criminal and get their money by robbing, and they will as long as they're allowed to, before even stronger forces destroy them. But as Dutch Engstroem puts it at one point: "We don't HANG nobody!" They just kill those who oppose them, and only way to successfully oppose them is to kill them.Well, this movie gives me goosebumps every time I see it (since January 1985, when it was shown on Finnish TV for the first time, some 100 times) for the reasons I mentioned above, but of course I'm a sane person and it's still only a movie. It just awakens those deeply buried animal instincts... like btw does a brilliant werewolf-movie The Howling... A man... A beast...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Modern Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah, John Woo, and Quentin Tarantino are three directors who are probably often mentioned in the same breath. The reason? Their films are very similar one sense: they are brutally, shockingly and graphically violent. Unfortunately, this often prevents people from seeing another similarity: their films are almost all brilliant, and The Wild Bunch is no exception.The Wild Bunch is the story of two groups of outlaws; one, a group of aging bandits led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), fleeing from a botched bank holdup and reduced to being gunrunners for a Mexican general. The other, a ragtag bunch of hoodlums sent to catch the Wild Bunch. They are barely held together by Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), who has old ties to Bishop. As Thortnon's group chases the bunch through Mexico, Pike and the rest of the old outlaws learn slowly but surely that this is the new west; it is a west of technology. It is a west where killing, once a necessary evil, is quick, efficient, and for the new generation, fun. We see this early on, as the bunch rides into to town watching children callously throw scorpions to be ripped apart by ants. Later, Thortnon asks the Railroad boss who sends him to get Pike, "How does it feel t'be so damn right all the time?!", being able to sit back and let other do the killing for him.The film is paced brilliantly, and the flashbacks in the director's cut are vital to the understanding of the characters. All the performances, from vets like Holden, Ryan and Earnest Borgnine, are fantastic. Then, of course, there is the issue everyone goes back to; the violence. This is one of the most graphic films I have seen, even by today's standards. blood, bullets and bodies fly through the air in slow motion, probably lighting the fire in John Woo's belly. The final scene is one that sticks with you for days, a ballet of squibs and red paint.This is a western that is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good film about American outlaws in Mexico, running from the law led by an old friend, robbing trains, etc. It is dated, seeming like an old John Wayne vehicle. In fact Wayne could have easily fit into the role of Pike (Holden's character), the leader of the outlaw gang. Oddly enough, the music score gets in the way. Making it seem more dated. Less of that old 60's dramatic theme would have been better. This was made at the time Clint Eastwood was making his western epics and this film tries to borrow the violence of those.***SPOILER AHEAD The end of this film and Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid are strangely alike. Wild Bunch was released June/69 and Butch in Sept/69, It's ironic that these 2 films could end the same way. But, I really knew that the outlaws would get it in the end, Peckinpaw made it too obvious. Good wins out over bad. At least in American made westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does indeed cover an array of leads whom live up to the film's title, as misadventures; duels; heists and standoffs amount to a wild ride through gritty western territory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Wild Bunch, that cheeky American director of all things mostly sordid with a blackly pulp attitude Sam Peckinpah, paints a vast and quite frightening vista of early twentieth century wild west U.S.A. Feeding off of Leone's westerns of not-so-many years before, his 1969 film takes the action away from quaint little small desert towns and into the back-o-beyond of nowhere; providing us with very little in the way of moral or particularly upstanding characters and instead piling on extra helpings of unrestrained oneupmanship and unprincipled adventure. Where the characters whom will come to resemble whatever 'lead' tag you wish to attribute to them are forced into confronting both their age and the sort of condition they're physically in, Peckinpah holds up the proverbial mirror to the American western as a whole as his tale unravels in an ever changing world slowly beginning to phase out those whom came to dominate past proceedings. His film is a spacious, sweeping, seemingly endless tale of chase and crime and redemption across the boundless landscapes of 1913 Texas featuring a handful of key characters, each of whom are given certain respective dues, and a lot of mean spirited supporting one's relegated to occupying those roles of dirty corrupt Mexicans and ill-informed hicks lead around. Despite all that's wrong with it, Peckinpah's often veering into over-the-top territory when his skill is clearly in more intimate; lower-scale skirmishes between sides involving small groups of people as seen in a number of his films from Ride the High Country to Straw Dogs, the film remains a fruitful exercise in western genre filmmaking.We begin on Pike Bishop (Holden), a man riding along with a number of others; each of them dressed as somebody of great honour, soldiers in uniform trotting along in a formal, patterned manner, his second in command of whom is Dutch Engstrom (Borgnine). Where they're heading is into a small town, the issue of classical American westerns of old here addressed in that starting out with a lone rider or gentleman riding with his accomplice into a town on the edge so as to sort out the villains and put back some kind of order to proceedings was usually the norm. The Wild Bunch goes some length to reverse this trend, Bishop effectively revealed as a gangster; as a crook and of a no-good ilk there in disguise to thieve valuables from an establishment under what appears a perfect guise. Bishop appears methodical, calm and reassuring but with a streak in him that's sinful enough to have got him to where he is here and now; the reigning in of a potential lashing out at a bystander on the ride in studiously observed, the blunt and cut-throat tone which accompanies the order to his minions that they should kill the employees of where they're robbing if they so much as even move additionally quite chilling.The crew get away after a bloody and chaotic shootout, loosing many along the way for not an awful lot in the way of reward; the chief of the railroad from whom Brishop and his crew have just attempted to steal coming to employ an ex-prisoner named Deke Thornton (Ryan), whose task it is to hunt Bishop and company down. For Thornton, much rather the blank antagonist upon which the long dusty trail is an excuse for the film to unleash blind violence and chase, he is informed to both the audience as well as Bishop's clan by the man himself as being "the best" at hunting those down whom need finding. This knowledge comes from Bishop and Thornton's past interactions during which they worked together, now each other's nemesis as Thornton himself is given a blunt ultimatum to which he must work toward or face going back to Yuma prison ? something it's inferred is nary a good thing.The film is first a foremost a treacherous chase thriller about a large but somewhat incompetent group of men chasing another, smaller but more methodical group of men for some relatively high stakes. For some of Bishop's crew, they have been kept on the metaphorical hamster wheel following the debacle of the opening heist; the film a workmanlike last-job thriller during which the two leaders of each gang are forced into coming to terms with how old they're getting; the changing world around them as the modern age creeps in at a glacial pace and gracefully acknowledge the youth of the day being one thing compared to what times were once like.The film divulges into a fresher tale about the robbing of some armaments for a Mexican General living in a fort with his fellow hoodlums rife with sleaze and poverty; their depiction counteracted by that of the character of Angel (Snchez) whom rode with Bishop's gang from the offset, a character that berates the Mexican General and his bloodthirsty ideas which will surely bring about the demise of more of Angel's own; a Mexican character allowed to feel and come across as humanistic in comparison. The heist itself, of which in another film might act as a fitting establishment sequence getting across how effective and well these men work together or indeed a climactic denouement but here inserted half way through the piece, is a quite wondrous sequence seeing the men attempt to swipe an arsenal of guns amidst onlooking guards and a hissing, steaming train whose noises act as a pulsating overlying soundtrack to Bishop and his crew's ever meticulous advancing. The film aims high, hits several notes and explores both its characters and themes in a manner as outlandish and as grandeur as Peckinpah's direction and the immensity of the locale which is put across; all of which culminate in a western thoroughly worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cast iron stomach is a must for watching Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, a 2 1/2 hour septic tank of machismo and masochism. Rarely will you see such a gore-saturated, over-serious, and incoherent mess of a western, with William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Ben Johnson, and Warren Oates grimly blasting away with manly nobility (while Robert Ryan, L.Q. Jones, and Strother Martin notch their stocks with buzzard-like abandon; Ryan finds his compatriots revolting, but that's a small matter).Peckinpah does score points cinematically. His use of interposed flash cuts intensifies the mayhem, but at what cost? But by the ending credits, the KIA count is in the hundreds--and darn near every one of the horizontal is saturated in ketchup.Unless you really believe that immersing yourself in this nauseating vat of sanguine symbolism, deeply moving whiskey drinking, and Ben Johnson grabbing a Mexican woman's breasts and displaying them to brother Oates as if they were fish he just caught, makes for a special experience in great film-making, save yourself the cost of a bottle of the pink stuff . . . and the lining of your stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie shows why the wild west was wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wild Bunch" was truly the first western of its kind. Showing head-on, ultra-gruesome violence, the movie pulls no punches. Focusing on a group of aging outlaws (William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien) going in for one last showdown, the movie shows what the Old West really was. Within the first ten minutes of the movie, there must be 100 people killed; moreover, the ant-and-scorpion scene shows the younger generation getting desensitized to violence.All in all, "The Wild Bunch" affirmed a total break from the John Wayne mold (as did another western in 1969: "Once Upon a Time in the West"). I can't think of any western in recent years that has equalled this movie's quality. You have to see it to believe it. But don't try to see if you're squeamish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilersThe 'Classical Age' of the Old West, as portrayed in movies, was approximately the quarter-century following the end of the American Civil War. Westerns set after that period, particularly those set in the early twentieth century, tend to be elegiac in tone, with a suggestion that an age is coming to an end; 'The Shootist', set in 1901, is a good example.'The Wild Bunch' is another example of a post-1900 Western which focuses on the theme of the changing West. It follows the fortunes of a group of ageing outlaws who have for many years made a living through robbery and violence. References to the short-lived regime of General Huerta across the border in Mexico suggest that the year is 1913 or 1914. The film starts with an attempt by the gang (or 'The Bunch', as they call themselves) to rob a bank in a small town in southern Texas, dressed in stolen military uniforms. Unfortunately for them, they have been set up, and are ambushed by a band of vigilantes led by Deke Thornton, a former member of the Bunch, who has been hired to capture them by a railroad boss. The ambush leads to a shoot-out with numerous people being killed- both members of the Bunch and of the vigilantes, as well as innocent bystanders. The surviving members of the Bunch manage to escape, and set off for the Mexican border with Thornton's men in pursuit. The American West of the 1910s was a more peaceful and law-abiding place than it had been thirty or forty years previously, and the age of the outlaw was coming to an end. Most of the Bunch are middle-aged or elderly; they continue to live the lives of outlaws because they, quite literally, cannot imagine any alternative. In Mexico, however, things were different, as the overthrow of the authoritarian regime of General Diaz in 1910 led to a decade of revolution and civil war. It is notable that the one youthful member of the Bunch, Angel, is himself a Mexican. The Bunch become involved with General Mapache, a Huertista commander, and reach an agreement that, in exchange for payment in gold, they will rob an American munitions train in order to provide him with the guns and ammunition he needs to defeat a peasant uprising. Although the Bunch succeed in stealing the weapons, they fall out with their Mexican allies, leading to a bloody climax.When this film was made in 1969 it was criticised for allegedly excessive violence. Certainly, it is a violent film, more so than most sixties films. Gunplay and bloodshed were nothing new in Westerns, but the two big set-pieces here- the failed bank raid and the battle between the Bunch and the Mexican army- have more in common with full-scale military engagements than they do with the traditional Western shootout. At times, in fact, the violence seems gratuitous rather than realistic- I doubt whether, in real life, the Mexicans would have taken so long to overcome a small band of desperadoes or have suffered so many casualties in doing so. Nevertheless, although the film may have seemed shocking in 1969, it seems less so today after three and a half decades of increasingly violent films.The film does, however, differ from the traditional Western in a more fundamental way. Previous Westerns had generally had a firm moral code at their centre; acts of violence or villainy could be shown, but there was always a figure (or group or figures) standing up for right and justice, and good normally triumphed over evil in the end. There are innumerable examples, including the characters played by Gary Cooper in 'High Noon', Alan Ladd in 'Shane', Burt Lancaster in 'Gunfight at the OK Corral' and John Wayne in most of his films. 'The Wild Bunch' dispenses with this traditional morality. On the American side of the border, the forces of law are nowhere to be seen; the vigilantes are as ruthless and lawless as the men they are pursuing, if not more so, and it is doubtful whether they have any legal authority for their actions. On the Mexican side, duly constituted authority is represented only by a brutal general in the service of a repressive regime. Much has been made of the Bunch's 'code of honour', chiefly involving loyalty to one another, but, for a criminal, a code of honour can be a two-edged weapon. On the one hand, it can prevent him from descending from mere criminality into psychopathy; on the other, it can act as an obstacle to repentance or reform. A man who scrupulously observes his own private code of conduct can come to see himself as a superior moral being with a licence to disregard rules of conduct laid down by others, including rules as fundamental as 'Thou shalt not kill' and 'Thou shalt not steal'.As well as being criticised for violence, the film was also much praised. There may have been a connection between the criticism and the praise; during the late sixties and early seventies there was a tendency among liberal critics to overpraise any ultra-violent film, if only as a rebuke to those conservative critics who objected to violence on moral grounds, with the result that the label 'masterpiece' was applied a number of films that hardly deserved the honour. In my view 'The Wild Bunch' is one of those films. It is a competently made Western, even a good one, but no masterpiece. There is some good acting, especially from William Holden as Pike Bishop, the leader of the Bunch. The big set-piece action sequences are well done, as is the photography of the dry, dusty desert scenes, a physical landscape as arid as the moral landscape inhabited by the characters. There are scenes of grim humour or irony, such as the juxtaposition of the bank raid with a hymn-singing temperance meeting, or the scene where the Bunch discover that their raid has netted them not gold or silver coins, as they had thought, but near-worthless steel washers. Nevertheless, the film's lack of a moral centre is, in my view, its main weakness. We are unable to sympathies with either the Bunch or with those who oppose them, and as a result the film generates little excitement. The film does not really try to analyse the causes of violence or make us care about the result. We spend two and a half hours watching, in Matthew Arnold's words, ignorant armies clash by night- a metaphorical 'night of the soul' if not a literal one. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented The Wild Bunch on the premise that it was a classic western that I had not seen - a serious omission for a person who tries to view all the best movies. About an hour into this snore-invoking extravaganza, I realized that I had, in fact, seen it and completely forgotten it! Therefore, it made no impression on me the the first time I viewed it, and even less on me this time.The movie has a wonderful cast, boasting William Holden, Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Strother Martin, Dub Taylor, and a bevy of overly tortilla-fed Mexican cuties momentarily baring their chubby breasts for the camera. It also boasts a favored director in Sam Peckinpah.The movie makes little sense, and engenders not an iota of sympathy for its rather obnoxious characters. In fact, they are so lame that they don't even garner our dislike --- we just don't care about them. TWB also contains a musical score that further alienates the viewer, overbearing and improperly emphatic in all the wrong places.I cannot explain the high ratings for this epic, except to surmise that these viewers were so grateful when this mess finally ended that they gave it too many stars in justifiable relief.If you want to see a good Peckinpah work, rent The Getaway (also featuring a great turn by Ben Johnson). If you want to watch a great William Holden, rent Stalag 17 or Network. If you want to see Borgnine at his best, rent Marty or the Poseidon Adventure. If you want an 'ender' western, see The Unforgiven (of even Cat Ballou for fun). If you need an ensemble western partly in Mexico, get the Magnificent Seven. But avoid this over-rated turkey by all means!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: showing its age, meanders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no problem with westerns, even old ones. I liked The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, and loved Unforgiven, and others. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get into The Wild Bunch. I think I 'get it', a few talented men gang up with a bunch of losers (on both goodguy and badguy sides) and the losers basically drag 'em all down into chaos. And the whole "end of an era" is pretty cool.Unfortunately, the film seriously meanders. There are long scenes that don't seem to have any point -- they don't move along the characterizations or the storyline. Maybe it's because I'm watching the "full-length version" of 127 minutes that it's so boring. It's not clear who's doing what why. Someone gets shot and the people around don't seem to mind. There's nothing like a good set up of motivations and goals. And the version I watched (VHS 1989 full-length version) was out of focus. At times I couldn't really tell the characters apart... they all have beards and are dressed the same.I think a lot of people rate a film for how good it was when it came out. I prefer to rate how a film is doing now... that way I can use ratings to decide what I want to see today. Well, action and drama have moved on from 1969 and I felt this film was seriously showing its age.Who should see this film:-- Art classics types only. You have a real racket going on in making the rest of us feel unworthy because when it's boring we call it boring. Don't send me hate mail. A work should stand on its own and if I found it boring that's a valid opinion.I'm going to give The Wild Bunch a disappointing 3 out of 10. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different sort of western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of the film the opening credits keep interrupting the movie. That is really annoying. Now moving on.The film is about the adventures of a gang of outlaws, and to a lesser degree a gang of mercenaries hired to bring them down. The new world is closing around the outlaws and the age is also starting to catch up with some of them. As far as Westerns go, this is the least original premise you could go with. However, that is just the skeleton. The film succeeds in strapping enough meat onto that skeleton to make the movie interesting and exciting. The storyline is loose, more of a set of adventures rather than a cohesive whole, but it is interesting nonetheless.A lot about Wild Bunch feels like a modern film. It is quite gritty; the music has modern rhythms; the characters are dark. In older westerns, whenever bandits are made to be the protagonists, they are also made to be misunderstood souls full of heart. In the Wild Bunch the outlaws, despite being the protagonists, do some pretty reprehensible things?well, at least sometimes.Perhaps the largest problem with the film is that it takes too much freedom with its characters (and by extension its story). The film starts showing the bandits as crazed violent people, but it appears that the makers could not resist adding more honor and humour to these gangsters, perhaps out of fear of making them too unlikable to the viewer. And so towards the end of the film they start acting more and more like heroes. Two of these guys in particular are portrayed as greedy criminal side-kicks in the beginning but in the end they get heroic for no particular reason other than "Why not?", as one of them put it.In fact, the whole tone starts shifting together with the characters and becomes more and more light-hearted towards the middle of the film.Besides this strange character identity issue, the acting is actually quite good. Of particular note is the Mexican warlord played by a gentleman named Emilio Fernndez. On paper that character is just a power-hungry warlord but the Mexican actor breathes life into the character with good facial expressions. He is perhaps the most memorable character in the film.There is unfortunately a good deal of overacting, like people laughing hysterically when there is nothing funny to laugh about. In fact, there is a lot of that in this movie.For the most part the film looks good. It has good atmosphere with its smoky Mexican villages and bath houses and mountains. There is however a problem in this film from which many of the modern action movies suffer: the cuts during the main action scenes are too fast. You lose track of what is going on.The music does not have a memorable tune for you to whistle, but is nonetheless interesting because it has a lot of modern asymmetry, with many different instruments coming in to do the various tasks required each time and doing so using special rhythmic patterns.There is a recurrent little tune and when I heard it I immediately felt that these guys were ripping off The Magnificent Seven, until I found out that The Magnificent Seven came out 10 years after this movie. Food for thought? This film is not perfect. There are little things like a scene where you hear a man talk, but can see his mouth is not moving. There is an issue with the character development and an issue with the mood. There is just something off about its whole structure, including characters and story. Having said that, it still feels worth watching for its off-beat violent delivery and good atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Re-seeing 'The Wild Bunch' after many years, it still packs an emotional punch as well as containing some good action. But the middle is somewhat slack, and the characters do not have enough to say to each other after the initial 30 minutes of dialogue. While the Peckinpah misogyny and downright dismissal of greaser Mexican machine gun fodder is off putting - and this will count more against the film as the years roll by, because the obvious Vietnam War parallels and references will be lost on newer generations! The performances are excellent, especially in view of the lack of new character material in the final hour, and the themes in the much greater but smaller Peckinpah movie - 'Ride The High Country' - eg ageing cowboys in a disappearing West and the bonds of male friendship in an uncertain, more selfish, capitalist world, are well rendered. However, the big shoot out at the end is overdone, although it brutally and symbolically shows the futility of and randomness of death in new modernised warfare as particularly practised in Vietnam. If only we could have seen the full 'Major Dundee!'</fullReview>

The acting either: it perfectly fits the story. But that story is too much stamped with nostalgia. There are no heroes. Just old tired cowboys eager to retire but whose lives only mean something when they are on the run. Hence the discrepancy between the action scenes and the few nostalgic flashbacks. Well these are part of the director's cut re-release. They help to understand Pike's and Thornton's characters but you never really get involved.

		<shortDescription>among the worst I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just viewed the director's cut of this film this evening. On the plus side: a good selection of talent, and some interesting camera work.On the negative, I'd have to say overall, that this film seemed slapped together from a bunch of sequences bearing only a general relationship to each other. The 'story,' if you can describe it as such, was developed almost as though by a drop out film student. Editing was on par with bad kung fu movies; often one scene did not support or lead into the next. The use of crossfades was baffling, ie, crossfades usually express the passage of time; in this film, they were often used when a simple cut would have been appropriate. The director seemed to have just discovered push ins and pull backs, and way overused them in the sense that they didn't help the story, and made the camera an uninvited actor.Jumps were downright rude and disorienting...the sense of time and timing was clearly not respected or considered. Laughter scenes seemed non-sequitur to the larger scene within which they appeared and left me scratching my head. The lack of coherence and mature story telling made this film, to me, preposterous. I read here that Peckinpah was 'mistunderstood' for his use of violence, but this film's gun scenes seemed motivated by "Oh, yeah...we better use up these bullets." Gunfight scenes were a sort of free-for-all, not well choreographed, with seriously undisciplined camera sequences leaving the viewer on his own to sort out the random action. I didn't get a feeling of excitement or danger, only of "what the heck IS this thing?"Considering other quality films of this era, I'd have to say that you can't chalk this disaster up to having been made 30 years ago.What do I consider a benchmark film of the Western genre? High Noon. I'd take any 5 minutes of that film over this 3-hour trip to wackyland anyday.-joe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I am not a fan of westerns, but only because I have not really been exposed to any other than whatever random my dad would watch on the occasional Sunday afternoon. I did enjoy this movie, but I cannot say that is one of the best westerns of all time because I have not really seen any other Westerns. I must say that I loved how there were no good guys in the movie, but we had people to root for. I would not say that any of them were bad guys, but just a consequence of their environment. There were a lot of really good set pieces, but over all I would say that the movie suffered from a lot of things that make it harder for me to connect to older movies. In particular the laughing was the thing that bothered me the most. It seemed as if they were forcing their laughter way too much and their were certain scenes I was literally rolling my eyes. Nothing really stood out to me as great to me. A lot of it was good and very little of it was bad, but it just did not resonate with me. I really loved the walk at the end. That really was a great scene and that is how I want to meet my own death. NO FEAR!! The violence was hokey, but I was expecting that, but there was a lot more nudity than I was expecting. I liked most of the characters well enough, but no one stood out to me. I really usually like the whole brotherhood part, but I honestly think the over the top laughing killed that for me. I guess one of my favorite parts was the train robbery. It had a lot of tension and I really was not sure how it would end. The explosion of the bridge while not super big was pretty cool to watch. I also found it interesting how much it looked like animals were actually getting hurt. Besides the insects at the beginning some of the horses looked like they took a beating. Not thrilled with movie and I am not sure if it will turn me onto the Western Genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously a harbinger, but lacking now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, when examining other major works that appeared around the same time, stands out as a true harbinger of the violent, lawless era of film that we live in today. Most of the reasons why this movie does not seem extraordinarily interesting to the general populace is because most of its themes have been copied and recopied many times over... and quite frankly, done more tightly and with more control than was allowed to Peckinpah at the time. The violence in the film, while slightly over-the-top, is nothing compared to what we live in today with the age of "Kill Bill". That said, I still believe this is a beautifully shot film and certainly one of the best-acted Westerns. William Holden is spectacular. But in today's music-video era, it does not hold the power it did long ago. As a major film aficionado, I found myself squirming several times and attempting to defend the film to the rest of its audience as a pioneering film- which it is. Unfortunately, this should not have to be done... In any case, I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well-acted, technically competent, visually striking, and even containing flashes of brilliance.It baffles me, however, that this movie could ever have been considered among the greatest of all time--even in the 60s, when its moral nihilism might have passed as revolutionary hipness, or when gruesome violence in major movies was fairly new, and people didn't yet realize that any bozo could explode a squib.The funny scenes aren't funny, the touching scenes aren't touching, and the exciting scenes aren't exciting (unless you think Steven Seagal movies are exciting). The characters and plot are completely uncompelling. The notion of modernity leaving the Old West's gunslingers behind was not particularly original, even in 1969 (see, e.g., SHANE and LIBERTY VALANCE), though I will grant Peckinpah some originality points for taking the position that modernity was not entirely an improvement. And at 145 minutes, it's way too long...and boring, if I can say that without being set upon by a band of ravening film critics.But if you like bang-bang shoot-em-up action flicks, here's one you can admit to watching in your college sociology course. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sam Peckinpah's two hour and twenty-five minute long 1969 Western classic, The Wild Bunch, is certainly an influential and important film, but, compared to the other great Western released that year, Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West, it has not held up nearly as well. There are several reasons for this fact, and by making that statement I am not stating that Peckinpah's film is in any way a bad film. No. It's merely a good film that has been passed by later films, and lacks the depth Leone's film still does. Part of the reason is that Leone's film is far more stylized and revolutionary. No, that film is not nearly as violent as Peckinpah's, and it is the violence of The Wild Bunch (and occasionally claims of its mainstreaming slow motion cinematography mixed with quick cutting) that is usually the lynchpin to arguments for its revolutionary status, not its more straightforward and derivative storytelling; although the earlier Bonnie And Clyde, by director Arthur Penn, deserves more of the credit (or blame) for mainstreaming over the top and slow motion violence. Compare the openings of the two films. In Peckinpah's film there is the great opening montage where the heroes/villains are introduced, and then the action is frozen into a black and white image. We see children sadistically dropping scorpions on to red anthills, then setting the wee creatures ablaze. Then we see the heroes, dressed as good guy American soldiers become vicious killers as they rob a bank, then get in a shootout with bounty hunters during a Temperance March. Leone's film shows almost nothing happen for the same amount of time. We see a train station captured, and wait. This is visual poesy. Peckinpah's is prose, albeit with tweaks. Now consider the two leading men used as psychopathic killers. In Peckinpah's film it's William Holden, a second level leading man. But in Leone's film it's Henry Fonda- one of Hollywood's towering filmic giants of American decency. Leone's choice is far more fundamentally disturbing. Then there is the actual story lines of the films. For all the claims of upsetting the apple cart, Peckinpah's tale is punctuated with numerous poorly scripted scenes. There are numerous moments where the characters in the gang simply do not speak realistically, and where they force laughter, like at the end of a bad TV sitcom- there's the scene with the sauna, with the whores, the scene where Angel's villagers steal weapons from the gang, and others. Leone has no such moments, and although there is less actual violence in Leone's films, there is nothing within Peckinpah's film as primally shocking nor disconcerting as watching Fonda's character murder the whole McBain clan?. Despite its reputation, this overrated film gives no real insight into either the Old West nor the human condition, and certainly nothing new. Too much of it, especially in interior stage shots, and in some of the dialogue and forced laughter between the gang members, feels like refried Bonanza, or other banal TV Westerns of the era, whereas Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West was wholly original. Peckinpah's film is a good, but not great, film, even if it is an enjoyable diversion for an afternoon, and was certainly influential- just look at the final shot of Lyle Gorch at the machine gun and there is an almost identical pose struck by James Franciscus at the end of Beneath The Planet Of the Apes, released a year later. If one goes into this film fresh, it will be an enjoyable film, a cut above the simpleminded John Wayne tripe that dominated the silver screen for the three decades prior, but if one expects a true masterpiece, disappointment is bound to follow. Choose ignorance?.you know how the rest of that saying goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>confusing character development weakens film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me the major weakness of this picture was Peckinpah's development of his characters. Were they good guys or bad? Did they love or hate each other? What virtue, if any, did they have? There are scenes in which they are quite ruthless, with each other and with others.But in the end of the movie they all die for one of their group. One who was never really a part of the group, one who had already declared his greatest loyalty was 'to his people, "the Mexican people" ? not to them.As far as their character development, this sacrifice makes no sense at all. It simply wasn't in their character for these hard nosed, calculating criminals to make such a sacrifice. It only makes sense in the context of William Holden's one speech, and that is not enough to support this heroic, sacrificial action.The other thing that confused me was the constant laughter of the main characters throughout the movie. What did this signify? Often what they laughed at did not seem at all that humorous. If this was supposed to reveal character it was a confusing revelation.Aside from this, rather major flaw, the picture is very well directed. I suspect it is this, not on the strength of the script, upon which its fame rests.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK first of my movie classics to watch for the first time and wow? Hope they get better than this???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of my friends and fans of my reviews have sent me messages saying why don't i give some of the classics a watch? So what i have decided to do is pick a list of some and write my reviews on them. Well the first on my list is obviously The Wild Bunch. I am one that is not afraid to offer my true convictions on one of the classics, maybe that's why so many wanted my opinion? Anyhow having just watched a pretty cool little documentary on directors in the 60's and 70's entitled Easy Riders To Raging Bulls, sorry if i got the name slightly wrong as i am having a memory burp. In this documentary they detail a lot of the goings on with the directors during a wild time and era, eg; drugs, women you name it! They talked a lot about the late Sam Peckinpah and The Wild Bunch so i said its time to get this off the to do list and have a watch. For the first half I was bored silly in fact so bored that i almost said screw this and moved down to the next on my list. i like the cast but i'm afraid I'm still a fan of only a couple of western's and they were both made in the 90's. I think i was more lured to this film as a result of more interest in Peckinpah's wild ways and wanted to see the end product cause of it. Also the only movie i really enjoyed that was one of Peckinpah's was 78's Convoy. The storyline was OK, the train heist was one of the highlights of this film, especially the bridge explosion. That being said this shootout at the end really gets me, OK i got it that the Mexican militia were drunk out of their minds including the general so in turn made it easy for Peck and his men just to waltz up to them toting shotguns, however as soon as they nailed the General you can't tell me that the whole army would've just sat there saying whoa! wait a minute? and started to get to their guns and the shooting, no they would've shot these men within getting within so many feet of him. No but suspension of disbelief i know was extremely required however at least make it look legit. I can see however that the violence in this film rocked the nation so to speak cause of the time frame and the Wild Bunch actually showed bullets penetrating the actors and the ensuing splatter for the first time. That in itself was the reason i continued to watch this colossal waste of time. Sorry guys, but next....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing shoot-em-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film begins promisingly but deteriorates fast. Its opening sequence, depicting a town torn up by indiscriminate gunfire -- cross-cut by scenes of a sadistic desperado toying obscenely with his hostages -- is stunning, both in terms of the cinematography and the fact that kids and other bystanders are felled in the crossfire. But the movie goes seriously downhill from there.We tag along with a bunch of aging thugs led by Pike (played by the only mildly interesting William Holden), who are being chased by some bumbling lawmen led by Deke (Robert Ryan). Holden and Ryan look so similar it's hard to distinguish one group's intentions from the other's initially.The outlaws are an incongruous bunch. One does feel for Pike when he recalls having escaped death while bedding a Mexican beauty. Yet when gang member Angel (Jaime Sanchez) kills his slutty ex- in cold blood, and no one so much as raises a word of disapproval, we recoil from the robbers' depravity. Stretches of this film include dialogue that cannot be understood, due to the eccentricity of the speaker or the fact that it is in Spanish, sans subtitles, and the action of the movie drags egregiously in spots.I lacked the patience to see this movie through to the end, but I'm glad I got to sample the work of fabled director Sam Peckinpah. Even so, this movie cries out for editing and a voice coach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I greatly admire the Sergio Leone trilogy "A Fistful of Dollars", "For a Few Dollars More", and "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly". Having never seen "The Wild Bunch", I was curious if the film could live up to it's much touted reputation. The good, is fine acting by the veteran cast, and some plot surprises. The bad, is that the movie drags, especially the middle 45 minutes, and logic seems to have been sacrificed for spectacle. The ugly is that this could have been a better movie if it was less stylized, and had tighter plotting. The ending becomes cartoon-like, and definitely not believable. This may be on a par with Leone's weakest, "Duck You Sucker", but in no way is this superior to "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly". = MERK</fullReview>

However, I can tell that it's the kind of movie that the viewer must be in the right mindset to see. There is a lot of violence and folks who simply do not care about the lives of others. William Holden plays the main character. He doesn't look ANYTHING like the character he played in that movie with Audrey Hepburn and Hump Bogart. I can't remember the name of it but Harrison Ford was in the remake. William Holden did look authentic though. He looked like a COWBOY should have looked. In otherwords, hardened and rough. The final scene with the circle shaped machine gun was horrific. When I say HORRIFIC, I mean that it was VIOLENT. I have heard that for that era, this was the most violent movie ever made. It's a decent movie but moves slow. If you want a good and violent western, I would suggest HANG EM' HIGH.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made but I'd hate to watch more Westerns like this one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very long Western about a group of criminals during the years leading up to America's entry into WWI. These criminals, led by William Holden, were selfish and greedy and in an effort to catch them, bodies and blood were shed on an unheard of scale in this Sam Peckinpah directed film. Technically speaking, aside from some very over-indulgent scenes (I hated all the slow-motion stuff and the scorpion scene--the imagery was far from subtle), this is a very well-made film. The acting is excellent, the script very familiar (much like the earlier film, THE PROFESSIONALS) but new enough to make it stand out from other Westerns and it was exciting.So, why, with so much to recommend it and a very high score on IMDb do I wish to never watch more Westerns like it?! Well, the film was so freaking Nihilistic and violent. In this film, there were no heroes--none. The railroad authorities (in the form of Albert Dekker) were not the good guys--they could have cared less about all the innocent civilians who were slaughtered. As for Robert Ryan and his band of bounty hunters....well, they were scum and seemed much like evil versions of "Larry, Darryl and Darryl" from the Newhart Show. The Wild Bunch itself, all murderers who supposedly redeem themselves in the end, but this end seemed more like a pointless job of butchery and not an act of justice. The American Army,...they were just there to look stupid and be killed. And, perhaps, Pancho Villa's troops were the closest thing to heroes in the film, though you never really learned about their cause or that the real-life Villa was a cut-throat and vicious killer. Never before this movie had there been a film so jam-packed full of worthless and vile people. Now in a way, doing such a film isn't a bad idea--after all, the utter futility of it all is a big message you are left with when the film is complete. But Peckinpah's twisted vision of the West also led to other more modern films where it seems that entertainment is watching others die and heroes, as we've come to know them, are non-existent. As for me, in the long run, I could have lived without this well-made but unfortunately oft-copied film. Give me some heroes instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over wrought. Over praised.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With nothing whatsoever to do with the demise of 'The Old West' -- quite why it has escaped so many that the Mexican border ain't in the West -- and everything to do with Peckinpah's increasingly desperate attempts to vindicate himself as a film maker, 'The Wild Bunch' remains today exactly what it was 30 years ago: an irrelevance.Incapable of addressing (in nigh on three hours) the kind of intellectual challenge Leone used to routinely dispense with in under three minutes -- you want to see the demise of the Old West? Watch the tracking shot of horse and wagon crossing the railway line in 'Once Upon A Time In The West' -- 'The Wild Bunch' lacks even the blood and guts to go for the kind of straightforward nihilism of Boorman and Marvin ('Point Blank').Instead, there's an authorial inconsistency throughout the entire movie, an inability to decide whether the central characters are revolting scum or, in some strange way, mythic heroes.Of course, they're revolting scum, and even more: mass murderers, to judge by the opening shoot out, killers on the make, on the take, on the run. Quite why Peckinpah ever figured that this kind of saddle trash was worthy of chronicling is a mystery, albeit one smaller than the greater mystery of why so many viewers found within the amoral husks of Pike's gang men to admire, men to applaud, men to weep over.Still. There is much to weep over, not least the waste of so much talent, and not merely Peckinpah's alone: Ballard's as well as that of all the leading players, actors whose own strengths bring to the characters a humanity that isn't there nor was ever there.Ten years earlier, Sturges took exceptional care to ensure consistency of characterisation in 'The Magnificent Seven'. Peckinpah's revisit, this time with Mexican baddies so ludicrously one-dimensional Eli Wallach's earlier essay seems Oscar-winning in its complexity, has no idea at all what it's trying to say or where it's attempting to go.And it's that lack of compass, moral as well as narratively, that ultimately consigns this film to the trashcan.As another IMDb reviewer wrote earlier, 'The Wild Bunch' has been absurdly over-praised. Far worse though is that it was criticised on release for all the wrong reasons: its violent balletics, its slo-mo gore. Well, so what?Many of the same elements were present in Leone's work, but as dressing for the content, not the content itself.And therein, of course, resides the difference between the self abused visual talent of the American film maker and the comprehensive genius of the Italian maestro, the latter's seminal 'Once Upon A Time In The West' remaining not only one of the best Westerns of all time but one of the finest movies of all time, something so multi-layered of meaning and of cinematic and theatrical technique that by comparison 'The Wild Bunch' is no more than the grubbiest of trifles, its serial inadequacies highlighted by the fact that Leone's narrative elements include within their vast span not only the meagre ingredients Peckinpah managed to whisk together -- trains, railroads, eras, departures -- but more. Much, much more.The end of the West signalled by 'The Wild Bunch'?More like the end of all sense of critical facility amongst far, far too many.Thirty years on and the verdict is still the same where the Western is concerned. To Ford belonged the horse, but to Leone belonged the opera. And to Peckinpah, sadly, very little at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I FINALLY GET IT--IT'S A COMEDY. "Mr Thornton, it's them." DUH!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most critics consider director Sam Peckinpah's western to be a seminal work in the genre. I guess this is because Peckinpah depicted people being shot as though they were actually taking a bullet. Prior to this, characters in Westerns would clutch their stomachs, call out for their mamas and fall to the ground in dramatic Shakespearean fashion. Why critics thought this film was especially groundbreaking probably has to do with the fact that most film critics are lucky if they can make it to the popcorn stand and back without breaking a sweat. In other words, their range of actual experience is rather limited and seeing somebody get realistically shot seemed new and cool at the time. And of course it's all the rage now to glorify a director of Peckinpah's "vision", much like Stanley Kubrick. Movies don't have to entertain anymore, or make any sense as long as they're "different" and The Wild Bunch is different-as far as I know we even have the genre's first two gay killers in LQ Jones and Strother Martin. Now these two are FUNNY, but not as funny as Gen. Mapache with his finger superglued to the trigger of a Gatling gun.That the Western was dying as a genre in 1969 and the characters in the film were dying as viable villains also lends itself to overzealous analysis. Over 3600 scene-to-scene edits goes way past the point of reasonableness. It leaves the viewer dizzy in the wake of a director's blatant self-indulgence and disregard for his audience and honestly it's just plain tiresome to watch.My Opinion: Overrated with a capital "O" as well as overlong. I didn't find much of the honor among thieves that other reviews touted. All five of the "bunch" are losers. I will give credit to the director for his obvious passion for creativity, but does it work-NO! Aside from the blood and guts this film's departure from the tried and true western formula leaves you flat- there aren't any "good guys" in this movie. There was no one to root for or against-you just don't care one way or the other. This movie is totally pointless and the director knows this, it's a joke on the audience exemplified by the whiskey bottle scene where Warren Oates is left holding the empty bottle with nothing to drink- it's a metaphor for what you are left holding at the end of the movie-NOTHING. Although the big gun fight may have been groundbreaking at the time, I find it just doesn't make this movie into a classic all by itself. The entire rest of this film is MEDIOCRE at best. The bridge scene is the clear highlight of the film but where are the multiple camera angles when you REALLY need them??? Not only is it NOT the greatest Western of all time, and not even close to being one of the top 50 Westerns ever made, it's not even Peckinpah's best Western-that honor belongs to "Ride the High Country," a much less grotesque and far superior film.Most of what Peckinpah did was to borrow from the hugely popular Sergio Leone formula for violence, magnify it, and squirt some blood in the air in super-slow motion, while omitting the imagination that made Leone's films so great. Even the famous "walk" into Mapache's compound for the showdown is hilarious...with shotguns casually cradled in their arms and a dumb grin on their face these guys look like they're going duck hunting, not marching to their almost inevitable demise. "Glory through stupidity" is what I think the director is trying to convey in this scene.Final analysis: It's a joke on the public and the critics, all who refuse to say anything negative about this film. The final shoot out is hysterical and it offers William Holden's best line of the movie..."Bitch." Take a cue from Edmund O'Brien and Robert Ryan in the final scene....they're laughing along with the rest of the cast via flashbacks and so am I at anyone who thinks this is some sort of masterpiece. Is it creative film making-yes, does it pass for entertainment-NO, is it any good-NOPE. To those of you that insist this is the "greatest western of all time" I submit you don't know a hell of a lot about westerns. My suggestion to you all is to go rent the Trinity series, Lucky Luke, and Zachariah-you'll find them just as appealing as they are stupid and irrelevant, much like the Wild Bunch. Oh yeah, and don't forget to pick up a copy of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid while you're out, it's even worse. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's garbage but this comment may be helpful to anyone that liked the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of good actors here-borgnine,Johnson,o Brien,L.Q.Jones,etc.Too bad they are used for a very worn storyline-Small group of Americans go to other country and slaughter non-Americans many times their number.This time the country is Mexico where in real life General Pershing failed in the punitive expedition to capture Pancho Villa.Since the storyline has been used a lot through the years it more than likely is sure box office.That in turn would indicate there is a large audience that has a need to view this sort of superiority.If that's not true and a person could get on with their life without this kind of a movie leaving an impression there is no problem.That's not the situation though,while viewing this movie years ago in the theater a person seated behind me commented" Mexicans are crazy".The comment wasn't "Those Mexicans are crazy" or "The Mexicans in this movie are crazy".A so-called blood and guts director working for a money sucking movie studio was able to convince that viewer all Mexican's were the same.An isolated case? Doubtful.Here's the helpful part-when persons don't let movies make them feel superior to others they stand less chance of experiencing an unpleasant surprise.</fullReview>
