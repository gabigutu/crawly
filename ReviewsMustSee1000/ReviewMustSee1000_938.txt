		<shortDescription>Shaw's One Academy Award</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bernard Shaw was very wary about allowing his movies to be filmed. He had seen movies by other famous writers and dramatists thoroughly rewritten for the screen, and thoroughly wrecked as a result. So the greatest English speaking dramatist of the 20th Century held off from any involvement with motion pictures into the 1930s. Then he met Gabriel Pascal. Mr. Pascal was thoroughly honest. He admitted he did not have a cent to his name, but he also admitted a desire to produce all of Shaw's major plays as movies exactly as Shaw wanted them shown. Shaw was impressed and made an agreement giving Pascal a monopoly on all his plays for movie making. In return, Shaw was to be involved in the productions.It turned out to be a remarkably small but fruitful partnership. Of the over fifty plays of Shaw's output (not to mention several novels), only four were produced by Pascal. They are PYGMALION (1938), MAJOR BARBARA (1940), CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA (1945), and ANDROCLES AND THE LION (1952). They are all good films, and the first three have reason to be considered great. Shaw died in 1950, so he was not there to see (after Pascal's death) the decline in standards of films based on his plays - such as Otto Preminger's brave attempt at ST. JOAN, and the wretched THE MILLIONAIRESS with Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren.PYGMALION was a good choice for the first of the series, probably as it was the most popular comedy by Shaw. It was also one of the most controversial plays because of the problem that bedeviled the original production of 1914 and has effected it ever since: how is it supposed to end? Will Higgins and Eliza put aside their differences and admit they love each other and come together at the end?Shaw clearly felt that Pygmalion Higgins and Galatea Doolittle were doomed not to end in an embrace. He wanted the audience to be left thinking of Eliza as one of the 20th Century's "New Women", who is independent and strong, not just a piece of weak clay to be kneaded by an artistic and overpowering male ego. In the dialog (which he uses in the play and in the movie script) Shaw insisted that Eliza favors Freddy Eynesford-Hill over Higgins because Freddy is a weakling. All her life she has been dominated by strong men (first her father Alfred, then Higgins, and (although he is kinder) Col. Pickering). Freddy is the first one to show his need for guidance and help - he is shown at the beginning of the play as little better than a servant for his mother and sister, getting them a cab in the rain. But Shaw did not have an easy time with this view. The play was produced by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, one of England's leading stars of the Edwardian and Georgian stage (he was brother of critic and writer Sir Max Beerbohm, and his son David Tree plays Freddy in this film version). Beerbohm Tree felt that there was a real romance between Higgins and Doolittle, and insisted on playing it like that, to the point of throwing a bouquet of flowers to Eliza as she is leaving. Shaw was furious at this, and wrote a seven page afterword which (mercifully) is never read at productions. I saw Peter O'Toole as Higgins in 1988, with Amanda Plummer as Eliza, Lionel Jeffries as Pickering, and the late Sir John Mills as Alfred Doolittle, and the play ended on the right note of uncertainty wanted. It did not have a thin, bearded actor as Shaw coming out to read the afterward. In this afterward, Shaw said that Eliza learns from the brutal Higgins he is a confirmed bachelor devoted to his mother (an interesting psychological point there that another play could have been built from). She does marry Freddy, and (as Higgins had sneered) things are tough - though not due to Freddy being unfaithful but that he is not very sharp. But Col. Pickering helps them set up a florist business, and after awhile it prospers. Clara Eynesford-Hill (whose character is barely developed in the play or on the screen) does become a friend of the socialist and novelist H.G.Wells. Alfred Doolittle, after getting speech lessons from Higgins, becomes a popular speaker and writer on social issues. As you can see, Shaw's anger got the better of him.Shaw was convinced by Pascal (for business reasons) to soften the conclusion, by showing Eliza fleeing Higgins in Freddy's car, Higgins walking alone through London to his home, slamming the door of his study, causing the phonograph to go on, playing a record of Eliza's old voice talking. As he sits with head in his hands, Eliza shows up at the door, turns off the machine, and starts talking as on the record. But Higgins realizes it is her, although he does not turn around. He sits back with a happy, if smug expression on his face, pulls his hat down over his eyes, and says (shot from his back to Eliza), "Where the devil are my slippers, Eliza?" It is suggestive of a meeting of two souls, but it leaves it still in the air. It is superior to that idiotic afterward.George Bernard Shaw won his only Oscar for a screenplay for PYGMALION. It is a brilliant play and script, given top notched direction by Anthony Asquith and Leslie Howard, with Howard giving one of his three top performances in it as Higgins - ably matched by Wendy Hiller as Eliza and Wilfred Lawson as Doolittle. And it's conclusion was so good, it was kept by Learner and Lowe for MY FAIR LADY on stage and screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not My Fair Lady ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While My Fair Lady was a tremendous film which is a pleasure to watch and rewatch, Pygmalion is the true cinematic version of Shaw's work and this version is brilliant. While I still have mixed feelings about the Henry-Eliza relationship and the play ending, it has to be said that the two leads here are perfect for their roles. There were not many British actors better than Howard at the time for this type of thing, and Wendy Hiller never disappointed her audience once in her long career. A good film full of detail and feeling. The one sticking point is the weak and feeble Freddie who at least was given a personality in MFL. Here you can't wonder that Eliza is so quick to discard his attentions. A film which should be celebrated and treasured more in the UK than it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By George, they got it the first time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bernard Shaw editorialized and lectured on the need for uprooting obsolete notions of a rigid English class-structure in order for individuals to realize their full potential. He wrote the play "Pygmalion" in 1912 and 1913 as part-social protest, part-satire, part-comedy of manners. Its central character, Henry Higgins, a London teacher of elocution and expert in regional phonetics, makes a small wager with his friend and colleague, Colonel George Pickering, that he can take a waif from the streets, one Eliza Doolittle, and pass her off as the cream of the social crop. Using a pedagogical technique consisting mostly of inhumane badgering and humiliation, he manages to pull off the feat with unexpected success ? but at an emotional cost he does not foresee.Besides the inventive montage sequences illustrating the frustration of linguist Higgins as he transforms Eliza from Cockney flower-girl to the statuesque, gowned beauty who's mistaken for a royal princess at a diplomatic reception, there are other items which failed to materialize in Shaw's original transcript ? the use, for example, of the phrases, "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plains" and "Hurricanes hardly happen in Hartford, Hereford, and Hampshire," both of which became lyrics for Lerner and Lowe's musical version of the play. Additionally, in Shaw's original play, Higgins's irritating Hungarian nemesis is not given a name; here, for the first time, he is dubbed "Kaparthy."Leslie Howard, who co-directed this 1938 filmed version of the play, impersonates Higgins as a hard-core realist - diabolical, profane, impatient, sometimes maddening. And as Eliza, Wendy Hiller has her coy moments, particularly when she is "tried out" at a tea party given by Higgins's mother. Her carefully high-toned enunciation of "the new slang" is timed to perfection. The film, unfortunately, leaves one with the feeling that at the story's conclusion - with Higgins quietly demanding to know from Eliza the whereabouts of his slippers - both student and mentor "live happily ever after." This contrived ending must have been a compromise on the part of the producer, Gabriel Pascal, although one finds it mystifying that Shaw, who is credited with the story's adaptation, would have ever endorsed such a sentimental ending. For as Shaw had written at the end of his play over two decades earlier, "the rest of the story need not be shown...if our imaginations were not so enfeebled by their lazy dependence on the...reach-me-downs of the rag shop in which Romance keeps its stock of happy endings..." The playwright then proceeded into seven pages of prose, describing an epilogue in which Eliza married the worshipful young suitor, Freddy Eynsford-Hill, and the generous Colonel Pickering set up the newlyweds in their own business near Victoria Station. As for any relationship between Higgins and Eliza, according to Shaw, "(to this day) he storms and bullies and derides; but she stands up to him so ruthlessly that the Colonel has to ask her from time to time to be kinder to Higgins." As is the aftermath of most good stories, the worm indeed did turn.With Wilfrid Lawson as Eliza's father, Alfred; Scott Sunderland as Pickering; and David Tree impersonates the shallow but inoffensive Freddy in high style. (He would do the same with the role of Charles Lomax three years later in "Major Barbara.") If the American schleps and male-pushovers that Ralph Bellamy used to play in "The Awful Truth" and "His Girl Friday" ever had a British opposite-number, David Tree was it; he did the upper-class twit better than anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a joy: all the witty pleasure of "My Fair Lady" without the tiresome bursting into song. Lovely as that production certainly was, beautifully as it was restored, I find I much prefer the rapid-fire dry wit of this 1938 production of George Bernard Shaw's 1916 play.The story is a satire on class and language: two linguists bet cynically on the transformation of a Covent Garden flower seller into a fine lady through speech and appearance alone. Bent on immediate success, they fail to consider the consequences, and their once-unwashed protégée teaches them the casual selfishness of their act. (* * small spoilers from here * *) It's also a rather modern romance, though I've read that Shaw hated this aspect of it and tried hard to neuter the theatre-goers' burgeoning castle in the air, through an afterword. It clearly didn't stick, which is why "My Fair Lady" got made and remains the much-adored classic it is today. Poor old Shaw ? I don't feel very sorry for him, though: I'm romantic too.Leslie Howard's wonderfully eccentric and flawed Professor Higgins soon had me hanging on his every word, snorting with laughter as line after memorable line came rattling out at classic 30's/40's breakneck speed. I'm British and have at least one eccentric uncle, and I can testify that his portrayal isn't at all over the top. His alternately adoring and despairing mother treats him with weary tolerance; but she's kinder than he is; less wilful and less blind ? like his friend Colonel Pickering. But with Higgins' many faults come great wit and intelligence, penetration, a constant challenge to anyone who cares to meet him half way.But?in an intensely class-conscious England where one minutely 'knew one's place', for all his boastful assertions, he's part of the same rigid social system that is more 1888 than 1938. He goes to the embassy balls, he knows just what to wear, he delights that his protégée is "talking to a Duchess"; and his magnificently arrogant and idle "you might marry, you know?I daresay my mother could find you someone" is something he'd never have said to a woman he truly thought of as an equal. But their need is symbiotic: for her to leave him, and make him recognise her as an equal, she needed his education.I love the point where she articulates to him how she sees their relationship. The camera, having previously been very British (i.e. it thinks it's still at a play, fixed-distance, unswerving), suddenly swoons vertiginously close to Eliza while she tells him how much she loved being with him "all friendly-like", and not because she wanted him to 'make love to her'. The camera switches back to Higgins, forced off his guard by this unexpected honesty and quiet dignity. "That's exactly how I feel", he says, and then, after a baffled pause, "and?.Eliza you're a fool." Only that's exactly what at that moment she isn't: and we all know it. It's a crucial moment in the film: it's funny and sad, and so is this story, really, whichever ending you choose (Shaw's, or the film's, or any ending the viewer wishes to dream up).And Wendy Hiller! I'd never before known of her as a sparkling young actress. Of course she doesn't have that pearly, matinée beauty ? she has something better: the way emotions wash across her face; bright eyes and high cheekbones and a fleeting, occasional beauty that disappears when you look too hard for it. Hiller herself, I believe, had elocution lessons, and her Eliza's transformation is never absolutely entire: you always know that she's playing a part ? beautifully ? which of course is just what 'well-bred' people are themselves carefully trained to do - look no further than the Queen for a modern-day example of this. Even innate poshness doesn't equip a girl sufficiently to 'carry yourself off' as a Duchess, or a 'consort battleship' as Higgins charmingly puts it. No wonder Shaw himself championed Hiller. I've been loving watching her lately in Powell &amp; Pressburger's outstanding 1945 "I Know Where I'm Going!" I defy Shaw: I think they do love each other, but not with swirly-music romantic love. Theirs is more like the relationship of two artists, two dominant personalities who will fight a great deal, but may just produce great work, if they can stay together without cracking. For once, the cosy doors into the future are opening, not closing, and the future is unknown. Shaw's scenario was I think a signpost to the world we now live in, where Britain claims to be a meritocracy, nurturing its class awareness on the sly; and where the traditional sanctity of marriage is giving way to something more fluid and egalitarian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This Film Any Good? Bloody Likely!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabriel Pascal's production of G.B Shaw's acclaimed play is an excellent film adaptation, staying true to it's source material and Shaw's original intentions. It's a lot more faithful to Shaw's vision and less romantic and 'Hollywood' than the later re-working, 'My Fair Lady', which is probably the better known of the two films.This succeeds because the casting is perfect. Leslie Howard was never better as Higgins, he seems to be really enjoying his role here. Wendy Hiller makes a great Eliza, much better than Audrey Hepburn, in my opinion. Hepburn was simply too glamorous for the role, and when she played the Cockney flower girl (with THAT accent) it is thoroughly unconvincing. Hiller's unconventional beauty and air of the natural, the normal, suits the role. She is very believable, as is Howard.It also succeeds because it is kept so...how can I put it...English! I'm not English myself (a proud Aussie, thank you), but when these sorts of plays and novels are committed to the screen, they should be as faithful as possible, and that includes the casting and sets. 'Pygalmion' succeeds in looking, and feeling, very English indeed.Shaw's interest in phonetics and the 'science of speech' is interestingly conveyed, as is Eliza's position. Do these two men (Higgins and Pickering) have any claim on this lowly guttersnipe flower-girl? No, you say. But who does, and does anyone care either way? It's an intriguing play and a very good film.Highly recommended 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Leslie Howard as Henry Higgins, there is no way I could find Rex Harrison half as appealing, with his chanting/singing, in My Fair Lady. Leslie Howard simply is Henry Higgins, and if he seems unappealing and unlikable, that's because he's supposed to be unappealing and unlikable -- Henry Higgins is not a nice man. Howard does an incredible job with the role, and Wendy Hiller's Eliza puts Audrey Hepburn, as lovely as she is, to shame.If George Bernard Shaw thought that Howard's interpretation of his play was good, then who are we to argue?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Shaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shaw's brilliant play is expertly filmed by Howard and Asquith. Howard is perfectly cast as the snobbish Professor Higgins and is matched by Hiller, in her second film, as Eliza Doolittle. The fine supporting cast includes Sunderland, Lawson, and Lohr, who's terrific as Mrs. Higgins. It is difficult to make a bad film of this work, given Shaw's witty dialog, but film performance is different from stage performance, with film calling for more subtlety. The love-hate relationship between the professor and Eliza works wonderfully because Howard and Hiller provide the right combination of humor and humanity. Howard's role here is in sharp contrast to the wimpy Ashley the following year in "Gone with the Wind."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful Movie With Outstanding Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professor Henry Higgins (Lesley Howard) is an arrogant bachelor professor of phonetics who bets with his rich friend Colonel George Pickering (Scott Sunderland) that he is able to transform the cockney accent of the simple low class seller of flowers Eliza Doolittle (Wendy Hiller) in a British accent that would make high class people believe that she is a duchess. This story is one of the most delightful in the cinema history. Based on a book of Bernard Shaw, this was the first time I watched this 1938 version, and I found it marvelous. The cast has an outstanding performance. I am Brazilian, but it seems to me that the cockney pronunciation of Wendy Hiller is perfect. I intend to watch today again `My Fair Lady', a musical and fancy version of this story for comparison. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Pigmali?o' (`Pygmalion')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent, compelling, but not My Fair Lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if I had not yet seen this film I'd have had good reason to assume its merit simply because George Bernard Shaw, as cantankerous and protective of his work as he was, liked it. But I have seen it, many times, and that only validates that conclusion.Leslie Howard not only starred in it but co-directed as well, and accomplished both magnificently. His rapid-fire intensity, conveying the true overbearing Higgins using Eliza as if she were "a block of wood," to quote, to be sawed, hewn, nailed, drilled and pounded into an object to his liking, is wonderfully complemented by Wendy Hiller's Eliza, bringing us to understand the full range of her growth from the depths of her imprisonment in the class of the street vendor barely escaping mendacity by selling flowers to a real princess, not by royal birth, but by her strength and accomplishment. Higgins may like to claim credit for her transformation; but it's Eliza who really made it happen.There's a lot said here comparing Pygmalion to My Fair Lady. That's really a classic apples-and-oranges fallacy. Musical theatre is an entirely different art form, with a different goal. It's clear that if this interpretation of Pygmalion had been duplicated with songs and dances tacked on, it would have been horrible; yet My Fair Lady is a triumph of its art. It's often called a musical adaptation. That's mistaken; it's "based on" Pygmalion. The nature of musical theatre requires a different approach. To evaluate either by the standards of the other is a waste of time and thought.Shaw would undoubtedly have hated MFL; his revulsion for Romanticism and the failure of The Chocolate Soldier, the operetta based on Arms and the Man, would guarantee that. MFL is not a musical Pygmalion, and should never be mistaken for one.It is a great tribute to the genius of George Bernard Shaw and his best-known play that it could spawn both this artful and powerful movie version and a greatly different and beautiful musical as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The nice thing about watching the screen version of Pygmalion is that having seen My Fair Lady and heard the original Broadway cast album a few thousand times, you know where the songs are supposed to go.And you know the plot. There's a little more of George Bernard Shaw's social commentary about class in this one, but still we enjoy the romance of the man falling in love with his creation.Leslie Howard is cast very much against type here. The romantic idealist that was Alan Squire or Ashley Wilkes, there's no trace of here. Professor Henry Higgins is one misanthropic fellow, a man who's disdained the social class mores of the pre-World War I, United Kingdom. But he's no social crusader. He's taken up the esoteric study of language and phonetics and on a bet with Colonel Pickering, boasts he can obliterate class lines for any subject by teaching proper speech.And who's the subject, cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle. Someone who Higgins opens a new world for and after the wager is finished, just can't go back to what she was.As in My Fair Lady, the funniest scenes are Eliza trying to master the English of the Oxford Dons. We don't get the Rain in Spain here, sung and danced as Eliza breaks through, but it's still the part I like the best.Shaw's commentary about class distinctions come out of the mouth of Alfred P. Doolittle. Wilfrid Lawson's ideas about morality may very well make him the most original moralist in the English speaking world. The poor just can't afford them and he's driven kicking and screaming into the middle class with a sudden burst of luck. Think Mickey Rourke in Barfly, forced to clean up his act for the sake of convention.Pygmalion introduced Wendy Hiller to the screen as Eliza Doolittle. It's a difficult part as Eliza evolves in front of us. Quite a revelation for Leslie Howard also.Hiller of course would be another Shavian heroine in Major Barbara, another great role for her. Howard, sadly, never got a chance to tackle George Bernard Shaw again. I could see him as Caesar in Caesar and Cleopatra or Cusins in Major Barbara.Even without the songs, Pygmalion can be seen and enjoyed by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nearly 70 years later the Gabriel Pascal "Pygmalion" still sets the bar for film adaptation of a stage play. So much so, in fact, that the GBS incorporated many of the film's upgrades into the authoritative published version of the play, despite the play being more than 20 years old when the film was made.When was the last time you saw a performance leap off the screen like Leslie Howard's as Professor Higgins? Shaw never saw such treatment on screen again, even under Pascal's hand. The film of "Major Barbara" is interesting (and a bit bizarre toward the end) in its own right, with some magnificent bits in the Act II homeless shelter and a heart-wrenching Wendy Hiller, but pales next to the stage version in its intellectual, political and dramatic depth. And all the rest, even the charming "Caesar and Cleopatra" with Raines and Leigh, just don't cut it compared to the plays."Pygmalion" is where any screenwriter needs to start in adapting a play for the movies. No one has done it better since.(BTW, GBS's afterward to "Pygmalion" is intended to be tongue-in-cheek, I think. It's intentionally ridiculous, so that the mob clamoring for a romantic ending would realize just how inappropriate and uninteresting that would have been.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "Pygmalion" is a black and white movie, and pretty old, it's really well done. The actors are very convincing - Higgins is just as rude as I thought he'd be, and Eliza as moralistic and vivacious. It complements the written play itself - not many things are left out and it does not seem too heavy or dramatised. The supporting cast were great as well - Mrs Pearce, Colonel Pickering, Mr Doolittle and Mrs Higgins were excellent. As for dialogue, there is a lot of it, but it's all so meaningful, that you have to be riveted so you don't miss a thing. The fact that it is black and white is actually irrelevant.Oh yes. "Pygmalion" is the story of a Professor of Phonetics (Higgins) trying to change a flower girl in the streets (Eliza) into a lady in the middle class.Overall, "Pygmalion" is an excellent movie, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest of all British films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perfect cinema. That was my reaction when I first saw Pygmalion, the first of 50 viewings and counting, and I still think so. Who could not fall in love with Leslie Howard, one of our greatest actors, so tragically assassinated in the Second World War? Wendy Hiller IS Eliza. The cast is flawless. The script... words fail me, for George Bernard Shaw was a genius, he did not simply adapt his play for the screen, it is so good that it is like it's happening before your eyes. My God, after seeing this is there anyone out there who thinks 'My Fair Lady', the slowest film musical on record, is the best screen version of Shaw? If they do, they are mad.That film moves me not one jot, everything is so clean, so smug, so unreal. Here we see poverty, but also hope. These are not actors and actresses moving through the sets garbed in Cecil Beaton, but real people, real suffering, but humanity lights every scene like a beacon. The unbearably moving scenes of Eliza capturing society at the ball, the irresistible waltz, watch this with no tears in your eyes, I dare you. Halliwells Film Guide calls this 'one of the most heartening and adult British films of the thirties'. Too right. I cannot fault this film, it is priceless. By the way, I saw 'My Fair Lady' on stage recently, and it's miles better than the film version. Warner Bros really let Shaw down, and it's impossible to put it right. But this...well it is a big compensation. And I don't miss the songs one little bit.There are so many classic scenes I can't pick any out. Of course viewers will spot that it was 'updated' to 1938, and the original play set in the Edwardians. That doesn't hurt it at all, 'polite' society didn't change much in the intervening years and gives the play an added 'contemporary' edge. Please, please, please see this film. You will be gripped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless film by Shaw shows what Shakespeare did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the mid-1990s I followed the "Shakespeare authorship question." One of the "doubters" of the traditional "Man from Stratford" was one of the stars of this movie, Leslie Howard (Prof. Higgins). One of the "authorship" arguments is how could a commoner from the country, in a society when the noble elite were so closed-off against such people, have known so much about the inner life of the noble class as to be able to present -- to an audience of nobles -- noble characters that convinced them that the characters were authentic. In 1938's "Pygmalion" Prof. Henry Higgins takes a lower-class cockney girl, Eliza Doolittle, and transforms her into a young woman who can pass so convincingly as a member of the upper class that she can fool a ballroom full of real nobles at an embassy reception. What Henry Higgins is doing is creating a fictional noblewoman whom real noblemen and women will accept as one of themselves. Which is exactly what Shakespeare was doing: creating fictional noble characters whom, when presented to an audience of real nobles, would be accepted by those nobles as one of themselves. And what was the most difficult problem Higgins faced? Stripping away from Eliza errors born of ignorance of how members of that class act in their private encounters: actions and words and behaviors erroneous for a person born and bred to a status of nobility. There is a scene in which Higgins introduces Eliza to a social group of the upper class for the very first time. It is a tea afternoon hosted by his mother. It is soon apparent that while Eliza has learned vocabulary and diction, the subjects she introduces to speak about, and the facts of her life and relatives that she reports, expose her as not of the upper class. It is her errors that expose her. Higgins thereupon embarks on a detailed program of teaching her the proper substance and content of what it is to be upper class. Watch Higgins as he teaches Eliza how to curtsy and dance without errors, as he orders the right hair-dressers and the right dress-makers and rents the right jewelry. He makes no errors that expose the fiction. He knows how to curtsy and dance and the hair and clothes and jewels because he was born to the class in which people curtsy and dance. This is the key point: he is able to do this only because he himself is a born member of that class. Only a born member of the class will have the innate, instinctive, detailed knowledge to identify every single moment when Eliza goes off-character and does or says something, or does or says it in a particular way, that will expose her as a false, fictional character, not noble, not even upper class.This is what Shakespeare knew. Shakespeare presented dozens of noble major characters (and including minor characters, hundreds) to an audience of real nobles. He did, dozens and dozens of times, what Henry Higgins in Pygmalion did but once. And his noble characters had no betraying errors, were always accepted by nobles as authentic nobles. Not once did he present a noble character who rang false. Shakespeare never did this with lower-class characters; they are all caricatures. He had to have been born to the noble class in order to create fictional nobles whom real nobles would accept as real.Writers who try to create fictional characters who are part of the same real-world social class or group as the intended readers of the novel, or audience members of the play, are acutely aware of the danger of ignorantly including in the character elements that make the character ring false, as not really being part of the intended class or group that comprises the readership or audience. They fear making errors such as did Eliza Doolittle in her tea with Henry Higgins' mother. Professors and others who have never attempted to create a fictional character who can pass as real in an elite milieu do not realize the difficulty and danger of humiliating failure in this effort. The problem is particularly insurmountable when the real-world group of which the fictional character is supposed to be a part happens to be, in the real world, socially exclusive and closed-off to outsiders. In the world of Henry Higgins, the upper-class Higgins is able to conduct research among the lower-classes because the lower-classes are exposed, in public, in the streets. But a lower-class person could never do the reverse, and conduct research among the upper-classes, because the upper-classes are protected by buildings and servants. A lower-class person cannot get any proximity to them to observe them as they speak and behave, unless voluntarily admitted by an upper-class person, and even then that access will be limited by the boundaries set by the upper-class person who has given admittance. A writer who presents -- to an audience of earls and dukes -- a private conversation between an earl and a duke, must be a writer who knows what things are NOT said and NOT done in such conversations, in order to present a conversation that convinces real earls and dukes. That is what it takes to pass-off an Eliza Doolittle to nobles as a noble herself -- as portrayed in the grand climatic ball. Now when I watch the ball scene, and see Eliza enter the room, ascend the stairs, and convince real duchesses and nobles that she is, in fact, a Hungarian royal princess, under the escort and gaze of Henry Higgins, I feel I am seeing Shakespeare escorting and watching one of his own fictional nobles advance into the gaze and evaluation of real nobles, there to find acceptance by them as one of their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing Pygmalion I had been longing to see "My Fair Lady" but after seeing Pygmalion re-making it did not make sense to me8though I haven't seen My Fair LADY YET).I guess the uppermost side of Pygmalion is that its writing credits (both scenario and dialogue) belongs to the writer of the play.Not just that of course.Wendy Hiller's performance as a common flower girl who is forced to turn into a duchess like speaking lady on a bet is totally fascinating.Leslie Howard as the cold,unaffectionate,unkind phonetic professor is also likable.The plot looks precisely loyal to the play itself.I haven't seen a good adaptation for a while and it was great for me to have the chance of seeing this old but great adaptation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there has ever been a perfect film, that's the one. A great story and a superb cast, it makes the musical 'classic' look like a children's movie. Howard is the real Higgins, witty and cynical, intellectual but cheerful, unabashedly snobbish, yet strangely endearing. But above all, there is Wendy Hiller, whose sole performance gives the movie its enduring charm. When I first saw the movie, I fell in love with her, literally. The next thing I knew, I was scouring video stores for any Wendy Hiller movie, and I was not disappointed. I think she is one of the greatest actresses of all time, second to none, probably except Giulietta Masina. It's a pity that her dedication to the theater did not allow her to make more movies. A long time after I first saw this film, its memorable moments are still fresh in my mind-and the dialogue: 'I'm a good girl, I'm'; 'I don't want to speak grammar, I want to speak like a lady'; 'If you say "I'm a good girl" again, father will take back home'; 'them she lived with would have killed her for a hat pin, let alone a hat'; and so much more. Who could have been wittier than Shaw?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greatest works of arts often do not acquire much popularity. They just might be too unattractive or unconventional to the wide audience. But that does not mean they should be left into historic oblivion, quite opposite. Such injustice was definitely done to film Pygmalion (1938). Based on the best drama by best English dramatist of 20th century, this film does not offer any other famous references. However, professional theatre actors (Hiller, Howard) did a simply perfect, flawless acting and directing (Asquith), editing (Lean) and music (Honegger) are all fantastic. I think they all did their best film performance of a lifetime. And moreover, Hiller's voice performance is most probably the very best in the whole film history.Watch not this film if you are look for a careless amusement - in this case My fair lady is the appropriate choice. Watch it if you are looking for film classics and highly intellectual challenge. It is not one of 100 most popular British films of all time, but it should be on the 100 best British films list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pygmalion by George Bernard shaw is my favourite play, closely followed the importance of being earnest by Oscar Wilde. And this version of it has to be one of my top ten favourite films. i love it, everything from the acting to the story is note perfect. Leslie Howard IS professor Higgins and one cannot imagine a better Eliza than Wendy hiller.everyone knows the story (which is loosely based on a Greek myth), a cockney flower girl (Eliza Doolittle) is trained by a fussy and arrogant elocutionist (prof Higgins)to behave properly in high society. The story is witty, entertaining and is extremely popular. the casting in this is note perfect, Leslie Howard (probably best known for his portrayal of Ashley Wilkes in 'gone with the wind'), who also co-directed this film stars as professor henry Higgins and he embodies him perfectly, capturing every aspect of this arrogant, witty, fussy and infuriating man. the character is easily the most popular in the whole play (much against the playwright's wishes, shaw was a feminist). it was also one of Howard's favourite roles in his career as this man did not particularly like Hollywood films, considering them to be stupid and he spent his working life in Britain. he earned a nomination for best actor at the Oscars for this role (i really wish he had got it!). Wendy hiller making her screen debut and also personally recommended by shaw for the role is the best Eliza one will ever see. she also got nominated at the Oscars that same year. the rest of the supporting cast was good too, Scott Sunderland as the gentlemanly colonel pickering was very good, Wilfred Lawson as Alfred Doolittle was excellent (when he breathed at Higgins with his bad breath, i nearly wet myself with laughter), jean Caddell as the proud but middle class housekeeper Mrs Pearce, Marie Lohr as Higgins's stern but caring mother, David tree as the wimpish Freddy Eynsford-Hill who falls for Eliza and Esme Percy as count Aristid Karpathy. every one was nearly perfect in their roles.the one thing i wasn't too pleased about was the fact that Anthony Asquith has decided to take out some of the funniest lines in the play an replace them with ones no where near as good as the old ones. he has also done this in the 1952 version of importance of being earnest.shaw was a bit weary at his plays being done on screen. he had constantly turned down Hollywood offers to do screen his play (thank god, Hollywood has the greatest reputation of ruining British stories). he won an Oscar for best screenplay as he adapted his own play onto the screen here which did not please him. he was an odd man. they had too add in more here if they were going to make it feature length, so they have shown us Eliza's tutoring and the ball scene which is very well done. they also change the ending where Eliza returns to Higgins instead of leaving with Freddy. we are left wondering whether they get married, of live as friends or whatever. Higgins makes it perfectly clear that he will never marry anybody, but it could have happened. and Eliza is unlikely to marry a man who bullied her for six months but it leaves the audience guessing which is exactly what shaw wanted. the ending of the original play was Eliza leaving Higgins to go with Mrs Higgins, colonel pickering and Freddy to Alfred Doolittle's wedding and Higgins was left alone but with an incorrigible manner. in the film where she returns, it makes our imagination work a little more.don't be taken in by the musical version of this play, my fair lady. this version is the real thing. i originally saw my fair lady before i saw this film and it was a lesson for me to see this and really appreciate it. i loved Rex Harrison's slightly mad performance as Higgins but Leslie Howard plays him closer to the original play (it has also been said that he would have been given the role of Higgins in my fair lady if he had still been alive) and Audrey Hepburn is just plain irritating in the role of Eliza, she can't hold a candle to Wendy hiller's performance. shaw would have undoubtedly hated my fair lady, he couldn't stick musicals, he probably wouldn't have allowed them the rights to make it. it didn't take me long to find fault in my fair lady and start loving this though. my fair lady is a Hollywood musical, they haven't a clue how to do British properly. it irritates me that everyone remembers my fair lady and fewer people know this film.Pygmalion is deservedly a British classic and should be so much more appreciated in the UK than it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive film version of the Shavian classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remains the definitive film version of the Shavian classic. As in any of Shaw's plays, the essence of Pygmalion rests upon sharp dialogue rather than splashy musical numbers, and upon character rather than action. Wendy Hiller makes an infinitely better Eliza Dolittle than the miscast Audry Hepburn. Hiller's transformation from flower-girl to lady is astonishing. On the other hand, one never believes Hepburn in the role of a "draggle-tailed gutter-snipe". She comes off like a dressed-down fashion model putting on an accent. Leslie Howard's performance is far more subtle, and far less strident, then Rex Harrison's. Perhaps Howard would have been offered the lead role in My Fair Lady in preference to Rex Harrison had he lived longer (he was shot down in a plane in 1943). The two actors were not that much different in age and, if Leslie Howard was not noted as a singer, neither was Rex Harrison. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Seeing this and My Fair Lady together was a real lesson for me, a lesson in how a seemingly small change in presentation can completely transform a production. The lines of MFL are precisely those of Pygmalion, plus the Ascot race and some foolery with Dad. The sets of the two are nearly identical. But the effect is radically different.Shaw's play was about how people are actors, and the supposed class system, indeed all rank in society is a result of how skillfully you play the role. It is a socialist notion, highly intellectualized through the then promising science of linguistics. In other words, this play is a self-referential criticism of the notion of play.Shaw would have been repelled by the transmogrification into MFL -- because the musical is an exploitation of the medium for sheer entertainment. In other words, MFL is a celebration of the notion of play.Done with the very same words!</fullReview>

Both Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller are terrific in the leads, and this production brings out both the fun and wit of Shaw's words, and the sharp, complex, and sometimes paradoxical political and social observations underneath. Dated in style, yes, and Hiller is a bit older than ideal for the role's innocence. And some of the supporting performances are too stagy (although some are very good indeed).

Mr. Shaw receives official credit; he shared an "Academy Award" win with three screenplay adapters. Whatever the distribution of work, Shaw's sharp and brilliant satire on British dialects shines prominently. Everyone performs marvelously.

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Adaptation of a Distinguished Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bernard Shaw's play "Pygmalion" was written in support of his controversial thesis that class divisions in British society could be overcome by encouraging the use of Received Pronunciation (supported by reformed spelling in a phonetic alphabet) in place of regional and class accents. Today such an idea would doubtless be attacked as snobbish and reactionary, but in 1912 Shaw clearly intended it to be enlightened and progressive. The story concerns Henry Higgins, an upper-class professor of phonology, who accepts a bet that he can teach a Cockney flower-seller to speak like a duchess and pass her off as one at an Embassy reception. The title was taken from a Greek myth about a sculptor who creates a beautiful statue which the gods transform into a real woman; the implication is that Higgins is the sculptor and Eliza his "creation". (I remember misunderstanding the title when I was taken to a performance as a child and found myself wondering why, in a play called "Pig Malion", pigs were never mentioned once).This film, dating from 1938, was the first cinema adaptation of the play. Although it was a financial and critical success in its day, its fame has today largely been overshadowed by that of the 1964 musical version "My Fair Lady". The screenplay was adapted by Shaw himself from his play, although the ending was changed against his wishes, with Eliza returning to Higgins' home in such a manner as to suggest a romantic attachment between them. The original play ended with Eliza marrying her admirer Freddie Eynsford-Hill, a wealthy but vapid and foolish young man, and Shaw strongly resisted any attempts by actors or theatrical producers to change this ending. In "My Fair Lady" it seems at first as if the audience are being prepared for Shaw's original ending; Freddie is made more attractive, both in looks and in personality, and he gets to sing one of the film's big romantic numbers, "On the Street Where You Live". That film, however, also ends with Eliza returning to Higgins.There was a reason why Shaw resisted attempts to turn "Pygmalion" into a romantic comedy. (He seems to have deliberately ignored the fact that in the original myth Pygmalion fell in love with and married his creation Galatea). Besides social class, the play also deals with the theme of feminism, with Eliza seen as a strong, determined "new woman" who learns to stand up for herself after being bullied first by her drunken, womanising old reprobate of a father and then by Higgins, a crashing snob and misogynist. (He regards Eliza as a "guttersnipe" and has no qualms about calling her one to her face). The attraction of Freddie for her is precisely that he is a weak character and therefore unlikely to bully her.This film updates the action from the 1910s to the 1930s (although some of the costumes look a bit old-fashioned for the latter period) and makes a few other changes to the plot of the play, some of which were retained in "My Fair Lady", such as the invention of the Hungarian Professor Karpathy. Shaw, however, kept his controversial line "Not bloody likely!", making Wendy Hiller the first person to utter that particular profanity in a in a British film; rather surprisingly the censors appear to have raised no objection. One thing the makers of this film got right, unlike the American makers of "My Fair Lady, is the pronunciation of the name "Eynsford", originally a Kentish village. (It's "Ainsford", not "Inesford").Hiller was reputedly Shaw's favourite actress and was certainly something of a specialist in Shavian drama at a time when performances of his works on the London stage were more frequent than they are today; her next film, "Major Barbara", was also a Shaw adaptation. It is therefore unsurprising that she makes a fine Eliza, perhaps closer to Shaw's original conception than Audrey Hepburn who always seems more convincing as the society lady of the later scenes than as the Cockney of the earlier ones. Leslie Howard is certainly a better Higgins than Rex Harrison, who was too old and too laid-back; I have never understood why he won the "Best Actor" Oscar, especially as his singing voice was not really up to taking the male lead in a musical.In his lifetime, Shaw was held in very high esteem as one of the greatest British dramatists of all time, at times regarded almost as a twentieth-century Shakespeare. Since his death his reputation has declined somewhat, although a number of his plays, "Pygmalion" among them, still hold a popular place in the repertoire. He was able to create witty dialogue and interesting characters, even when he was writing a didactic piece, which most of his plays are, and this is particularly true of "Pygmalion". Antony Asquith's film is a worthy adaptation of this distinguished play for the cinema. 8/10</fullReview>

Howard and Hiller are brilliant here, as are Harrison and Hepburn in My Fair Lady. I can't favor one pair over the other. However, Esme Percy as the Count is more amusing than his counterpart, Theodore Bikel.I agree with the controversial ending. Eliza had come too far to leave Higgins for Freddy, a comparative dolt. To my mind, it wraps up this witty picture appropriately. There is no telling how many more great Leslie Howard roles there would have been, had he not been a casualty of that awful dustup World War II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You see, the difference between a lady and a flower girl isn't how she behaves, it's how she's treated."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opportunity to watch Pygmalion next to My Fair Lady is not to be missed. If Shaw at first was reluctant to approve a movie version of Pygmalion, he ended up enthusiastically promoting Wendy Hiller for the part of Eliza Doolittle and, at 82, co-adapting his play into a screenplay and writing several new scenes, including the whole ballroom episode involving that oleaginous fraud, Karpathy. Thanks to Shaw, director Anthony Asquith, co-director Leslie Howard who plays Professor Henry Higgins, Wendy Hiller as Eliza and Wilfred Lawson as Alfred Doolittle, we have one of the wittiest, cleverest takes on social inequality that ever had a romance wrapped around it. "I can't change my nature and I won't change my manners," says Higgins, a crabby, bossy, arrogant, insensitive fellow who believes the intellectual life is the only life, and who benefits from private wealth and his talent as a teacher of phonetics. His reaction to Eliza declaring her independence is to squawk, "I tell you I've created this thing out of squashed cabbage leaves in Convent Garden!" Eliza (and Shaw) sees things differently. "You see," she tells Colonel Pickering, "the difference between a lady and a flower girl isn't how she behaves, it's how she's treated." Eliza Doolittle, after she's been cleaned up spectacularly and taught not to drop her H's by Higgins, has become, not just a "proper lady," but a woman of confidence and spirit. Shaw, of course, turns all this into a contest of ideas -- his -- stated in dialogue so provocative and clever one really needs to appreciate the skill of Howard and Hiller. The contest between the two becomes interesting because we know (this is corny) the two were made for each other. Higgins may have taught Eliza how to speak and behave like a lady, but he doesn't have the faintest idea how to appreciate her. Eliza turns out to be a great teacher, too, and she has a good deal to teach Higgins, squirm as he may. "Eliza, where the dickens are my slippers?" may not be the most romantic last line in movies or plays, but with Shaw, it does just fine. More than fine, because the question of whether Eliza will stay with Higgins is left up in the air. That last line also works so well because of the two extraordinary performances by Howard and Hiller. Despite Pygmalion being a showcase for Shaw's opinions, Howard and Hiller make it also a showcase for this strange and appealing combination of intellect, sexual attraction and love. Watching My Fair Lady right after is something like looking at carefully preserved mastodon bones hauled out of the LaBrea Tar Pits. There are some great bones, but the life is gone from them. This isn't to say that the theatrical version of My Fair Lady isn't one of the best musicals Broadway ever came up with. The movie version, however, was made, it seems to me, with such ponderous dignity, such careful attention to giving the audience what they think they remember, and with such an overpowering sheen of Hollywood's deadly professionalism, that the sparkle and much of the wit is either gone or coarsened. Harrison is superb, but at 56 too old (and irreplaceable in the part, although Jack Warner at first wanted Cary Grant). Hepburn is beautiful but not believable as a grubby cockney. Her beautifully posed and lit close-ups are all about Audrey Hepburn and not for a moment about Pygmalion's Eliza. Stanley Holloway is energetic but no patch on Wilfred Lawson's way with a Shavian line. When Lawson wheezes, Howard looks askance because of Doolittle's nature. Higgins' reaction is amusing. When Holloway wheezes, Harrison reaches for his handkerchief because it's a setup for a visual joke involving Doolittle's spittle and bad breath. It's just a cheap laugh. Enjoy both movies. There's certainly much to like, sort of, in the movie of My Fair Lady. But to see a witty classic of manners, ideas and even romance, watch Pygmalion.</fullReview>

So far though this film is my favorite. I thought Leslie Howard (Professor Higgins) made an excellent performance in this film. I found his rudeness in the film particularly enjoyable and very fun to watch. And even being the rudest character in the movie, he pulled off to be the most likable as well. I liked Wendy Hiller (Eliza) much more in this film then in Major Barbara. Another enjoyable character in this film was Wilfred Lawson who played Alfred Doolittle. I enjoyed the part in the movie where he first speaks to Henry Higgins. He displays how even though he is lower class he still has cleverness with in him. I would definitely recommend this be the first film that anyone studying or learning about Shaw should watch as their first.

		<shortDescription>Forget "My Fair Lady". This is the real thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Bernard Shaw is reputed to have absolutely despised musicals. There is speculation that the original idea behind "My Fair Lady" was based on a discussion of the absurd and what could be more absurd than a musical based on one of Shaw's plays?It is equally true that a lot of people love MFL in spite of either the absurdity of it or what Mr. Shaw would surely have thought of it but the fact is that the musical can't hold a candle to the magnificent original.The performances and characterizations of Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard are far more complex and rewarding than they ever were in the musical and without all of the sentimental fluff and music, the story is allowed to stand on its own merit.Shaw stages a broad assault on the hypocrisy of the English class system and at the same time he affirms the value of the individual. He does this through two very complex characters that are, at the same time, both lovable and imperfect.The lesson here is that others are who they are and not who we perceive them to be. In this, the film had a lot in common with "As Good as it Gets" that also illustrated beautifully how some people even late in life have yet to learn the all-important less that nobody thinks of themselves as a bad person; we are all just trying to do what we think is right while suffering other people's misunderstandings and reactions to us.I read some other remarks here from people who complained that the idea of Eliza returning to Henry was absurd or unrealistic. How can it be? Who better understands her than he and who does she better understand than him? They are the perfect couple not because they are the same but because they understand one another and true love can only come with understanding.You don't need songs to put that point across.</fullReview>

Instead of finding it's own voice as a film, the producers (and pretty much everyone else involved including the cast) maintained a "safe" course not daring to divert from the source material. The result was an entertaining but not particularly memorable movie. It's the same thing that has happened currently with the movie adapatations of the "Harry Potter" books. The source material is so rich that the makers of the films simply don't dare to try and make their own statement. They think it would be some kind of blasphemy and treat their material with too much reverence. However, this version of Shaw's "Pygmalion" for some reason doesn't fall into that trap. Maybe it's because Shaw was alive at the time the movie was made (and was on the set). This may have created the feeling that the movie was contemporary. I think that has a lot to do with it. Unlike the sodden 1964 Hepburn/Harrison vehicle which you really never could figure out exactly what era it was supposed to be, this version is firmly planted in (then) contemporary London of the 1930's. Therefore, there is a freshness and vitality that makes the whole film seem spontaneous. Nothing more indicates this then the GREAT scene after the ball when Eliza tells Higgins off. Higgins (the great Leslie Howard) is stunned. And he attempts to make a grand exit after being mortally wounded. As he descends the stairs, his foot ever so slighly slips. It's a great small moment that speaks volumes about Higgins' vanity and how deeply Eliza's words have affected him. Just compare the exact scene in the '64 version. It's all stiff and affected. The ONLY thing about this version that I don't like is the rather long and drawn out discussion near the end between Eliza and Higgins. It's definately due to the play as it's written rather than the movie because it's the point where Shaw makes his arguments about class structure and how it isolates people, etc. Compared to the wonderful fast pace of the rest of the movie, this is very static and nearly stops the movie dead in its tracks. But it's very small quibble when one considers how good the rest of the movie is. Excellent cast throughout. Leslie Howard shows how brilliant he could be (as opposed to the sap he played in "Gone With the Wind"). And of course, Wendy Hiller's Eliza is nearly perfect. One can see both her need and desire to better herself AND the intelligence she possesses that eventually gets her out of the gutter. Ms. Hepburn was never convincing in the early parts of "My Fair Lady".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>G.B Shaw's Take On Selfhood, British Empire Classism and Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films, as a writer, as an actor and as one who teaches phonetics, for self-apparent reasons. This is an attempt in fictional form by Fabian socialist and enemy of imperial pseudo-Christian monarchy (pragmatism) George Bernard Shaw to argue several things. One is that if life is a performance, then appearance and speech matter more than character in his present period of history; hence the choice by him of the "Pygmalion" style transformation of one Eliza Doolittlie by professor Henry Higgings into a butterfly instead of a "draggletailed guttersnipe". Of course. he chose her because she looked intelligent and reacted more than other flower girls in the zone outside a theater where she what been selling flowers by night. But his boast that he could make over this product of the East End and its cockney dialect, which he considers to be less-than-human as a speech pattern, is not believed by his colleague, George Pickering, himself more a student of India's many languages than of phonetics per se, and taken on by Higgins as a guest after their meeting that very night. The next day, the young woman who has overheard both his criticisms of her speech and his boast about her potential opportunities comes and offers money so that he will teach her. Higgins is a monster socially, professorial type in this interpretation of the Shavian play--but he agrees to take her on as a cold scientific proof of the rightness of his theories, without regard to Eliza's feelings. It is enough she has had the courage to dare to approach him. He has her undressed, given a bath, and outfitted in new clothes, since he has burned the old ones. When her father hears what she is doing, he comes around to protest the loss of her income, blaming the Professor's actions as representing a potential reputational problem for his daughter. He is given money and sent away never to return; and he decides to get married, after demonstrating remarkable natural speechmaking abilities. The training continues, a rigorous one; Higgins' mother protests and is rebuffed. The housekeeper has to remind Higgins Eliza is human. Pickering treats the girl like a duchess, and Higgins excuses his own rudeness by arguing that he is the same with everyone--he treats duchesses as if they were flower girls. Finally the Professor's methods succeed. Her father's native cleverness with language may be at play in her, but she masters the upper-class accent by her own exhausting work. Then she is groomed for presentation "in society". Due to her success in this endeavor, her Cockney stories and odd grammar being taken as a new sort of courtly speech game, she causes one Freddy Eynesford-Hill to fall in love with her. She disrupts the Ascot Races with her exhortation to her horse, and then is taken back to Higgins' rooms to be groomed for her last battle--presentation at a diplomatic function where the Queen will be present. She carries the night with a triumphant and lovely appearance, fooling an Hungarian bogus phonetician to the extent that he believes her to be royalty herself. Then in the cold light of dawn, she realizes what has happened. She has lost her old niche in Britain's Imperial caste-ridden society, and she has nowhere to go. Higgins upbraids her for being ungrateful; but he is proud that she is her own person now. He ignores the insuperable social-class barriers set against her in England's totalitarian system. She runs off, to escape him, professing that she will marry Freddy, whose mother has a great deal of money. But in the end, realizing he really wants her to stay, she returns--with no promises, no guarantees, and no regrets on her part. He has made her independent and she chooses to be in love with him, perhaps forever. For his part, he has fallen in love with the perfection of his own creation. This is a B/W production, and quite different from the later Lerner and Loewe musical version with its many familiar numbers. It is a good and frequently an eloquent play, I argue, one demonstrably filled with witticisms, interesting comedic characters and memorable lines. The film is deliberate in places, but the dialogue for the most part plays very very well in my opinion. W.P. Lipscomb and Cecil Lewis were credited along G.B. Shaw for the screenplay; Anthony Asquith and Leslie Howard did the directing. Harry Stradling Sr. was cinematographer; art direction was by Arthur Bryant. And the costumes were designed by Schiapparelli among others. In the cast, Leslie Howard makes a good understated Higgins-professor impersonator; Wendy Hiller is lovely and stunningly good as Eliza Doolittle. Marie Lohr plays Higgins' mother, Scott Sunderland a sympathetic Pickering, Wilfrid Lawson a charismatic and inebriate Alfred P. Dolittle. Others in the cast included David Tree as Freddy, Esme Percy as the Hungarian phonetics hack, Jean Cadell, very good as the housekeeper, and Everly Gregg as Mrs. Eynesford-Hill. The difference between this intelligent satire with comedy and the musical comedy with satire seems extraordinary to me; the distinction might be likened to a great actor one spoke to at his own home during a quiet party in soft lighting, and then watching him repeat the remarks at a vast Washington DC party to a hundred reporters in the midst of an inauguration ball. While I enjoy the musical version for its clever songs, I prefer the original version for its intelligence and focus on human value--the value of one human; and why such a commodity needs to be judged in this world, and protected from anyone's losing his rights and opportunities within any society because precisely those governmental guarantors who in some Age were charged with seeing that he/she did not do so failed to offer protection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people know the story of "Pygmalion" by way of the musical version, "My Fair Lady" or the homage, "Trading Places," without ever having seen the original, which is unfortunate. It's simply one of the best films ever made, and stands up not only to time?it is, after all, nearly 80 years old?but to repeat viewing.On a fresh viewing, what struck me most was the superb script?for which it won an Academy Award?which is hilarious and quite caustic, in no small part due to George Bernard Shaw. Both performances by Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller are amazing to watch, every bit as good as the best contemporary actors. And Hiller's performance in this is stunning and heartbreaking. I'm certain Anthony Asquith, who also directed "The Browning Version," deserves much credit, and David Lean as editor.Sometimes, I have to caveat older films with "it was really influential" or "It was good for the time." "Pygmalion," however, is timeless. A film anyone can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaw Without the Music Still Sings in the Still Wondrous Original Film Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far more a pointed satire on social mores than an opposites-attract love story, the original 1938 adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's classic 1913 play is still a glistening piece of pre-WWII British cinema fluidly co-directed by Anthony Asquith ("The Importance of Being Earnest") and star Leslie Howard. Howard ("Gone with the Wind") and Wendy Hiller ("I Know Where I'm Going!") are close to perfection in the principal roles, but the movie's key distinction lies in the fact that Shaw adapted his own play for the screen with some assistance from W.P. Lipscomb and Cecil Lewis. Consequently, Shaw's biting wit and uncompromising tone remain intact as the familiar story of Professor Henry Higgins and Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle unfolds without the cherished Lerner and Lowe musical score that decorated the identical plot of "My Fair Lady" two decades later. As I am not a big fan of the overstuffed 1964 musical remake despite the wonderful songs, this version provides the same narrative in a far more economical 96 minutes. It's a genuine treat to appreciate Shaw's words without the music.The story is familiar to anyone who has seen the musical. Higgins makes a bet with fellow scholar Colonel Pickering that he can pass off a lower-class flower girl as a duchess by teaching her how to speak and act. None other than later film master David Lean ("Lawrence of Arabia") directed the montage sequence of Higgins teaching Eliza the proper elocution and etiquette. An awkward trial run occurs at the Chelsea home of Higgins' mother where Eliza makes her social debut recounting her ghastly story of a relative's suspicious death. Regardless, potential suitor Freddy Eynsford-Hill is entranced and becomes obsessed with Eliza. Later, Higgins and Pickering decide Eliza is ready for a formal ball at the Transylvanian embassy where Higgins' pompous former pupil, Count Aristid Karpathy, threatens to expose her Cockney roots. Instead, he is fooled by her demure polish into thinking she is a Hungarian princess. Higgins and Pickering celebrate their mutual accomplishment, but Eliza recognizes her contribution and self-worth in the deceptive exercise. When she threatens to leave Higgins' tutelage for Freddy's waiting arms, it becomes an uncomfortable matter that the professor realizes has slipped completely out of his control.Shaw's ageless point is that class distinctions are artificial at their core. He recognizes that articulate speech, good manners, and an expensive wardrobe are the key elements that separate the classes, and that they can all be attained given the appropriate resources. What genuinely separated Higgins from Eliza is the fact that he is a ruthless, selfish egotist who cannot imagine wanting the respect much less the love of his blossoming student. That becoming a lady of his level of bearing should be Eliza's aspiration is what ultimately appalls her, and it becomes clear that such class distinctions have no relevance when it comes to personal value. Deep in the shadow of Rex Harrison in his definitive role, Howard brings a more impulsive, youthful energy to Higgins, so much so that there is true terror when he threatens to strike Eliza. Hiller handles Eliza's metamorphosis with arresting conviction and makes a more convincing Cockney guttersnipe than Audrey Hepburn. By comparison, Hiller's transformation is more subtle in this treatment. There are nice turns by Marie Lohr as Mrs. Higgins, Sunderland as Pickering, and Wilfrid Lawson as Eliza's ne'er-do-well father Alfred, although David Tree comes across as far too callow for the likes of Eliza as Freddy. The 2000 Criterion Collection DVD surprisingly contains no extras, but the print transfer does justice to the pristine cinematography of veteran Harry Stradling ("Funny Girl") and his camera operator Jack Hildyard ("The Bridge on the River Kwai").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wilfred Lawson and Leslie Howard play a great comedic scene with Lawson as Liza's father refusing to take more than five pounds for his daughter so that the extra money (more than he can drink in a weekend) doesn't make him too prudent with money to enjoy himself. An offhand remark by the professor eventually leads to that very result. Shaw's take on the Victorian notion of the deserving versus the undeserving poor is another of this film's illustration of the not so hidden injuries of Britain's class system. Just about every social distinction that leads to inequality becomes a target in this film, not excluding intelligence and expertise. The only uncontested claim to merit is human sympathy, which Shaw saw as lacking across the ideological spectrum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The voice of Shaw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1938 adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion is here the voice of Shaw. To explain further, Pygmalion is utilised as the carrier for Shaw's opinions and socialist ideals, and his satirising of the middle class values and moral coda. As such, the irony is that Shaw who utilises Pygmalion to critique middle class patronage and their imposition of a moral code in the style of English imperialism, is here the dictator of opinions.The further irony of Shaw's somewhat naive, gullible views of socialism of that time period is about 'freeing' the subordinate classes and women from the shackles of their positions. Yet as the passage of time reveals, such ideas of freedom have not seen the realisation of either groups.The lack of freedom of the subordinate classes is measured by their absence in defining British culture which is still premised on middle class morality which is imposed from above by the media. This middle class imposition of their values and morality is illustrated by television shows such as Trinny and Suzanna or Jamie's Minitery of Food. These television shows are imbued with patronising nannying, teaching the average Joe how to dress and cook in th middle class image. It all but says the subordinate class are ignorant. This is ironic when it is the proletariat whose hard work, intelligence and values shaped industrial Britain and changed working conditions for the better. Meanwhile the middle classes remain ignorant and patronising. They're left scratching around to find new ways to re-assert their dominant position in a class society. This is achieved via their moralising, and ironically, as well as being controversial and telling society that conformity is the back bone of Britain, rather than the toil of the labouring classes.This moralising by the middle classes is illustrated in the film adaptation of Pygnmalion when the police officer confronts an innocent kiss by the courting couple in he street. It begs the questions of what crime is?, what morality is?, and more to the point what the role of the police officer is? The police are here obviously the middle class enforcers of morality.As to the acting in the film it is of the highest standards from Howard, Hiller and the rest of the cast. Hiller is particularly excellent at her perfection of Eliza Doolittle.In sum, this is a film which acts as the preachy voice of George Bernard Shaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely, but why change Shaw's ending?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PYGMALION is based on George Bernard Shaw's reinterpretation of the Greek myth about Pygmalion. In this old tale, Pygmalion is an artist and creates a statue of "the perfect woman" that is so beautiful that he falls in love with it. The gods see what has occurred and take pity, so they turn Galatea (the statue) into a real woman and they live happily ever after. In his play, Shaw injects quite a bit of humor into the tale, as instead of the smitten Pygmalion, Henry Higgins is a misogynistic (and possibly gay) man who only comes to care for his "creation" (Eliza Doolittle) when it is too late. By his boorish ways, he's driven this "perfect" lady out of his life forever. Oddly, however, in both this 1938 version and its remake (MY FAIR LADY), the ending was changed and Eliza inexplicably returns to an unrepentant and annoying Higgins--even though this undoes most of the fourth act of the play!! If you have already seen MY FAIR LADY, then you will most likely recognize that this later film is practically word-for-word the 1938 film in many places. As for the songs, they make MY FAIR LADY a wonderful film but without them, this earlier film is still just as good--just different. The biggest difference is the mood. Because of the songs (some of which are very humorous), MY FAIR LADY is definitely a lighter and more breezy film. Also, while Henry Higgins often repeats the exact same dialog in the latter film, because of Rex Harrison's age and more irascible style, it comes off a more silly and cute. While some might hate the more somber and sad mood of PYGMALION, I like it just as much as the film tends to be a bit more believable. Here Higgins is much more believable as a potential lover of Eliza--and the sexual tension is therefore greater.My overall verdict is that PYGMALION (1938) and MY FAIR LADY are about equally delightful and fun. They are different enough that I think you should see both and while I like the Higgins and Pickering of MY FAIR LADY more, I think Wendy Hiller and the rest of the cast of the original film are at least as good as the originals. While Leslie Howard is excellent, because of his age he is so different from the older and nastier interpretation by Rex Harrison. And, you just can't beat Wilfred Hyde-White as Pickering--he's so cute and sweet.Regardless of which one you watch (or perhaps both), I still can't give either a 10 simply because the ending makes little sense and is a letdown. The bottom line is that Shaw understood this and got it right in the play, but the movie folks in the UK and Hollywood just couldn't stand not tacking a happy ending onto the film. Too bad, as Doolittle and Higgins NOT getting together at the end seems more true to the characters and makes the film more of a tragedy--and make for a much more poignant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable movie...And very loyal to the actual Bernard Shaw play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pygmalion is a great movie, it takes place in England. It is mostly about the love that Henry Higgins has for language, he was an expert in the science of phonetics along with Colonel George Pickering. Henry Higgins meets a young lady, Eliza Doolitle, whom sells flowers for a living. She dose not speak well, he takes on a bet that he can teach her the proper way to speak. He bets that he will be able to pass her as a Lady. After very hard work, he believes she is ready to be introduced to his mother, this is how he tests out Eliza. She meets his mother and her guests, Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Freddy &amp; Clara, she does great until she says a curse word as she is leaving. Freddy is infatuated with Eliza. Clara is portrayed as a mirror image of what Eliza is to become. She is a Lady. Then, she is finally taken to the Embassy Ball (this seen is merely talked about in the play, but a very important scene in the movie) were she meets Karpathy, also a teacher of Phonetics. He believes she is a Hungarian because she speaks English perfectly. Higgins wins the bet. Eliza then is upset because she dose not know what will become of her in the future, she runs off after the ball. She returns to the marketplace where she had originally sold the flowers (another scene added to the movie) but ends up in Higgins' mother's house. She runs off with Freddy at the end of the play...but in the movie there is a different ending...which you can see if you watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb, just as My Fair Lady is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this film, it just felt like My Fair Lady without songs. Of course, that's a backward view seeing as My Fair Lady was an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's original play, but My Fair Lady has become such a classic that it's hard not to hear Eliza say "the rain in Spain" and not go into singing it. However, upon re-watching it, I found it to be delightful and a perfect companion for My Fair Lady.Leslie Howard is perfect as Professor Henry Higgins, the teacher of phonetics who makes a bet with friend Colonel Pickering (Scott Sunderland) that he can take a flower girl and turn her into a duchess. That flower girl is Eliza Dolittle (Wendy Hiller). Initially I found Hiller's performance to be less charming than Audrey Hepburn's, but Hiller's performance is charming. It is the charm of comedy and wit rather than Hepburn's mix of vulnerability and assurance. This is not an inferior charm, simply a different one.I adore Leslie Howard as Henry Higgins. In the play, Higgins is only 41, so comparatively young. However in My Fair Lady, 58-year-old Rex Harrison played Higgins, and the actors that followed tended to be in their late forties-late fifties. It's interesting to see both versions. The older Higgins of My Fair Lady means that we do not see their relationship as a typical "love affair" and so we concentrate on Eliza's journey rather than wanting her to get together with Higgins. Having a younger Higgins adds a wonderful sexual frisson and Howard is boyishly sexy in a geeky sort of way without being sexy in a matinée idol sort of way. However, some of the deeper meanings of the play get a little lost this way. This film is a witty cerebral version of the play (I adore David Tree's portrayal of Freddie as a simpering toff), with great editing by David Lean (who would go on to direct Brief Encounter and Laurence of Arabia just for starters). However, My Fair Lady helps to reveal the darker messages behind the play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was Ever Woman In This Humour Wooed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A briskly paced and sometimes hilarious retelling of George Bernard Shaw's most entertaining play. The Pygmalion of Greek myth is Leslie Howard, a professor of phonetics specializing in regional and class accents, who brings his Galatea to life in the person of Wendy Hiller, transformed from dirty, homely, gutter-mouthed flower girl to a clean-minded, morally upright, and impeccably spoken middle-class woman.As Henry Higgens the linguist, Leslie Howard is outrageously self centered and coolly professional. As he says, he treats a Dutchess like a flower girl, contemptuously. What he doesn't add is that he treats a flower girl too like a flower girl too. He treats everybody like dirt except his affable companero, Colonel Pickering, the specialist in "spoken Sanskrit." Even when Howard rushes in on his mother, she looks up with shock and says, "Henry, your supposed to stay home today," and tells him to get out.In Act I, Howard meets Hiller at Covent Garden and, on a dare, takes her into his house to make her over. She finally acquires the phones proper to an English lady. Alas, in an initial experiment in middle-class company, she introduces herself with all the proper pronunciation of all the improper words and stories. "Them that done her in would have done it for a hat pin, let alone a hat," she announces with florid delicacy. Back to the chalk board for both of them.In Act II, the experiment is given the acid test. Howard and Pickering take Hiller to a fancy dress ball full of English nobility and foreign dignitaries. One of the attendees is a former student of Howard's, a certain Aristide Karpathy, who boasts, "You may be able to place anyone in England, but I can place anyone in the world." And Karpathy is determined to discover who this now-beautiful young stranger is. He comes to the conclusion that she speaks English too well to actually BE English, that she's actually a Hungarian princess. ("The chin shows.") End of experiment, and beginning of Act III, which gets serious, repetitive, and a little draggy. The question is, What's to become of Hiller, now that she's been made into a lady? Higgens offers to throw her out but she slides sadly off on her own steam, chockablock with dignity. Does she return to bachelor Howard a moment later? Guess.Some of Shaw's original lines show up both in this speedy little film of 1938 and the elephantine musical that featured Rex Harrison as Higgens and Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, but otherwise there's little to compare. Rex Harrison may very well be better at this sort of comedy than Howard. Harrison was a more versatile actor. And Wilfred Hyde-White is more impressive than the bland Colonel Pickering of 1938. But Wendy Hiller is pretty, despite that overbite, or maybe partly because of it, without being stunningly beautiful, and she can't be compared to Audrey Hepburn. Who could? What drags the more recent, more nearly gargantuan production down is the strain of effort that shows up in the production design and wardrobe. A character in this earlier film is described as wearing "half of Kew Gardens on her head," and -- wow -- how that applies to the wardrobe and makeup in the later movie. It's all rather overwhelming. And after all, Hepburn hardly needs it. It's gilding the flower. Wasn't Givenchy good enough? Anyway, I like this movie at least as well as the musical version. Except for that last act in which everyone seems to get broody and contemplative, it rushes headlong into the study of English class differences, more pronounced and more interesting than those of Americans. It's never boring, and that's saying a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful adaptation of a great stage play, it is as witty and full of interesting ideas as its source material is. Hiller plays her cockney flower girl well, including her transformation, and Howard is a superb choice for the charismatic Henry Higgins. The technical side of the film is not too great though, and there are a few awkward jump cuts in the mix. The film is also hurt by constant choices of music that just do not suit what is happening on screen. But these are minor complaints. Even though the ending is abrupt it also only slightly mars the experience. Any viewer who has seen the play performed or studied it will be interested in this version; those who are not familiar with the material are in for a treat. It was, of course, later turn into the musical 'My Fair Lady' - a technical superior film - but that does not prevent this one from being very good too.</fullReview>

In teaching her, she becomes his ideal woman -- Galatea to his Pygmalion, from whence the title)Hiller is a better choice than Hepburn (Hepburn is too naturally beautiful to play a "draggletailed guttersnipe" believably).All the rest of the casting is better, from Pickering and Freddie to "The Count" and Eliza's father.The idea that you could take the work of a master playwright like Shaw and "add songs" is like colorizing a Hitchcock film (yeah, people are stupid enough to have done that, too...). The songs only serve to disrupt the rhythm and flow of Shaw's dialogue.In short, if you've seen this before you see MFL, you will be greatly disappointed in MFL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not like the mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about a girl named Eliza who tries to learn how to speak proper English from a guy who's simply doing it to win a bet. The plot is fairly basic. I could have sworn that this was based on some Shakespeare play, but instead it was a George Bernard Shaw play which was loosely inspired by Greek mythology. The best part is actually probably in the first eight or so minutes. You get an introduction to all of the main characters at once. It's interesting to see how these characters will develop into the plot. It's a little tedious, but certainly worth checking out.It's really fascinating how intense this film can be. There are many great shots of Eliza failing and people acting out how she's supposed to be like. These characters mostly keep their personalities when the major conflicts truly happen. The camera work is quite impressive. I also feel that this film had a really nice length. It wasn't too long or too short and seemed to be in the middle for a lot of movies released at this time. I rarely see movies that are completely about language, so this was a nice and rare find. ***1/2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rain in Spain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pygmalion is directed by Anthony Asquith and is based on the play by George Bernard Shaw. The film stars Leslie Howard, Wendy Hiller, Scott Sunderland, Jean Cadell, David Tree and Wilfrid Lawson.Snobbish and antisocial phonetics professor Henry Higgins(Leslie Howard), makes a bet that he can turn a cockney flower girl into a duchess, simply by teaching her to speak properly.The lady in question is Eliza Doolittle(Wendy Hiller).Over the course of several months Higgins drives Eliza to a near breakdown as he encourages and bullies her in equal measure to work hard and speak properly.Higgins may teach her to speak nicely but he fails to understand that a lady isn't just considered as such by how she speaks, but by how she is treated. His friend Colonel Pickering(Scott Sunderland)treats Eliza with respect and gentleness from the first moment he meets her. Higgins on the other hand treats her merely as a subject of his experiment and nothing more.When he is satisfied with her progress he takes her to a ball where she will mix with the upper classes and royalty. If the guests believe her to be one of them Higgins will have won his bet.Things are complicated when the dull but sweet Freddy Eynsford-Hill(David Tree)falls in love with Eliza. Eliza makes an interesting observation which is something worth thinking about, now Higgins has made her a lady she is not fit to sell anything accept herself. This is true, the best she can now hope for is to marry a rich man and become a beautiful ornament on his arm at social events. At least when she was poor she could find some sort of employment.Eliza dearly wants to open a flower shop but in the society that she has been elevated into such a thing would have been frowned upon.Over the years some people have longed for a romantic and happy ending between Higgins and Eliza. Shaw himself was against that and was angry when a happy ending was included in the stage play. The films ending is ambiguous because we leave the two characters not knowing what will happen to them next. It can be viewed as happy though.Personally I don't see Higgins and Eliza as a romantic couple. He comes to admire her strength, determination and he does grow fond of her. Eliza is grateful to him for bringing about a change in her life for the better but can never forget that he treated her badly at times. Their personalities are so different that I just can't see them together. I can see them as friends but lovers? No way.The cast are all superb. Leslie Howard is at his best as Higgins, he is totally swept up in his work, it is all consuming to him, he has no time for relationships or social niceties.Howard makes him slightly eccentric, with a razor sharp mind and good observational skills. The look on his face in the final scene says more than any dialogue could, it is a rare glimpse of the feeling Higgins has within but rarely shows externally. From this performance here and his role in Pimpernel Smith, I think he would have been fantastic as Sherlock Holmes, alas that was never to be, but think of how he would have been in that role.Hiller does very well as Eliza although I think she struggles somewhat with the cockney accent, she is much better in the scenes where she is learning to speak properly and in the scenes when she has made the transition from street girl to elegant lady.Wilfrid Lawson steals every scene he's in as Eliza's father and Jean Cadell is good as the tough housekeeper Mrs.Pearce. Scott Sunderland doesn't get much to do as Colonel Pickering but he is good in the scenes he's in. David Tree is good as the young rich man who falls for Eliza because she is different and exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Bare Naked Lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I was doing research and couldn't help but notice that something was familiar about this flick. As the first establishing shot of the town faded in, one building had gigantic pillars and that is when it hit me. MY FAIR LADY. Same story, honestly only different in some ways, but not too much. This one is not a musical, sadly, but on the bright side it is only and hour and a half, as opposed to three hours as its remake was with Audrey "the beautiful" Hepburn in 1964. The title of this film, staring and directed by Leslie Howard, is Pygmalion (1938).Now, Pygmalion is actually a Greek story of an artist who designs a sculpture of a beautiful woman. He ends up falling in love with her and prays to the gods for her to come to life. Aphrodite granted his wish -the lucky bastard.. But this is what the story is based off of.**Henry Higgins's goal is to teach a down-in-the-dumps gutter-girl how to speak the proper English; the fancy kind. To aide him is a colleague named Colonel Pickering, who is a very easy going lad with very little to say.I really found Eliza (Wendy Hiller) a bit different from Hepburn's. I believe in this film, she gave here character more of a meaning. She starts out as a desperate FLOWER girl who just wants to get by, but also aches to learn how to be more middle-class; how to speak properly; and how to fare. This is shown towards the beginning when they negotiate the terms in which Henry (Leslie Howard) teaches her simple phonetics (the science of speech). -- She is also a tad more passive; she seems more accepting to the change rather than completely pushing it away.As for Henry, Rex Harrison's was excellent, but so was Howard's. He defines his character and makes him truly an arrogant bachelor, who does not even notice his insults that come out of his mouth. You can see that he takes after his mother, but only on the egotistic part. She carries a little more heart on her sleeve, if you know what I mean.One thing I would like to mention is that the EDITING, for its time, is amazing! There are two montage scenes that include fading transitions and dutch-angle close-ups that I cannot help but find sexy.I gave this 1938 film a 8 out of 10. I didn't not give it the extra star because I find the story a bit condescending in a way during the MANY arguments between Eliza and Henry. I just think it was not necessary and could have been more pleasing/gratifying towards the end. Other then that, this film and its story is perfection; a true beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film version of Shaws play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review and I will try to make it short. This movie is based on Shaws play "Pygmalion". Its basically an adaption of an old Greek myth. You can read more about it by just searching for Pygmalion on Google (I do not want to somewhat spoiler). Its not like all the comedy nowadays. You do not sit there and laugh at big jokes. This movie rather makes you smile continuous. You have to look at the movie as a whole and not at the single little jokes. The acting is brilliant. Both Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller do a great job and they really get into their roles. If you like comedy with a little more content, you should try to watch "Pygmalion".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful! Unmissable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all seen the 1960s musical version of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion - My Fair Lady. Well, the musical is great entertainment and very well done and unmissable too but this 1938 B&amp;W film version is a revelation. It is fantastic to see different actors deliver the same lines. In my opinion the 1938 version is funnier and the characters are more fully developed so that their relationships are more interesting and engaging.I enjoyed the scene dressing and wonderful costumes in My Fair Lady but the scene dressing, props and costumes in this 1930s film are great too - woollen suits, in fact all of the clothes, made in natural fabrics like fine wool and silk, just glow in the studio lights and are stunning, and get a load of Prof Higgins' owl-spectacles (step aside Harry Potter)! I love the haircuts, the body language (even the extras walk like HM Elizabeth the Queen Mother), the make-up, the huge Bakelite telephones, the bone china tea cups - everything looks real not just a prop. The jewellery glitters, eyes glint, hair glows - everything is so well lit it really does convey candlelight or daylight. The B&amp;W tones are amazing. All-in-all simply fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with wit and intelligence but a curiously damaging ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PygmalionThis is a movie adaptation of the play by George Bernard Shaw; Shaw rewrote the play for the screen and, in my very humble opinion, messed it up. It still is worth watching, though, for people who enjoy intelligence and wit in their movies.We all know the story: 'Enry 'Iggins (ably played by Leslie Howard) picks a flower girl from the gutter (Eliza Doolittle, played admirably by Wendy Hiller), teaches her manners and an upper class dialect, then shows her off in society where she fools everyone. Wendy Hiller was, again in my humble opinion, the best actress of Shaw's time to play his heroines. She was 27 or 28 at the time this movie was made, and she reminds me of Maggie Gyllenhaal in "The Secretary." Hiller really shines as the flower girl with more than spunk.The problem with the movie is that Shaw changed the ending. He also added a dance scene and a character, but they pass without objection. The ending, however, completely changes the play. Shaw had his views, and he was very definite about them. He attacked society and its hypocrisy at every opportunity, and his attacks were more impressive because of their popularity. Among his plays were "Mrs. Warren's Profession" (she was a prostitute, shocking at the time), "Arms and the Man," "Major Barbara," and "Candida." Shaw was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925.In "Pygmalion," Shaw punctured middle class morality and England's class system. One of the funniest scenes in the movie takes place after Higgins has taught Eliza the niceties of pronunciation but not of conversation. He takes her to his mother's home, where she meets and converses with Higgins's mother and her friends. Shaw places her interests and vocabulary in the gutter (so to speak), but gives her the precise pronunciation of the upper class as she talks about her aunt being fed gin to revive her until someone done her in. The dialogue is excellent, and the cast perfectly shows the blank-faced confusion of the upper class as they maintain their mannered aplomb.The movie is mostly a witty social satire; you can ignore the social satire which is dated and just enjoy the wit and sparks flying between Eliza and Henry. If you pay attention to the dialogue, you'll be rewarded. However, when we get to the end, the dialogue becomes didactic and things tended to drag a little for me, although Hiller's interpretation of Eliza's lines makes them ring with pride and independence: "I won't be coaxed round as if I was a baby or a puppy. If I can't have kindness, I'll have independence." I'm very disappointed by the ending, though. SPOILERS---------------In the play, there is a poor but upper class character named Freddy who worships Eliza. After Henry shows Eliza off at a royal party, Henry takes full credit for having produced a clever parrot from a guttersnipe. Eliza is outraged that her hard work and personal effort, to say nothing of her native intelligence, are unnoticed by Henry. They argue, giving Shaw's view of the world, and Eliza leaves Henry for Freddy. This is the ending as it should be, although it gives lie to the title.* For the movie, Eliza leaves with Freddy but returns to Henry and fetches his slippers. I can't believe Shaw wrote this, but there it is in black and white. It gives the movie what I presume audiences saw as a happy ending. (The final shot reminds me of the end of "The Man Who Fell to Earth," by the way.) It's not enough of a travesty to wreck the whole movie for me, but it was a disappointment nonetheless.*The story of Pygmalion is given in Ovid's "Metamorphoses." In that story, Pygmalion is an artist who lives on an island. None of the women there meet his standards of virtue, and he carves a likeness of his perfect woman in ivory. The statue is so beautiful he falls in love with it and prays to Venus for the statue to live. Venus hears his plea and grants it, giving life to Galatea. They marry and live happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's MY FAIR LADY with a "Freddy" so vacuous . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . that "Eliza Doolittle" is driven back to Leslie Howard's self-styled modern Pygmalion, Professor of Phonetics Henry Higgins. This despite the fact that the future "Ashley Wilkes" (Leslie Howard) uses the "D-word" a dozen times more than Clark Gable's Rhett Butler would the following year in GONE WITH THE WIND. (That's because England was about a dozen times more "free" than America back in the 1900s.) Eliza's wavering between misogynist "confirmed bachelor" Henry and Freddy's Mr. Giggles is understandable, since Oscar-winning screenwriter George Bernard Shaw included an "afterword" about 50 pages long with the book version of his original PYGMALION stage play explaining why he thought Freddy--NOT Henry--must wind up with the flapper version of Galatea, Eliza. Emerson said a foolish consistency is the "hobgoblin" of little minds, which excuses Shaw's ambivalence. Bernie had a great big brain--so vast that he's the only screenwriter in movie history to have a Nobel Prize on his mantle. When you watch PYGMALION, you'll realize Shaw handed Lerner and Lowe the musical openings and half the actual lyrics to their eventual 1964 "Best Picture" screen musical remake of this story: MY FAIR LADY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British version of Shaw play is concise and terrific...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There can be no doubt that LESLIE HOWARD was the perfect actor to play Henry Higgins in Shaw's PYGMALION--although when watching it one can't help hearing Rex Harrison behind some of the lines, so ingrained is the Harrison performance on this particular role.But Howard shows the flair for comedy that he demonstrated in other films of the '30s, most notably a screwball comedy with Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland called "It's Love I'm After" in which Howard and Eric Blore stole the film with their riotous performances.Here he excels as Higgins and with a wonderful Eliza in the form of WENDY HILLER, the two of them make you forget there ever was a musical version--well, almost. Every time they mention "the rain in Spain" or other Shaw phrases that were turned into musical phrases, you can envision the musical behind the play.SCOTT SUNDERLAND is a delightfully aristocratic Col. Pickering and WILFRID LAWSON is impressive as Alfred Doolittle, each making the role their own in a way that rivals the broader playing of the roles in the musical version directed by George Cukor.What's nice about this MY FAIR LADY is that it isn't overstuffed to the point where it takes more than two hours to tell the tale. It's performed in a brisk one hour and thirty-six minutes without any dull spots.WENDY HILLER is remarkable as Eliza, making the transformation from ignorant Cockney flower girl to a glittering lady with the right amount of poise and charm. She isn't as glamorized as Audrey Hepburn for the ball scene, but still manages to convey the elegance that classifies her as a princess to the elite ladies and gentlemen at the ballroom.If you look closely, you can spot a youthful LEO GENN as the prince who dances with Eliza while the onlookers stare. He hasn't a line of dialog.Well done, smoothly directed by Anthony Asquith, it's a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The character of Professor Higgins is a pompous, arrogant, thoughtless. selfish and completely unlikable character and it beggars belief that anyone could find anything about him worth caring about. And what is worse, he never redeems himself. George Bernard Shaw is far too enamoured with the sound of his own words to have been allowed to write the screenplay. There is good writing here no doubt, but most of the scenes are interminably long and verbose and continue long after the point has been made. Wendy Hiller is an absolute joy both to watch and listen to. Her performance is outstanding, but sadly not enough to save the movie from the endlessly annoying droning of Professor Higgins.</fullReview>

With all the beautiful music, that film was far more captivating, but this 1938 gem is not exactly a slouch either.With a totally different ending that might disappoint you, this is basically a story of a woman coming into her own and after succeeding, learning that in life we must assert ourselves. The next to the last scene where Hiller asserts her intentions is absolutely terrific.The scene at the ball may have been a little too dull, but nevertheless, it fits the decor.Cheers to George Bernard Shaw for his creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hungarian Rhapsody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a wonderful 'in joke' at work here: Leslie Howard, the ultimate 'English' man, teacher of English and expert ON English was actually Hungarian though George Bernard Shaw could have had no idea of this when, in his original play he created a Hungarian pupil of Higgins who became so adept that he, too, could spot an impostor at ten glottal stops. Inevitably comparisons will be made with My Fair Lady and, by extension, between Howard and Harrison. It's really no contest; in real life Harrison was widely acknowledged both to his face and behind his back to be a super c... so that he could phone in the Higgins arrogance and disdain whereas Howerd was a much nicer, gentler person and had to 'act' the Higgins arrogance. The movie is this week's free DVD with a Broadsheet newspaper and it makes a welcome addition though the companion DVD - also directed by Puffin Asquith - The Browning Version is light years ahead of it and an acknowledged classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, No Match for My Fair Lady -- but Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Famous in its day, "Pygmalion" with Leslie Howard and "introducing" Wendy Hiller is a faithful if abbreviated rendition of George Bernard Shaw's most famous play. Most famous, not because it is his best nor because it is the most penetrating portrayal of British society, but because it provided the story for the musical "My Fair Lady." And that's the problem when you watch this excellent film. The viewer can't help comparing Leslie Howard as Professor Higgins with Rex Harrison and Wendy Hiller with Audrey Hepburn who played Eliza Doolittle in the movies or Julie Andrews who played her on the stage, and it's difficult to suppress the expectation that the characters are likely to burst into song at any given moment. One particularly misses Stanley Holloway as Mr. Doolittle, Eliza's father, that stalwart, self-described representative of the "undeserving poor." Still, judged on its own terms, "Pygmalion" is a brilliant success (in black and white). Both Howard and Hiller capture the essence of their characters and -- although it is a departure from the play -- the fact that they have fallen in love is evident as the credits roll. Howard, best remembered as Ashley Wilkes in "Gone for the Wind" (which I happen to despise), is far better in this movie. Watching him in this starring role is a reminder of how much was lost when he was killed during World War II at the age of 50. Young Wendy Hiller foreshadows her elder self in a completely winning performance. This was a British production and the cast is filled from top to bottom with well-trained British actors. Too bad that Shaw has essentially gone out of fashion. This film -- more perhaps than the musical -- is a reminder of just how brilliantly funny Shaw plays often are. Yes, they are "talky" -- but such talk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wendy Hiller destroys it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie after the musical "My Fair Lady". I am afraid it compares badly. And the biggest reason for this is the choice of Eliza: Wendy Hiller. I think she was a good character actress, and she did many good parts later in life, playing middle-aged and old women.But here in "Pygmalion" she is deeply inadequate - at least after one has seen Audrey Hepburn, who could have been tailored for the role. Wendy Hiller was nowhere near beautiful or graceful enough - on the contrary: she was stocky and her face was coarse. I think it was such a pity that she was allowed to ruin this movie, which I am sure I would otherwise have liked a lot. The other actors are excellent in their roles!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaw On Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1938 Gabriel Pascal-Anthony Asquith production of George Bernard Shaw's classic comedy, Pygmalion, is an excellent adaptation, bears the imprimatur of the great man himself, and I highly recommend it. Upon close examination it's not as good as it could be, especially compared to what David Selznick and George Cukor might have done with it, even with the same cast, in the U.S. British films of the time weren't technically as good as American ones, and while this one's as good as it gets from its period, the production values and cinematography, while accomplished, are not nearly so larger than life as the play itself, and as a result the film feels a little tinny at times. Leslie Howard makes a nicely genteel if somewhat wan Professor Higgins, while Wendy Hiller shines as Eliza. The play must have seemed a bit of a period piece when the film was made, and as a result it doesn't reflect its time. Pascal and Company missed the timelessness and universality of Shaw, whose speeches and asides are often spoken as if they were more old-fashioned than they in fact were, which in turn makes the film, not the play, feel rather dated. Pascal got it right a few years later with his film of Major Barbara, and that one's the best movie of Shaw's work I've ever seen. This one's a close second. A good try, nice to listen to, but not a hundred percent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It would be better without Professor Higgins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a four-star movie in the various video guides, but not for me. True, there is much to like. It can be very funny. But two-thirds of the way through the film I began finding the Henry Higgins character unbearably dense--for all his brilliance--and tiresome.Here Eliza Doolittle has been transformed into a veritable princess, but for Higgins this just means he's won his bet with Pickering. He can't see the beauty that's right in front of him. For that matter, throughout the film he cannot see the human woman that's right in front of him; he treats her like an object and is downright mean.Higgins strikes me as the sort of irascible eccentric that we are meant to find delightful and, when all is said and done, endearing. It's been my belief that eccentrics are tiresome because they really have no sense of what they look like to others and in fact don't really care that much about others. They're too busy riding some behavioral or mental hobby horse. And that's what makes them eccentric.Wendy Hiller is wonderful as Eliza, both pre- and post-Higgins. I don't see anything funny about the way Higgins treats her character.I don't know anything about G.B. Shaw other than this film derived from one of his plays. It doesn't make me want to find out more about his work.</fullReview>
