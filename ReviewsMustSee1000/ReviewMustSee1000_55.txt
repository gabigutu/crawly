		<shortDescription>Droll romantic comedy showcases Hugh Grant in his best role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Curtis, author of Rowan Atkinson's sublime Blackadder TV series, here contributes a romantic comedy screenplay which is actually romantic AND actually funny. American hacks should take note: it's possible to write comedy based on the battle of the sexes that doesn't rely on misogyny and gross-out humor.Hugh Grant at his most charming leads a talented ensemble cast in this warm-hearted tale of unrequited and requited love that so impressed stodgy Academy voters it actually got a Best Picture nomination. I won't quibble with those who say it was undeserving -- although some of the other user comments are ridiculously hostile to such a lightweight romp -- but I will defend its makers for crafting a genuine crowd-pleaser that relies on story, character and witty dialogue for its appeal. The essence of good romantic comedy is what Curtis and director Mike Newell capture particularly well in this film (more effectively than Curtis' other Grant hit, NOTTING HILL) and it's this: love makes us do stupid things. We err in choice, we blunder in execution, we make utter fools of ourselves, and yet we don't give up. We still strive. We still search for that perfect someone. And the glory is -- sometimes we get lucky.Going along on this quest with Grant and friends is as enjoyable an entertainment as you're lucky to find in your local DVD section.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A British Romantic Comedy as Good as Hollywood at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Curtis's films have sometimes been criticised for giving a too cosy, conservative view of British society. "Four Weddings and a Funeral" seems to take place in an England of eternal summer, a land which consists almost entirely of green and pleasant countryside and the more exclusive districts of London and which is populated solely by members of the upper and upper-middle classes. The script does cross the border into an equally idealised Scotland of mists, tartans and Highland flings, but even these scenes were actually shot in Surrey. Such criticism contains an element of truth, but is largely irrelevant when it comes to assessing the merits of the film because it ignores the fact that most romantic comedies (in other media as well as in the cinema) are set against a relatively narrow background in terms of social class, often enabling the writer to satirise the manners of that class. Jane Austin, for example, the most successful writer of romantic comedy in nineteenth-century England, set all her works among the wealthy landed gentry or prosperous bourgeoisie of the day.Most of the action of the film takes place either at, or immediately before or after, one of the four church services mentioned in the title. The main character, Charles, is a well-to-do young man, probably educated at public school, and clearly a member of the professional classes, although we never actually discover what his job is. The film starts with a wedding at which Charles is best man to Angus, one of his old friends, and at which he meets Carrie, an attractive young American woman. The film then traces the ups and downs of the relationship of Charles and Carrie, via two more weddings (the second of which is Carrie's own, after she and Charles have split up), the funeral of Gareth, another friend of Charles who suffers a heart attack while dancing at Carrie's wedding, and one final marriage ceremony.Hugh Grant, as Charles, gives a very good performance. Grant has a relatively narrow range as an actor, but he is capable of some excellent work within that range. There are some subtle differences between Charles and William, the character Grant played in "Notting Hill", another romantic comedy written by Curtis. William is a shy young man who uses ironic, self-deprecating humour as a cover for his shyness and lack of self-confidence. He is very much in love with Anna, that film's heroine, but is afraid to declare his love because he cannot believe that a beautiful and successful film star would take any interest in the owner of a small bookshop. Charles, by contrast, is less shy than William and enjoys more success with women. His humour is also ironic, but for a different reason. He is afraid of his emotions and of commitment and uses irony as a means of distancing himself from life and of avoiding having to commit himself.The film can be seen as the story of Charles's journey to emotional maturity. He has had a number of brief affairs, all of which have petered out precisely because he is afraid of his emotions. His relationship with Carrie initially goes the same way and she marries a richer and older man. The change in Charles's character is partly due to the fact that he sees his carefree bachelor world disappearing as most of his friends get married, but the event which seems to have the greatest effect on him is Gareth's funeral, at which a moving eulogy is read by Matthew, Gareth's gay partner, touchingly played by John Hannah. Charles realises the strength of the love that Gareth and Matthew shared for one another and comes to appreciate that such a relationship is something to be valued.Grant does well to make Charles a sympathetic figure, despite his having many failings quite apart from his ironic distancing of himself from the world. He is clumsy, accident-prone (he manages to lose the ring at Angus's wedding), much given to profane language and can be appallingly tactless, especially about his former girlfriends. The other main character, Carrie, can perhaps be seen as a female Charles, someone who is on the same journey as him but who has travelled slightly further. (It is significant that her name is short for Caroline, the feminine equivalent of the name Charles). She freely admits to having had over thirty previous lovers, but she is the first to want to bring emotional commitment to their relationship. Am I, incidentally, the only one to have liked Andie MacDowell's performance?- she has come in for a lot of criticism, in my view undeserved, on this board.The film is, however, more than simply a study of relationships- it is also very funny with some superb lines. Hugh Grant can be very amusing, and there was a great cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling, nervous trainee priest who keeps fluffing his lines during one of the weddings. ("Awful wedded wife", or "Holy Goat" for "Holy Ghost"). I also liked David Bower as Charles's deaf brother David, the late Charlotte Coleman as his impudent younger sister Scarlett and Anna Chancellor as his ex-girlfriend Henrietta (also known as Duckface), whose embarrassing emotional incontinence perhaps explains why Charles is so keen to distance himself from his feelings. I was less impressed by Simon Callow as Gareth, loud, extrovert and excessively hearty (like most characters Callow plays).To sum up, this was a very good film indeed; proof that the British cinema can produce romantic comedies as good as Hollywood at its best. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Comedy Done Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Weddings and a Funeral is a wonderful movie. Romantic comedies often throw people off because they tend to be cheesy or depressingly sugar-coated. However, this is a truly wonderful movie.First off, the cast is terrific. They play off of each other wonderfully and it makes for a delightful atmosphere. Just take the lead, Hugh Grant, whose character doesn't appear fit the stereotypical lead at all. The humor is very witty, and the jokes are guaranteed to make you laugh even after you've seen the movie a dozen times. Situations in the movie are set up to be played out perfectly. In one scene Hugh Grant is at a wedding and is seated with all of his ex-girlfriends. The scene is set up for utter humiliation. Even with the quick-witted characters, and all the weddings, it wouldn't be a movie without that touch of drama that for many might just get a tear out of them.Hands down all around great movie to fit most every occasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich In Story and Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, `Four Weddings and a Funeral,' directed by Mike Newell. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar. Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next. Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he's had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp. Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him. It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it's only-- as they say-- the beginning. Set in contemporary England, one of the aspects of this film that makes it so engaging is the propriety with which the humor is presented. Refreshingly subtle, there's more of Noel Coward than Tom Green or Rob Schneider to it; a matter of manners, mores and innuendo taking precedence over gross-out, in-your-face, shock schlock humor. And though Grant and MacDowell are at the forefront of the piece, Newell does an excellent job of developing all of the characters, succinctly supplying enough detail to each individual to give the film some depth and dimension, without having to actually go too deep. He never lets you forget that first and foremost, this is a comedy. There's some insight provided, but this is not an in-depth commentary on human nature, though there are some overtones and implications in that direction (Charles is always late to the weddings, for example; perhaps a subconscious denial of the impending nuptials?). Most importantly, the characterizations are rich, and the story is involving and presented with an even flow that allows you to effortlessly be swept away with it.  Certain actors make a career out of playing a variation of the same character in film after film, striving for that definitive portrayal. W.C. Fields played the hen-pecked husband in a number of films, finally perfecting that particular character in the person of Harold Bissonette in `It's A Gift.' For Hugh Grant, it's the retiring, somewhat self-conscious and stammering, eyelid fluttering charmer, of which he's done a variation in such films as `Sense and Sensibility,' `The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill, But Came Down A Mountain,' Notting Hill' and `Mickey Blue Eyes.' But Charles is his definitive portrayal of that character, the one in which he achieves the balance and honesty that makes the character so believable. It's a good bit of work by Grant, and definitely one of his most memorable performances. Andie MacDowell, meanwhile, gives a rather composed performance as Carrie, the quiet American with a reserved bluntness who captivates Charles. MacDowell brings a sense of quietude to the role that is sensuously seductive, which lends credibility to Charles' infatuation with her. It's a role for which MacDowell is perfectly suited, as it allows her to play effectively to her naturally calm demeanor and exquisite beauty and femininity. In a part that has to be an actor's dream, Simon Callow is absolutely exuberant as Gareth, one of the fixtures of Charles' circle of friends. More than just an effervescent character, Gareth is something of the conscience of the film, laughing away and laying bare any and all pretense or hypocrisy like a modern day flesh-and-blood Spirit of Christmas Present. It's a character that gives needed balance and perspective to the film, and he's wonderfully played by Callow. Also turning in especially noteworthy performances are John Hannah as Matthew; Kristin Scott Thomas, who is quite alluring as Fiona; James Fleet as Tom, a character very reminiscent of his Hugo in the TV series `The Vicar of Dibley,' (and very effective here); Charlotte Coleman, memorable in the role of Scarlett; and Rowan Atkinson as the hapless Father Gerald. Rounding out the supporting cast are David Bower (David), Timothy Walker (Angus), Sara Crowe (Laura), Anna Chancellor (Henrietta), Simon Kunz (John), David Haig (Bernard), Sophie Thompson (Lydia Jane) and Corin Redgrave (Hamish). There's enough twists and turns along the way to keep this film unpredictable, including one scene near the end that initially seems so mean-spirited that it may have you biting your fist and crying, `Oh, NO!' But, not to worry, Newell provides an instant resolution consistent with the rest of the film, and it not only works but gets a good laugh to boot. Entertaining, pleasant and funny, `Four Weddings and a Funeral' makes for a satisfying, feel-good cinematic experience that just seems so wonderfully civilized amid the seemingly endless rancor abounding in our world today. It's what's known as the magic of the movies. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A note to the anti-Andie brigade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm blind to the alleged charm of Andie MacDowell myself. That's why I think that casting her in this film was a stroke of genius, for so far as my senses tell me she perfectly fits the character she plays: a dull beauty who casts a spell over one out of every twenty men she meets, leaving the remaining nineteen cold and completely baffled. Charlie (Hugh Grant) is surrounded by MUCH more desirable female friends - even Duckface has something going for her - but instead of so much as noticing them he falls head over heels for an unattainable woman who is, on top of everything else, boring. Would have been as good as it is if Charlie's passion had made SENSE? Of course not.Anyway, everyone I know with a low opinion of this film begins the case for the prosecution with an attack on Andie MacDowell. Is there anything else to dislike? I can't see it myself. This is one of the world's few perfect comedies, devoid of longeurs - perhaps the funeral didn't have quite the desired effect - with true comedy and a nice selection of characters. One has no difficulty keeping the dozen or so members of the main set mentally separate. How many romantic comedies can you say THAT about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky Characters Shine in Touching, Funny, Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lead character in this film, Charles, says at one point that, while his friends were busily obsessed with marriage, two members of their group were, for all intents and purposes, married to each other. In those days before Britain had a civil partnership law, he was referring to Gareth and Matthew, played by Simon Callow and John Hannah. "Four Weddings and a Funeral" was among the first major films to feature a gay couple without any comment, moralizing, or stereotyping. Considering all of the absurd controversy generated by "Brokeback Mountain," this English comedy may be considered subversive in some quarters, because it portrays the union between the two men to be as loving and enduring as any between the men and a women in the same film. The two gay men are among a circle of idiosyncratic friends that orbit around Charles, who suffers from relationship avoidance. Played engagingly by Hugh Grant, Charles attends the weddings of others, but manages to avoid any commitment of his own. One of the film's funniest scenes involves Charles at a wedding reception where he has been seated at a table with several of his ex-girlfriends. With that one scene, screenwriter Richard Curtis wittily fleshes out Charles's character as each woman remarks on her past experience. The episodic comedy is broken down literally into the five events of the title, and the core characters attend these events as spectators who each hope for a wedding of their own. Many of the lines and situations are extremely funny. Rowan Atkinson steals his brief time as a novice preacher who blesses a couple "in the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy goat." Although Hugh Grant plays Charles as, well, Hugh Grant, several other actors create some fine comic turns. The ravishing Kristin Scott Thomas is touching as the lonely Fiona, and her timing is impeccable when she recovers from an indelicate question with a snappy comeback. Of course, why anyone as beautiful as Kristin Scott Thomas should be unwillingly single is a minor casting flaw in the film. Unfortunately, Andie MacDowell plays the American, Carrie, and, although she looks great in a hat, she fails to generate the necessary charisma to convincingly be Charles's object of desire. However, the low wattage generated by the two leads does little to dampen the hilarity or the pathos of this excellent film. While, at nearly two hours, the movie is long for a comedy, the structure and quirky characters easily sustain interest throughout. With "Four Weddings and a Funeral," director Mike Newell has made one of the best romantic comedies, and the film holds up to repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Little Film That Charmed Its Way to a Best Picture Nod in 1994</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and a Funeral" is a nice little film from 1994. It did fair at the box office and did fair with critics. The Academy was charmed enough to award the film with a Best Picture nomination. The film deals with a British bachelor (Hugh Grant) who continues to run into a beautiful young American (Andie McDowell) at various weddings in England. As the film progresses their lust for each other turns into love and the finale is a real triumph. This film is a comedy for the most part, but its elements of drama put it above most films that go primarily for laughs. The screenplay is smart and the supporting cast is excellent. Kristin Scott Thomas and Rowan Atkinson (albeit in a very small role) are memorable. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderfully funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am viewing the movie for my fifth time since its release. I just love this movie and laugh almost endless throughout the movie. My favorite parts of this movie are not the "Hollywood A List" actors but the not so well known actors. They are incredibly funny and give wonderful performances. I could easily write a bit about each actor in this movie but time does not permit. These are some very talented people. As a fan of British humor, I am especially pleased with the incredible writing along with the acting. Not to mention some of the scenery. If someone is feeling low, this is a great movie to watch to lift the spirits. I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting or needing a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> "Four Weddings And A Funeral" is indeed a delightful little comedy with some wondeful writing and polished performances.Hugh Grant shines in a role that unfortunately left Him typecast to this day (for a different side of Grant see his brilliant Fredrich Chopin in "Impromptu".) and Kristen Scott Thomas is perfect as the enigmatic Fiona...witty,beautiful and touching. Simon Callow nearly steals the film as Gareth..He is one of the world's finest stage actors and its nice to see him get a film role he can really sink his teeth into. Andie McDowall is very convincing as the object of Grant's affection and Corin Redgrave has a well acted cameo as McDowall's fiancee Hamish. over all a jolly good film,funny,touching and sharp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie? Not bad. McDowell? Disastrous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was funny, easy to watch. Hugh Grant's character - the same one he plays in every film - is sufficiently charming that it can pull you through any number of storybook plots without all that much trouble.But Andie McDowell - and I was so seized by this that I registered on this site just to make this comment, marking the first time I've posted anything on one of these - acts so badly I was squirming in my chair with vicarious embarassment every time she stood in front of the camera. At first, I thought her character was simply being sarcastic and thus speaking with an exaggerated indifference. Then I realized that the story called for nothing of the sort, and it was just her. Each sentence was blurted in the same vacant monotone, like she was the voicemail lady sitting in a room reading off disjointed phrases to be pieced together later by a computer. Out of the hundreds of engaging, beautiful, talented actresses who would be champing at the bit to appear with Grant in a sure-fire feelgood movie such as this, how, I ask, how could they have selected her? And after all the film was in the can, available for objective review, what callous laziness prevented the studio from employing the best CGI talent available to excise her visage and droning voice from every frame and replace it with something more lifelike, such as perhaps a Dalek from an old Dr. Who episode?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Britain's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSOnce upon a time there was a British film written by Richard Curtis which made countless young actors careers. That film was "Four Weddings And A Funeral" and despite a few flaws, it remains as fresh today as it did in 1994.In "Four Weddings And A Funeral" we are introduced to a group of friends who are all looking for love. There's the extremely posh but extremely adorable Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), her idiotic brother Tom (James Fleet), the excentric Scarlett (the late Charlotte Coleman), gay couple Gareth and Matthew (Simon Callow and John Hannah), deaf friend David (David Bower) and most importantly of all, their useless mate Charles (Hugh Grant). The film covers these friends adventures over four weddings and one of their owns brace with mortality. Primarily though, it's a love story between Charles and the mysterious American Carrie (played with a wooden quality by Andie MacDowell). From their first meeting until the obvious conclusion, these two show signs of chemistry and leave the audience wanting a happy ending.The best part of this film, by some considerable distance, is the link between the friends. In their friendships our own relationships are reflected, and they remind us of how great these connections can be. Kristin Scott-Thomas and Simon Callow in particular are outstanding, Scott-Thomas showing signs of a promising career and Callow holding his own as one of the few old faces amongst a sea of fresh young actors. When this huge group of friends are all on screen together, the film is best off for it.In contrast with the group of friends, the acting takes a nosedive when Andie MacDowell is on screen. I actually feel sorry for MacDowell when I hear criticisms of this film. Whilst it is an awful performance by her, it should not be seen as a regular occurance. Whilst she is dire in this film, in "Groundhog Day" with Bill Murray, she holds her own and demonstrates potential. It is just a shame that she is so useless in this piece.When talking about this film, the script and the group of friends make this film what it is. Grant and company make this film amazing. Sadly though, the film does dip when Andie MacDowell is on the screen. Despite one American flaw though, this film does remain one of Britain's finest pieces of cinema ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three laughs and a ton of rubbish (spoilers throughout)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So let me get this straight. There's this British bloke who sleeps with this American gal. Just once, mind you. But despite this, he falls hopelessly in love. However, she leaves and doesn't call him back. Then when they see each other again, she's engaged. But for some reason she sleeps with him again. Oh, and then she takes him out shopping with her. As if that isn't torture enough, she's shopping for a wedding dress and makes him watch as she tries on various gowns. What kind of woman is this? And why should I give a damn about her? And how the hell can the filmmakers expect me to be happy when these two imbeciles end up getting married? But then again this a Working Title picture and a film scripted by Richard Curtis. Drivel is their forte.What I hate most about Four Weddings and a Funeral is how mechanical it is. There's not one genuine moment or one piece of sincerity. Its whole purpose is to manipulate in the name of entertainment. Just take the ludicrous sequence of events listed above. It isn't done because it echoes genuine human behaviour. It's done so that the screenplay can move from Point A to Point B. And that's how I really see the film. I see it as plot points. Charles and Carrie have to meet so that the wheel can start turning. Then they have to sleep together so that they Charles can fall in love. But then Carrie has to leave to keep the tension going. However, Carrie has to come back to keep up the interest. But she has to be engaged to provide an obstacle. But then they have to sleep together again to keep the promise of romance later in the film spluttering along. But then she has to leave again to tighten the tension. Then she has to get married to wind the tension even tighter. But then someone has to die so that Charles can come to the conclusion that life is only meaningful if you're married. This of course then means that Charles has to decide to marry someone awful so that we can be jolly pleased when he decides not to and when he decides to marry his true love who has suddenly, miraculously even, recently separated ? a woman, let me remind you again, who jerks him about and who rubs her engagement to another man in his face. It's a load of rubbish.It's not very funny either. I think I laughed three times. The first laugh was at the drunk man in the pub, the second was at the awful best man's speech and the third was at the sex scene. Aside from that though, I didn't even crack a smile. Most of the humour fell flat. Just take Rowan Atkinson's cameo. You can see the jokes coming a mile away. Then there's the 'hilarious' swearing. I tell you, Richard Curtis just cannot do swearing. He tries his best in every screenplay he writes but it's so self-conscious that it's cringe worthy. And I'm someone who loves profanity. I mean, it kills me that I can't swear in these reviews, it really does. But Richard Curtis is no Peter Cook, no Ricky Gervais and no Chris Morris. He's just a middle class twit feeding America's preconceptions about Britain ? that we're uncomfortable with sex, that we're all loveably quirky and that in every corner there are dancing homosexuals.But the worst thing in the film is actually the American (or Andie MacDowell as she is otherwise known). I've already talked about her ridiculous character but her acting is astoundingly bad. She can't deliver a line. The worst example is, "Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed." The line in itself is awful enough, but when it's expressed in a monotone drawl, it's unbearable. And then there's the scene where she plays a joke on Charles. He doesn't know that it's a joke but when he does realise he laughs with relief. Pretty standard stuff. Only Andie MacDowell's laugh is so feeble that she does actually look like the bunny killer stereotype that Charles is laughing at. She doesn't look like she's joking at all. She looks dead serious.But the established actors aren't much better. Simon Callow, in particular, is hideously bad. I mean, he's a good actor, but in this film, like everyone, he tires too damn hard. He's a gay stereotype turned up to 11. I was actually quite thankful when he died so that he could give me a break. But at least Curtis had the good sense to ensure that he didn't die of AIDS. At least he didn't play that cliché.However, the death of Callow's character leads to the terrible funeral scene. It's not moving. It's not emotional. It's just a cynical way to play the audience and to get Charles to the next plot point. He has to see that monogamy is the way to true happiness and that you're a no one if you don't have someone crying at your funeral. What tosh! Then there's the ending. If everything else is just bad, then the ending is offensive. What happens? Why, everyone gets married, of course! (Oh, but not the gay man, you understand. Although he does find a new 'special friend'.) Bloody hell. It's bad in the sense that all the loose ends are tied neatly together but it's even worse in the sense that it sells conformity and belief in an archaic institution as the only road to happiness. How terribly middle class.Oh, and if the film had a brain, and if Charles had a brain too, he would have dumped the American for Kristin Scott Thomas. But we can't have that, can we? That would have killed the transatlantic appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but not worth the reputation it has surprisingly held with it over the past decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles' habit of being late to pretty much everything he does and attends doesn't stop him being best man at a friend's wedding. While there he meets (and beds) the delightful American Carrie and finds himself quite attracted to her and regrets that she flies back to America the same day. At another wedding he meets her again but finds that she has gotten engaged to a rather rich Scottish man and is off the market ? although that doesn't stop her sleeping with Charles again. As her wedding approaches, Charles begins to realise that his marrying days are fast passing him by and the woman that he loves may never be his.Despite this film "the best British film ever"? it has been many years since I last saw it so I decided to watch it again. With a simple plot, a lot rests on the central "romance" and the characters and for me it doesn't totally work on this level. The group of friends are reasonably well written but they are very much a public school crowd that are rather aloof and therefore failed to engage me ? it spoke volumes to me that Scarlet was the only one I liked, partly perhaps because she was just a down to earth character. Without this emotional hook in the people, I never got that into it and just let it wash over me as a comedy. However on this level it didn't set the world on fire; sure it was amusing and had some very funny moments but not enough to be worth the reputation it has gained over the years.The lack of characters are helped by what I consider to be two rather uninspiring performances from the lead. Grant does his usual "bumbling Englishman" stuff and back in 1994 it seemed fresh; now it appears to be pretty much all he has done and this cannot fail to colour it looking back. He isn't helped by a total lack of chemistry with MacDowell who, lets be honest, is pretty insipid and poor for most of the film. Her lines sound unnatural and I just didn't like her at all. The support characters are colourful enough; Callow is great value, Hannah is the only one that manages to bring some real feeling into the film, Coleman is cool and the others are nice. Smaller roles are also good from Walker, Bower and a funny cameo from Atkinson. None of them can really consistently lift the material but they are pretty good ? the problems are not with the support, it is with the leads.Overall this is an OK film but it is certainly nothing more than that. The comedy is sporadic and it produces a few laughs but not enough often enough. The romance falls flat because the dialogue is clunky and the two leads have little chemistry ? a fact not helped by MacDowell's roundly poor performance. Worth a look if the genre appeals to you but not really worth the reputation that the media hype and shock of a profitable English film earned it at the time.</fullReview>

It is a romance which makes absolutely no sense to the viewer.The object of affection is a promiscuous, threesome-having, cheating, superficial, self-absorbed woman named Carrie, which Andie Macdowell plays as if she were just a breezy, soft-spoken nice girl. Andie is so uncomfortable in this role that every single line is delivered in a monotone drawl. If you can get through her last line, "Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed," while they are standing in a downpour, without laughing, my hat's off to you.Without spoiling to much, let's just say if you value romance, like actual romance involving two people getting along, spending some quality non-sex time together, you are not going to find it in this hollow, mechanical movie. And when I mean hollow, I mean so completely insincere that anyone who lives in the real world would find the characters' behavior mystifying until the ending credits. I still don't understand what this movie was trying to say.I was 100% rooting for Hugh Grant (Charles) to end up with either of the two eligible women who are actually loyal and devoted to him, and who don't treat him and his feelings dismissively throughout the entire film, as Carrie does.So terribly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creme de la creme of romantic comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Weddings has achieved iconic status as a British film and for good reasons. It comes under the category of a romantic comedy but I would argue that it is in fact far more than that. It is a film about love in all its myriad and astonishing aspects - love between man and woman, or between 2 men, love between mother and child and longstanding friendship which can be much more important than sexual love. You would need a heart of stone not to cry at the funeral scene. The film is beautiful to look at with the contrasting weddings and gorgeous costumes. It is directed with a very light touch and interweaves the main characters in an ingenious way. The acting is generally superb and without a doubt it is Hugh Grant's greatest role - before he became middle aged and cynical. My only objection is that Andie McDowell was a very odd choice for the role, not very beautiful and not a serious actress. Apart from that, the film is perfect in every respect and I could watch it forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't matter how many times I watch this (and I keep watching it every single time I come across it on TV) I still quit changing channels and get completely sucked into this movie. It's such a classic. Funny, bumbling, charming, endearing. I just love everything about it.I also think this is when Hugh Grant became, well, the Hugh Grant we've seen in every single movie he's done since. It doesn't matter though, this is just fantastic.Randomly that scene at the funeral when the secret boyfriend recites the poem "stop the clocks" is my favourite scene. Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughter and tears as Hugh Grant finds love at Four Weddings and a Funeral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles has attended many weddings with his group of unmarried friends; none were his though. Then, at a wedding where he is the best man, he sees Carrie and it is love at first sight. Things seem to go well and he spends the night with her; then she says she must return to the United States. He doesn't expect to see her again but a few months later, while attending another wedding, he meets her again? the 'best wedding ever' quickly becomes the worst though when he learns that she is now engaged; that doesn't stop him sleeping with her again though. The next wedding is Carries and this goes well enough; right up until Charles's friend Gareth collapses and dies. After the funeral it is time for another wedding; this time Charles is getting married? the question is who is his bride and is he over Carrie?The plot of this film is fairly simple but none the less effective. The four weddings and the funeral of the title provide lots of laughs, some enjoyable romance and more than a few tears. Hugh Grant is great as Charles; it is the sort of role he was made to play and Andie MacDowell is likable as Carrie although we don't really get to know her character as well as we might. The strength of the film is maintained by an excellent supporting cast; Simon Callow does a fine job as the exuberant Gareth and John Hannah is equally good as Gareth's boyfriend Matthew; it is nice to see this gay couple being shown as ordinary people rather than camp clichés. It was also good to see that Charles's deaf brother, David, was portrayed by deaf actor David Bower. The late Charlotte Coleman is utterly delightful as Scarlett. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Overall this is a great rom com that has stood the test of time; well worth watching? or rewatching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed most of this movie - the funeral was devastating. And unlike many, I really do enjoy the standard Hugh Grant (which, in fairness, was not yet "standard" when this movie was new).BUT (and I'm agreeing with everyone else here) Carrie, the Andie MacDowell character, has nothing going for her. She is not appealing in any way, and she's a slag.Additionally, the wedding to Duckface is totally unmotivated, and only contrived so that he can leave her at the altar without us hating him.Here is how it should have gone. The fourth wedding should have been between Charles and Carrie - once she's divorced, there is no impediment after all. Carrie - true to character - will be getting it on with someone else by the night before the wedding. Meanwhile, Charles discovers that he is really in love with Fiona (wasn't that the point of the movie? it's what I expected to happen). The deaf character discovers both these facts and the wedding can now be played as originally scripted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a delightful romantic comedy with some measure of poignancy. Seamlessly directed by Mike Newell, the film has Hugh Grant in top form playing a stiff and slightly bumbling Englishman, a role he has patented over the years. The entire cast chips in well with some fine understated British humor. Rowan Atkinson has a short but hilarious cameo. Andie MacDowell is the only odd member in the cast. She is surprisingly uneven and her last scene is a shocker. There's a (MINOR SPOILERS) poignant funeral later in the film with John Hannah delivering an impassioned eulogy.

		<fullReview>'Four Weddings and A Funeral' is not my favourite of Richard Curtis's works but it's still a nice movie. The pace may be slow at times but the British humour works for me and the wedding sequences were funny. The direction is good but some sequences look a little out of place, even the climax shot. The regular wedding guest characters are fun and likable. Hugh Grant is pretty good. Andie McDowell is okay but she is overshadowed by the entire cast. Kristin Scott Thomas is the scene stealer. I liked her character the most and she plays it beautifully. Charlotte Coleman is hilarious. The rest of the cast are okay. The soundtrack is enjoyable. 'Four Weddings and A Funeral' is not a bad watch if you're into rom-com. In my opinion, it's not the best of the genre. I didn't like the way it abruptly ended with the two leads suddenly deciding on a live-in relationship rather than a marriage. What was the motivation behind such a decision? Before that we see how all the characters 'yearn' for their own wedding to take place some day soon. Yet,the movie is still a decent watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enduring Friendship. Pure, simple and very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Wedding and a Funeral is a fabulous movie even if you hate weddings, funerals or love stories. The film is about friendship, something we can all relate to with fondness. The movie follows seven friends as they experience love and loss, rejection and resolve. But, instead of a British pub, the setting is an English church or a Scottish castle. The film reminds us of the value of having supporting people in our lives. The joy, sadness and general awkwardness each character endures is magnified by these good friends being together through it all. Four Weddings and A Funeral makes us yearn for such relationships in our own lives as we laugh with our new friends on screen.Charles is the ring leader of this band of serial wedding guests. He is always going to weddings but fearful of any sort of commitment. With a charming smile and debonair wit, he can enchant women but has no intention of settling down. He is in awe of those who commit to marriage but freely admits that he could never take such a dramatic step.Until he meets Carrie. Carrie is an American who is experienced in love. She is care-free. And she is intoxicating. Charles is drawn to her, like a moth to a flame. It is certainly love at first sight. Unfortunately, opportunities to meet are few and far between. The few social settings alluded by the title are their only chance for interaction. After meeting at the first wedding, Carrie attends the second engaged. Will Charles' first true love be unattainable?For some reason, Hugh Grant's bumbling English charm rubs a large portion of movie goers the wrong way. His acting can be one dimensional. Grant's characters contain many of the same quirks and mannerisms regardless of the film. Call it being type cast, pigeon holed, what have you. At times, it is hard to argue with this reputation.But some of his films are far better than others. Four Weddings and A Funeral and Notting Hill are among his finest films. Is his character any different? Not really. But his surrounding cast is. Grant's greatest films surround his clumsy act with a colorful array of supporting characters. With their own distinct idiosyncrasies, Grant's cast makes his faults less demonstrative, less outrageous and part of a delightful hodge-podge of screen chemistry. Alone Hugh Grant cannot carry a movie. But as part of the whole, his persona can play against four or five equally engaging characters with magnificent results.Four Weddings and A Funeral works because the camaraderie displayed by the seven friends seems absolutely genuine. Screen chemistry is often used as a buzz word for any successful character driven film. But more than others, Four Weddings and A Funeral relies on this chemistry as the basis for the entire film. The audience must believe that these characters truly enjoy each other's company. It takes more than simply great acting. Script and direction must also accentuate the theme of friendship. The bond shared by the characters must permeate every aspect of the film. Four Weddings and A Funeral succeeds brilliantly. The audience is seamlessly drawn into the friends' inner circle. It happens so fast that it seems an effortless process. Before the first reception is over, we have a perfect understanding of each of the seven friends. Each is unique and compelling. The same appeal that has drawn them to each other draws them to us. As an American outsider and the object of Charles' affection, Carrie becomes a threat to the group. A group of which we have quickly become a part. We all long for substantial relationships in our lives. Whether romantic or platonic, dependable relationships make life wonderful or bearable. The good times become great; the bad times are a little bit easier to handle. Four Weddings and A Funeral is more than a romantic comedy. Too many romantic comedies involve a boy, a girl and little else. Four Weddings and A Funeral gives us a group of friends who are looking for love. We join their struggle, celebrate their triumphs and share their pain. Four Weddings and A Funeral draws us in as few films can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant British Rom-Com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Weddings and a Funeral was a smash hit on release and it's easy to see why. A brilliant British cast and a funny clever and witty script make this a must see. It follows a myriad of characters as they intertwine as the title suggests four weddings and a funeral. What's great this film is that it is full of great characters. Hugh Grant leads the way as the charming Charles who finds it hard to settle down. Whilst Grant is superb he is by no means the only one with plenty of pitch perfect performances from the likes of Simon Callow, John Hannah and Kristin Scott Thomas. The only real weak link is Andie MacDowell but even though she has been slated for her performance it's not the worst in the world. This is a film full of genuinely funny moments but also some sad ones. The funeral is genuinely touching and uses the poem 'Funeral Blues' to great effect. This is a film that is entertaining from start to finish and as well as Grant's finest moment, for me is the best Rom-Com ever made. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Charlotte Coleman, John Hannah, Kristen Scott Thomas, David Bower and James Fleet all offer great fun in their supporting roles, but it is Simon Callow as Gareth that steals the show, he is a delight. And though I remember his scenes word for word Rowan Atkinson still makes me laugh as Father Gerrard.I had not seen it in years, but it was still just as charming now as it was when it was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Grant establishes his persona in excellent British comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest, wittiest, cleverest comedy/romances to come out of Great Britain, moving at a quick pace through a series of scenes commemorating FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, with a cast of wonderful British players headed by HUGH GRANT and American actress ANDIE MacDOWELL.The running joke seems to be that Grant never knows what time it is, even though he's scheduled to attend a wedding almost every Saturday of his life. Grant plays the character in his standard befuddled, confused, yet charming manner and handles the role like a real pro.I'm not an admirer of ANDIE MacDOWELL but she's competent enough as his over-sexed sweetheart, the girl he falls in love with "at first sight", with marriage eluding both of them because of some bad timing. At last, just when it seems Grant will tie the know with someone else, he comes to his senses (thanks to a hilarious church scene that ends with his would-be bride punching him out of sheer vexation, knocking him flat on the church floor).Delightful performances by the entire cast, with special kudos to JOHN HANNAH, SIMON CALLOW, KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS and ROWAN ATKINSON in great supporting roles.But it's Grant who keeps the thing buoyant and easy to take despite some of the implausibilities in detailing the relationship he has with MacDowell. Easy to see why the screenplay got an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as charming as I remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: spoilers ahead. The screenwriter, Richard Curtis, is the deserved king of Brit romantic comedy (deserved based on his films' box office success), so when this came on tv the other night (Jan., 2004), I thought I would watch to see how the master does it. I had remembered thinking when I first saw it that it was an excellent light entertainment that was so tightly and inventively written that it went beyond light into meaningful. But, ten years later, it doesn't hold up so well. Not that it's bad, it's just so slight. I attribute this partly to the structure--it's hard to bring out much character in the three weddings and funeral that occur prior to the finale wedding/denouemont--but mainly I attribute it's slightness to the fact that we don't know much about Andie MacDowell's character... other than she's a bit of a slut. I realize she's written to be mysterious, at least I presume that's what it is, and she plays everything she is given, so my quarrel isn't with her performance, it's just that she goes directly into sex after barely even talking to Hugh Grant, and I mean barely. Yes they meet at the first wedding, and have a few near misses there and one later at their hotel, but then she invites him up for a drinky and immediately they go boom boom. Okay, fine, maybe she's not easy and just had a fling. But then she does it again later, but this time she's engaged! And she's engaged to a guy the movie has shown to be a shallow sot. But we never see any other side of her than the sleep-around, marry-someone-wrong-for-her-side. Other than being charming and lovely, she isn't given anything especially redeeming, or really anything at all, meaning her character isn't just slutty, but deeply shallow. So why care if Hugh Grant ends up with her? What's the big attraction other than her her looks (and her hat)? She's probably very, very good in the sack, but that's not enough to keep us interested as an audience. Overall, her character's lack of depth, at least as she is drawn, is a huge flaw in this movie and prevents it from being anything remotely close to a classic. It's flawed fluff, with good patches of writing and good performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie...except for that insipid Andie MacDowell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant, funny, charming, witty, touching. It has two problems, both of them related to the lead female character, Carrie (played by Andie MacDowell).The first is that the character is not written to be at all likeable. She is engaged to a rich older man she clearly doesn't really love (I think we're supposed to infer that she's a golddigger) and cheats on him with someone she doesn't really care about either (Hugh Grant). Later we learn that she's a slut and a homewrecker (see her appearance at wedding #4--don't tell me it wasn't conniving!). What would make us want this woman to win our beloved Charlie (Hugh Grant) (who is also something of a cad, but a loveable one)?Carrie might not have been so unpalatable if they'd found an actress who could actually ACT to play her, but instead, they hired Andie MacDowell, who may be pretty, but is as stiff and lifeless as the scenery. Maybe she thinks that's what's called for in a British movie. I wonder that the people casting movies haven't realized that Andie MacDowell simply plays the same character in every movie she's in. By the end of this film, you're incredibly frustrated. You want to adore this movie, because everything about it is so perfect, except for the fact that you hate Andie MacDowell' s character with a passion and wish that she would die so that Charlie could find happiness with a woman who can act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this movie beated the 1997 film Titanic at the BAFT awards and just like the Oscars the BAFTA messed up.The story is about Charles and is circle of friends ponder love and marriage - even as they attend weddings (and one funeral). Miss right may be right there - but will Charles be able to admit he has found love? Normally British films to me are kind of an mix bag for me and what I mean is sometimes I will enjoy or be bored by movies from Britain. I don't know why it just happens, and this is coming from a guy who is from Britain. I was a bit shocked when I find out that this movie won best film at BAFTA awards and knocked the highest grossing movie of all time Titanic, and to the people who liked this movie more than Titanic that's fine but to me in my personal opinion this movie was okay.Let's start of with the positive: The acting from everyone was solid and this movie has a great cast.The movie did make me laugh at times with characters doing whacky things that no normal person would do at a wedding yeah those kind of jokes.I'm not going to spoil anything but these a scene where there are at this funeral and one of the characters give a sad and kind of moving speech.Now for things that didn't work for me: I didn't really think this movie is on the level of amazing as some has put it out to be, I'm saying it's bad I honestly think it's just okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four occasions to laugh, one to cry, five to meditate about love and life ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many romantic comedies end with the two leads finally reuniting for the final kiss and realizing that they're meant to live together. Though it doesn't necessarily imply that the following step is marriage, but we can bet on a long-term commitment.Basically, "Four Weddings and a Funeral" stands above all the 'romantic comedy' genre because it doesn't take its very essence for granted and turns into a delightful social commentary about the meaning of marital commitment even questioning its compatibility with real love. Can love last for life? If not definite answers, the film provides some hints through four martial experiences and one funeral, which is an occasion to think about life and death. Mike Newell finds the perfect balance between humor, slapstick and intelligence, all of them in a typically British flavor.And one thing for sure, the film's title doesn't lie about the content since the five titular events and their direct aftermaths occupy almost 95% of the screen time. And as viewers, we're (literally) invited to follow the adventures of one joyful bunch of friends. On the top of them, there's Hugh Grant as Charles, a handsome thirty something bachelor whose penetrating blue eyes betray a vulnerable sensitivity that doesn't fit his look. There is the tiny, exuberant Charlotte Coleman as Scarlett, a gay couple, Matthew (John Hannah) and Garrett played by the scene-stealing Simon Callow. Kristin Scott Thomas plays Fiona, hiding in a sophisticated composure the grief of never having conquered Charles' heart, and last but not least, there's Tom, Jack Fleet as the goofiest and clumsiest of the bunch, which is saying a lot.We never know exactly what these people do for a living, but it doesn't matter actually. Besides, we know them enough to understand the way they feel, behave or approach life and important matters, so the rest would only fill the script with unnecessary details. Have you noticed by the way that in most rom-coms, the jobs of the two lead hardly play a role, one is an architect, and another is a cook, so what? And have you also noticed that many romantic comedies only rely on the believability of its lead couple and some supporting characters, "Four Weddings and a Funeral" is an ensemble cast movie, and even more effective because it doesn't depend on a multi-linear plot, the solidarity, the complicity between the friends is the story's heart and greatest source for gags and amusement.I insist on the ensemble cast because truth is if Hugh Grant was perfect for the role that put him in America's showbiz map, and earned him a Golden Globe, the same can hardly be said about Andie McDowell. As much as I respect and appreciate the actress, it's hard to see the same sweetheart who turned Phil Connor's heart in "Groundhog Day". She doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but a Razzie nomination (that thankfully the film was spared of) wouldn't have surprised me. It was hard to believe that Charles would be so infatuated in a woman who doesn't seem quite sure either about love, let alone marriage. Some would think this is what united them since they would be involved in the two weddings that didn't end. But something in Carrie suggested that she was more of a gold-digger type, while Charles is more a victim of his own idealism.Unsuccessful marriages end up being more insightful than the others, (if only because they do 'end up') and one of the merit of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" is to put the notion of commitment into perspective, to revalue the meaning of living and loving someone for life. In a way, the subtext is that we are never 100% sure to love someone then marriage is not necessarily a guarantee of happiness OR if we really love one person, then marriage would be totally meaningless. That's the idea conveyed by Gareth and Matthew's who'd be shown as the most solid and sincere couple, without any ceremony to 'validate' their union. The death of Gareth invites for these questions and works as a great dramatic relief in a relatively screwball comedy, thanks to Matthew's powerful eulogy, simple but realistically heart-breaking.But I guess I was a bit too serious in my review, and beyond the whole introspective facade, "Four Weddings and a Funeral" is also a cheerful celebration of the most special day of anyone's life, the day we have to say 'yes', this magical moment that sets a before and an after in our lives, that starts with solemnity and ends up with fun, alcohol, and maybe a few years later, regrets. It also allows other people to meet their match, soul-mates or one-night hits. Weddings are the premise of countless jokes, a nice twist on the forget-the-rings gag, embarrassing best man's speeches, some acts of pure desperation and a wonderfully comic moment with Rowan Atkinson as a priest in his first wedding. His five minutes are funnier than the whole 'Mr. Bean' film, in fact, the film reminds us that the world needs marriage, if only to have a great moment of fun and joy."Four Weddings and one Funeral" was one of the biggest hits of the glorious 1994, earning two nominations for Best Screenplay and Best Picture. The material is so fresh and new on the field of romantic comedies that it's hard to tolerate such conventional moments like a declaration of love under the rain, and a cheesy line delivered by you-know-who, and it's only forgivable because the film immediately redeems itself through the great ending credits sequence and Elton John's version of "Chapel of Love", the credits sequences perfectly captures the positive, optimistic mood of the film, and even its not-to-be-taken-so-seriously quality.And it does fit the general message of the film that after all, maybe wedding, just like life, is not to be taken so seriously, and maybe that's the best way to make it work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Newell directed this British romantic comedy(and sometimes drama) that stars Hugh Grant as Charles, a British man, who, along with his friends attends four different weddings and one funeral of mutual friends or acquaintances. At the first wedding, he meets free-spirited American Carrie(played by Andie McDowall) and there is some attraction, but it takes the subsequent four further gatherings for the both of them to finally act on it. Overrated comedy was a surprise box office hit at the time, but isn't especially funny or appealing, despite the good cast. Ending is also not in doubt for a minute, though this did make a star of Hugh Grant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully funny, warm and emotional - the perfect romantic-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We see the lives of a group of friends, largely through scenes at four weddings and a funeral. In this group is Charles who has a unhappy past with relationships. Then he meets an American woman, Carrie, at one of the weddings and it seems like his luck has changed. However, things are not so simple. As with almost everyone in his group of friends, it appears that the Right One is out there but never available.Wonderfully funny, warm and emotional - the perfect romantic-comedy. Written by Richard Curtis, of Blackadder fame, and directed by Mike Newell, this movie works on so many levels. As a comedy it is superb - very funny and intelligently so. Then there's the friends aspect, which creates a great warmth and engagement and a feeling of camaraderie. Characters have depth and complement each other well.Lastly, it works very well as a romantic drama too. Not your usual schmaltzy, formulaic romance but an intelligent examination of the subject.Hugh Grant is great as Charles. The role pretty much locked in his character in future roles - the shy, hesitant, stammering yet charming type. He has played that in about every role since.The group of friends are well cast and give spot-on performances: John Hannah (as Matthew), James Fleet (Tom). Kristen Scott Thomas (Fiona), Simon Callow (Gareth) and Charlotte Coleman (Scarlett). Rowan Atkinson has a minor part but is responsible for possibly the funniest scene in the movie.The only negative thing about the movie is the performance of Andie McDowell (as Carrie). Not terrible, just a flat, aloof delivery and thus quite unengaging. This is made more obvious by the fact that the other characters exude such warmth and vibrancy, making her seem quite cold. She doesn't wreck the movie but it would have been even better with a better actress in that role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mike Newell has directed a pleasant film about the importance of love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through his comedy film, "Four weddings and a funeral", British director Mike Newell gives an excellent idea about how love and marriage are viewed by English people. His film is a quest for finding true love. It also depicts the importance of love over sex in relationships involving men and women. A good film which can be watched with family involves elements which are valued by family members. From that yardstick, a film about love and marriage can be a little offensive only if has some explicit hints about sex. However, English film four weddings and a funeral deliberately avoids any unnecessary mention of sex in order to portray itself as a clean film. The choice of an American actress who is wooed by a flippant British bachelor works well for this film as Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant remain true to their on screen portrayals. In most films, minor characters are not developed but this film gives equal importance to minor characters who help viewers to understand the importance of friends in a person's life. Lastly, four weddings and a funeral is able to impress viewers as its spreads the message that there comes a time in each person's life when he/she has to become serious about marriage and must get married before it is too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this film in '94, I was expecting something a little snappier &amp; edgier like the rom-coms of the time (such as "Singles" or "When Harry Met Sally"). Instead, its low-key, subtle, British presentation caught me off guard and left me a little bit unfulfilled.I now realize that's because I was an idiot at the time. Subtlety is this film's strength, and Hugh Grant's performance is impeccable in that regard. There aren't a lot of wisecracking zingers or situational craziness, but Hugh's portrayal of a cute, clueless, British playboy is something he does par excellence. Andie McDowell's portrayal of a disconnected, almost soulless enigma is equally compelling, although on first viewing I didn't understand the character.The comedy comes through Hugh's strained reactions to the insane situations he finds himself in. Things happen that would reduce a normal human to hysterics, but Hugh is forced to ride it out with proper British decorum. For example, there's one scene where finds himself stuck at a table with EVERY ONE of his ex-girlfriends, trying to play it off as politely as possible while they take turns freaking out at him.Something to note: Unlike films like "Harry Met Sally" and "Singles" which focus equally on the characters, this movie is essentially from Hugh's viewpoint, and Andie's character is almost peripheral. With that in mind, it's not a standard love story between two people. Instead it's about one man stumbling through the concept of romance.If you like rom-coms that take a different approach, this is a good one for you to check out. I also recommend "Forget Paris" (about what happens to a couple AFTER 'happily ever after') and "Object of Beauty" (starring Andie McDowell &amp; John Malkovich as a pair of dysfunctional, small-time con artists in love).If you're a Hugh Grant fan, you'll love this film, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but not one of my favourites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard some morally bad things about this movie and a number of people portrayed it in a bad light. I think is was because of the prostitute incident at the time of this movie that put me off it. In fact, the prostitute incident put a number of people I knew off of Hugh Grant. Personally I don't think that it was the media's business about whether Hugh Grant was caught with a prostitute, and more so the pressure put on his girlfriend at the time to forgive him.This movie is about four weddings and a funeral. In fact, there is only one scene in the movie that is not set at a wedding or the funeral. As one can tell by the title the movie is about marriage, but the conclusion that it comes to I inevitably disagree with. The movie is based around a group of friends who are always going to weddings. In fact, it is the time of life when everybody is getting married. Charles (Hugh Grant) always sleeps in and as such is always late to weddings. That is until his own when all of his friends make damn sure that he gets up in time.The movie explores death and marriage, and at one point - the low point - the conclusion is that not everybody is going to get married. This is true as Charles concludes, after he called a wedding off because he did not really want to marry Duck Face - Henrietta, that marriage was not for him - yet he still wanted the companionship of a girl. My opinion here is not that marriage was not for him, but rather that he is so scared to make a commitment to a woman that he would rather have a relationship that he can call off easily.The funeral is of a very cheerful chap who dies at the third wedding. This chap is the oldest and commands his friends to find a partner. He dies and they come to see that not everybody is going to get married. This is not true to the movie because, as one can expect, everybody ends up happily ever after.The thing the people I know did not appreciate about this movie was the ending where they say that they can have a perfect marriage relationship without getting married. This I do not really agree with because marriage involves commitments and promises, and if you are not willing to make these promises to the person, then you should not either consider marrying this person, or living with the person as if you were married.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Hugh Grant. You just cannot go wrong with Hugh Grant and romantic comedies, and Four Weddings &amp; a Funeral is the perfect chick flick of romance, humor, and most importantly GREAT CONVERSATION. There are so many little scenes and snipets that are just brilliant little skits that are wrapped around into an interesting love story.Though the love isn't compelling between the two main characters and there could be minor plot tweaks, there's a lot of great things about this British film that I'm sorry that more films can't take away from.High expectations I had, and disappointed I was not. Possibly one of the greatest romantic comedies that I've witnessed thus far. Hugh Grant was superb, the leading gal was alright.. .but there is a great supporting cast. I can't hate a well written movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>jusco's review: Four Weddings and a Funeral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This delightful British romantic comedy kicked off Hugh Grant's career and rightfully so. There's something about him that is highly enjoyable to watch; we laugh at his witty remarks, we cringe when he is clumsy and makes stupid mistakes, we are happy for him when he finds true love. Sure, it's formulaic as evidenced in his later films; Notting Hill, About A Boy, Love Actually, just to name a few. But he is the master of playing romcom leads, and it's a wickedly pleasant indulgence to watch him in action. In Four Weddings and a Funeral, he charms both the audience and an American lady he meets at a wedding (the first of four), and we follow his exploits in attempting to win her over, amidst a hilarious bunch of friends and another suitor.This is a comedy that is actually funny, with plenty of smart dialogue to laugh at. Granted, it is all Richard Curtis' doing (the master of comedic writing: check Blackadder, Mr. Bean, The Vicar of Dibley), but the cast does deliver it spot on. Special mentions goes to Simon Callow and David Haig for playing two of Hugh Grant's friends, Charlotte Coleman for playing his flatmate and Rowan Atkinson, as always, steals the show with a brief but hilarious scene as a priest-in-learning. Andie MacDowell is sweet and will steal anyone's heart with her portrayal of Hugh Grant's love interest. A solid, well-picked cast.Despite an overall light-hearted tone, there is one particularly emotional scene that is both tragic and moving, and features the beautiful poem, Funeral Blues, by W.H. Auden. It is in this scene where Four Weddings and a Funeral proves itself as not just your typical romcom, but is deeply layered and even meaningful. The mood switches from happy and carefree, to solemn and heartbreaking, to happy once again. It's the perfect feel-good formula that will get you smiling and this is one romantic comedy that manages to pull it off extremely well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never less than hugely enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While starting off a little on the slow side, this film is never less than hugely enjoyable. The tale of the bachelor, his friends and their romantic escapades is constantly charming, witty, poignant and most of all funny, and the humour here is suitably understated. The film further benefits from being superbly written, beautifully filmed and sharply directed with a well structured story that could have easily have been episodic. Also whereas there have been films where I have been indifferent to the characters, the script ensured that the characters were warm and easy to empathise with. I think it is also to do with the quality of the acting, with Hugh Grant at his most charming, Andie MacDowell at her most enigmatic and Simon Callow and Kristen Scott-Thomas especially outstanding among the supporting cast.Overall, Four Weddings and a Funeral is a hugely enjoyable and enduring film. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Set Pieces and a Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The weddings are funny, the funeral is sad, and if you like romantic comedies with a touch of bitterness, 4W+1F equals a winning equation. The dialogue is fantastic: clever and effortless in the way that only the British seem able to manage. Plus there is some decent slapstick and the performing cast is excellent. Which is good, because, oddly, the film's greatest weakness is its central love story between Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell. They're both pretty, sure, but neither of them is exactly a great actor. Hugh Grant is so bloody mannered you wonder if he might be a blinking, stammering wind-up doll. But at least his comic timing is sharp, and his self-effacing schtick manages to move the plot forward: even if he can't convey loss, pain or remorse, through his hyper-indicativeness you can at least tell what he's supposed to be feeling. And unlike his fellow automaton-actor Michael J "Go to expression # 37" Fox, Grant at least has the courage to be cast as (if not actually portray) unheroic characters. Charles is a gossipy, irresponsible but charming mess, just the sort of bloke who might be found cheating on his beautiful girlfriend with a Hollywood hooker. (Note: that doesn't happen in the movie.) As Carie, the beautiful but troubled romantic heroine, Andie is less successful. She's convincing as that unattainable object of desire until she opens her mouth: her line readings are as monotonous as her character. Some of it isn't her fault: much of her dialogue has a particularly British lilt, which always sounds a bit odd in an American accent. The character is American for very good reason, and the scriptwriter should have Yankfied her speech some. Still, Andie was never cast in anything because of her great dramatic range. Why were the producers stuck with MacDowell? Well, blame demographics. This movie came out in 1994, exactly five years between two waves of American actresses who might have carried the role off much better: Demi or Jodie in 1989, Gwyneth or Cameron in 1999.But honestly, the limitations of the two main characters are minor distractions. You've got some of the finest British actors of their generations enjoying themselves tremendously: Simon Callow as Gareth, the boisterous, fun-loving poofter and Kristin Scott Thomas as Fiona, doomed to be always disappointed in love but enduring her misery with a cigarette and a wisecrack. (In truth, she's a far more compelling character than Carrie, and almost as beautiful.) And the funeral sequence is the best part of the film: as Matthew, John Hanna delivers a beautifully written eulogy with a clipped dramatic economy that obviates histrionics and deepens the sense of mourning. And flanking the funeral are the four title ceremonies, hilarious not because they're exaggerated but because they're painfully accurate: the awkwardness and the awfulness will be instantly familiar to anyone who has ever attended a wedding and stayed sober enough to know what's going on. If you're planning a wedding, rent this. It'll help you deal with the pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anglophile Americans will love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes the film work is a calculated (in a good way) mix of political correctness, bawdy "carry-on" English humor and wit, and knowledge of what Anglophile Americans want to see in British characters. Charles comments about a stag party "We didn't think it necessary in this day and age", the assorted idiosyncratic characters like the deaf brother, the misfit Scarlet, etc. all play on our wish that the "cold" Brits are really very human and lovable, but all the while feeding our "romantic" notions of the English as witty (which they are) and quaint. My favorite humorous moment is very throwaway; Grant frustratingly hits his head on a tree, then without missing a beat says, "Oh, hi, hello" to a passing elderly woman at the outdoor reception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know about Hugh Grant. One romantic comedy roll after another. Nevertheless the star of 'Notting Hill' 'Love Actually' and 'Nine months' brings his talents to this charming romantic comedy about a group of thirty-something's who are wishing for a bit more in life.Grant brings his charming acting skills to this 1994 hit where he plays the unlucky in love character Charles who attends weddings all the time but he's always the one in the seats and never the one at the alter.Grant is as great as he always is in this type of role and his partnership alongside 'Groundhog day' star MacDowell is perfect. The relationship between the two is intense and funny all the way through and is a great watch for older audiences who can appreciate the ideas put forth by the director of 'Harry Potter and the goblet of fire' It's a typical love story with many conventions of the romance genre involving flirtatious conversations, wedding settings, stereotypical husbands, wives and singletons and are all brilliantly conveyed in an enthusiastic plot with likable characters and effect speaking.There are many surprising twists and turns and great laughs consistent throughout, making a very different story to your normal love stories for example 'nine months'.This story follows Grant throughout but there are many different story lines going on with different types of characters. Because there are different opinions being shared between the characters there is always a feel of real life and a relaxed atmosphere to this comedy.It is different from other love stories because there are many personal issues relating to the characters which make it emotional as well as chuckle-some. It's not a laugh out loud comedy, more chuckle-some but watch out for a scene where Grant is locked in a cupboard, one of the greatest scenes I've seen him in.The key theme throughout are the relationships between the characters and yes, many people will say it is predictable but at the end of the day it is enjoyable, funny, a good laugh if you want to sit down with your loved one and enjoy funny sex and relationship jokes.A definite watch because of the likable funny characters 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoiler intended, but I may reveal surprises to 1st-time viewers. I own this film on DVD, and probably watch it 6 or 8 times a year...not counting the times I plug it in just to see a scene or two. It is frequently VERY funny, and sometimes quite touching as well. The scene wherein Charlie (Hugh Grant) is stuck dining at a table with several of his old girl friends is one of the funniest short scenes ever captured on film. Kristin Scott-Thomas gives a marvelously understated performance as the woman who's carried a torch for Charlie for years, and the movie must be watched several times in order to see that she's been giving hints about it all the way through. The casting on this film is almost flawless, with the exception -- just my opinion -- of Andie McDowell. Her character just doesn't strike me as being worthy of the way Charlie feels about her, but -- given how she was written -- I'm not sure any other actress could've made me like her any better. Perhaps the point is that love is beyond explanation, and we need simply to accept it when it comes, without questioning why. I love romantic comedies, and this is definitely in my top 3. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelled to defend this very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first impression of Four Weddings was that I did NOT want to watch the film. I had bought it and it stayed on my shelf for months. A few minutes in I laughed out loud, and ended up enjoying the film thoroughly..Now in its defense...Four Weddings and a Funeral is not only a film about true love. Its main characters represent a "romantic comedy" about two characters who feel immense sexual attraction, interpreted as love.What Hugh Grant's character is looking for does not depend on how uninteresting Carrie is, or interesting his friends are. Carrie is different than anyone else, exotic. Granted Andie overplayed the final scene, but for the rest of the film she nailed it dead-on. She is a beautiful American woman. She represents America as exotically beautiful but not necessarily intelligent. Grant's love is skin-deep but that's the whole thing with "love at first sight."You never know who that person is but that first moment just might click.Who cares if all it takes for the characters is attraction? The movie is all about different kinds of love and acceptance, be it homosexuality, or opposites attracting (the Texan) or marrying rich (Prince Charles) or marrying cousins or marrying out of a sexual affair (wedding #2).There is something for everyone in this movie, be it laughs, acceptance, a classy funeral and touching funeral scene, romance, or simply good-looking people being attracted to each other.The ensemble cast is first-rate and this movie is definitely a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I endorse those reviews that say this is a comedy first, a romance second (though the romance was enough for my wife to enjoy the film as much as I did). Thus, the comedy rings in the first wedding were funny, despite being unrealistic as some have noted. The comedy priest in the second was equally unrealistic but I found him embarrassing rather than funny. This despite being a fan of Rowan Atkinson from Not the Nine O'Clock News, Blackadder, Bean, Barclaycard adverts, etc etc. That sort of humour seemed out of place here (as in Never Say Never Again). All part of life's rich pageant - some reviewers say that Rowan's cameo is the only good thing in this movie, whilst I found it the only bit I didn't enjoy.I particularly enjoyed Simon Callow as Gareth. It reminded me of (as far as I can remember it) Chance in a Million. Can anyone else remember this (probably British TV only)?By the way, I wanted brownie points for recognising the church used for the funeral, but I see that someone has already done this (St Clements, nr Lakeside Shopping Centre, Essex). However, to those who say that after the funeral the river was not moving, I say the tide was out and that was mud!</fullReview>

It introduced several important performers who later had separate star careers among them Hugh Grant, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Simon Callow, John Hannah, Rowan Atkinson and Anna Chancellor. All look fantastic when the film is screened today yet its low budget pacing and out of date raunchy humor no longer carry the punch it did when new. The pacing is often slow. The scenery takes precedence over scenes in which two Principals converse. The humor seems dated.

		<shortDescription>A quirky British romcom, from a great film year...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is extremely possible that 1994 was the greatest year of film ever. Yes, we have "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" and "North" to slightly disprove that, but here's my argument. 1994 is one of the few years when all five Best Picture nominees at the Oscars have gone on to be considered classics. "Forrest Gump" won the top award, now an extremely controversial choice given that "The Shawshank Redemption" and "Pulp Fiction" were also both nominated. Also nominated was "Quiz Show", a lesser known but still excellent drama with Ralph Fiennes. And one more film ? a quirky British romcom known as "Four Weddings and a Funeral".The film centres around the five events described in the title, and the main character Charles, played by Hugh Grant, and his friends. Charles constantly bumps into Carrie, an attractive American woman, at these events and very quickly falls in love with her. The events themselves play host to a number of bizarre and humorous characters, with Rowan Atkinson's vicar being one of the film's greatest components, despite only being in a short scene. One of my biggest problems with the film is Hugh Grant. Perhaps it's the curse of not being a teenage girl that I find him more irritating than likable, and therefore cannot really understand why women keep falling for him. To his merit, however, he plays the bumbling English fool very well at times and just about carries off the film's romantic element.The film's greatest strengths are its sharp script, written by British romcom stalwart Richard Curtis, and superb supporting cast. Simon Callow is the finest of these, bringing across his character's outrageous lines with an incredibly likable quality. John Hannah and James Fleet also play great characters, and each have set pieces to showcase their talents. The place where the film surprised me most was the funeral, which is extremely emotionally charged, and Hannah's reading of Auden's "Funeral Blues" is highly moving. Kristen Scott Thomas' character is less enjoyable, and her confession to Charles at the third wedding feels unnecessary.But despite so many great aspects, the film isn't perfect, and while it's likable for the majority, it does lose a lot of its flow towards the end. The overall plot has a formula which it sticks to fairly rigidly, and feels a tiny bit forced at times. Perhaps it's a sign of how romcoms have changed now, but the ending feels extremely clichéd, and is predictable from the get-go. It's got great moments and is worth watching if just for its Great British cast, but unfortunately is not consistent enough to be carried off really well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles (Hugh Grant) has always been afraid of marriage commitments. But he and his group of fellow friends who are also single including his female flatmate Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) have always been able to find themselves being invited to weddings, while searching for the true meaning of love at these events.Charles would become the best man in the first, where his friend Angus (Timothy Walker) is marrying Laura (Sara Crowe). But he was almost late. Still, he manages to arrive at the church in time. It was at this wedding where he first met Carrie (Andie MacDowell), an American who had been invited to the ceremony. It became love at first sight for Charles, and the two would spend the night together.The second is the wedding of Bernard (David Haig) and Lydia (Sophie Thompson), where Charles would come to find himself face-to-face with several of his ex-girlfriends relating embarrassing stories about him, including one his friends has always called 'Duckface' in Henrietta (Anna Chancellor). He would meet Carrie again, but this time her Scottish fiancé is also at the ceremony in politician Sir Hamish Banks (Corin Redgrave).He would find himself being invited to Carrie's wedding, which becomes the third in the film. Though in the lead-up, he had actually accidentally came across Carrie in a shop while shopping for presents himself. Charles would find himself having the unenviable task of helping Carrie select her wedding dress, though it was what Carrie would later tell him about her past which surprised him. While he did attend Carrie's wedding which took place in Scotland after all, it would eventually be marred by one of his friends Gareth (Simon Callow) who died suddenly of a heart attack, leading to the funeral which Charles would attend and meeting Carrie being of Gareth's.The fourth and final wedding in the film would be of Charles's, though the appearance of Carrie without her husband Hamish until Charles learned the full story between Carrie and her husband before the ceremony starts made him think twice of whom he really wants to spend the rest of his life with, with his deaf brother David (David Bower) and friend Matthew (John Hannah) helping him out to decide.What makes this film appealing and charming is how the group of friends in the film, with Hugh Grant's Charles being among them who are proud to be single themselves, are constantly searching for the meaning of 'one true love' and whether it exists at the weddings they go to and unexpectedly at the funeral of one of their friends who had died. But there is also Grant's character and whether his 'one true love' was right there all along.It is the film which gives one the feel-good factor about love and romance, making us still want to believe in love again. It is also the film which makes one want to believe in the 'happily-ever-afters'.</fullReview>

In the first wedding, he encounters enchanting American Carrie (Andie MacDowell). He falls for her immediately, and he keeps running into her.I think this is the first time I saw Hugh Grant, Kristin Scott Thomas or Rowan Atkinson in anything. It's a very good introduction to all of them. My favorite comedy bits include the ghosts of girlfriends past, 33, and Duckface. Of course, Hugh Grant is doing his stuttering most notably about David Cassidy. Although the rom-com with Grant and MacDowell has its moments, it's the group of friends that make this movie shine. The shiniest has to be Charlotte Coleman as Scarlett. This is one fun and touching comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My kind of romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first saw the movie I didn't like it, watching it now though I liked it a lot. I guess this is because of age difference. Having attended several wedding and knowing more of relationships I see now things that passed me by years ago.I like it, because it is different. Sure, the plot line is the standard one: a guy and a girl see each other, fall in love at first sight and end up together, we never see their love develop and must just accept that it is the usual love at first sight But details like characters, surroundings etc. is what makes it more unique and makes me look over the first love thing.I liked the characters. Charles and Carrie had their share of relationships/or sex but never had a true commitment. They seem to b the perfect soul mates. Yeah, my last line was very sappy, but it just seems right that this kind of people end up together. And not only that, they decide to "not to be married forever". i like this part because not everyone is a "marriage person" and these two seem to be the ones who would be happier without it. I was expecting the movie to end with the message of how the happy ending is the wedding, while it shows us that a happy ending is simply to be with someone you love. Andy MacDowell's acting is criticized a lot, but I saw nor problem with it. I guess it depends on what person one expects Carrie to be. But the thing is, she could be any kind. We don't know too much about her. People just seem to put her into a "slut" drawer and expect her to be less reserved and more outgoing. I liked that the character went so against usual expectations. She is just a normal woman with a sex life, not a usual "almost virgin" you see on TV and the sexists in or society want women to be.I also liked the portrayal of the gay couple. Simply because they are never really presented to us as a couple, we just know that they are. It is great because they made it not extraordinary, but normal as it is supposed to be. I didn't even realize that they were together until the funeral and Matthew's speech. The one part that made me cry. It was a beautiful moment.I also liked the character Fiona who was greatly portrayed by Kristin Scott Thomas. Her love for Charlie is just another thing that happens in life, when someone may love a friend knowing that it will not happen.The great amount of characters is what stops us from knowing them too well. But it is perfect for this movie because it just gives us the usual atmosphere of a wedding. A bunch of people you kind of know because you keep on seeing them at ceremonies, but don't really know because you don't see them outside of it.And the comedy element is great. It is nothing over the top, bu yet hilarious portraying issues that may arise at a wedding. The ring scene is wonderful. So is Rowan Atkinson's first ceremony. And Charlie's constant sleeping over and then running to the wedding yelling "f..., f... f..." ("prohibited words"). There is of course more but I don't need to tell the whole movie in the review!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good For What It Is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Weddings and a Funeral is a British romantic comedy that is sometimes charming, but it mostly falls flat and gets lost in the mix of all romantic comedies out there. This film is entertaining, but forgettable. Writing this review, I can hardly remember what happens in the movie.Mike Newell's film is about a bachelor named Charles and he is seemingly the best man at many weddings. At the first wedding, he meets this girl and he thinks he finally falls in love. Over the course of several more weddings and a funeral, he gets the notion that maybe he has fallen for the wrong lady.The acting is pretty good for the most part. Hugh Grant is a charming British fellow and this film introduced him to the American audience. Simon Callow and John Hannah are really good and quite funny. Andie McDowell is pretty darn awful and she sounds like she's a robot.Overall, this is a decent but entirely forgettable British comedy. It has some good moments and some boring moments. Some of the jokes are quite funny especially the one involving the band, U2. Despite this being a solid film, I can't fathom how the film was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It's only a date night film at best. I rate this film 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and a Funeral" is a good example of a nice comedy with the peculiar British humor. It confirms that British people have a great sense of humor. Their humor is very classic and particular, which makes it so amusing.This is a simple and silly movie, but reasonably likable. There's nothing extraordinary about this movie. But I'm sure that it isn't the priority of this film. The point is that this motion picture is great fun, quite entertaining, relaxing and good to give great laughters. Humor is the priority of this film, but funny humor, not the stupid humor of nowadays which isn't funny at all.I think that the actors are all good and funny on their roles, but Hugh Grant steals the show as the "alergic to weddings" Charles. The comedian Rowan Atkinson has a small role (as Gerald, the priest in the second wedding). Although his role is almost minor, during those few minutes it's impossible not to laugh hysterically. Nothing else would be expected coming from Rowan Atkinson."Four Weddings and a Funeral" has also some gorgeous sceneries and images from Scotland: green places, big mountains, castles, old churches with fine architecture, etc...Overall, an okay comedy. One of the funniest English movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this film came out and everyone was raving about how brilliant and hilarious it was. For some strange reason i simply never got around to watching it until many years after all the hype, but the comments did stick in my mind.So here's what i thought - Positives first 1/ It's really well written by Richard Curts, as you would expect after his fantastic work on the Blackadder series.2/ Hugh Grant performs fantastically well in this role which really launched his career to a new level entirely.3/ It's littered with quirky and humorous characters, who all have minor roles, but provide a great deal of entertainment, Rowan Atkinson and Kirstin Scott-Thomas are the names that stand out the most.4/ It's original and entertaining, with many amusing moments.Now the Negatives, well Negative 1/ Andie MacDowell is seriously bland and terribly miscast in the role of Hugh Grant's often absent love interest, so much so she took the shine off the romantic element in this romantic comedy.In summary 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is good entertainment, that for me failed to live up to all the hype. Probably because it was the first good comedy to come out of Britain for years, but since then we have seen Notting Hill and Love Actually come from the same writer and i found them both more enjoyable than this.Still worth 7/10 despite MacDowell's poor character portrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect marriage of humour and romance - 87%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sadly indicative of the ever-fading strength of the British film industry that one film can seemingly turn it around but this is arguably true of "Four Weddings And A Funeral". It feels as if every British film released since strives to relate to it in some way. Writer Richard Curtis has since gone on to specialise in romantic comedies ("Notting Hill" and "Love, Actually" are both from his pen) and the team behind the film seem determined to remake "Four Weddings..." at every attempt. Bridget Jones and her diary can dream all they like but they simply cannot match the perfectly balanced mix of genuinely touching romance, wonderfully observed humour and gut-wrenching tragedy that this film provides in spades.Hugh Grant plays a thoroughly English Charles, charming and good-looking but ultimately unhappy about his endless days in singledom. The film is set over the course of a funeral and four weddings when Charles and his friends meet and wonder if they will ever find true love. Then suddenly, he meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell) and falls wildly in love with her. But when she returns to America and becomes engaged, will Charles ever find himself attending his own wedding and if so, will it be to the right woman?The main reason why "Four Weddings And A Funeral" works is that everything is in perfect balance and harmony - in short, it really is a marriage that works. Grant is a perfect leading man and MacDowell has little to do but look pretty. But Grant also displays a comic timing he has rarely displayed since, as well as his famed stutter and ability to get himself tongue-tied. But as good as the leads are, the supporting cast are equally impressive with Simon Callow almost stealing the movie as the camp, foul-mouthed drunk Gareth. The cream of British comic talent is seemingly on display and it's testament to the strength of the performances that you really empathise with the characters, especially during the funeral scene.Many films have tried but few have equalled the perfect blend of romance and comedy with the same levels of skill that "Four Weddings And A Funeral" provides. Despite the years, it remains a brilliantly conceived and wonderfully engaging watch and essential viewing for anyone thinking, planning or even avoiding walking up the aisle. For so many years, British film has been holding this film up as a watermark - something to strive for and demonstrate the beating heart of our film industry. Mighty praise indeed but surely the time has come to let the past lie and stop revisiting this movie, highly recommended as it is. Assuming you can forgive an excessive amount of swearing, this is still one of the best British films made in recent years and although it is predictable, you'll be kicking yourself if you have somehow missed it after all this time. Consider yourself invited to one of the best rom-coms I think I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good British romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning, it's clear that this is a different kind of romantic comedy. The characters are more thoroughly developed and the general tone is quite different from what one is used to from this genre. I mainly watched this because I had nothing else planned, it aired on TV, and I enjoy the work of Richard Curtis, who wrote this. I very much like the BlackAdder series and I found his directing effort(which he also wrote), Love Actually to be rather well-done. The plot is fairly good... the idea of having a small group of friends attend several weddings, all the while meeting new people(not to mention old "friends") and contemplating where their own love-life(or lack thereof) is headed was a great one, and it works out very well. The pacing is solid, for the very most part. Few(but still some) scenes seem drawn-out. Atkinson's character is basically a one-note joke, but his part is fortunately sufficiently small to not disrupt the flow. The acting is mostly magnificent, with a few exceptions. MacDowell clearly displays the lack of preparation that the top trivia entry alludes to. The humor is quite British, and almost entirely verbal. As such, I, personally, enjoyed the very majority of it. Anyone who isn't familiar with it or simply doesn't find it funny probably won't find much entertainment value in this. With quirky characters and sit-com situations/scenes, this is a somewhat unusual film for its genre. Two fun hours. I recommend this to any fan of British humor and, to a lesser degree, romantic comedies. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and a Funeral" is of major importance for being two things: 1) the first collaboration (of many) between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis, and 2) Hugh Grant's first major hit film. It was, in fact, for a long time, the highest-grossing British film ever."Four Weddings and a Funeral" centers around Charles (Grant) and his group of friends. It seems every weekend Charles has a wedding to attend, and now he's beginning to wonder when it'll be his own. It seems he's found true love when he meets an attractive American girl (Andie MacDowell) ... but has he?Hugh Grant is terrific, and MacDowell is great as well. In fact, the whole cast is wonderful in keeping the film flowing. Then there's Richard Curtis' clever, very funny script, without which the film would be nothing."Four Weddings in a Funeral", while quite different from later Curtis projects like "Bridget Jones's Diary" or "Love Actually", is loaded with lots of romantic, British fun that anyone can and will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am the victim here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been ages since I've been to a wedding and I used to quite enjoy them. Unlike most people I try and remember all the good things that happen at weddings, like the great presents that I used to buy, or how good I was at dancing or how I managed to kiss the bride, but every body else seems to want to remember the bad stuff, like how I made that kid cry.Honestly, you can do about a million great things at weddings and people just forget them, but you punch one toddler and suddenly you're off the invites list. I bet Ghandi must have punched one or two kids in his life, but because he's Ghandi everyone just ignores it and just remembers the 'good' things he did. Like I wasn't happy about what happened, but it was a church wedding and even the vicar was swearing at me. Oh, and apparently I'm the first person to be barred from churches in the Thames Valley area for 80 years. The last guy who was barred in 1924 had '?burning eyes like a snake and a touch as cold as ice'. His representatives managed to get the ban lifted after saying that there was no proof he was Satan and that the decision infringed his civil rights.What about MY civil rights? Pubs, libraries, Cambridge University, Virgin Airways Flights, 'The Lounge' Nightclub, Aylesbury Civic Centre, The City of Milton Keynes and now all the churches in Buckinghamshire have barred me. Clearly I am the victim in all of this. And what the hell are people doing taking kids to weddings anyway? If you can't be trusted to take a child to a strip show then logic would suggest that at an event when you're not supposed to stare or try and touch the performer (i.e. the Bride) children are unwelcome. If I went and stood in a boxing ring with a toddler on my shoulders and a glancing blow caught it, would it be the boxer's fault. No, it would be my fault for being stupid enough to step into a boxing ring with a child. If it happened I'd be the first to own up and say that I was in the wrong, but according to the Church of England and the kid's parents such an analogy is 'deranged'.Can you imagine what would have happened if a parent threw their child into a giant fish tank with 'Free Willy' and that stupid orca smacked it with its tail? Do you think people would blame Willy for what happened? No, they'd be all like "oh Willy doesn't know any better", or "he was trying to help the child". Oh yeah sure, whenever he does something clever make out that it's the best thing in the world, but when he does one bad thing, just put it down to low intelligence. I rate the 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' an average 11 points</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four Weddings and a Funeral is an extremely funny film. If the opening sequence doesn't make you laugh, nothing will. And conversely, if Matthew's moving rendition of W. H. Auden's "Stop all the clocks. . ." poem doesn't leave you close to tears, then you must be truly hard-hearted. Unfortunately though, what could have been an excellent comedy has a major flaw.Charles (Hugh Grant) is a likeable chap whose friends are all getting married, leaving him as a sort of perpetual Best Man. Then American Carrie (Andie MacDowell) enters the picture and causes Charles to reassess his thoughts on marriage. Grant has charisma in spades, but sadly MacDowell does not. In fact, she is perhaps one of the least charismatic actresses ever. Not only that, but the limit of her acting ability seems to be a toothpaste-advertisement-style smile. Fortunately the casting of Charles's motley collection of single friends is excellent, and one can't help thinking he would be better off marrying one of them.The film is almost fly-on-the-wall in its style, which gives it realism and allows it to explore the relationships within the group of friends on an intimate and everyday level. Hence the subtle humour works better than, for example, Rowan Atkinson's very obvious laugh-line attempts as a preacher with a penchant for Spoonerisms.As one character notes, weddings have a habit of blending together in the memory and the director has played on this, creating four weddings that are visually similar and yet distinct. And of one of them is particularly memorable for the fact that it doesn't actually include a marriage ceremony. At its conclusion the film shows that whilst marriage is a noble institution, it is not for everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a greatness to this film's sweetness !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally I get repulsed by the term romantic-comedy. On 75% of the times, the films belonging to this genre, specially the ones that are made in the Hollywood system, tend to come across as very shoddy and utterly artificial products made by money-making committees. However 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is an exception. No matter how many times I watch this film, I find myself getting charmed by the inherent and inescapable sweetness of it.One of the reasons why it works could be the fact that the film is extremely British in an almost unapologetic way. All the characters exude this Victorian charm that works on me every time. Hugh Grant himself plays this awkward character that I can in a sense relate with. Although like other romantic-comedies, the primary theme of this film is finding love, but 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is also very much about friendship. This is an ensemble piece and every character apart from Charles also gets his/her fair share of presence. I believed the friendship between them. I have to mention Kristin Scott Thomas. She is brilliant as Fiona. She expresses so much with her eyes. It's her emotional vulnerability that she expresses through her eyes even though her outward appearance remains as assured,confident and elegant as ever throughout the film.It is very intelligently directed by Mike Newell. He knows exactly when to cut to which face to get a particular reaction. His sense of comic timing is also brilliant. The screenplay by Richard Curtis is certainly not short of clichés, but there is a sweetness to it, that Newell elevates to the next level through his directing.'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is certainly not a 'great' film in the artistic sense of the word. It has some of the clichés that you would expect a romantic-comedy to have. But the British charm, elegance and Hugh Grant's lovable awkwardness works every time I watch it. It is a feelgood film that makes you want to get together with our friends and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when it first came out and thought it was great. However, now after viewing it again almost ten years after it was made I realised just how appalling it actually is. It bored me to tears. Out of the group of friends, the only ones I actually like are Matthew and Charles' brother David and that's only because he doesn't speak! (well, not outloud anyway...)I like the way in which the conversations that he has with Charles are subtitled on screen. I find that with some deaf characters in films their dialogue is only usually signed so that the listening audience cannot tell what they are saying. This usually implies that what the deaf character has to say is of no importance.In fact David (the deaf guy) appears to be the smartest one out of the entire cast in that he's the only one who sees that Charles doesn't want to be with Henrietta, but with the 'dull American' instead (because let's face it, there is absolutely NO sexual chemistry at all between Grant and McDowell - she seems to be rather irritated by him.) David also sets in motion the sequence of events which will bring the two romantic leads together. And he's also rather cute!All in all I would say that is this programme is on TV. watch it if nothing else that day takes your fancy - otherwise, I really wouldn't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***spoiler within review - but warned of later on***It is with no surprise that Four Weddings and A Funeral was a massive success in the United States. To the inexperienced American eye the movie appears to be a fluffy iconographic piece, flaunting the upper echelon of England's society. Like Chariots of Fire released over a decade before, this Mike Newell film seem to utilize the heritage tradition to achieve both economic and critical acclaim in the United States. Just as the characters in Four Weddings and A Funeral did not see the most loving relationship before their eyes (in Gareth and Matthew) the mass public did not see the true movie that lay before them. The weddings, churches, money and nostalgic icons of the film are simply a façade for the real tone of the piece. By implanting non-traditional characters and themes into Four Weddings and A Funeral, the film undercuts every facet of the heritage film.The ensemble of character all undermine the heritage tradition of cultured ensemble casts. Although each character (Gareth and Scarlet excluded) appears to have a fanciful purse to their name and no indication of an inclination toward employment they still undercut high culture in their own unique way. It is from Hugh Grants' tardiness, sloppiness and lack of love to Tom's Godly amounts of money but humbling clumsiness and low standards that they not only undermine subtly undermine the high culture they take part in but also become such likable characters.The normal viewer can cling to these likable flawed characters, sumptuous visuals, playful dialogue and seemingly simple romantic comedy appeal. I challenge everyone, upon second viewing, and without a date, to observe how each character in some scene or in many pokes fun at British high class. The one scene that is both brilliant not only in it's juxtaposition with the weddings but standing alone and that is the funeral scene.***Spoiler alert***the rest of the review contains a spoiler***The funeral of Gareth stands as the most beautiful and thematic purposeful scene in the movie. In stark contrast to the countryside of England and Scotland Gareth's funeral takes place in a working-class neighborhood in London. Where the exposition and backdrop of the weddings are beautiful countryside?s this takes place among run-down flats and with steaming factory as the backdrop. Unlike the four weddings, a completely different crowd attends the funeral. The only African American in the entire film, a multitude of working-class clad attendees and homosexuals are all shown to be saddened by and in attendance at Gareth's funeral. Mathew's moving speech shows that he and Gareth were truly in love. Where all the other character's sloppily search for the meaning of love and companionship the most truly perfect match lay in the homosexual couple and not the repeated heterosexual attempts and eventual denouncement of marriage by Carrie and Charles. Gareth's funeral scene is filled with all of the themes and messages of the film but most importantly the class, culture and ceremonial irrelevance of marriage in relation to love.The ?veil? of the movie Four Weddings and A Funeral is that it is a movie about the delightful institution of marriage. Be it the comedic nature of the film or more importantly the surface elements resembling the heritage film genre this film is often declared devoid of reality as well as insensitive to the lower classes. But beneath the veil there is a completely different message. Broken down the real plot of the film can be seen as revolving around a group of characters who all represent differing anti-elite elements as they experience a culturally important institution - marriage. What they discover in their own ways is that love is what is important and not the act of getting married. In fact the most beautiful ceremony in the entire film is set in a lower class neighborhood and is Gareth?s funeral. In both the case of the marriages and in the case of the funeral ones first assumption about the event is reversed in this movie. Equally for the film itself, although it seems to be a heritage film filled with love and marriage on the outside, the type of film it actually is and the message it ultimately conveys is completely different than it appears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie when I saw it at our local cinema, but it is not a film I would normally comment on. However, I had a look at some of the reviews below and found them intriguing. Unlike many of the posters, I thought Andie MacDowell's fey American was just the ticket for this plot. She slides into scenes like a shadow and we viewers, like Hugh Grant's figure, spend our time trying to grab a hold of her. She was terrific as she underplayed this role tempting all of us until she got her man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw this movie until last night and when I found out it was on cable tv I thought I'd give it a try because I am a big fan of Rowan Adkinson.I was very surprised I didn't like his scene at all (except for the first little scene in which he is talking with some woman about sex)But I did like the movie a lot! I never knew anything about Hugh Grant movies, I thought they were boring romantic flicks you would take your girlfriend to. Boy was I wrong, I watched this one with a few mates and we all thought it was hilarious. I even liked this Andie McDowall or whatever her name is , the female star that most of you seem to hate. But then again, she is exactly the kind of woman I fancy (I mean her looks) So I didn't really care if she could act or not. The other girl I really liked was Scarlett. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film especially Rowan Atkinson's holy spigot and holy goat mistakes. The crowd of friends consisting of Charles and Scarlett make me laugh. They are always together at each wedding and seem to know everything and everyone. Gareth is the funniest with Charles coming a close second. I only wish though that Charles had married Hen and we could have seen how it ended up. I love Charles mistakes when he tells John the rumour of another man and John's wife. Matthew's eulogy of WH Auden's famous poem, which I may add I love, makes the funeral all the more poignant and also all the sadness of the death of the most popular guy in the film. It's full of sadness but mostly keeps me in fits of laughter. It's excellent with superb acting BUT Andi McDowell's performance could have been better. She seemed unsure of her role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and a Funeral" is, in a word, blah. A few funnies here and there doesn't make up for its overall dullness. The funniest character would have to be Mr. Bean's -- oops, I mean Rowan Atkinson (sp?) -- priest, but for some reason he appeared only for a short while. Which is too bad, because most of the main characters fail to provoke any interest. Having said that, Hugh Grant is one sexy Brit! It's just unfortunate that he got matched with Andie Mc-somethingorother; I hate to say this, but she can't act. She seemed so detached from her character, which was also the case in "St. Elmo's Fire". I believe if the role of the American woman was given to someone else, the romance between her and Grant's Charles would be more believable.This movie is okay. It's not overly great or whatever but it doesn't suck as well. But Best Picture? Um...no?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gawky English guy Charles is stumbling through the mischances and misconceptions of his life represented here by various weddings other than his own. With or without the help of the miscellaneous group of friends he finally gets hold of the true feeling - and that's exactly when things start to go seriously wrong. Wonderful ensemble of silly acting and barmy moments combined with the parody of British upper-class stiffness and dry humour. Lots of hilarious dialogue in this Richard Curtis's right-timing and witty script.Actors and characters are terrific except for Andie MacDowell, who seems like a bad miscast. She can't really act that well so it makes you wonder A) is her character deliberately irritating and B) why didn't Charlie-boy get together with the seriously charming Scott Thomas. But... such is love and people sometimes make weird decisions... and after all - although you really start to live and sympathize with the characters - it is just a movie!!</fullReview>

It's the old man next to whom Charles is seated at one of the weddings. Charles introduces himself, and the old man looks defiantly at him and says: "Don't be ridiculous! Charles died many years ago!" Whereupon Charles replies: "Maybe that's another Charles?" The old man gets angry and says: "Don't you think I'd recognize my own brother?!"Then one of Charles' friends encounter him at another wedding, entering the church. When asked "Bride or groom?" as to where he should be seated, the old man replies, just as defiantly: "It should be obvious I'm neither!"Take my word for it. This film is a great one.</fullReview>

Addie McDowell is delightful as the American ice-maiden and the rest of the cast just avoid being sterotypes and give splendidly eccentric and witty performances.

		<fullReview>I liked the cast overall - who doesn't love a British romcom? The main characters were absolute prats, though, and deserved each other (and I don't mean that in a good way!).They both toy with each other and other people in their lives until they - predictably - end up together, but not before hurting just one more person.I mean, Carrie knew what she was doing when she came to his wedding, and told him ON HIS WEDDING MORNING that she was separated. She knew he loved her, and now that she was alone (without her gold mine husband), she didn't want to lose him, but of course, his wedding day was the perfect time to tell him she was available... *roll eyes* SMH for that. She also cheated on her fiancé with him... and he went along with it!What's more, he stood up his bride to be on the wedding day AT THE ALTAR just because Carrie shows up! Seriously.Overall, they come across as really shallow people who don't care if/how they hurt others in their own pursuit of happiness. No regard for anyone else (including each other!)I did love his group of friends though - what an interesting bunch! They are the only reason I'm giving this movie 7/10!Also, not much chemistry between Andie M. and Hugh G. ... and he played the hapless character he always plays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>14 years after its release, I watched 'Four Weddings' again on DVD. Perhaps it's a sign of a bona fide classic that on repeated viewings the film - like a vintage wine - improves with age. The Richard Curtis script has not been diminished by numerous knock offs. It's a warm, tender entertainment totally lacking in cynicism.The opening scene sets the original tone. Charles (Hugh Grant), a 30-something Londoner and his semi-punk flat mate Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) are late for a wedding. The first twenty words or so of the film are 'f**k' or variations on the word 'f**k' delivered as an expression of exasperation every time something delays them. Unless you have only seen the film on US TV - I saw it on American TV in 2001 and the 'f**ks' had been replaced by 'buggars', a quintessentially English swear word never used in the USA and therefore inoffensive to American ears.The title is also a full plot summary. The film follows a group of friends through 4 different weddings and the funeral of one of their number. The other friends - Kristen Scott Thomas, John Hannah, James Fleet, Simon Callow - exist only at these glossy straight from the pages of 'Country Life and 'Tatler' weddings. Charles is the principle character, perpetually embarrassed and in love with a Yuppie American Carrie (Andie McDowell). He looses her, sees her married, then when she splits up with her husband, Charles jilts his bride on their wedding day to be with Carrie. And here is the film's main flaw - Carrie is nether especially sensual or interesting. In fact, she's rather flat (imagine what Tracy Ullman or Emma Thompson could have done with the role). Charles turns down the attentions of Kristen Scott Thomas and jilts Anna Chancellor at the altar, both of whom are more attractive than McDowell. But this is a fantasy where love is like a bolt of lighting. Director Mike Newell and writer Richard Curtis turn the English social occasions into self-contained vehicles for farce and romance, notably Rowan Atkinson as nervous, tongue tied novice priest, fumbling and fluffing his way through a wedding service. Most moving of all, John Hannah delivering the eulogy at his boyfriend's funeral (the ebullient Simon Callow, dying of a heart attack) - it's a reading of WH Auden's poem blues that is touching without ever being mawkish.A durable format was created with this film and the English Rom-Com born.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has lasted better than a lot of marriages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened to catch this movie on TV the night before my nephew's wedding, so it was good preparation for the event to come, even though it took place in a national park rather than in one of Wren's lovely London churches. I very much enjoyed it on its first release in 1994 and it stands up very well 13 years later. It's a strange thing really. The characters are a bunch of aging but immature unemployed hooray Henrys and Henriettas, thrown together originally in boarding school or at universities, now in their early thirties, still aimlessly partying their way through life. Charles (Hugh Grant) is terminally indecisive and the object of his desire, Carrie (an American), though beautiful, is lacking in self-confidence. I couldn't help thinking that the strong-minded Henrietta alias Duckface (Anna Chancellor) would have been a better mate for the feckless Charles, assuming he didn't mind being dominated.So why is this such a great comedy? First, Mike Newell, a very versatile director, has put it together beautifully and there is not a wasted moment. Second the dialogue is sparklingly fresh. Even 13 years later Charles's "wake-up" scene at the beginning still packs a punch. The scene at which Charles is trapped at a table with a posse of his ex-girlfriends is just hilarious. Third, although the characters are rather a shallow bunch they are still a good-hearted lot, and when one of them dies the mood changes dramatically. We wind up wishing them well, and the end of the film gives us their eventual matrimonial destinations. The minor characters are all well-drawn also.Richard Curtis, who was responsible for the script, is well-known for "Blackadder" (and Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance in this film), but the humour here is of a different sort. We recognise enough of ourselves in this bunch of upper-class twits to laugh along with them, as well as at them.I have only one niggle (shared with a lot of critics) and it is about Andie McDowell's performance as Carrie. It does appear wooden, in comparison with the others. If she is meant to be a pretty woman with no self-confidence, she does the job, sort of. Perhaps the problem is, surrounded by so many good professionals, she's just a pretty face. As we know, Hugh Grant didn't do too well in California.</fullReview>

The humour is so genuine, so warm-hearted, so silly, so very...British. And there's lots of it, all the way up to and including the credits.The setting is somewhat upper class (but not entirely), so panders to the stereotype. (If something is true, is it still a 'stereotype'?) But I loved that this provided a platform for intelligent dialogue - plenty of social insights to take home, and not a trace of dumbing down for 'lowest common denominator' audiences.This is a very re-watchable movie. There's such rich content and so much humour that it's still very entertaining on the third or fourth viewing. Thoroughly endearing, remarkably brilliant movie-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the absolute best comedies in recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and a Funeral" is one of the absolute best comedies in recent years. I do not have it on DVD but every time it appears on one of the TV channels you know where to find me. The story is well thought out and it is supported by a very talented cast of characters. Hugh Grant is absolutely fantastic in his leading role as the (almost) eternal bachelor Charles. His interaction with all the supporting characters, Tom, Fiona, Henrietta, David etc is outstanding. He falls short only when it comes to his relationship with the leading female actor, Andie McDowell, as Carrie. Although it is very difficult to tell how love strikes in real life, usually the make-believe world of Hollywood and elsewhere is more predictable. Carrie and Charlie may well have fallen for each other in real life but in the film setting they are not really convincing as lovers. This is a blurp in an otherwise great film with star performances by actors like Kristin Scott Thomas as Fiona, James Fleet as Tom, Simon Callow as Gareth, and not least John Hannah as Matthew. The most heart-gripping scene in the entire film is John Hannah's recital of W.H. Auden's poem "Stop All The Clocks" at Gareth's funeral. It provides the necessary balance to all the funny scenes throughout the film. This balance is also visually supported by the choice of location, a grey, rainy Inverness in Scotland provides quite a contrast to the rolling English meadows and sunny London. Pure genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a perfect film, but wonderful even with its flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the film many times on DVD, and having read many reviews, has inspired me to offer this review. It is easy to find fault with one aspect or another of this (or any) film. Sometimes it may be the performance; other times it may be the script and the way the character is written. Overall, whatever shortcomings any viewer might identify according to his or her perspective, Four Weddings and a Funeral does what it is supposed to do, namely to entertain. One could wrangle on and on about Andie MacDowell (as many have!), but the fact remains that she portrays a character we, as viewers, are not meant to judge. For those who claim there is no chemistry between MacDowell and Grant, it would seem that they are not accepting the story as written but as they would like it to be. MacDowell plays a very complex woman: attractive, somewhat mysterious, coy, experienced as a lover (a very uncomfortable point, especially to a modern audience) and verbally playful. It would be easy to dismiss her character Carrie by labeling her a slut (as Fiona does in the film). Hugh Grant's Charles is attracted to her and falls in love with her. The movie establishes that there is some level of mutuality in this attraction, despite Carrie's considerable amorous past. Charles is meant to be the one man in her life who challenges her to see that there is a difference between love and sex, that sex is more than mere physical attraction. We see Carrie much more objectively than Charles does, which I think is part of the movie's energy. We could as easily dismiss Charles for being a fool for being interested in someone with a longer list of lovers than his own. Much has been said about MacDowell's acting- that she can't, that she is wooden, that her very presence on the screen is boring, even ruins the film. That is too facile, too dismissive. One could equally take exception to Charles' constant faltering speech and see his eye blinking as annoying. Clearly this Englishman and this American woman are not perfect, but they do happen to be attracted to one another and the movie tells the story of what becomes of this initial attraction. Let us not forget the insensitive way Charles has treated each of his former girlfriends, regaling each new date with the shortcomings of the previous ones. Let's not focus on the fact that he is more virtuous because he only slept with nine women, a mere fraction of the number of lovers Carrie had. Clearly the movie is about how both of these characters are looking and at the same time are somewhat lost. Both choose the wrong partners for marriage for the wrong reason. Neither really listens to his or her heart until the end of the movie and having made disastrous mistakes. Some criticize the movie for the fact that we don't know what any of the characters do for a living. I don't see how that really makes a difference. We do learn that Carrie worked for Vogue magazine. We also learn that Scarlett is considering a job for a supposed sex shop called Rubber. The focus of the movie is on the personalities, feelings and thoughts of the main characters, not what careers or professions they have. In that area the movie does give us enough information to be able to involve us as viewers. The movie is not meant to be terribly profound, although there are several moments which delve beneath the surface of mere comedy. The best way to enjoy Four Weddings and a Funeral is to see it for what it is and not what we think it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, warm and clever despite it's appallingly weak central couple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Weddings And a Funeral has a lot to answer for, because it almost single handedly spawned that sub genre of extremely bland British rom-coms which are usually mildly amusing, usually mildly romantic and usually starring the immensely irritating Hugh Grant. However, Four Weddings, although certainly over hyped at the time of it's release, is still quite an enjoyable film.Thefilm sadly fails with it's central romance. Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell have no chemistry, McDowell's delivery of her lines is so fake and wooden you expect her to turn into a tree, and there's little sense of romance about a couple who casually sleep together a few times and than may or may not fall in love. The ending has little genuine emotion because we care so little.However, the supporting characters are so interesting and likable that the film comes alive when Grant and McDowell are not centre stage. Simon Callow, as the life and soul of the party, the sadly missed Charlotte Coleman, and Kristin Scott-Thomas, whose confession to Grant that she loves him is the most romantic thing in the movie, stand out.Unlike most of it's successors, Four Wedding is also at times hilariously funny, such as when Grant finds himself at a table full of ex girlfriends, or the great bit of visual comedy with Rowan Atkinson and a ring.The structure of the film {basically, as it's title suggests, it's based around four weddings and a funeral} is made into a virtue, as all the important interplay happens at these social gatherings, and all four are completely different from each other. The funeral adds some tragedy, but it works in this film which seems to generally celebrate life. The feel good factor still presides, but sometimes touches of loss and sadness do creep in, adding a depth missing from most films of this kind. There are enough good elements in this film that one can almost, but not quite, forgive the weakness of the central couple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some spoilers ahead:This might have been a good picture if a) no Andie MacDowell allowed near the camera; b) the director had been able to control Hugh Grant's facial tics and stammerings which he thinks pass for acting; c) the F--word had been said maybe 2 or 3 times instead of 2 or 3 hundred; d) the sacrament of marriage had not been treated like something you do when you're bored, like going shopping or having a manicure; e) the supporting characters had been given more screen time; or f) Hugh's character had ended up with the old friend who was in love with him all along.I will give praise where it's due: John Hannah as the "widow" of the fat man who died was marvellous, and the Auden poem he read at the funeral was beautifully done...a rare touch of class amid all the swearing and carrying on.As I've said, had this movie been cleaned up in its profanity, toned down a little in its desperation, and the female lead given to a real actress, it would have been very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I am not a fan of this film, having worked with Charlotte Colman on her last film, 'A Loving Act', before she died, I feel that I have to give this film some attention. Having previously watched snippets of the film, and then seeing the whole thing on a weekend retreat, I can only remember that I fell asleep half-way through the film. It bored me so much that I gave way to my eyelids. Perhaps the most significant part of the film is when Charlotte Colman swears. That's the only thing that I can associate her with the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barring the slapstick of Naked Gun &amp; Airplane, this is the funniest film ever made &amp; ran very close by Notting Hill.The only people who don't find this funny are either American(ized) or have had a sense of humour bypass operation at birth.After all the writers of this film are the mob that wrote Blackadder which was universally acclaimed the Greatest TV show of the millennium in 1999, so I think they know what they're doing.Spoilers withinRowan Atkinson steals the film with his wedding scene, just about the funniest thing ever, but Grant's chat with the pupil of the Housemaster who'd just got married comes close. Likewise, Grant spilling out his words of love to Andie McDowell, beside the Thames, was also brilliant.Aswell as it being hilarious, there is the sadness too, which all true good comedies can achieve.People forget, this films sells itself as a comedy, with a romantic subplot. Not the other way around, so fact their romance came together in an unusual way should be neither here nor there. One idiot below even commented that the scene with the rings was hard to believe as other guests would've offered there rings instead of the comical rings. It's a extended sit-com, not an Agatha Christie novel.Admittedly I don't like Andie McDowell, infact she is poor, but that's the only criticism you can level at this film. This is English humour. People were aware of differences in humour between between America &amp; Australia &amp; Europe, years ago, but still, years on, persist in trying to get comedies to be a hit all over the world. I doubt there'll ever achieve it. People are just brought up on completely contrasting TV programmes, depending on where they're from.I can imagine people who don't laugh at this are the sort who sit in hysterics at such sidesplitters as the childish 'penis in the apple pie' or masturbation type gags in American Pie or any of the equally unamusing, ill-informed romanticised crap that was in the Wedding Singer. Excuse me while I sow my sides back up. (I've just remembered that hilarious scene where a bloke done nothing but impersonate Boy George). Had it not been for the video covers, I'd have never even known they were comedies.Anyway. If you're clever enough to appreciate both adult &amp; family humour together, and don't feel a need to show off by analysing every character &amp; scene in every film you ever see, then make every effort to see Four Weddings &amp; a Funeral, it is brilliant. One of only 10 films of 300 that I've given full marks too.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Title should be "FOUR JOKES AND A LAUGH".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most successful movies of 1994 that also gained itself an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Many people who have viewed this trash may agree with me when I say that this film marked the decline in the quality of the films that are nominated for Oscar night (as well as the credibility of the Academy's voters!!).It seems that each year the Academy's taste gets worse and worse in regards to the best picture category. For example Gladiator and American Beauty were average movies at best and yet they both receive "Best Film of the year" Oscars.The following contains spoilers.........The film Four weddings and a funeral is credited as a romantic film. Yet as a "romance" this film fails terribly in that the two leads (Grant and MacDowell) fall for each other far too suddenly. The two characters spend so little onscreen time together for any love to truly blossom despite the fact that their personalities are too different.Grant's character Charles seems too pompous and sexually inhibitive whereas MacDowell's character Carrie is the very opposite. In fact Fiona (played by Kristen Scott Thomas) describes Carrie to Charles as a "loose woman".Also their paths in the story go in completely opposite directions as one gets married (and then suddenly and conveniently gets divorced) and other gets engaged. Therefore the romantic interest here is far too sudden and inexplicible to be in anyway formulaic. Also the language in the film seems far too strong to convey any romance patricularily in the beginning.The film is also sells itself as a comedy and again it fails miserably. This is because the jokes seem far too predictible and out of place that they appear to lack any credibility.For instance Charles forgets the rings for a wedding in which he has the role of best man. So the unfortunate couple in question are then married with a heavy metal "skull ring" and a child's enormous "butterfly ring". This is just too unbelievable given that there are so many married couples in the congregation that would be happy to lend the unfortunate couple their own wedding rings in such a crisis.Another instance of this trend is when Father Gerald (played by Rowan Atkinson) muddles up his first wedding ceremony by getting the couples names wrong etc. The fact that it is supposed to be his first ceremony weakens the credibility of the joke since in reality such ceremonies are so well rehearsed to allow for any such errors. So in order to enjoy the humour viewers may have to avoid looking too deeply into the jokes in this film. This is blatently contradictive as the film does try to sell itself as a "thinking man's" comedy.All the characters are shallow. The romantic interest is simply uninteresting. The humour has a very stereotypical flavour which is brewed for US tastes. English are portrayed as frigid upper class goons who jeer at other nationalities such as Americans and Scottish. And with a final nod to US stereotype humour one of the English elite ends up marrying his very own cousin.It is hard to see why this film has received so many honours. It seems that each year the Academy nominates at least one non American film for the "Best Film" category. The reason for this could be to promote films that are made by Foreign production companies abroad (with Hollywood investment!!) to the general viewing public. This is probably because such films are cheaper to make for Hollywood as they own all the studiios outside the US and so therefore it frees up a lot of studio space in Hollywood for other big budget blockbusters etc.This annoying film has an equally annoying soundtrack thanks to the awful theme song "Love is all around" by the aptly named band Wet Wet Wet.This film is a true powerhouse of annoyance!!!!!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a "one-in-a-thousand": Everything fits together perfectly (yes, even Andie MacDowell). The cast is wonderful, every actor playing -- no, being -- his part. every wedding is shown in its own style with the first one looking most of the time like a professional video made for the wedding couple. And then there is the brilliant script by Richard Curtis, arguably the best screen writer working in the movie industry today. All his lines sound real but are very funny and fit together (watch for the last wedding and Andie MacDowell's tip for Hugh Grant).With all the good films of the last few years especially from Great Britain this one stands out and tops them showing that there are still mature people with a good sense of childishness in the motion picture industry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Weddings and a Funeral: And Only That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I enjoy romantic comedies as much as or more than most, I found very little to appreciate in Four Weddings and a Funeral: It flits around from wedding to wedding employing a fairly large cast of characters, which, though interesting, the viewer never gets to know.The fatal flaw of Four Weddings is that it tells us about many significant friendships, relationships, and romances but rarely shows them to us in actual character interactions or dialogue. The supposedly deep and meaningful connections between characters were actually so threadbare as to cause audience confusion or worse, indifference.Here are a few examples: Charles and Fiona- We learn that they are long-time friends, but see her carp at Charles for his lateness and then confess her love for him, which is never mentioned again hereafter. Carrie and Hamish- She's flirting with Charles, in bed with him and then ? engaged to Hamish. Things like this do happen, but she goes out especially with Charles for a fun, "dress-selecting" outing and then sleeps with him again before her wedding. This is the marriage that came from nowhere and made no sense other than a (poor) plot device. Gareth- He wears a silly-looking vest but makes fun of Scarlett's dress. He generally has a good time, drinks, dances, and then drops dead in a startling and therefore moderately comical manner. However, his funeral is treated seriously in the film and is supposed to carry great emotional weight with the viewer. Honestly, I barely had time to learn his name and a few superficial facts about him, but there was not enough "meat" in his character development to make my eyes even begin to grow misty when he died. Charles and Henrietta- They have a couple of tearful conversations, one complete with a dressing down, no steamy encounters, but suddenly, they're walking down the aisle?But all of this may have been forgivable if the movie had spent any time with the side characters before bombarding us with the montage of weddings at the end. Henrietta/ "Duckface" gets married, happily, it seems, but the audience gets not one minute with her after Charles leaves her at the altar.This film skips over almost every relationship or character development worth showing, leaving it emotionally hollow, frustrating, and ultimately forgettable.I guess screenwriter Richard Curtis was getting warmed up for Love Actually, which succeeds in all the ways that Four Weddings and a Funeral failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A farce featuring British Urban Stuck-ups (and American suck-ups)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do like this movie (rating it a 10*) but am amazed when I rented it again recently from the video store how much the British YUPPIES were unabashedly stuck-up. Granted that we are watching them at their most sexually "full-blast" modes, they seem to have no view of consequences for their self-absorption. The down-to-earth childhood rhyme "first comes love, next comes marriage, then comes Hugh pushing the baby carriage" only gets fulfillment with the finally included still photographs of the characters in the near future. The most ludicrous of the four is the final WEDDING where the major character admits that he would prefer being in love with another to paying attention to Hen, his on-again, off-again love interest who is in full bridal costume standing next to him. The wedding theme of the picture is lovely and enthralling; the consequences of being more committed to one's tag-along companions than to a monogamous partner are indirectly put forward as the "cause" of Gareth's death, one might theorize. I do recommend this film even if you find yourself with mouth agape at the hedonists and big-mouths/awful liars who get front and center attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie probably seven or eight times, and I simply never get tired of it. It seems like every time I see it, I discover something I never noticed before about it. The structuring of the film is terrific--we really never know the characters outside of the various weddings and funerals they attend. The casting is wonderful--Hugh Grant is obviously the star, but each character is fully fleshed out and so interesting! Kristin Scott Thomas is particularly impressive as the icy, brokenhearted Fiona who has so many hidden secrets. The actors playing the gay couple are wonderful in the subtle way the relationship is handled, and Matthew's speech at the funeral leaves me in tears every day. This film has it all--sadness at Gareth's funeral, the torment of a broken heart, the joy of a wedding, and some absolutely hilarious scenes! Even after seeing it so many times, I cannot stop laughing in the scenes where Hugh gets stuck in the closet while the bride and groom are "celebrating" their marriage, or where he is stuck at the table with all his old girlfriends, or where the vicar performs his first wedding ceremony. It's hilarious without relying on stupid sight gags, obvious jokes, or other conventional movie cliches.I know a lot of people may not agree with me, but I find this movie to be so completely entertaining that it amazes me. It's greatness lies in the individual scenes and the inclusion of sideplots in addition to the main romance between Charles and Carrie. I swear, every time I see it I find something else that I love about it. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a subtle comedy (but be prepared to rewind it in several places to get a grasp on the British accents).10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Am I the only one who sees her as the wooden, boring actor that she is? Whenever she speaks I cringe, her lines are delivered so awkwardly. Hugh Grant can only carry their scenes together for so long. Otherwise, this was a very funny movie. Hugh Grant's character and his friends were great as eccentric single Brits who are always invited to weddings. I especially enjoyed the scene where Hugh Grant (who I don't usually like much as an actor) finds his pencil. A good, fun movie to see one night if you're not looking for anything that makes you think too much.....as long as you ignore Andie MacDowell.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious comedy of manners (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by the same man who penned the popular British TV series "Blackadder", and making name out of it's star Hugh Grant (as well as his then-girlfriend Liz Hurley), "Four Weddings and A Funeral" is a hilarious British comedy of manners, doing exactly what it says on the tin: exploring the social mores and madness of the great British institutions - the wedding and the funeral.At the heart of this is thirty-something English bachelor Charles (Hugh Grant), who wakes up uttering a string of expletives as he rushes to join his group of well-off friends for a wedding occasion. While there, he encounters an attractive American woman (Andie MacDowell), with whom he spends the night. But commitment-shy Charles hesitates to get more involved, and finds himself in danger of losing her to someone else...The whole affair is very lightweight, and none of the actors appear to take it too seriously. Hugh Grant is wonderful in a career-defining role. Andie MacDowell has a very limited acting range, but she manages the material here well and forms a good on screen partnership with Grant. In other roles, Simon Callow is fine as a bon viveur homosexual, and John Hannah gets some sharp lines in as his partner. James Fleet and Kirstin Scott Thomas are on top form playing characters who are a little bit more than the stereotypes they first appear to be. Rowan Atkinson has an excellent cameo appearance as a tongue-tied priest who performs the second wedding service.The best thing about "Four Weddings" is the wonderful script. Some lines don't quite hit the mark, but others are completely spot on. It pokes fun at the little rituals and hypocrises that make up these sorts of occasions, and makes some solid use of visual, as well as verbal comedy - the rings in the first wedding sequence.All in all, an enjoyable romantic comedy. Grant performed a similar role a few years later, in the Julia Roberts vehicle "Notting Hill".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie, Hugh Grant creates the role he does best. OK, let's be honest, the ONLY role he does!. The dialogue is sharp and funny, the various characters are on the whole realistic and interesting (Andie McDowell's is the weakest), and the story works well as a simple vehicle for the characters to reveal themselves in. The pathetic attempt to do a sequel (Notting Hill - gimme a break!) pales in comparison to this movie. The two gay characters are especially well done; no-one notices they are gay until the funeral. Simon Callow is brilliant as Gareth, and John Hannah's eulogy had people flocking to bookstores in Britain to buy copies of Auden's poem. The ending is kinda obvious and I thought a little too drawn out, but that is minor. A comedy the Brits can be proud of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who remembers when this film came out might recall seeing one Elizabeth Hurley at the premiere. She arrived with Hugh Grant on her arm, and was wearing a black dress which seemed to be tied together with safety pins. When she turned sideways, she looked almost naked.The reason I mention this is because the dress drew more attention than the film, and anyone who bothered to see it (the film, that is) would understand why.As Bob Hope once memorably said, 'There'll always be an England - even if it's in Hollywood.' Therein lies the problem of this picture.It is so desperate to be liked by American audiences it turns its core subjects into stereotypes in order to pander to the overseas image of the British upper class twit.I'm only surprised that they didn't bother filming the entire picture within the confines of Buckingham Palace, that way even Prince Charles might have got a walk-on part and a few lines. God knows, he couldn't have been any worse than Hugh Grant.Incidentally, the aforementioned Elizabeth Hurley has no part in this film. Nor does her dress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I been so impressed with a film as I was with Mike Newell's British romp, Four Weddings and a Funeral. I can honestly say that this was one of those films that needed to have strong definitive characters to make the story work, and Newell accomplished this task with the greatest of ease.While he had done some work prior to this film, America was introduced to a very funny and very British Hugh Grant for the first time. His amazing and singular work in this film skyrocketed him to his level in Hollywood today. He could not have found a better step ladder.This film is funny, insightful, witty, and very personable. It is hard to find films of this caliber created by Hollywood anymore, so thankfully we have this film. Everything from the soundtrack (boasting several American songs), to the deeply humorous and intuitive references to American 'pop' culture, to Hugh Grant's use of a certain word time over time, only keeps this film above all others. This is definitely one of those films that should be watched when life seems to be dragging and you need a bowl of laughter in your life. It should also be used by anyone that is a fan of British humor. It will turn any day into sunshine.Overall, this was a surprising film when I watched it for the first time, and it continues to impress. I am not a huge fan of Andie MacDowell, so it sometimes perplexes me as to why she chose this project, but thankfully this is counteracted by one of Hollywood's most classic scenes involving Rowan Atkinson! That man can do no wrong! I suggest this film to everyone at least once. It may not be everyone's 'cup of tea', but watching it once caused nobody harm.Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My extended review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In early 1995, Four Weddings and a Funeral became the first film in over 20 years to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture with only one other nomination (Best Original Screenplay). It had no chance of winning the award, but it was a film popular with the general public, especially those from British extraction. The film was so popular in its home country that it won the BAFTA awards for Best Film and Best Director. Looking back almost ten years later, I am forced to wonder why the film was so well received.The film stars Hugh Grant as Charles, a man who cannot commit to a relationship. He has had a string of girlfriends but nothing has ever worked out for him. But at the wedding of a friend, he sees a woman who he lusts after. He asks his friend about her, and he tells Charles that she is a slut, and that he should not go after her. This woman is an American called Carrie (played by Andie MacDowell) and she acts like a seductress and slut through the whole film. The film works around Charles being attracted to Carrie, and his interactions with her at various weddings.Hugh Grant is perfect in the insecure but charming stereotype he has echoed in most of his films; Kristen Scott-Thomas is fairly good, but not great, in a BAFTA award-winning role as Grant's friend, Fiona; and the film itself has a small number of amusing moments, but the film often does not work.For one thing, many of the jokes are not funny. There were a few funny moments and sketches here and there, but much of the humour did not work, at least for me, and I felt that the onslaught of jokes at the first three weddings did not mesh well together. I have been told that much of the humour came from how British people perceive Americans. Being Australian I can't really disagree. All I can say is that it would have better if the jokes tried to cater for an international audience. But then, I guess one has to ask if Newell intended his film to be the international success that it became.Still, there is the problem of characterisation. All of the characters are shallow, except for perhaps Hugh Grant's. As the title suggests, one of the characters dies during the film. This character is one that been on-screen for a fair amount of time, so I supposed I am meant to feel grief for his or her departure. However, I felt no emotional charge. The supporting characters in the film all have no depth, so why should we care for them? Then the last main problem is the whole Carrie character. She is as annoying as hell. Why? Because she's slut, she's deceptive and she's manipulative. She does not appear to be a nice person at all. With a comedy, you don't really want to displease the audience. And what else are we meant to feel but displeasure when Grant is obsessing over her. He has, and has had, a number of chances to make it with a character that is not made out to be annoying in the viewer's eyes, so his obsession with Carrie violates what I, as a viewer, want from the film. In a drama it is sometimes okay to go against what the viewer wants. But comedy is different. In a comedy you don't generally want the viewer to walk out unhappy. And that's what this film did to me.Oddly enough I don't really feel any strong hatred towards the film even though it violated what I would want from a film, even though it was often not funny and even though the characters were never more than surface deep. I guess I found it amusing to a degree, and it did keep me watching, even if not liking it overall. Hugh Grant, Scott-Thomas and a few funny moments are vital in bringing a bad film up to scratch. But they are not enough to make it really worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was - and for all I know still is - often said of Roger Moore that his entire repertoire consisted of raise left eyebrow, raise right eyebrow, which may well be true but it's still twice the sum total of Hugh Grant's repertoire which consists of a shy grin punctuated by a stutter carefully designed to result in ersatz charm. Thank God, therefore, that he is here confronted with genuine charm in the shape of Andie McDowall, the lone American who takes on the cream of British luvvies and leaves them dead in the water. Richard Curtis, who supplied the screenplay attempts to do the reverse by taking on the cream of American screenrights who dabbled in romantic comedy, Ben Hecht, Charles MacArtur, Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, Preston Sturges, Robert Riskin et al or, to put it another way, pits his Edsel against their Dusenbergs. Ouch! Having said that this is a pleasant lightweight diversion but you'd really be better checking 'Midnight', 'Easy Living' (1937 version), 'The Philadelphia Story' etc out of Blockbusters and see how the big boys do it.</fullReview>

Today, many people, especially married people say, "Marriage and love are different." or "Your marriage partner and your lover are exactly different."

		<shortDescription>Unorthodox approach to romance a pleasure, but a bit schizophrenic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and a Funeral" had some pretty amazing competition for Best Picture at the 1995 Academy Awards: Robert Redford's "Quiz Show," Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," "The Shawshank Redemption" and the winner, "Forrest Gump." To say the least, this little British comedy was way out of its league. As unorthodox and interesting of a romantic comedy as "Four Weddings" can be, the comparison stops there next to those all-time greats. But that's not to diminish the British talents that emerged with this film: director Mike Newell, star Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis, all of whom are held in high esteem today. Together, they put together a non-traditional, droll comedy with a unique approach that muses about love, life and marriage.The events of the film are indeed as described in the title. A group of friends with non- traditional and/or non-existent love lives attend various weddings of their other friends (and a funeral of course). The focus is Charles (Grant), a bit of a clumsy fellow trying to sort out his feelings on marriage having burned several past lovers as he could never commit. At the very first wedding of the film, Charles meets Carrie (MacDowell), an attractive, flirty and slightly domineering American who hooks him in. After a one-night stand, they find each other three months later at the next wedding, only it turns out Carrie is engaged.Curtis, creator of Rowan Atkinson's (who has a hysterical cameo) character "Bean," makes the better moments of this film with his Oscar-nominated screenplay. You can never completely get a pulse on the humor: one minute he's dry and the next more slapstick, but it works. The romantic subplots -- of which there are many -- could have used some work, but "Four Weddings" never feels typical. Curtis' construction of the story, though odd, keeps the film running at an amusing tempo. With the exception of Charles, no character receives a complete portrait, but each receives a strong attribute or context with which the actors can work. Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is a victim of unrequited love that tempers the wedding experience for her and Gareth (Simon Callow) has a joyful "everything's a laugh" mentality at weddings. We never see into who these characters really are, Curtis provides enough detail for them to feel real and to enhance the running dialogue about love that makes up the meat of the film. Ever since this film, Curtis ("Love, Actually" and "Bridget Jones' Diary") has specialized in the multi-character romance because he's adept at character design.The fact that "Four Weddings and a Funeral" tries to play in both dramatic romance and comedic romance prevents it from ever finding footing. Newell excels at directing both, but both don't exist in harmony in this case. The dramatic moments in particular hurt from lack of character depth and the comedic moments -- there aren't enough. The film is memorable, but the identity crisis keeps it out of the conversation of great romances.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some entertaining cameos but as a whole it's nothing special other than the manifest attractions of Hugh Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite an entertaining movie but I don't see why so much fuss has always been made about it, unless it's because the British Film Industry has been in the relative doldrums for so long that anything reasonable was over-hyped? It has some great cameos in the earlier part of the movie, but the later part drags. I find it difficult to appreciate some of the characters especially when they start to act pretentious. I felt it was rather a mistake to have so many well-known "character" actors in the same movie. A few less of Charles's "set" of familiar faces would have helped a lot because most of their characters/scripts were pretty boring.The central story, of Charles and Angie I found rather tedious too and this is the other reason I can't rate this movie highly even though Hugh Grant is an absolute sweetie and lifts any movie quite a bit nearer the stratosphere. I have to say though that I didn't decide that the first time I saw him, which was the first time I saw this movie, simply because I grew irritated with Charles' very fashionable, at the time, determination not to commit and the pretty silly ending in which he anxiously insists there mustn't be any commitment - OK, the wording is funny for a few seconds, until you realise how daft it is. To those of us who don't find commitment a problem it just sounds immature and I would pity any kids of this union, and even Angie as she has to put up with this immature guy's attitude. Well, perhaps he'd change in time.These days, the relentless determination that everyone must be "free to come and go as they like" in relationships has become rather sour as relationships become more and more problematic due to young people knowing no different from feckless parents and creating havoc for kids. Watching this movie again now, I felt it was very dated. Unfortunately too, there's no real charisma between Andie McDowell and Hugh Grant even though they are both trying hard and that's another reason I didn't rate Hugh Grant so much then as I do now. Watch Grant and Julia Roberts (Notting Hill) or Sandra Bullock (Two Weeks' Notice) and my, what a difference! With those lovely ladies who have such enormous charisma of their own, Hugh is perfect too - he's dynamite gorgeous just as they are and the poignant moments are brutally brilliant and I can watch both those movies over and over. Of course Hugh's done other splendid work too. It seems a shame he's so much remembered for this rather ordinary movie rather than some other far better movies he's made - that one about the man going up the hill and coming down the mountain is quite one of his best. Another aspect of the charisma or lack of it is the curiosity that Andie McDowell had far better charisma with the Scot she marries earlier in the story after rejecting Charles. It was impossible to imagine why she'd leave the guy after those tender glances in the wedding scenes and go rushing back to Charles - she even looks as though really she can't make out why she's left the Scot for Charles and Charles doesn't seem all that sure why he's got her back. Whilst I doubt this movie could ever, for me, reach the heights because of the other themes often overwhelming it, a different leading lady (or a different leading man) would have helped.This is not meant as a criticism of Grant or McDowell. As I said, they put their hearts into it and are both delightful on screen. It's just they don't have anything that special together. I think the casting people are at fault. They didn't make sure the two actors would have that essential on-screen charisma that could give this relationship the poignancy it deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super-successful Britsnob comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Grant's kingmaker film. The very acme of scrummy, dithering Englishness, as seen by all people foreign, Grant triumphs in this romantic comedy with a little help from writer Richard Curtis, who, in his pomp, didn't do too badly off it either.The great masterstroke of the treatment is giving the hapless Anglian prig enough credibility for people to really like him. Consequently Four Weddings And A Funeral could more instructively be called Five Friends and a Brit for the Nineties, because it is out of this (first-class) ensemble that the modern man-boy Charles thrives. On one side are the posh people of old, James Fleet and Kristin Scott-Thomas, bumbling and bitter like blue-blood siblings from dramas a century before. On the other, Britpop - the late Charlotte Coleman as Scarlett - and cuddly homosexuality with John Hannah and John Bull himself (making sure that all this cool Britannia doesn't take itself too seriously), Simon Callow. Charles wants to be neither one nor the other but is clearly both and this elastic, endearing indecisiveness means he gets everything wrong and is thus utterly charming. All Andie McDowell has to do is look perplexed (as well she might) to offset this psychological farce.It's a Third Way drama which mapped the social change in this country that became a political reality three years later, launched a dozen careers and made us laugh without the guilt that later Curtis concoctions brew. Unique. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A British film with an American ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of analyzing people in their social environment and what better occasions than weddings or funerals that provide an atmosphere for people to mingle,and share their joys or sorrows,is entertaining and wise.It is interesting that the factors that indicate the time in which the story takes place(mostly in interiors and gardens)are mostly through the dialogues, for the formal way in which people,especially the British, dress doesn't reveal the era, it is through the dialogues and mentioning some contemporary Names that make one realize that it's in nineties. And suddenly,in this overall British surroundings appears Carrie(Andie MacDowell) dressed not much differently but an American.A woman that despite her coldness and indecisiveness and also poorly played by Mac Dowell is able to take away Charles's(Hugh Grant) heart,despite his being surrounded and loved by many native girls,even more interesting than her.Through the whole film one wants to find out why her and why an American.While Charles manages to skip the traps and stands in the corner as the best man or witness to his friends's weddings,others make use of the occasions and form relationships,one of the girls even learns the sign language in order to communicate with Charles'deaf brother.But all his hesitation and avoidance take in to Carrie who just keeps on putting him in awkward positions one after another,by the not funny jokes she makes about them tying the knot,and while she marries a Scottish guy "three times her age" and Charles watches with dignity surrounded by men in skirts,and the worst when she shows up in his wedding to his former girlfriend,a neurotic girl who can put off any guy from contemplating marriage.Beside the unconvincing interest of Charles towards Carrie and paleness of Carries character,and their dull conversations,there are so many joyful moments in the film;dialogues are so witty and clever,like for example"Bride or groom?"a question to which the answer not only indicates the relation of the girl guest to the bride,but also provides an answer to what Tom(James Fleet) was looking for,his match,which unfortunately one can't say in Charles's case.Although there are so many Hollywood films with great happy endings,this American girl fails to fulfill her mission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Film With A Major Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Weddings and a Funeral is funny (hilariously at times), touching, enjoyable and entertaining...but it has a major flaw which brings it right back down to earth.The flaw lies in Andie MacDowell's performance. Her character is neither believable or, probably more importantly, likable. I can see Hugh Grant falling in love, but not with her, she seems shallow and just another "pretty face".Apart from this gripe, the film itself is good. The supporting cast are excellent, especially John Hannah in my opinion.Overall 8 out of 10...when it could so easily have been 9, or even 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Comedy About Commitment I Know Of; Charming and Humorous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and a Funeral" belongs, with its characters, obsessions, wry humor, Establishment bashing, music, attitudes and scenes to the 1970s. It was not made until 1994 .The story appears from the outset to be about young people obsessed with sex, love and finding their way in a bewildering society of expectations but few responsibilities. We begin and end the film without knowing what anyone does for a living, except Hamish (the unfortunate choice of the heroine as a first husband). But we come to know all the characters through their attitudes toward love, which is the fact that I suggest accounts for their unusual memorability, even where one cannot keep so many similar characters clearly separated in the mind. Mike Newell directed what had to be a hellishly-difficult series of similar but differing weddings, social gathering rooms, ceremonies, conversations, traffic adventures and interiors; so the remarkable achievement was his, to me, as well as that of the producers, production designer Maggie Gray and cinematographer Mike Coulter; because despite this multiplicity of scenes, hundreds of costumes and indoor and outdoor challenges, the film looks remarkably of a piece. Tim Bevan is the credited producer, and wonderfully appropriate music was provided by Richard Rodney Bennett. Set Decorator Anna Pinnock and costume designer Lindy Hemming also earned high accolades for making every scene look real and interesting at the same time. From makeup and hair stylings to lighting and set dressings, this film, I claim, is a low-budget triumph. The complex script by Richard Curtis is filled with charming comedic moments, one liners, revealing statements and reactions. As the hero, a man struggling toward commitment, Hugh Grant has what I regard as his best early role, opposite Andie MacDowell, who does well with her part also. Kristin Scott Thomas, Simon Callow, John Hannah, James Fleet and David Bower all are given winning moments. Pert Charlotte Coleman is a scene stealer, as are Rowan Atkinson as a novice minister, Simon Kunz, Kenneth Griffith as the mad old man, David Haig, Sophie Thompson, Timothy Walker, Sarah Crowe, and Anna Chancellor as Henrietta. Among the film's many highlights are Hugh Grant's speech as the best man at Wedding One, the eulogy for Gareth at the funeral, and the mad dashes Grant and his sister make when they are late for nearly every event. The theme of the film--that commitment to the right person is harder than it looks and a bit scary but necessary is enacted here in a plot that interweaves more than a dozen young people's lives. But it is the change in the hero, played by Hugh Grant, and Carrie, portrayed by Andie Macdowell, that are the vital center of the piece. Watch also for the charming still-photo montage at the ending, complete with Princess Diana and a Labrador Retriever. This is a film I find to to be feckless, charming, interesting, very funny, filled with visible and audial bits, put-down lines and involving confrontations, agreements and conversations about commitment. I judge this to be a very watchable comedy, one with a suitable ending, and a film that will bear repeated viewings. It is a screwball comedy decades after such films were thought to be improbable, but it has genuinely touching and off-the-wall moments mixed into a good-hearted melange of friendships and rivalries. Recommended highly--for its near-unimportance and for its importantly triumphant realization on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wet Wet Wet's Love Is All Around - not actually in the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't get round to seeing this movie until about 3 or 4 months after it was released, by which time the song from the film (Love Is All Around, performed by Wet Wet Wet) had been at the top of the charts for fifteen weeks until I understand the band requested that their record company deleted the single because they had had enough of performing it and promoting it. I had assumed that because of the longevity of the song in the pop charts, and because of all the tremendous hype surrounding the song, that the it would play a significant part in the story. However I was totally surprised to see that the Wet Wet Wet song isn't used anywhere in the movie at all! I watched it all the way through (and enjoyed it very much) but I keeped waiting for the familiar strains of Marti Pellow's voice signing THAT song but it never came. The nearest we got was an amateur version sung at one of the weddings by a cabaret band but it was not the Wet Wet Wet version. I was about to leave the cinema when right at the end of the end title sequence it suddenly faded in after Elton John's cover of Going To The Chapel. Am I missing something here? Is it really possible that the record-buying public took this song to their hearts (making it the biggest-selling single of all time) and associated it with the movie on the strength of it being very clumsily spliced on the end of the end titles? Incredible! It's almost as though the producers needed a last song to include on the soundtrack album to make up the numbers, or they realised that there weren't enough ballads in the soundtrack of what was obviously a love story and so persuaded Wet Wet Wet to record it and then spliced it onto the titles almost as an afterthought because there was nowhere else for it to go. If this is true then I suppose it shows how powerful the movie was because cinema audiences obviously must have stayed to watch it to the very end of the end titles (which is unusual), and so caught THE song. But perhaps what is even more odd is that after the huge success of the song the director wasn't tempted to re-edit the movie to include at lease a snatch of the Wet Wet Wet song at some significant point. As the song says - 'Come on and let it show'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-written movie to cherish again and again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie again recently on TV, and I fell in love with it all over again. Grant is charm and humor personified; Scott Thomas is hilarious and poignant, too; and John Hannah's funeral oration is again the dramatic highlight. I liked Andie MacDowell much better than when I first saw it; Initially, I thought she was a bit too old for Grant; now I appreciate the subtleties in her approach and appearance. I love David Bower as John, Charles' hearing-impaired brother. I agree with John Hannah's character that he is a dish. Angus, too, appeals to me. What a lovely movie. I could see it again and again and still laugh again and again. And hooray for Rowan Atkinson in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Goat (oops, he means the Holy Spigot).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen as one of the classics in the British romantic comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fine romantic comedy with Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell and Kristin Scott Thomas. This movies is seen as one of the classics in the British romantic comedies. It's not bad, it's good, funny and entertaining. I liked seeing it. The story is good, fine characters and there are several amusing moments in this movie. Maybe a little overrated at the BAFTA's. "Four weddings and a funeral" was nominated for 11 BAFTA's and won 4 of them. The British were wrong by seeing Hugh Grant's performance (although he is pretty good) superior to Tom Hanks' performance in "Forrest Gump". You can't deny the fact that they were wrong by doing this.Furthermore I also think that "Nothing Hill" and "About a boy" (two other romantic comedies, both starring Hugh Grant) are much better. So if you would like to see a British romantic comedy, i would advice you to see one of these. "About a boy" was one of the best Hugh Grant-movies I have ever seen (but I haven't seen "Love Actually" yet)."Four Weddings and a Funeral" is a fine and entertaining movie with good performances, although the movie may be a little overrated. 7,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in its genre that should be seen by all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and a Funeral" is seen as the first of many romantic comedies and personally I have to say that this is still one of the best. While many other movies in this genre always use the magic formula of 'boy meets girl, boy and girl hate each other, something stupid happens, they start to like each other and fall in love...', this movie has been built up much better and smarter.In "Four Weddings and a Funeral" we follow Charles (Hugh Grant) and his friends. Most of them find a partner and get married, but Charles is still single. But than he meets Carrie during one of these weddings and immediately he falls in love with her. The only problem is that she is an American and that she will fly back to the USA after the wedding. Later he sees her again, only to find out that she is about to marry an older, but very rich man. His world collapses and he decides to give her up and to find someone else. But his love for her is deeper than he thought and he just can't forget about her...I guess this would be an excellent movie for everybody who could use some laughter in his or her life. And it has to be said: the refined, very British humor is certainly a relief after having seen too many examples of the average Hollywood comedy, full of toilet humor (vomitting, farting, ... aren't exactly my idea of humor). The story is very nice and most of the acting is very good, but especially Rowan Atkinson, as the clumsy priest, is absolutely hilarious. The other actors all did a very good job as well, except for Andie MacDowell, who never really seems to get into her role. In my opinion she was the weakest link in this movie.In the end this is still one of the finest romantic comedies I've ever seen and personally I think this movie should be seen by everybody, since it is a classic in its genre. I give it an 8/10</fullReview>

I think this movie is a really good choice for anyone who enjoys a good romantic comedy. The movie follows Hugh Grant's character as he stumbles through various weddings with often hilarious results. His group of friends (particularly Simon Callow) add to this humor and Andie MacDowell gives the movie a romantic charm as she is Grant's love interest. Although MacDowell's alleged sex life in the movie is completely unbelievable, this can either be ignored or seen as humorous. Overall I would give this movie an 8 or a 9. It is one of my personal favorites.Watch it! You won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very funny film, with hidden depths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is said that if you need to explain a joke then it can no longer be funny. So the compulsion to explain why I think that `Four Weddings and a Funeral' is much more than just a very funny film is rather risky. But I believe that the movie is an example of a work of art that can be enjoyed at many levels. Enjoy it, certainly, as witty, very well acted, moving and engaging. But I would argue that it has a deeper quality ? especially its ability to challenge prejudice and its touching belief in the ultimate decentness of people ? and in the power of love. Love is the central theme of all three of Richard Curtis's major films (`Four Weddings?'; `Notting Hill' and `Love Actually'). Curtis's credo is `amor vincit omnia' ? although in ultimately conquering love may slip along the way. In `Four Weddings and a Funeral' the risks to love's happy resolution are all revealed and (mostly) conquered. Shortly before he dies at the Scottish wedding Gareth says `A toast before we go into battle. True love ? in whatever shape or form it may come ? may we all in our dotage be proud to say ?I was adored once too'; and Carrie (the bride) quotes John Lennon in her speech - `Love is the answer'.Described in this way the risk of such a critique is that we navigate close to romantic novel territory. But Four Weddings never strays across this sentimental border. The ultimately happy ending (not just for Carrie and Charles but for all the characters in the photo montage over the credits) is only possible for Charles when, having at last declared his love for Carrie `I've loved you from the first second I met you', then asks her if `after we've spent lots of time together you might agree?not to marry me?'. No more weddings ? but an agreement to spend the rest of their life together. And so it was (of course) with Gareth and Matthew - the relationship described by Charles at Gareth's funeral as the `perfect match'. Such a match can only be destroyed by death as Matthew acknowledges in his quote from Auden at the funeral `I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong'The connection (or not) between love and sex is also addressed throughout the film. The unspoken sub-text of Carrie's slightly shocking revelation to Charles that she has had thirty-three lovers is that she didn't actually love any of them (including, as it turns out, the one she is about to marry). And Scarlett says `?most of the blokes I fancy think I'm stupid and pointless, so they just bonk me and leave me.' Charles is like this in Henrietta's description of him as a `serial monogamist' who will `never really love anyone, because you never let them near you.' Implied strongly here is the modern reality that sex (as an enjoyable pastime) can be decoupled from sex (as an expression of love). There is however the (moral?) suggestion that if you combine love with sex then that will be the best of all worlds. Whilst Bernard and Lydia reach the height of sexual passion together (and Charles crouches in a nearby cupboard) he says `Oh I love my wife' to which she replies `I?love?my?husband!'The central theme of the film is really that love takes many forms. Platonic (Charles and Scarlett; Tom and his dog Jilly?) unrequited (Fiona for Charles); Single sex (Gareth and Matthew); hard work (Shy Serena and deaf David) and (crucially) the love that binds a group of true friends together. The film is not judgemental ? other than to expose the crass (George, who asks `what use are the novels of Wordsworth') and the boring (John, the `38 going on 60 stockbroker').That the pursuit of love leaves casualties along the way is an explicit part of the film. Fiona's hopeless love for Charles, Henrietta's rejection by Charles at the altar; the failure of Carrie and Hamish's marriage (despite his confident statement at the wedding that his life with her would be a `joyful one, for years and years to come') are examples. But despite the wounds there is a moral message here as well ? that living a lie or deluding yourself that there is love when really it is only lust, or convenience or habit is undesirable. You can be as indecisive as Charles; as dim as Tom; as scatty as Scarlett as randy as Lydia; as intellectually brutal and honest as Fiona ? none of this matters if, in the end, your heart rules your head and you allow true love to triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A British masterpiece that proves that Hugh Grant is the best at playing the romantic hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie meant for all of the Americans who are tired of seeing a romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts or an action flick with Bruce Willis, Four Wedding's and a Funeral brings back my nostalgia for British comedy. Reminding me of those delightful BBC sitcoms Faulty Towers, Fine Romance, and As Time Goes By this film enchants on all levels and shows a British perspective on the oh so tired romantic comedy genre.  Hugh Grant is at his finest in the role as the romantic lead and Andie McDowell delights as his American love interest Carrie. Hugh Grant may have run into the problem of typecasting himself for an eternity as the romantic hero but who can fault him for that? His amazing eyes and playboy hair make him perfect for these roles and I'd rather fall in love anyday with Hugh Grant than that American romantic zero Tom Hanks in Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. Andie McDowell also has good chemistry with Grant and proves that Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and Notting Hill is nothing more than a name that somehow merits big paychecks. Her Carrie is a fairly quiet but obviously intelligent and witty woman who knows what she wants and goes after it.  Four Weddings and a Funeral is truly the first romantic epic since the over-rated Doctor Zhivago and you get the feeling that the makers of the film could have stretched out the fun at least a half-hour more. There is never a dull moment and it remains a fun foreign flick without the sub-titles that typically annoy. And if you need ideas for your wedding day there are all of four weddings to help you choose a dress and food for the reception. Rent this with your husband! 9/10 (The Best Romantic Comedy Ever)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised that so many comments have written off this classic British film as either boring or over-rated. Possibly the subtle humour and romance of this film have been missed by an audience for whom the film wasn't really written. The difference between Four Weddings and the next Curtis/Grant collaboration, Notting Hill, is that whilst the latter was clearly made with a transatlantic audience in mind, this film is English through and through.It's brilliance lies mostly in it's throw-away humour, rather than big one-liners. Some have remarked that the only good bit is Rowan Atkinson as a Mr Bean-esque catholic priest, but his brief scene seems plucked from another movie, and is from a wholly different British school of comedy. This film succeeds by (mostly) staying away from the carry-on tradition of bawdy farce, and instead following a more realistic well-rounded path. It is true that the setting is not the England of the masses, but then one of Charles's friends is introduced early on as the seventh richest man in the country, so that is fair enough, especially since most modern British films seem to be set in northern mining villages or on rundown council estates!Yes, McDowell doesn't have much to do except look pretty in a hat; and yes, Hugh Grant plays himself - but both fit their parts perfectly, so fair play to the casting director. Apart from that all the characters in a fine support ensemble are well drawn and believable, without ever detracting from a wonderful central romance.If you want brash humour, you won't find it. Neither will you find gritty social realism. But if you want a well written, understated romantic comedy of the highest class, look no further - you've found your perfect match.</fullReview>

Everyone is dumping on her acting, but Andie Macdowell is just not attractive. If you're suffering from sleep deprivation, pop this one in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this movie was not as successful as its supposedly follow up - Notting Hill, less enjoyable and too romantic. Grossly unfair Four Weddings... didn't achieve as much praise as Notting Hill.Anyway, I like Four Weddings... a lot. Hugh Grant is so hilarious and Andie MacDowell is as good and cute as ever. I dig all the weddings scenes, especially the one with Rowan Atkinson on it. I enjoy how many times he fails to say the right word. And Hugh Grant's speech is good as well. The end is sweet, though a little predictable.Nine out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm actually confused when I need to say what I feel and think about "Four weddings...". Of course, she's a pretty picture. But forgive me to say that the end came rather as a shock to me. (I'm not in a mood to add a spoiler, so I'd better stop here) Hugh Grant was - as usual - funny and Andie McDowell (is that correct???)did a fine job. Though they were the most important throughout the movie, I did prefer John Hannah and Kirsten Scott-Thomas. Oh, and the scene with Rowan Atkinson - second wedding - is hilarious. You should see this movie, it's quite a mess sometimes and I think 7,5/10 should be enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie at least 4 times and it keeps getting better. If you want to know what England is like, pay attention to the first wedding: the terrible hats, the congregation tentatively warbling "Jerusalem", the happy couple's complete inability to dance. A few reservations tho: Rowan Atkinson is wasted as the vicar who gets the service wrong (very simple gag over prolonged) and Simon Callow's Gareth is totally unconvincing, especially when he does 'Scottish' dancing at Carrie's wedding. I've got used to Andie McDowell. Perhaps it's reverse Liz Hurley syndrome. Many US films star British actresses who are pretty but can't act at all - I wonder if speaking in a British accent counts as acting where you are? I wonder if we think Andie is acting cos she talks like a Yank? (Sorry, Liz.) xxxxxx x</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfectly cast, expertly written and exquisitely looking British comedy. Hugh Grant has often tried to emulate but never matched the charm he showed as the architypal upper-middle-class, floppy haired, fumbling Englishman that is Charles. He may steel the show but the supporting cast are all equally spot on.It was the highest grossing film of 1994 in its native country, and it cleverly manipulated the American market too! The film is essentially a cleverly disguised costume drama dressed up as a modern day romantic comedy. It actually is as far removed as being a typical slice of contemporary British life as any Austen period drama.However, for all it's superficiality, it's far more enjoyable escapism than its patronising predecessor 'Notting Hill'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely, simply lovely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has become my all-time favourite romantic comedy, beating out even "Sleepless in Seattle". The script is wonderfully witty and all of the actors (Andie MacDowell excluded) are a joy to watch. MacDowell seems incredibly out of place here, however, and I believe that her part could have been portrayed much better. Hers was the only character that I had a difficult time empathizing in any way with, although I tried. She seems very stand-offish, and almost sleepwalks throughout the movie. Hugh Grant, on the other hand, plays this role so naturally, I wouldn't be surprised if he was just playing himself (and from what I've read, he probably was). The true kudos for this movie, however, belongs to the scriptwriter, who had the presence of mind to include a deaf character who actually contributes something to the movie other than a "humorous" minority. David is a true, natural character, who has the ability to love, laugh, joke, and express himself without needing some stupid sight gag, like having him walk into a bus because he can't hear the horn or something. You actually care about this character. "Ahem" Hollywood scriptwriters, please take note!!!The true gem of this movie for me had to be Simon Callow as Gareth. Rarely have I fallen in love with a character because of his love for life, his zest, his wit, and his hidden tender side (it seems hardly beside the point that his relationship is homosexual, and it works beautifully), rather than his chiselled good looks and muscular chest. How refreshing that a character such as Gareth could be so wonderfully played, when it could have so easily been turned into a campy, ridiculous charicature by many of the popular actors churning out movies today! Enjoyable to the very last scene, I laughed out loud (rare for me, especially when watching a show alone), I cried, I fell in love, and every time I watch this movie, I want to embrace my husband and never let him go.Watch this movie, and you'll fall in love all over again. It's "the definitive icebreaker"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I'd been out of town for a week in 1994, my parents told me that they'd seen "Four Weddings and a Funeral". The movie eventually got nominated for Best Picture. It didn't win, and Hugh Grant soon gained a reputation as a playboy whose repertoire consisted of eye-rollers like "Nine Months".Well, now I've seen the movie, and I can't see what motivated anyone to nominate it for Best Picture in a year that saw "Ed Wood" and "Legends of the Fall" ("The Shawshank Redemption" should've won). Yes, I know that this movie is about the development of relationships, but so what? The best character is Rowan Atkinson's bumbling priest. I am NOT impressed. Mike Newell did a far more interesting job with "Donnie Brasco" and "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire".What's with all those weird hats that English people wear at weddings?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me of a song I once wrote. It only had one word as the lyrics and that word was the same as the title, "Marijuana." The word was purposely pronounced incorrectly to sound like "Marriage you wanna?". The idea of the song was to take a swipe at marriage by comparing it to the quick high and long thereafter of a good toke. This film seems to take the same opinion on the subject.We see the silly celebrations taking place in an attempt at formality. Usually something goes wrong or something embarrassing happens at the time. This leaves a kind of skepticism about the holiness and correctness of marriage. This idea comes out more firmly when the main character asks his love to not marry him under and circumstances. She ironically replies, "I do".The film has some funny scenes in it, and it was quite watchable. I would recommend it for those that like to relive past experiences at weddings or other social occasions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be considered the definitive romantic comedy of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles (Hugh Grant) is set to be best man at the wedding of a close friend, Angus. He gets up very late on the day of the nuptials and nearly misses the wedding. Thank goodness he didn't, for he meets a very attractive lady named Carrie (Andie McDowell) and ends up spending the night with her at a hotel. Although she teases him the next morning about becoming engaged, she leaves quickly and without giving him any contact information. Fortunately, another twosome met at the same wedding and have their own ceremony a few weeks later. There, Charles again meets Carrie and he is thrilled. That is, until he learns she is engaged to a major pain-in-the-butt named Hamish. Horrors! After a lifetime of never meeting the right person, Charles is now smitten but his love interest is committed to another. Nevertheless, Charles and Carrie have a repeat close encounter when Hamish leaves the wedding early. What can Charles do? Meanwhile, Charles's deaf brother David may be falling in love, friend Fiona may be in love with Charles himself, friend Scarlett has fallen for a Texas cowboy, and other friends and foes are dancing at other weddings. How will Charles and his pals fare in the game of love? This is a delightful film. At first glance, it is another romantic comedy. And, it delivers mightily in that respect, having several lovely and funny love stories woven into its fabric. But, it also has much more to say about friendship and about the various ways in which we show love to our fellow man or woman. Hugh Grant is outstanding in his role as Charles, a man with connections who nevertheless glides through life aimlessly until he meets Carrie. McDowell is also beautiful, humorous and touching in her role as a woman who has no trouble attracting suitors but who makes bad choices, at times. The rest of the cast, including Kristin Scott Thomas and Simon Callow, is likewise wonderful. The costumes, settings, and cinematography values are all on the upper rung of moviedom's ladder of production. In addition, the script, direction, and soundtrack are to die for. If you have never seen this film, just where have you been, on Pluto? This is in many ways the definitive romcom and it should not be missed by anyone in the known universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just wanted to add my praise for Andie McDowell's performance, which I found fine, including the very last lines. The criticism of her from other commentators strikes me more as a dislike for the way she and the director chose to portray the character, rather than an inability on her part of playing it in some different way. I also like the way the movie resolves the last wedding, which is very true to the personalities of all the characters and grows naturally from the interaction of all of them, and keeps Hugh Grant's character honorable, though flawed. Clever, unexpected, but true to character. I would give it more stars except that there were a few parts where I felt the movie was a little too contrived to get some laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopelessly Lovable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like romance movies very much. I don't find the plot lines very interesting at all. But 'Four Weddings' was different. It's not a basic love story, but rather, many different stories wound into one. There's the charming Charles, and his American love interest Carrie; there's Micheal and Gareth, the gay couple that are polar opposites of each other, but love each other all the same; there's the social boob Tom, and his sister the lovely Fiona, and an assortment of other interesting and charming characters. Rowan Atkinson has a hilarious cameo in it as well, as the incompetent priest. If there was one thing that I would change, it would be the Carrie character. Warning: she has a monotone which gets seriously annoying after a while, but is a beautiful and good actress nonetheless. Simon Callow stuns as Gareth, as does John Hannah, who gives a tear-jerking and hilarious performance as Micheal, as does Hugh Grant as Charles. Overall, a must see! I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting and a tight plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy, yes, but that word is also used for the products of Chevy Chase or Jim Carrey. Here there is no ridicule, no absurdities, just acute, humane and forgiving observation of the humour in situations arising in normal interactions - sometimes embarrassing, sometimes frivolous, sometimes tender.I always find it a pleasure to discover, at a second viewing, elements that one could not have spotted first time around because they are logically connected to something that becomes clear only later. To me it is a sign of intelligence of the director. This movie is full of such moments: looks, movements and words one can really appreciate only the second or third time around.My favourite moment: Charles saying "odd decision" to himself after having made a spur-of-the-moment choice that indeed turns out to change his life. Everyone, I think, has encountered such moments which afterwards appear to have been life-changing but are essentially arbitrary, only partially rational choices.The end of the movie isn't the strongest part, in particular Carry's "is it still raining? I hadn't noticed" doesn't ring true. I now tend to switch off after Helen knocks Charles out.Curtis played on the success of this movie a lot, but nothing comes close to the original. In particular, "Notting Hill", which many people seem to like a lot, is only a poor shadow of 4W&amp;1F.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about as close as one can get to a perfect film. The plot strikes the right balance between comedy and drama, and the acting is excellent. The film has so many solid British actors. John Hannah is one of my favorites. In addition, many of the actors for supporting-supporting-characters are still seen quite frequently in film and television. My one problem with the movie is that last bit of dialog, something along the lines of, "Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed." Gah, terrible! I wish something had been done about that. Overall, I think this is a better film than both Love Actually and Notting Hill, though Love Actually was quite good. Four Weddings and a Funeral is a classic that stands up to many viewings.

		<shortDescription>A Romantic Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have asked why I see movies at least twice (once at the theatre and on DVD). My answer is that there is at least something in most movies that demands such action be taken. Here is an example of a movie that has never lost its luster for me. From the first time I saw it, I recognized its potential, the beauty of its craftsmanship, and its many virtues. There were so many thoughts and emotions going through me, as I laughed along with an involved audience at its clever, romantic, insightful, and moving screenplay. There was a movie that wasn't afraid to share its emotions with the audience in a way that "Annie Hall" didn't. It had a brain, a heart, and so much more.Part of the reason the movie succeeds so well is its incredibly talented cast: Atkinson (in a short and hilarious role), McDowell who has never looked more charming, Hugh Grant, a funny lead who carried the film in a way Cary Grant would have been proud of. The very lovely and ethereal Kristen Thomas made also quite an impression. Mike Newell's direction and Richard Curtis' collaboration/screenplay imbues everything and everybody with a magic and delicate touch that remains constant and very effective throughout the entire project.As most people know by now, the film follows the romantic adventures and mishaps of a bachelor who finally finds the woman of his dreams; only to discover she might be beyond his reach. They continue to see each other through a few weddings and ultimately realize they might just be perfect for each other. What makes their relationship a joy to watch is how well defined their characters are. They are real people with flaws, hopes, broken hearts, mistrust, envy, illusions, and dreams. The film entertains and yet it never takes the easy way out to solve their dilemmas. There are bits when one wonders why one is not repelled by some of their actions, then the audience realizes that they are reflections of themselves.There is much to commando in the film, from its romantic score, the gorgeous photography, the superb acting, and most importantly, the assured hand by Mike Newell who adds another gold star to his repertoire. The film is a classic for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Weddings and a Funeral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From BAFTA nominated director Mike Newell, and Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Blackadder writer Richard Curtis comes this excellent all-star cast romantic comedy. Basically the story follows Charles (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Hugh Grant) and his friends, Tom (James Fleet), Gareth (BAFTA nominated Simon Callow), Matthew (BAFTA nominated John Hannah), Fiona (BAFTA winning Kristin Scott Thomas), Scarlett (Worzel Gummidge's BAFTA nominated Charlotte Coleman, and deaf brother David (David Bower) as they repeatedly meet at weddings, and try to find their perfect partners. At wedding one for Angus (Timothy Walker) and Laura (Sara Crowe), Charles is smitten by the attractive American, Carrie (Golden Globe nominated Andie MacDowell), and they sleep together. After wedding two for Bernard (David Haig) and Lydia (Sophie Thompson), performed by inexperienced vicar Father Gerald (Rowan Atkinson), Charles starts to develop stronger feelings and she tells about all her sex exploits, but she is engaged to Hamish (Corin Redgrave). Wedding three is the one that crushes Charles, Carrie and Hamish, and he didn't interfear. It is also there that Gareth dies (heart attack), and soon after everyone is gathered at the funeral, and Gareth's close friend Matthew is tearfully reading a poem to express his feelings. Eventually, the fourth wedding comes along, it is Charles and Henrietta/"Duckface" (Anna Chancellor), but Charles will be shattered and embarrassed when Carrie shows up and says she has now left Hamish, and he eventually ends the wedding with the 'punch'. There is the happy ending though, not just for Charles and Carrie, but there are also flashes of photographs from following weddings for the other characters. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and the David Lean Award for Direction for Mike Newell, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Richard Rodney Bennett, Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. Hugh Grant was number 73 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 8 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Kristin Scott Thomas was number 22 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, the film was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the funeral, it was number 75 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 36 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest British Films, and it was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Films.

The ending was very disappointing and frustrating!Now I have to find a way to get rid of the DVD!I don't know how this movie is rated 7, I guess it might have been a bit more interesting in the older days. The story of the movie is about true love but it wasn't a very good way of showing it to the audiences (in my opinion) since it brings a lot of bad behaviors to the screen and make it looks like that it's OK but it's actually not. I was left disgusted, disappointed and angry after watching the movie, I don't think a comedy movie should make you feel that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no problem with the movie but I am at a losss to explain the HYPE of the movie. I saw it not that long ago and for many years now have heard how it's great, one of the best romantic comedies etc etc. Not that I hated it and I think it is a bit more original then many of this genre but I wouldn't call this the best romantic comedy ever made.For me two negatives-I do not think the two leads had chemistry for one. And two, I didn't like High Grant in this role as much as some of his others. I would give this an easy 6 but not neccessarily a 10. I think I was spoiled from the overhype, from what I heard this was a classic and I did not feel that way. Still, it's original, sometimes funny and had a good cast. 6 or 6. 5 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good beginning, nice transitions but McDowell...? Who doesn't hate her? Really? Who can say that they don't even slightly utterly detest her.It wasn't bad as Romantic comedies go, anyone who knows me knows there are some days i just want to sit and smile, Four Weddings and Funeral satisfied me up to a point but Mc Dowells character was evil there isn't much to smile at when it comes to the ending.As i said, good beginning, good opening line, won't say what it is, i'm not allowed to swear. But The first groan has to come when Hugh Grant starts talking, properly talking. He can act up to a point can't he? But he only really knows one character. Yes, he's good at smiling, brushing back his hair and laughing nervously but not much else. If what your looking for is a typical Grant character you won't be disappointed.but i'm afraid i started to lose interest when he started falling for McDowell's character who's name i can't remember. The whole thing goes downhill from there as you start to wonder what the point is, we all know he'll end up with her in the end which is something you can only groan at so why bother seeing it through.I wanted to know who was going to die but after that i thought i'd probably switch over. I was disappointed when it turned out to be Callow whose character i'd actually taken quite a liking to. But i had to watch it to the end anyway, I wanted to see what became of some of the minor and far more likable characters.I was quite please when he was about to marry that weird one whose name i also can't remember. Then McDowell turns up at his wedding to take him away, evil!!! How can he like her? why??? She's just... evil! The ending was everything i expected and less. Less because of that awful line i used in the title. Who wouldn't cringe at that? It's almost as bad as 'sophie, your hairs the colour of starlight' (quote from 'Howl's Moving Castle' (film, not book, book is brilliant, read the book).

		<fullReview>Okay. There's something I have to say about this movie, and I feel it's pretty simple. Andie MacDowell is so bad at acting I found myself wishing they WOULDN'T get together. We basically are never shown anything interesting about her character except two points: She isn't faithful to her fiance, and she apparently isn't very interested in Hugh's character Charles. So why do we want them to get together? I didn't.On the other hand, the movie is really quite funny and while the whole romantic ending thing left the taste of something horrible in my mouth, I enjoyed the beginning. All the brits are very fine actors and their part of the script is quite decent. But if there are any casting directors out there, please PLEASE stop hiring Andie Macdowell.

		<fullReview>I tend to like movies that Hugh Grant is is and I had been looking forward to seeing this movie. I'm glad I did, but it's not quite what I was expecting .... save the first hour. That's when this movie shines, brilliant gags and wit told in understated British fashion. The movie is worth watching for that alone.The story is basically about a group of British friends (men/women) who find themselves having to attend weddings frequently ... and then start to ponder their own marital status. The movie is focused on Hugh Grant's character and his fascination with a frequent American attendee (played by Andie MacDowell).Shortly after the second hour starts, it's much more of a depressing and dry drama that is not really fun or uplifting. Instead of starting to like and identify more with Grant's and MacDowell's characters, there's kind of a feeling of wanting to distance oneself from them.However, if you like Hugh Grant's style of delivering witty lines in socially awkward situations, I do recommend watching the first, say 60-70 minutes. After that, it's kind of a different movie ... not really worth watching except to find out what happens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The British certainly have a wonderful, subdued sense of humour, as shown in this latest offering from the mother country.Director Mike Newell provides us with a very funny look at the age old institution of marriage, suggesting that perhaps it's not all some would claim it to be. The dashing, and very English, Hugh Grant plays Charles, a rather disillusioned chappie who has seen many of his friends happily tie the knot, yet can't seem to find the right girl himself. Enter American Carrie (Andie McDowell), whom Charles falls head over heels for, but still can't determine to settle down with."Four Weddings and a Funeral" is mostly a light look at relationships and commitment which even manages to touch on mortality. Mike Newell does attempt to offer us more than just a comedy but really that's all the film is. "Four Weddings" never really works as a romance, and fails dramatically as well. Don't let these lesser aspects deter you however, as the comedy alone is worth your while.Never quite justifies the rave reviews it has received, however "Four Weddings" will certainly amuse anyone who has ever been involved in a wedding ceremony at any level. Rowan Atkinson's cameo is quite humorous but really doesn't belong in this picture.Sunday, June 5, 1994 - Doncaster Village Twin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This inexplicably popular piece of trite, self-indulgent garbage made the slimy Hugh Grant equally inexplicably popular. In a group of shallow characters he stars as King Shallow. Really, I found myself wondering half-way through the movie if I had anything in common with or even cared about any of these people and if indeed, I wanted to. King Shallow and his shallow friends go from one event to another, talk about things, he has a one night stand with Andie MacDowell, then a few months later she gets engaged to somebody else, he gets engaged to somebody else, then finds out she dropped her engagement and we're supposed to care whether they get together at the end. The only reason I went to see this movie in the first place is that Rowan Atkinson is billed as one of the stars. In fact, he only appears in two scenes. In one, apparently meant to be funny, he is the vicar performing one of the weddings of the title, and he uses the wrong words. I don't get it. We're told its his first wedding. Doesn't everybody know the standard vows of a wedding ceremony? The title is even misleading; there are only three weddings, a fourth winds up being aborted. The funeral of the title is that of the movie's only vaguely likeable character, who is also a complete jerk. Just before his death, he was making fun of Scottish dancing while attending a party in Scotland. A few minutes before that he was making fun of some Americans' ignorance of Britain. Gee, I've never seen that before in a British movie! How original! The high number of people who claim to like this movie must have seen a different one from me.</fullReview>

On the other hand, this may not be supposed to be a "happy ever after movie," since commitment-phobic Charles marries emotionally dead Carrie and so remains "uncommitted." McDowell may be cut some slack for her wooden performance because of a lack of preparation and perhaps the people responsible for this movie realized her behavior was that of a high functioning person with autism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Four Weddings and A Funeral" starts off as a really nice comedy but ends poorly in my opinion. I am a little surprised by the decent rating here on IMDb.POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! OK, we start off with Hugh Grants' character, Charlie. He is always late and a bit commitment-phob. He meets Carrie, an American lady with a bad reputation. They have a one night stand and Carrie leaves the next morning for America. Charlie has not stopped thinking about her for over 3 months where they have another encounter at another wedding. Unfortunately, we find out that Carrie is engaged, it's only been 3 months! Crazy, no? Well, does this stop them from having another night together? No! She gets married the next day like nothing happened and Charlie confesses his love to her. When he and his friends make a pact to get married, he goes back to his crazy Fatal Attraction type of neurotic ex. They become engaged out of no where and when Carrie comes to Charlie's wedding, she tells him that she's separated. So, the mature thing to do for Charlie, dump his bride at the alter and Carrie and Charlie live happily ever after.In my opinion, the ending was just ridicules and immoral. I wasn't too crazy about this movie. I enjoyed about 60% of the movie, but the rest was just too heart breaking.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected much much more from this movie. Hugh Grant's performance was good, and so were a few others but overall it was a disappointment, mainly because of the script and how it was rendered on screen. I had a few laughs, mostly in the beginning, but roughly halfway through the movie I felt humor has worn out. I found it difficult to empathize the characters, any of them, in fact. What's that thing with getting a kick out of someone else's embarrassment? Dry humor, you call it? Andy McDowell didn't look charming at all. She was much more believable in "Groundhog Day". Maybe playing "sluts" (as she was rightfully labeled by one of the characters in the movie) isn't her thing after all.Now don't take me wrong. It could very well be that the problem is with me, not the movie. Maybe you need to be British to fully appreciate all the jokes and allusions in the movie but I was left untouched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I admit it. I never ever saw Four Weddings and a Funeral until today, January 24th 2003 - almost 10 years since it debuted. I recall all the hype, and acclaims that this film received. Yet I never saw it, maybe it was the title, maybe it was Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell's smarmy faces on the posters. For whatever reason, I never saw it. NOW that I've seen it, all I have to ask is: "What in the bleeding -$%@#- was that?!?"While Four Weddings isn't as bad as the nauseating "Serendipity", it fails for the exact same reasons. In fact, I was looking forward to seeing Four Weddings and a Funeral after thoroughly enjoy "The Bridget Jones Diary". What a shame!First off let me say that Four Weddings starts off brisk, light and I was convinced that this movie was going to excel. But after the first 45 minutes, to an hour, the movie really starts to show it's weak points. Andie MacDowell's character, Carrie, admits to having relations with over 30 men, Hugh Grant's character Charles, being one of them. They flop into bed as easily as some people shake hands. This is somehow mistaken for 'True Love' or some such nonsense. Really though, after 31 lays, you'd think Carrie wouldn't believe in true love.The movie revolves around the namely, Four Weddings and One Funeral that takes place during the movie. For sheer entertainment, the Wedding Scenes are the highlights of the movie. Each scene features very witty visual and spoken humor that really made me laugh. I was genuinely enjoying the film. It's what happened in between the weddings that was truly putting me off. I could care less about Charles, and Carrie. She's a promiscuous slut ( a label given to her at the beginning of the movie), and he's a charming English cad, with perfect hair.My two biggest complaints were the following: (**possible spoilers**)1.) Obviously, the namesake of the movie indicates that someone dies.. and for predictablity's sake, it has to be -the- most favorable chap in the entire movie. He just keels over and dies.. at a wedding of course. Predictable, Predictable, Predictable...2.) Unlike what many people in the User Comments have labelled him as, Charles (Hugh Grant) is NOT a hero. He may be the protagonist, but he's NO hero. What he does is so utterly dispicable, that everyone of his friend's should have alienated him.Ladies, seriously, put yourself in Henrietta's place. She loves him, totally adores him, yet Charles leaves her at the altar in order to pursue another woman whom he's only been with three times. COME ON!! Get off your 'Fantasy Island' will ya?? If you had a guy friend who did that to one of your friends, you know you'd be calling him an A-Hole. What he did was SO despicable, disgusting, irresponsible, self-centered, and shallow that Charles should of been burned at the stake. He was with Henrietta for 10 months, a woman who had not wronged anyone, who admitted that as long as she loved Charles, no one else would stand a chance. Yet she is cast aside by Charles,to pursue what could only be a fantasy.Just like the vacuous, bowl-of-pus that is John Cusack's "Serendipity" this movie suffers from characters doing their own shallow deeds, in their shallow world in order to provide a moving plot.What really bothers me, is how the public is willing to swallow this crap and not realize, that if they'd put one moment of thought into watching their movies they'd realize how moronic these characters are. That the actions they commit are not harmless.Perhaps if critics like Roger Ebert were a little more consistant in their reviews, and see the real cracks in the pavement of a movie like this instead of glossing over it and giving it three and a half stars, perhaps better movies would get the attention they deserve.</fullReview>

We particularly follow Hugh Grant's character, Charles, as he goes from event to event. Along the way we meet and get to know a bunch of his companions, most notably Carrie (Andie MacDowell), whom he meets at the first wedding. Carrie is a complicated American woman, who after initial interest starts to pretty much torment old Charles. But Charles is in love and desperately wants things to work out? Will they or won't they? See it and find out.There's plenty of decent cameo's and some good laughs, the best scene when Charles translates for his deaf brother.

All are amiable, likable and have the majority of the good lines, with the remainder going to James Fleet, which bearing in mind that none of these are the lead two characters is a major problem. Ultimately as I watch this I can't help but feel it is a movie made to support the American view of what the English/British are like. Living in this country for my entire life I can safely say it's not true.This film falls as it's function as a romantic comedy is made impossible by two leads that seem incapable of convincing the audience of any passion between them. If you're after a good Britsh film then "About a Boy", "Billy Elliot" and "The Full Monty" are the ones to watch. is merely a stepping stone on the way to some of the best films this country has made in years</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles (Hugh Grant) keeps attending friends' weddings one after the other. He realizes he's the only one not getting married--because he can't commit. Then he meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at one of the weddings and falls immediately in love...but does she love him and can he overcome his fear of commitment?I remember loving this in 1994--but it doesn't hold up 14 years later. It has its definite good points--two of Charles' friends are a gay couple and are presented very matter of factly with no big fuss; it LOOKS beautiful; the cast is as good as they can be and there are some solid laughs. But it doesn't really work. For starters we know nothing about these characters--heck Charles isn't even given a last name! We don't even find out the name of one of his friends till halfway through the movie. They're just stock characters. Also the movie is too long and slow--it needed tightening up.The acting is as good as it could be. Simon Callow is fun as Gareth and David Bower is drop dead handsome and good but talented actors like Kristen Scott Thomas are left with nothing to work with. Grant does wonders with his under-written role--he's utterly charming and likable. Unfortunately MacDowell doesn't match him but she's incredibly beautiful--Grants obsession with her is understandable.Also this ends with a bunch of happy endings that strain credibility (even for a romantic comedy). But this film was a huge hit and made Grant a star so use your own judgment. Also be aware of the R rating--there's tons of swearing and VERY frank sexual dialogue. Don't let the kids see this one.I can only give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was incredibly disappointed with this movie. I was expecting it to be a lovable romantic comedy, but instead it made me sick. And not at all because it was too sappy, which many romantic comedies are, but because of its lack of any sort of real romance. Of course Hugh Grant was wonderfully funny, but his leading lady, the actress that played his love interest Carrie desperately lacked in depth-showing absolutely no substance or emotion in her role. I hated her character (perhaps more than any other character) in how she seemed fickle in her approach towards men and life, and in the way she toyed with Charley's heart throughout the entire movie-disgarding him casually everytime. But of course Charley's character was more the fool at the end. The comedy though was enjoyable and the interesting mix of characters made it even more funny. I wonder though, of course whether or not Carrie ever did love Charley or just need desperatly to get married to someone that loved her. The movie's portrayal of marriage seemed a big joke- either as a commodity or a stepping stone in life to get over with- if that was intentional they did a good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Start That Quickly Disappears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a pretty strong start. The first of the four weddings referred to in the title was a very funny affair, and seemed to be setting the stage for a very funny movie populated by a variety of memorable characters. Unfortunately, most of the fun and enjoyable parts of the movie seemed to be packed into that first wedding. From that point on, the movie became increasingly less enjoyable, mirroring the fact that as the movie went on, the two leads (Charles and Carrie, played by Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell) became increasingly less likable.Charles is a guy who is terrified of commitment, not being able to imagine himself getting married. Not surprisingly, then, when he meets Carrie and falls head over heels in love with her, he's decided that he wants to make a commitment to a woman who can't make a commitment to him because she's already engaged to someone else. There's some classic psychological stuff going on there; Charles in some ways is a great case study for relationship counsellors! He bumbles his way through the movie, causing deep pain to at least one woman by both his inability to commit and his inability to admit that he can't commit, all the while pining away for Carrie. She, on the other hand, has essentially the same problem with commitment. In a conversation with Charles she goes one by one through the 33 men she's slept with in her life. He's #32, the most interesting points being that their first tryst came within a few hours of their meeting and just before she returned to the US (a shallow and likely one-night stand in other words) with their unexpected second coming not long after she tells him that she's become engaged to #33 (and had no intention of giving up #33, whom she didn't love, for a guy she supposedly felt some connection with). Neither Carrie nor Charles are likable characters, although Grant and McDowell weren't bad from a performance perspective, Grant I thought being the better of the two.All the way through this, you know that ultimately these two are going to end up together, and equally all the way through this you hope that they don't, because (a) it's just too easy and obvious, and (b) you really don't want these two, who've toyed with and hurt so many others, to find happiness together. Then, in the end, when they do get together, you do find yourself wondering how these two - both with a classic phobia about commitment - can possibly even think about hooking up. The reality is that aside from the first wedding this movie lacks both fun and sympathetic characters. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK when a comedy, atrocious as a romantic drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 12/23/2006 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mike Newell): OK when a comedy, atrocious as a romantic drama. Hugh Grant is fine as the reluctant bachelor who attends many of his friends and relatives weddings without ever having his own and not really expecting it, in fact. He falls for an American at the first wedding he attends, played horribly by Andie Macdowell, and hopes this might be more than just a one night fling, but at the second wedding she comes with her fiancée. Of course, that doesn't stop them from having a second encounter. What happens to them after this you'll have to watch for yourself(I don't want to give away everything). The movie is promising at first as a comedy with some laugh-out loud funny scenes during the first wedding, but by the time the 2nd wedding comes it slowly turns into a romantic melodrama that I couldn't wait to be over because I could guess what would happen every step of the way. Too sad because it could have been a very good British comedy but ended up being a mediocre romantic drama at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 hours of my life I will never get back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took a girlfriend to see this when it came out (on someone's recommendation) and had to apologise to her afterwards. It would take a long time to list all the things I hated about this film, so here are just a handful:The scene where Andi McDowell lists all 30 men she's slept with in order. As if anyone would remember thirty names in the right order off the top of their head. Every scene with Andi McDowell (a producer's decision to appeal to US as well as UK markets?) but especially the one during the downpour when Hugh Grant says they should get out of the rain, and she goes 'is it raining? I hadn't noticed,' such is the power of Hugh's love. Even the rest of the cinema audience (who for some reason seemed to love the film,) made a loud collective groan at this line.The clichéd British stereotyping.Hugh Grant in particular. Rowan Atkinson's 'Holy Goat' and 'awful wedded wife' jokes. Last time I heard those I fell off my dinosaur. The scene where Hugh tells the guy how lucky he was to have split with his wife because everyone knew she used to sleep around, only (wait for it) the guy didn't know! How funny is that! Bumbling lovable Hugh puts his foot in it again and can stutter some more. The deaf brother. Completely irrelevant to the plot, except that it he helps prove that despite his philandering ways deep down Hugh must be a good chap because he has a deaf brother and knows signing. Also because having a deaf character is one of many right-on/politically correct boxes this film seems so desperate to tick. Others include the fact that that Andi McDowell has slept with 30 men (because hey, why shouldn't a woman be able to sleep around too?) that Hugh shares a room with a girl (because hey, why can't a guy and a girl share a room without having to have sex with each other?) and that they realise eventually that the gay couple were as committed as any of them (because hey, not all gay people sleep around you know.)Oh yeah and despite the endless Time Out-friendly politics, the film still manages to remain resolutely conservative throughout in its underlying message, namely that marriage (or at least settling down) is the surest way to find lasting happiness. Not one character questions the institution in the whole film. Hugh may be afraid of commitment, but he isn't against marriage as such, and you feel sure the gay characters would have got married if they could have done. Even at the end we are told that Hugh's quirky but nice flatmate got married eventually. Thank God, or she might have ended up a spinster!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly unfunny and sour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever said this was a 'classic' comedy or that it 'set the standard for future British rom/coms' was bang out of line. This is everything a romantic comedy should not be; stereotypical, clichéd and downright vulgar and unfunny.Charles (typical Hugh Grant) is a bit of a playboy. He's late (again) for a Wedding, forgetting the ring. In a desperately unfunny scene, the ring is replaced. The part that got this film a 4 out of a 10 is quick to follow, though. One of the funniest, cleverest scenes you will see on screen; Rowan Atkinson, a gem, 'mis-pronouncing' some of the Wedding proceedings in a moment of downright hilarity.But nothing even vaguely humorous follows (save maybe the American girls 'when will we get engaged' scene) but apart from that it is crude and unfunny. No doubt critics would love it; it has all the elements of 'British Pride' in it. But a dreadfully stereotypical ending really blows this down, not that the preceding part were any better. Or Warmer.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did this movie make any money in the first place?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even Hugh Grant himself felt that this movie was awful while filming it. He was only half right: the movie was awful and he was (as always) terrible. The acting was sub-par save Rowan Atkinson in a very, very minor role (only good thing in the film I might add). The dialogue was also sub-par and down right gratuitous in its vulgarity. Only Pulp Fiction and South Park (as far as I know) use the "F" word more often than this film (the entire opening dialogue is nothing but the "F" word repeated like 30 or 40 times). My friends and I were keeping count of how many times the word was used just to keep our sanity. The story? (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD) Like everything else, it was God awful. Please tell me I didn't just waste 117 minutes of my life just to hear Hugh Grant's character go up to the woman he loves, tell her that he loves her, but I can't marry you so lets just live together...AND SHE IS OK WITH THIS!?!? You've got to be kidding me. Its not just the ending, its the whole story that drives me insane.(END OF SPOILERS)To quote Brain from Animaniacs, this whole film is "dribble unfit for lightbulb commercials."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am NOT a chick-flick basher! I LOVED Steel Magnolias. I enjoyed The Turning Point. I even laughed and hid a tear or two through Green Card, though after this exercise in boredom periodically interrupted by flashes of repugnance I plan on avoiding all future Andie McDowell offerings.The fact is that this critics' darling was a sleepy mess. The characters were self-centered snipes, the plot was razor-thin, and the aforementioned Ms. McDowell's performance should have gotten her kicked out of the actor's union.Maybe this film's purpose was to numb the senses. If so, my congratulations to its participants. Mission accomplished!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe that this movie has a user rating of 7.2 It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, filled with bland characters, crude humor, and offensive language. Even Notting Hill was not this bad ( and it certainly wasn't GOOD). Skip this unless you want something to fall asleep to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a morally bankrupt "love story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When movies like this gain the popularity that they do, I feel concerned for the moral plight of our world. I'm sure this sounds awfully preachy, but I am serious. When I watched this film, I was totally turned off by the "romance" between Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell. Think about it, folks! These two don't know each other at all. They happen to meet at a wedding and screw like weasels in heat! Then, they leave and don't see each other until the next wedding, where they once again screw like weasels. This happens several times and there is no love, no commitment--just pointless sex. I would have REALLY loved it after a while if they would have had the characters get STDs--then at least the movie would have had some point! It's ironic that the same pointless sex is exactly what the real life High Grant got himself involved in with that skanky prostitute only a few years later. Given the message movies like these make, the next ones caught with prostitutes might just be our own children--after all, the message these movies give is "do what feels good and damn the consequences".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly: Two weddings, a big chunk, a wedding, a funeral, a last big wedding &amp; a lot of little weddings (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are best when they offer a vision of a personal dream! This is the case with this one: Actually, i do my best to get past a sad relationship, and as the character, i wonder "Every people I know get married: what about me?"... The story offers an answer in a original way: love will come sooner &amp; later, and there won't be any doubts of its strength... Just meet a sweet &amp; kind person and believe in this meeting...Here the soulmate is Andie Mc Dowell: I'm always amazed by her talent... She can indeed DO WELL... She evocates sweetness, generosity like no one.But, their love only exist among their friends' ceremonies: we never know them in their daily life: at work, at home or with their family... This choice is interesting, above all the director let a large place for humor &amp; gives a distinct flavor to each event... England carries a lot of traditions, and if people can think what they want about them, they sure bring good taste....This movie has given so much positive things to the production (5 zeros checks...) &amp; its cast (the 1st success of Hugh Grant), that you can share it to: just watch it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cameo by Divine Brown would have made this BETTER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, its weird. I've always thought that if a movie is a comedy, that means it should be funny. But "Four Weddings and a Funeral" have proved me wrong on that one. Perhaps its the British brand of comedy that I just couldn't associate with but I've never been more literal when I say that I didn't laugh ONCE at anything that happened in this movie.Basically, the movie is about Huge Grant's character Charles and his relationship with women, mostly a woman he keeps bumping into at weddings. Even though it is a "romantic comedy" I found it a little ridiculous at how romanticized it was that all these characters kept meeting each other and then almost instantly falling in love with one another. That also lead to a sort of moral ambiguity. The two main characters sleep with each other the night they meet. He's been the heart breaker in a lot of failed relationship and she cheats on her finance and then divorces him shortly after the marriage (Big surprise!) and these are supposed to be the "charming" characters we're meant to root for and associate with? Aside from one or two nice scene locations I couldn't really find anything good to mention in this movie. It might be something you'd like if you're like 60 and British and have no hobbies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the disc it's burned onto...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... let alone the silver halide it has forever corrupted, for that matter. The death of film is a tragic thing, but I will be grateful for the day when that great medium is no longer tainted and insulted by endless contemporary tripe such as this.I heard about this movie because I was talking to a friend about "Death at a Funeral" and somehow he'd not heard of that one--but boy, had he heard about "Four Weddings and a Funeral." And one after another people started asking me if I'd seen the latter--and insisting that I MUST!But, why?? Why, why, why, why, WHY??Warning: do not go in expecting anything like "Death at a Funeral" or you will be deeply sorry. There are some incredible differences here:1. "Death" had impeccable black comedy timing from start to finish. All of the funny scenes in "Four Weddings" revolve around minor characters, all of whom were primarily centered around the second wedding: the desperate bridesmaid-turned-bride, her even more desperate suitor, and the newly-ordained Roman Catholic priest Father Gerald to whom falls the unfortunate task of marrying them--but while his liturgical blunders were amusing enough, by the time he got to the end of the Rite and was still screwing up every other word, I was ready to say, "Okay, Monsieur l'Abbé, let's move it along, now!" And I'm not sure I laughed once after the second reception was over. The funeral was just cheesy, and totally unnecessary--but actually, the entire film was unnecessary, so that's a petty complaint.2. "Death" had a coherent, engaging plot from start to finish. "Four Weddings" does not. The excuse, I know, will be that the story was not plot-driven but character-driven, but more on that below.3. The characters in "Death" were all real people, and all of them--even the shallow, marketable, jet-setting Gotham-dwelling novelist--burn their dignity at the stake for the sake of those they love. For a black comedy, it was surprisingly inspirational. But the characters in "Four Weddings"? Insipid, unsympathetic, promiscuous and totally implausible. A grown man lives in a flat with a young girl--and there's no scandal there?? A group of friends that seems never to have left high school? The obligatory queer couple that must factor into every romantic montage in the P.C. post-modern cinema?Charles starts out somewhat sympathetically, a seemingly nice and reserved young man who just can't seem to commit... but gradually we learn WHY he can't commit, and it's not pretty. (Also... Hugh Grant cannot act.) And Carrie? She had to be lying when she claims she's jumped over thirty men. How on Earth could anyone sleep with her once, let alone fall in love with her? From the minute I saw her at the first wedding I could see she had "b****" written all over her. (Also... if I thought GRANT couldn't act...)4. "Death" was a showcase of amazing British dramatic talent. The actors in "Four Weddings" are pathetic, mostly because of the lame story they have to work with. (The aforementioned three minor characters are the exceptions.) Clearly, the casting of Andie MacDowell was deliberately done to drive home an anti-American theme, and it worked quite well. I relish the scene where she says, "As for the rest of you (i.e., the British in the room), I'd have thought that lots of frightful Americans flying in was an excuse for staying away, so I thank you, too." You're not welcome, sweetheart. If I knew she'd be there, I would find every excuse to stay away from Scotland.This being said, the film does do a couple of things right. First, there's the theme of marriage: it's a good thing, a constant, a necessity, and Charles finally starts to realise that his eternal bachelorhood counts for little, particularly when all his friends are getting married. (Not that he's inclined to do anything productive about it, alas.) Second, I liked seeing one Low Church, one Roman Catholic, one Presbyterian and one High Church wedding... a nice showcase of the British cultural landscape. And of course anyone who knows me will not be surprised to hear that I appreciated that the only funny characters (and the ones who seemed to enjoy paying the marital debt the most) were the Catholics.Shame, however, that none of that could make up for the movie.</fullReview>
