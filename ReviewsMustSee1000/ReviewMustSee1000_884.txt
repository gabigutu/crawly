		<shortDescription>Altman's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put together a top-shelf Raymond Carver story and the last two reels of 2001 and you have a dim idea of the unique genius of Altman's 1977 masterpiece, probably the most original movie ever made within the studio system. Shelley Duvall is a practiced flirt and would-be social butterfly, oblivious to the total failure of her Donna Reed mystique, and Sissy Spacek is the childlike tag-along who idolizes her. That's all I'll say about the story, which makes turns you couldn't have guessed at in ways that can't be summarized. Humane, funny, staggeringly strange and deeply creepy, THREE WOMEN defines certain social strata and modes of interaction that you've never seen in a movie before or since--and then goes out on a mystical limb that makes the last third of APOCALYPSE NOW look prosaic. With all due respect to NASHVILLE, MCCABE and many others, Altman never made a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman's Dream Film May Give You Nightmares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Altman made a lot of films that are obscure and deserve to remain so ("Quintet"), but he also made a lot of films that are obscure but deserve to be seen, and "3 Women" is one of those. It's one of the most fascinating films Altman created, and that's really saying something from a director who was able to make even his bad films fascinating.Altman claimed that "3 Women" was inspired by a dream he had while his wife was lying ill in a hospital, and the film does indeed work on its audience the way a dream does. It resists literal interpretation, and will probably frustrate any viewer who insists upon tidiness in their movies. It communicates its messages instead through pervasive imagery and tone -- it's not "about" something as much as it's about making you FEEL something, and it does that expertly. This movie will stick in your mind and haunt you long after you've seen it.If I were forced to explain the film's plot, it would go something like this: Shelley Duvall plays Millie, a rather foolish woman who works in a geriatric physical therapy center, and whose roommate has just moved out to live with her boyfriend. Sissy Spacek plays Pinkie, newly hired at the center and put under Millie's direction. Millie is a pathetic character -- she yammers on endlessly about ridiculously trivial things (like how to make tuna melts) and doesn't realize that everyone around her either ignores her or makes fun of her. But Pinkie nevertheless becomes enamored of her and moves in with her. The third woman of the title is Willie, a reclusive artist who owns both the apartment complex in which Millie and Pinkie live, and a saloon that resembles something from a ghost town. She paints murals of strange-looking mythological creatures engaged in violent and sexual acts. These images recur throughout the film, as do images of water. Everything up to this point in the movie is dealt with in a fairly straightforward manner. But then Pinkie has an accident, and when she wakes up, she's become a different person, causing Millie's hold on reality, already tenuous, to unravel. At this point, the film becomes reminiscent of films like "Persona" and "Mulholland Drive," in which seemingly separate female characters merge into different facets of one female personality.The ending is creepy and chilling in ways that are hard to define. The whole film has violent undertones -- the lone male character in the film is a lout and vaguely predatory; all of the women at various moments seem to be holding back a barely suppressed rage. Altman uses his camera in his characteristically expert manner to shape our perceptions about what we are seeing, and he uses other parts of his mise-en-scene, like color (Millie's favorite colors are yellow and purple, and look for them in the art direction), to bring a slightly surreal quality to even the most mundane of locations.I've always thought that Shelley Duvall was an underrated actress, and she gives one of her best performances as Millie (and almost looks pretty for a change). Sissy Spacek is tremendous as well, and shows a remarkable range as Pinkie. Both of these actresses do wonderful things with tough roles, and even if we sometimes feel like we're on uneven footing because of the movie's enigmatic nature, the actresses are so assured in their parts that we can rely on them to guide us through it.Altman directed a quartet of "dream" films that all revolve around the psychological and emotional crises of women: "That Cold Day in the Park" (1969); "Images" (1972); "Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean" (1982); and "3 Women." I've not seen "That Cold Day..", but of the other three, though all of them have qualities to recommend them, "3 Women" is easily the best.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed, few movies can haunt you 20 years after you've first seen them. Not only that, even after you've seen them 20 times, still leaving you with a desire to see them again and again? 3 Women is just such a movie. From it's haunting Gerald Busby score, to Bodhi Wind's arresting murals, to the captivating performances by Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek to Robert Altman's deft writing and direction. This is a movie which will haunt you and fascinate you. I knew this movie was no ordinary movie when I seemed to be the only one in that 1977 audience who caught onto Shelley's disobedient skirt. Things began to appear slanted just off center - you just didn't know how off center they were. And that was and is the magic of this film. You never know what utter ridiculous impossibility of life will take hold of you and bring you through such a unusual journey.Even as the credits start to roll, you begin to wonder: what have I just witnessed? what does this mean? why does it leave me wanting for answers? Only after you've seen it as many times as I have do you stop asking those questions and accept all of these occurences as another window in the mind of a genius, which is Robert Altman. With all due respect to Nashville, this is his pinnacle of achievement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've wanted to see Robert Altman's "3 Women"(1977) for long time and finally saw it last night. The references to one of my all time favorites, Ingmar Bergman's "Persona" are obvious: two young women, the main characters (seemingly meek, childlike Pinky and outgoing and seemingly popular but in reality a sad loser Millie seem almost to exchange identities, or to become one in a desperate search for connection and sense of belonging but "3 Women" is memorable and haunting on its own terms. It makes you think long time after it's over. As a matter of fact, I am still thinking about it. I think that it is an incredible work of an extraordinary master. As always in his best films, Robert Altman is terrific - innovative, iconoclastic, free-spirited, unconventional, and truly original. He is a great humanist who sees through his characters but never makes fun of them and he understands them. Under his directing, Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacec gave two astonishing performances. They were both great but Duvall was a revelation. She adapted the loquacious Millie's personality and become the character. Altman had discovered Duvall at one of the malls in Texas where she was selling cosmetics and given her roles in his six films. I want also to mention the eerie music, the dreamy and uneasy atmosphere of something sinister ready to happen, the scary and mesmerizing murals on the bottom of the pool that the third woman, silent and mysterious, tired and wise Willie (Janice Rule) was painting. Altman did not try to trick or confuse me, and the story seems to be simple one but I am not sure that I understood everything, especially the enigmatic ending. Altman was aware of the effect of his movie to the viewers and in his commentary he says that he sees the film as a painting and that the audience should feel it but not understand it. In this regard it also reminds of "Un chien andalou" (1929) which was supposed to be experienced directly and not analyzed by the viewers."3 Women" is another great film by one of the best American film directors. I've never seen a bad film from Robert Altman.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman's second best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Women is an utterly fascinating film, and, by my calculations, is Altman's second best after Nashville, which few films can beat. However, whereas I am so familiar with Nashville that I am actually arrogant enough to believe I can understand it, Three Women does not inspire that sort of confidence in me. I have no clue what exactly it is about.Basically, it is one of those movies where a woman, Pinky, admires her roommate Millie so much that she wishes to emulate her in every way, apparently even trying to steal her identity. In doing so, she freaks her roommate out, as can certainly be expected. She also freaks the audience out. It isn't all just a bunch of shivering, though. This movie contains a lot of humor which can only be called 'Altmanesque.' The great irony is that Pinky's object of admire is nothing but a bag of hot air. Millie is such a loser. At the film's opening, she is training Pinky for her new job at the nursing home. To any normal person, two weeks into the job, you'd be amazed at how much a moron the person is who showed you the ropes. She brags about men whom she rejects, but all the hot dates she claims to be going on never come to fruition. Millie also overreacts to Pinky's actions, yelling at her for very petty transgressions. When Millie does something that is grossly irresponsible and morally wrong, she attacks Pinky for judging those actions. Meanwhile, Pinky is creepily reciting passages from Millie's diary with the passion of a high school drama student.Taking Ingmar Bergman's Persona as its major inspiration, around halfway through the film, after Pinky has an accident and goes into a coma, the two women begin to switch roles. Millie becomes the passive and protective roommate while Pinky becomes the aggressive vixen. Actually, Pinky becomes the mythic version of Millie. But I have purposely left out the third woman of the title. I really am not sure about her, or the climax and the ending, in which she plays a major part. Her name is Willie, a pregnant woman married to a man named Edgar (who will, through the course of the film, also sleep with both Millie and Pinky). They run a bar where Millie likes to hang out, and they also live in the same apartment complex as Millie and Pinky. Edgar is an outgoing joker, and has no problem sleeping around on his wife. Willie is mostly silent, which is why she is easy to forget in the proceedings. She paints in a Native American style all over the bar and the apartment complex. She does so seemingly because she is compelled to. She despises complements about them. Throughout the film, her paintings comment on the situation between Millie and Pinky (they're used in a masterful fashion, but the pan-and-scan version that I saw on TV (it was also edited for time and content, dag nabbit) screws this up a bit). I don't know if she serves much more of a purpose than that for most of the film.It is the ending which is especially peculiar, and it also most effectively channels Persona. Pinky has convinced Millie that she ought to have their apartment's master bedroom to herself (and Millie ought to sleep in the living room). Pinky has a surreal dream, which is punctuated by the camera's filming through a fish tank whose blue waters are undulating like a snake, in which she goes through the events of the past few months. She becomes frightened, and, much as Elisabeth Volger does in Persona, she wanders into Millie's bedroom. Here, though, she wakes Millie up, asking if she would mind sharing a bed tonight. As they try to sleep, Edgar wanders into their apartment, drunk off his rocker and spouting that Willie is giving birth all alone. Millie and Pinky race to her side. Millie tells Pinky to drive away and fetch a doctor, while she herself helps Willie deliver the child. Pinky, fascinated or frightened (she had earlier expressed fear about being pregnant herself), just stands there and stares. When the child is born, it is still. Willie cries in her bed, and Millie smacks Pinky for not getting a doctor.The next scene takes place at a restaurant where Pinky is apparently a waitress. She bizarrely refers to Millie as her mother. We find out that Edgar accidentally killed himself with his gun, but the audience suspects differently (all three women had individual scenes where they shot at targets at the bar; they also all have reason to despise him). Millie and Pinky then leave the restaurant and walk back to their house, where Willie sits on a porch swing. Pinky talks to her as if they were sisters. They appear to be living together as a family. Who else could end a film like that besides Altman? I've only lately come to notice this, but his endings are always enormously original. I just lately saw his latest film, Dr. T and the Women, which many people hated because of the ending. I cringe imagining what they would do with this one. If anyone has any ideas, please contact me. I will have to watch it again. Perhaps soon they will release it on DVD where I can watch it in its true form. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are all on the brink. Many of us have endearing qualities that are lacking in others and vice versa. Do we question ourselves or do we change drastically? Can we become better people or are we doomed with our very own dismal personality traits? These are the questions that the film, 3 Women, examines. I saw this film as a 14 year old boy with no preconceptions. It made me feel like there were imposter's as well as identity thieves among us all. I even became suspicious of people who I considered to be my allies! A truly, classic piece of cinema paranoia (in the tradition of Polanski's The Tenant). Except in this case, there is no illusion. Just one ,blatant, slap in the face after another. When you watch this film, it will literally shed it's skin and reveal something that is spookily real and very threatening, without all the supernatural riff-raff and far-fetched plot. This is a film about REAL characters and REAL development. The ending can be summed up by the scene which precedes it, in which the three women are brought together by a rather tragic incident, as this breathes new "life" into their bleak, sometimes dusty environments. "One woman became two..Two became three...3 Women became One."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Now For Something Completely Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 Women is a seriously strange mood study that plays like a languid nightmare. It is an abstract and unusual film, loaded with symbolism. The logic, if there is any, is dream logic. Everything is open to interpretation. There is no sense to be made of it so don't even try.The first half of the film is slow and aimless but things get very interesting once Pinky (brilliantly acted by Sissy Spacek) hits her head. Pinky sort of becomes Millie (Shelley Duvall) and Millie sort of becomes Pinky and they both sort of become the dream of Willie (Janice Rule) or maybe they don't. Listening to director Robert Altman's commentary on the DVD is revealing. He says that he sees the film as a painting and that the audience should feel it but not understand it. The references to Persona are obvious but while watching 3 Women I was reminded of another haunting and puzzling film- Picnic at Hanging Rock. Mysterious and deeply Freudian, 3 Women is one truly unique work so sit back and marvel at the inexplicable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Uh oh! Here comes Thoroughly Modern Millie..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playing would-be social butterfly Millie in Robert Altman's often-inscrutable "3 Women", Shelley Duvall creates an amazing, amusing, totally original character. Millie fancies herself a great caregiver at a job where others regard her as nothing; she talks about her neighbors and activities as if she's Sally Bowles, when actually nobody notices her. She's pathetic, but Duvall makes her funny and quirky (and Altman is careful not to make too much fun of her). Sissy Spacek as roommate Pinky is also fine in a less-showy, less-complex role, but her transformation in the second-half shows off her range. The film is slow but not dull, confusing but not off-putting (despite fuzzy cinematography). The one thing I really objected to was the ending, which plays like Greek tragedy mixed with Tennessee Williams. Nobody has dared to make another film like "3 Women". Altman-protégé Alan Rudolph captured some of its eccentric quality in "Welcome to L.A.", but his script wasn't clever enough. The writing here may seem simple, but this turns out to be deceptive: the dialogue is pungent with the ring of absurd truth. It took me a while to reconcile my feelings for this film. As soon as I decided how I felt about it, I couldn't wait to see it again. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman breaks form . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . which is a really good thing in this case.If you've seen other Altman films, you know that he uses a very spontaneous, documentary style that glances here and there, picking up little bits of dialog and character. He lets the story, whatever it is, evolve naturally and doesn't force it.In this film, things work a little differently. There is a fairly tight, classical story, sort of, even though a couple of big pieces are missing. Moreover, there is a very strong sense of symbolism in almost every shot, from Shelley Duval's first appearance, where she is pictured as a "new woman" displacing an older generation, to the scene where Sissy Spacek playfully puts a noose around her neck, foreshadowing her suicide attempt.But here's the miracle: even though there's a lot of symbolism, the style still feels very loose and spontaneous and open, just like other Altman films. How this is possible, I don't know, but it's quite an accomplishment--almost unique in cinema, I think, in the way that each frame is simultaneously closed &amp; symbolic but also open &amp; realistic. Really, you have to see it to believe it.Best of all, the story, which concerns three very different women, is perfectly suited to the style. This is a fable about the way women's identities are changing (or not) and it asks the right questions without giving clear answers.Actingwise, the real treat here is Shelley Duval as the "new woman," the Cosmo girl, plastic and fake and shallow and miserable and somehow, at the same time, horribly and hilariously alive. You will not forget her, or the double-sided, real/symbolic world she moves in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avant-guard film about female friendships.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Women was another Robert Altman masterpiece. His films have always deeply explored the frailties, of the human personality. And Three Women is typical of Altman's deftness, regarding intense characterizations.This film takes place in the late 70s, in a remote California town. It revolves around three very different female characters, and the effects that each of them has on each other's lives.Shelley Duvall is cast as Millie. Millie is an intensely garrulous woman. She's obsessed with talking about recipes, that she garners from women's magazines. She annoys those around her, with her constant chatter about her 'latest recipe'. Millie also desperately wants to impress her male acquaintances. Men seem to mostly shun Millie though, which doesn't stop her from trying to gain their attention.Millie has a dead-end job, working as a nurse's aid in a nursing home. Her supervisors are brusque, and unsympathetic. She tries to be friendly and helpful, but this often causes her more problems with her bosses.Pinky (played by the very talented Sissy Spacek) moves to Millie's town. She needs a job and is hired as a nurse's aid, at the same nursing home that Millie works at. Millie is assigned to train Pinky in her new job duties. Pinky soon becomes quite attached to Millie. Finally, Millie has someone around (Pinky), who actually admires her. When Millie posts a notice on the bulletin board at work , indicating that she seeks a roommate, Pinky is only to happy to get the chance to room with Millie. Pinky then moves into Millie's apartment. Though Millie's apartment has a tacky, garish quality, Pinky expresses how sublime she thinks it is.One afternoon after work, Millie asks Pinky to go with her to a run-down bar. Pinky meets Millie's friend Edgar, who has set-up a shooting rink out back. He constantly practices shooting there, and invites Millie and Pinky to participate. Edgar is a sophomoric, macho-type, who drinks heavily. He also likes to show-off his marksmanship skills.Millie also introduces Pinky to Willie, who happens to be Edgar's artist girlfriend. Willie is always painting monstrous, sexually explicit creatures around the bar. Pinky is, inexplicably, mesmerized by Willie's offbeat paintings. Willie has a haunting, remote presence. She mostly watches everyone else from afar, while being intensely involved with her artwork. Willie also happens to live in the same apartment building, as Millie and Pinky. Her disturbing paintings, adorn the bottom of the swimming pool located there.Basically, the film doesn't have much of a plot. At least not in the traditional, linear manner that audiences are accustomed to. Instead, Altman chose to focus on the psychological aspects of the relationship between the three woman, and how this changes over time. The friendship between Pinky and Millie becomes tumultuous, for no obvious reason. Willie is the ethereal, mysterious woman of the three. She doesn't interact much with Millie and Pinky throughout the film. Willie's artwork is so hypnotic to Pinky though, that it has a horrible effect on Pinky's psyche, resulting in tragic consequences. The viewer is left to try and fathom why.All three women in the film, are social misfits. And they each struggle pathetically to function in the alienating, urban environment that they inhabit. Altman did a marvelous job, highlighting the emotional turmoil that the women inflict on each other, during the course of the film. This is a film that will leave a deep impression, regarding the dynamics of women's friendships in modern life. But don't expect a neat and tidy conclusion, to the conflicts between the three women. More than any film I've ever seen, this one is vastly open to viewer interpretation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best movie you won't be able to understand (contains mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen all of Robert Altman's films, but I can easily say that he is one of the greatest innovators when it comes to character-driven films, as seen in his large ensemble pieces from "Nashville" to "Short Cuts." Perhaps the reason why so many actors like to work with Altman is because he gives them free-rein in the composition of their characters. Altman's ability to capture the actor's talent of creating a character from the inside out is no less present in his 1977 drama "3 Women", a buried treasure of a film starring Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek. "3 Women" is definitely a character-driven film, as there is virtually no plot to speak of. To enjoy this film is to be enamoured of Duvall and Spacek's performances, as well as Altman's daring and uncompromised vision.Duvall plays Millie Lammoreaux, a young woman living in a barren California desert town whose delusions of grandeur place her in a fantasy world full of social gatherings, dinner parties, and gentleman callers. Whether she is at the nursing homes where she works or the residential motel where she lives, she carries on as if she were the cat's meow, oblivious to the fact that her incessant ramblings about everything from her favorite food recipes to hula dancing lessons are falling on deaf, in not unkind, ears. Because of her endearing qualities however, Millie is a loveable misfit. The way she always slams her car door on the hem of her skirt says so much about her character.Spacek plays Pinky Rose, a new employee at the nursing home who takes an immediate liking to Millie and soon becomes her roommate. A childlike waif, Pinky emulates Millie in the same way a 6-year-old girl looks up to her big sister. While she completely feeds Millie's self-absorption, she also turns Millie's life upside down when she takes on her identity, borrowing her clothes and copying down her social security number.The third woman in "3 Women" is Willie Hart (played by Janice Rule), a sullen, pregnant woman who spends her time painting disturbing murals inside empty swimming pools. She is also married to Edgar (played by Robert Fortier), a drunken lout whose claim to fame as a former stunt double in famous Wyatt Earp westerns makes him a figure of admiration at the motel. The weirdness sets in when Millie invites Edgar over for an adulterous fling, causing a dejected Pinky to jump into the motel's swimming pool from a second story landing, putting her in a coma. This event is the first major plot point in "3 Women". as it spins the storyline in a completely new direction. Pinky wakes up from the coma, rejects her parents who have traveled all the way from Texas to see her, and turns into a surly beer-swilling, gum-chewing tramp. Overcome with guilt, Millie also changes into a different person. Her inflated ego disappears, she becomes more passive, and she caters to Pinky even while Pinky bullies her and treats her with complete disrespect."3 Women" has undoubtedly inspired wonder in whoever has seen it. The tone of the film is extremely strange and dreamlike and is filled with many symbols that defy the viewer who tries to make heads or tails of them. There are also many archetypal, mythical figures in "3 Women" that seem to come right out of a Jungian dream analysis book. For instance, Pinky's fixation with Polly and Peggy, two twins who work at the nursing home with her and Millie, figures prominently in the film right down to its climactic dream sequence. At one point in the movie, Pinky muses, "Do you think they know which one they are?...Maybe they switch back and forth. One day Peggy's Polly, and another day Polly's Peggy." Janice Rule's Willie also seems to be an archetype, the mother figure.Altman doesn't attempt to explain any of the weird connections in "3 Women." Every time I watch this film, I find myself confounded by the same questions: why are the twins so aloof? why is Millie and Pinky's supervisor so unrelentingly bitchy? why is Pinky twice shown taking off her underwear from underneath her skirt? The list goes on. Altman does provide a few rhyming scenes in the film as well. One such scene is one in which nice Pinky is sitting in a deserted bar and is spat upon by a hideous wall ornament in the figure of a wizened old woman, named "Dirty Gertie", whose mechanical laugh accompanies Willie's entrance into the scene. This scene prefigures a later scene in which bad Pinky mischievously spits beer at Edgar and then proceeds to cackle in an exaggerated fashion.It is a shame that "3 Women" is not available on home video or DVD. I happened to catch it on the cable network known as WE (Women's Entertainment) and was so intrigued by it that I looked up the next time it was playing so that I could record it. It is a wonderfully unusual film and Duvall and Spacek are up to task. The role of Millie Lammoreaux is a career best for Duvall. She has never played such a rich character before or after "3 Women." This is also my personal favorite Spacek performance. The spookiness of her performance here rivals her performance in "Carrie." She deftly portrays both Pinkys with equally terrific conviction. And Altman is to be commended (even 24 years after the fact) for bringing such a refreshingly unconventional story to the screen. "3 Women" is arguably the best and most mystifying film that I don't think I will ever understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "3 Women" in 1977. I went back to the cinema and saw it two more times, before I wrote a review. Though I have seen it many other times since then, today I do not recall every detail. Nevertheless I remember its story dealt with three women whose solidarity allows them to survive in a world dominated by insensitive men. Two of these women move the story, the third one does not have a direct influence on the events, but she is a key figure. There is no puzzle here, no enigma to decipher. It may be based on Robert Altman's dream, it may have a dream sequence, but it is quite linear and direct, with little relation to dreams' structure (or lack of it). I say this today but after finding my review in my files, I think it's ironic and makes me laugh at myself. By 1977 I had not read Susan Sontag's "Against Interpretation" yet and I was trying to decipher what the butter meant in "Last Tango in Paris". But I must admit that I find interesting some of the research I did and a few interpretations I made. I found then various leitmotivs in the movie: first, the grotesquely erotic murals painted and shot at by Willie (Janice Rule), that illustrate the oppressive situation of woman in phallocratic societies; water, which (according to French philosopher Dane Rudhyar) stands for collective consciousness and astral world, a symbol that for me tacitly connected the three women (and that has played an important role in other Altman films: "McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller", "Streamers", "Come Back to the 5 and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean", "The Gingerbread Man", "Dr. T &amp; the Women", frozen in "Quintet", and even in "HealtH", "Popeye" and "O.C. and Stiggs"); the image of twins Peggy and Polly, duplicated in Alcira and Doris, mirroring the Millie-Pinky duplicity; and the clinic, as a metaphor of social and moral decay while its members attempt at efficiency. It may sound crazy but I even made a connection between the pool of the boarding house (owned by Willie) and a woman's womb (Willie's), where the temporary symbiosis of Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek) into Millie Lammoreaux (Shelley Duvall) takes place. Today I consider all these more hints than cryptic data, and sometimes they are even too obvious ?as the line when Millie says something like "Sometimes Peggy can be Polly, and Polly can be Peggy", gun-crazy Edgar as a symbol of sexual inadequacy and male authoritarianism, and the delivery of the dead child as a metaphor of the sterility of this kind of relationship between men and women. As I remember it today, it is a sad story of female bonding as a means of survival in a consumerist society, narrated in a beautiful cinematic style, with remarkable performances by all. (Funny, although Duvall had won the Best Actress Palm d'Or in Cannes, in my review the one who impressed me the most was Rule, because she was able to transmit so much with less than a dozen of lines). By far, it's my favorite Robert Altman movie and one of his masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman makes his own "Persona"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and creates something even more fascinating than Bergman's film. Although they're not exactly equally themed films, the theme of female identity-swapping is similar in both. "3 Women" is a dark, allegorical and poignant study of loneliness and search for identity. Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek) is a shy Texan girl who idolizes her pathetic co-worker Millie Lammoreaux (Shelley Duvall), a young woman who's ignored by everybody around her - except Pinky. Pinky soon becomes Millie's new roommate, but their friendship doesn't make Millie feel any less ostracized by her peers, and an extreme act of Pinky will turn everything upside down.Sissy Spacek, right after the huge hit "Carrie", delivered another unforgettable performance. That's no surprise considering Spacek is one of the finest American actresses of all time; the real surprise here is Shelley Duvall, who usually got small roles in great films and never was considered a great actress. When she had a big role in a Kubrick film (the now classic "The Shining"), everybody hated her, and unfortunately that's what most people remember her for (which is unfair, since she was okay in my books; come on, you'd also act hysterical if your husband was chasing you and your son with an axe!). However, 3 years before "The Shining", Duvall gave a mesmerizing, wonderfully nuanced performance as the pathetic Millie, a cross between Blanche DuBois and Pollyanna. A character that could've been annoying if played by a less talented actress, but that became fascinating in Duvall's body. We all know or met people like Millie at least once in our lives, and at moments you just wish you could give her a hug."3 Women" is one of Robert Altman's best, and, consequently, one of the best films of all time. The man who knew how to make ensemble dramas like no other (Nashville, Short Cuts, The Player, Gosford Park, etc.) was also brilliant at creating intimate portraits/character studies. 1 woman became 2/2 women became 3/3 women became 1, which can be summed up by: Birth, growing up, awakening, and (in)stability. The artist, his art, perception, film, and life themselves. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've ever seen.It's closeness to Bergman's "Persona" is strongly felt,though both films are very individual pieces of art of two very different artists.It's a movie that leaves you thinking about it long after you finished watching it.One of it's strongest sides is a wonderful music that comes back to my mind every time I think about the film's disturbing images.The acting is excellent,especially by Spacek and Duvall and the operator's work is gorgeous. The film is about two common,mediocre,untalented(one,Millie,pretentious and pathetic and another one,Pinky,a grown-up infant who needs constant support and care)young women doing simple jobs in the Old Men's House(this is what they know and can do)and much older,quiet,reclusive but gifted artist Willie who paints beautiful murals describing strange male and female creatures in violent and sexual acts.I think these paintings are the key to understanding what kind of psychological relations Willie has with the outer world.This explains her estrangement and almost total silence during the film,giving preference to her wordless expression in an artful manner of her inner state and attitude towards the world.Actually this silent woman fells as a victim to the three other main characters - first losing her unfaithful,hard drinking friend-husband(?) Edgar as both Millie and then "new" Pinky in turn sleep with him(though both know very well that Willie is expecting a child)and then her baby when Pinky having been sent to call a doctor,just watches indifferently(this indifference is especially strongly felt after the Millie's "bloody" slap) as Millie is hopelessly trying to help Willie and finally fails. The ultimate expression of this unbearable cruelty of being is the dead-born baby,who "refuses to be born alive" into such a world.The end is open to interpretations:it may be easy to understand why Edgar could have been killed by Willie(though it is never revealed who did it),but it would be strange to discover that it is Pinky and Millie who actually did it(NOBODY FORCED them to sleep with Edgar and cause pain to Willie!). Love,depression,envy(What does Pinky think when she watches Willie painting?),psychological violence and hidden hatred are all interrelated in this superb human drama of an exceptionally talented film director.If you like cinema as an art,you won't regret watching it.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shock of the Familiar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dreamy and at the same time intensely realistic film about the life of one or two or three women living empty, lonely lives in a small California desert town. If you have not already seen it, and if you like any films by Ingmar Bergman or Robert Altman or David Lynch, then stop reading this or any other review and see the film for yourself.The fun of a movie like this, that is so realistic that it has no "correct" interpretation and even the movie's director and writer is not entirely sure what it "means," is to come up with your own theories and share with others who saw the film. My theory is that the three women are all separate individuals, who are alike in the sense that we are all one, but who are not alike in the way female characters/actresses are the same person in Persona, That Obscure Object of Desire, or Mulholland Drive. The sweet old couple really are Pinky's parents, and the suicide attempt leaves Pinky with amnesia, which is why she forgets her parents and confuses herself with Millie as she tries to reconstruct her life. Poor old Edgar gets shot by one of the women, or maybe all three, who make it look like an accident. It makes no sense for his body to be hidden in the tires, as that would not be an effective way of hiding him, the stench would attract attention, and the staged accident is consistent with a traditional body disposal. But maybe it is his body, just because stuff that happens in real life often makes no sense.The real fun of this movie for me was the shock of the familiar, in picking out the tacky details of real life circa 1977. I was 20 when the film came out, and yes I do remember making shrimp cocktails, and cooking pigs-in-a-blanket like it was a new gourmet treat, and sorting out Sociables crackers eating the broken ones and saving the whole ones for company with canned cheese squirted on. I even had one of those silly laugh-toys (not a hag face, just a little box in a felt bag) that made the laughing sound and cracked everyone up. I didn't smoke Trues or drive a Ford Pinto, but I was around others who did.And the Shelly Duvall character, with the heart of gold who lies constantly to try to make herself more interesting and who tries so hard to make everything perfect she annoys all the people she is trying to befriend? Too real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal, Disturbing And Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I think lots of the hatred is other former college students who were forced to write papers after watching this in those English Literature classes. The guy next to me said,"What the Hell was that crap?" Altman's most recondite work, I leave the feminist meanings to others, I will focus upon the existential issues of identity that render it so disturbing. There is an odd consanguinity between the seemingly different Pinky and Millie. On the surface, Millie seems more adjusted in her functionality at the rest home and motel. Pinky is like a female Zelig who changes into the people she surrounds herself with, terrified of being alone, she soon is dressing, talking and imitating Millie's identity until even Millie is freaked out. Yet, on many showings, you will notice that Millie is just as disturbed. She continues, blithely, her brainless banter to everyone around her; usually these are greeted by her listeners with ignoring or cruel, mocking remarks. Millie's soliloquies disguised as colloquies are the core of grasping what is going on with her. Notice how cruel everyone is here, Altman rivaled Kubrick for his dark view of human beings. The workers at the rest home are all creeps and jerks, uniformly cruel, uncaring and vicious. Altman uses this cruelty as justification for the bond between the two women with the third off in the distance painting odd images on the pool walls.The music augments the eerie, odd singular nature of Altman's classic that tortured other college students besides me. For me, Pinky is best grasped in the scene where her parents come to visit her in the hospital after she tried to kill herself. Notice her violent rejecting of her real identity. With the cruelty of all men ubiquitously throughout the movie, the intimation is that of molestation at the hands of her father. Her violent rejection of her parents is so extreme that even Millie cannot figure it out. This answers the riddle of Pinky and her ontological Zelig-like chameleon changing into Millie. She not only rejects her traumatic past but she attempts to existential flight by literally becoming Millie to escape Pinky. Yes, the feminists are right, trauma at the hands of abusive men is the core of all of these women's stories. Yet, as you watch it over, Millie, who upon first viewing appeared as a paragon of normalcy next to Pinky and Pool Lady, repeated viewings will show you the error of this first impression.Millie is not even really there existentially; she is in an impenetrable reverie surrounded by people who are not fascinated by her prattling inanities. She never notices or appears to hear the scathing abuse hurled at her by the people who are quite unwilling to serve as her ontological role players. When you watch it again, notice everyone rolling their eyes and fleeing at high speed from her. Often, Millie is still talking at full volume to people who have long since departed. Yes, all three were damaged by men, that much is on the surface but Altman also is doing something with identity in this movie. As Pinky draws herself as Millie's twin, Millie continues her interactions with people she believes adore her. Reality never touches her consciousness for a second. Pool Lady simply withdraws, she is there but only in her activity of painting; often, she stops to silently stare at someone but no words are spoken. If someone put a gun to my head, this is what I think it means: the world is a cruel place, humans are incapable of really relating to others; ergo, everyone copes in their own way. Pinky creates other's identities to escape from her own. Millie has simply left reality to never return; she has created another kinder world with uncaring strangers transformed, in her mind, into deeply caring people who are her friends. I can tell you this, never in your entire life will you see a movie like this. As a movie reviewer, I recommend it to people who like puzzles or human psychology. The deepest of all of Altman's films augmented by the creepiest, dissonant music that enhances its oddness. I re-visit it regularly and, truthfully, I am still working on it. A Good Movie. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 WOMEN (Robert Altman, 1977) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I&#x2019;ve had the Criterion DVD of this for quite some time before I finally managed to sit down and watch it. The film came at the tail-end of director Altman&#x2019;s most creative period, and it&#x2019;s not one that can be easily categorized &#x2013; much like his earlier (and equally demanding) IMAGES (1972); incidentally, both are original screenplays by Altman himself and are essentially dream-like and rambling, thus leaving room for (respectively) various interpretations and much improvisation.Anyway, the &#x2018;narrative&#x2019; concerns the odd relationship between the titular figures: Sissy Spacek is the inexperienced and reticent type; at her new work-place, an old folks&#x2019; home, she meets Shelley Duvall who, on the other hand, is worldly and garrulous &#x2013; but no less lonely; Janice Rule, then, is a bohemian artist whom they occasionally cross paths with (her strange designs adorn the floor of the pool at the apartment house where the other two live). For the first 90 minutes or so, there&#x2019;s hardly any plot: we see Spacek and Duvall at their work routine (where they&#x2019;re pretty much ignored by their co-workers), then bonding when the former moves in with the latter (again, their neighbors aren&#x2019;t very friendly), and occasionally visiting the bar out in the desert (complete with motor-track and shooting-range) owned by Rule and her husband. Eventually, however, the two grow apart as Duvall begins to find Spacek&#x2019;s maladroit ways a nuisance &#x2013; the last straw is reached when Duvall comes home with Rule&#x2019;s husband on her arms and unceremoniously shifts Spacek into the guest room: the latter takes this dismissal badly and attempts suicide in the pool! It&#x2019;s here that the film really starts to get weird: when Spacek finally comes to, she&#x2019;s a totally different person &#x2013; assertive and sensual, she basically takes up the characteristics that had previously been Duvall&#x2019;s, by which the latter is confused and becomes the one to feel awkward! Nevertheless, she tries to help by sending for Spacek&#x2019;s parents in Texas so that they can be near her: however, her room-mate doesn&#x2019;t appreciate the gesture as, apparently, being struck by temporary amnesia, she claims not to know them! Later, Rule&#x2019;s husband turns up once again at their apartment &#x2013; having deserted his pregnant wife; Duvall, however, grabs Spacek and goes to Rule&#x2019;s aid &#x2013; Duvall asks Spacek to fetch a doctor, but the latter seems dumb-founded by all of this&#x2026;so that the baby emerges still-born! Following this is a quite extraordinary surreal dream sequence, which leads us into the finale &#x2013; where Spacek is tending bar at Rule&#x2019;s place: when a patron appears, she calls on to her mother Duvall(!); it transpires that the latter is taking care of Spacek and Rule who, for some reason, seem to have regressed to a child-like state! The script provides an interesting analogy between the protagonists&#x2019; character names: Spacek, called Pinky throughout, is really named Mildred; Duvall is Millie, which is short for Mildred; while Rule&#x2019;s character is referred to as Willie (probably a diminutive of Wilhelmina) and which, of course, rhymes with Millie! Incidentally, the presence of the twins (co-workers of Spacek and Duvall) anticipates the film&#x2019;s later personality switch a' la PERSONA (1966) and PERFORMANCE (1970). Comedy, though of the neurotic kind one usually associates with Woody Allen, is present during the course of the film &#x2013; such as the neighbor Duvall fancies but whom she rejects due to his persistent flu, and ex-film director John Cromwell&#x2019;s appearance as Spacek&#x2019;s senile father. While the general apathy shown towards Spacek and Duvall also raises a nervous chuckle, it seems exaggerated to me &#x2013; for instance, after Spacek&#x2019;s spell in hospital, Duvall asks her superiors if she can come back to work&#x2026;but they maintain to not even recall her (though, admittedly, this ties up with Spacek&#x2019;s own earlier &#x2018;rejection&#x2019; of her parents)! Despite the emphasis Altman places on the murals (painted by one Bodhi Wind), no explanation is given regarding their harrowing nature other than the fact that they&#x2019;re the handiwork of the eccentric Rule, so that their point remains obscure to the last.I would&#x2019;ve liked to listen to Atman&#x2019;s accompanying Audio Commentary &#x2013; however, as I&#x2019;ve explained elsewhere, I&#x2019;ve been forced to by-pass such lengthy supplements for the time being&#x2026;and, in any case, from past experience I&#x2019;d say that his observations seemed to be just as aloof as the films themselves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman's commentary is riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't feel I can add anything to the excellent commentary by the other reviewers for "3 Women"; I just want to urge film lovers of all stripes to check out Altman't commentary on the Criterion DVD. In the liner notes, they refer to it as "wide-ranging;" it IS that, and expansive, too. It is almost as if Altman was saying to himself, "Well, I'm not going to be around much longer, so I am going to speak my peace about how I feel about film-making and let it all hang out". For the true aficionado, this is as good as it gets. You'll want to savor it in chunks it is so thought-provoking. Not only does Altman reveal all the hidden meanings of the film, he explains at length (with copious examples) the philosophy of his art. It shed light on my previous encounters with Altman's "difficult" style; highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is exactly what the film is about. Someone who doesn't really know who they are-yet. Someone who is desperately seeking someone to pattern their life after. Who is your inspiration? Who is your idol? If you have no one and are in an area where there are few inspiring people then you pick the least threatening. And this is sort of what the story is about. Someone who is a blank slate and looking to fill in the space. Excellent film! I've watched it probably 50 times in my life. It is fascinating with low key performances by Sissy Spacek and Shelly Duval. Watch it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Interpretation of 3 Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this brilliant masterpiece twice and in one particular scene, just as dreamlike as it truly is, a total vision of the two central characters, played perfectly astonishingly well and with a dash of campy perfection, by Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek, that these women were, again, in my opinion, the same person. With the fact that almost everyone seems to be ignoring Millie (Duvall), in some scenes, to a point where they are being downright rude and disrespectful to and about her, makes me believe her isolation and constant need for perfection (her apartment, her hair, her coordinated clothing, her endless chatter of the latest appliances and recipes) and constant strive for wanting to be the best Hostess on the Planet, I believe she created Pinky (Spacek), who also had the name, Mildred, in her private fantasy life, who is a total contrast of her. The idea came so fast to me, maybe too fast, to understand it all but I felt the need to jot it down. I want to believe Millie is aware of co-workers and neighbors ignoring her and openly being disinterested in what she is saying but I wonder if it is because the "perfect" side of these characters is really not there.Well, this is only my interpretation of a person who is isolated and has created her own fantasy life of a single career woman, who has a lavishly styled pad, goes to the local bar to relax, and sits poolside for some sun, yet is completely and utterly lonely.My only missing piece to this puzzle would be the third woman, played by Janice Rule, as the mysterious Artist and Bartender, and if in fact Millie and Pinky are pieces of her Creations and the constant maternal nurturing that overlaps with these three women, throughout the film.It is, hands down, the best character study piece I have ever encountered and is brilliantly acted by all central players involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enigmatic, Sad, Absurd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 3 Women, Robert Altman paints a portrait of loneliness that manages to disturb, amuse, puzzle and sadden the viewer. Altman wrote the screenplay himself and builds the action on mundane situations: an awkward young woman, Pinky (Sissy Spacek) starts working at a spa and becomes obsessed with a fellow worker, Millie (Shelley Duvall). Circumstances lead the two to share a room, allowing us to have a peek at the emptiness and pointlessness of their lives. There's not much of a story here, mostly illustrations of disturbing, embarrassing scenes that should ring true to anyone that spends time with people on a daily basis.Pinky and Millie have two different personalities. Pinky seems to have trouble making friendships, lies about her past and develops a fixation for Millie, perhaps because Millie was the only person who showed some kindness or gave her any attention on her first day on the job.Millie, like Pinky, is lonely, but whereas Pinky seems comfortable with it, Millie can't seem to bear it. She's always trying to get dates, she has problems with rejection; and when Pinky shacks up with her, she tries to impress the gullible woman by showing herself as popular and cool with people at work or with her neighbours. In fact, for all the chatter that comes out of Millie's mouth, no one pays any attention to her or says anything to her, except a bored 'yeah', if she's lucky.Shelley Duvall, whom I know only from The Shinning and whom everyone calls a horrible actress, steals the show as Millie. It's no surprise Spacek can act, she's one of the finest actresses to emerge from the '70s. But Duvall shines here as the silly, arrogant, deluded Millie.What makes Millie so fascinating is that she's instantly recognisable: we see people like every day, we know people like her, and - heaven help us - we have a bit of her in us too. Although the movie is dreamy, enigmatic and eschews simple answers, its characters are rooted in realism.I'm not a big fan of Robert Altman, but having watched this movie and Images back to back, I can say I'm beginning to admire him at last.</fullReview>

This first hour is an opportune moment for washing dishes, washing clothes, or any other kind of menial chore. Trust me, the film hardly requires your cognitive faculties.Finally, tension finally builds around 65:00, but the film hardly takes off, wastes time on moments that can be summarized succinctly in 1 minute, etc. There's nothing really shocking, and any opportunity for additional excitement is crushed by Altman's apparent genius.If this is Altman's best film, then consider not seeing any.

		<shortDescription>a film about a dream so in other words freaky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched 1977's dream flick "3 women", by the late great Robert Altman. This movie stars both Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacek, both who won awards for their acting in this film. So is this movie good, yes if you like the surreal (which I do). Is it a classic, I say yes but of cult status only. This is not a mainstream movie. Even for Altman this movie is out there. This is not one of his typical dialog driven smart comedy. It is a flick about images, ideas, and things that are open for interpretation. Including the end which Altman himself said he was not quite sure he understood. The inspiration for this film was in fact a dream Altman had. This film starts out seemingly normal but slowly morphs into a dream, becoming stranger and stranger with each passing scene. I recommend this movie for indy lovers and art lovers. I am not sure many others would appreciate the rather intellectual high art concept of this film. Watching this movie with friends may be the best way to go, with the right group this film could inspire a deep philosophical and existential debate. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, finally out on DVD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember first seeing this film on the A&amp;E channel in the late 1980's. It grabbed my attention from the beginning and I ended up watching the whole thing. Even though much of the film is deliberately meant to be ambiguous, I found it to be fascinating. I always interpreted it as a film about insecurity and the desire for the characters to be different people than what they really are. The Shelly Duvall character (Millie) is a nice person but she is not the social butterfly that she desperately wants to be. Despite Millies' delusions about herself, the Sissy Spacek character wants to be just like Millie because she seems to have no personality of her own. The Edgar character wants to be a tough guy/cowboy, but in reality is a burned-out drunk. I'm still somewhat confused as to how the Janice Rule character fits into the whole scheme. This is one of the few films where you feel like you're watching real people and not just actors portraying people. It's amazing how a movie like "Charlie's Angels" which has three gorgeous females in it and a ton of action can be so boring, yet a movie like "3 Women" with three average looking females and almost no action can be so interesting.Despite the bizarre ending (which I still don't fully understand). This is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat watching this film last weekend with a quizzical smile upon my face for its entirety. The source of this expression? 3 Women, a film that I entirely expected to abhor but which I found, though slightly flawed, an ambitious, unwieldy, thought-provoking masterpiece. It's a divisive film, for sure, with vehement and impassioned supporters and detractors. As with most films of this kind (certain Bergman films, such as Cries and Whispers or Persona, and 8 1/2 come to mind), I can understand why people have avid dislike for it--it's a difficult movie and if you're not in the mood or are unwilling to watch the film by its unique rules, then it will be a tedious bore, a failure. That's fine. I didn't like Satyricon or Weekend but adored Juliet of the Spirits and Pierrot. To each his own. 3 Women is the pitch-perfect examination of personality types, the subconscious mind, and California circa 1975, and I think Altman's ability to so deftly blend these three disparate elements into a cohesive film (that even has something akin to a plot) is what struck me as so amazing. I expected quasi-Freudian claptrap and a pretentious attempt at symbolism. What I found was a rather thoughtful portrayal of womanhood through symbolic manifestations of the id, ego, and superego sprinkled with some Antonioni-like personality crises. That makes the movie sound awful, I know. But imagine a movie that fits that description that is simultaneously funny, frightening, and moving. Imagine a movie that fits that description that is watchable and good. I fear that I cannot truly do this film justice. I cannot describe it, having now watched it twice. I don't know that I understand it completely or completely understand what Altman wanted to achieve. The film works for me nevertheless and I thoroughly question whether Altman even knew what he was trying to achieve with this dreamlike film based on dreams. Thinking back on 3 Women, now, I remember the little things, and some of the big. The nightmare sequence, for instance, looms large in my mind, as does Sissy Spacek's brilliant performance (to take nothing away from Shelly Duvall's best acting I've ever seen). But then there's the cock-eyed 0 in the 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning of the film. How utterly perfect. And the matching colors (cars and clothes in particular) and how Shelly Duvall's skirt always protrudes from the car door.This is a movie to which you should return, often, parsing it out as best you can. It's a thrilling experience and one unlike any other Altman film's I've encountered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for Spacek and Duvall, forget the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Revisiting Robert Altman's 3 Women a quarter-century after its release is more than an exercise in nostalgia. The movie's worst faults -- its oneiric aimlessness, its pretensions toward some sort of feminist metaphysics -- seem really not to matter that much. And its best parts -- Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacek and the interplay between them -- have stayed fresh as new paint. Has either of these actresses ever surpassed the natural, intuitive work Altman here inspired them to produce? These two-girls-sharing cook up a relationship as messy and powerful as lovers. Duvall, the clueless airhead who nonetheless gives herself airs, discovers an almost aching pathos when she finds Spacek slipping away from her. The ingrown, dependent Spacek seems to have been raised in a colony of sponges; when she starts reddening her lips and nails, and returning Duvall's haughty contempt, she's frightening and feral. Sharp as the comedy in 3 Women is, it bespeaks an almost insupportable sadness, so when Altman shifts into the minor mode and commences playing fortissimo, it's redundant, and a miscalculation. He's already shown us all there is to see. The rest is just obscurantist mood-spinning. Note to film buffs: the actor playing Spacek's elderly dad is John Cromwell (also the bishop in Altman's A Wedding), the director of Dead Reckoning, Caged, and The Racket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darkly comic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 3 women of the title are Millie, Pinky and Willie. Millie and Pinky work together at a health spa for the elderly and the infirm and share an apartment. Willie is an an artist and she never speaks. Millie speaks all the time but no-one listens to her, no-one that is except Pinky who idolizes her and would like to be her. Yes, this is Altman's "Persona" with a third woman thrown in for good measure and it's a darkly comic masterpiece.Altman says he based his screenplay on a dream he had and the film does have a dream-like hallucinatory quality. As Millie and Pinky, Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek are virtually never off the screen and they are superb. Duvall won the Best Actress award at Cannes and Spacek won the New York Film Critics Best Supporting Actress prize. The terrific and disquieting score is by Gerald Busby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Millie is always walking behind people talking at them, and she thinks everyone likes her, but most people just ignore her or make fun of her behind her back. Pinky thinks she's just about the best person she's ever met. I thought I would just put this on for a minute to see what it was like, but I literally couldn't turn it off. People say this, but its hardly ever happened to me. This movie cast a spell over me.Altman is a fascinating filmmaker and this is probably my favourite movie of his so far. Its beautifully shot, with a dreamlike quality, and the characters Shelley and Cissy play are so adorable they just draw you in. Actors own their parts because of just how much free rein Altman gives them, and it happens to really gel with these actors. The film is ambiguous, and I'm not entirely sure what happened in the second half, but its not what I expected to happen. There is a sinister undercurrent to the film which is highlighted by the music, but doesn't manifest in the particular kind of plot developments you might guess. So its unpredictable and mysterious, which I loved, but your mileage may vary. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pinky meets Thoroughly Modern Millie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two main characters, both named Mildred have emigrated from Texas to a small dusty Californian town off the highway that could pass for Texas -- the younger Mildred remarks, "Sure does look like Texas". The attention- seeking, loquacious Mildred #1, alias "Millie" (Shelley Duvall) struts around like a yellow canary on stage reminding me of Norma Desmond from Sunset Blvd with the same lack of self awareness. Obviously imitating what she's sees in the glamor magazines she reads. The clumsy naive Mildred #2, alias "Pinky" (Sissy Spacek) who's even more clueless mistakes Millie's bravado as confidence immediately becoming her sycophant says she is "the most perfect person I've met" until an unexpected turn of events challenges their fan-idol relationship and their identities. It is a final crisis that resolves their "identity crisis" in the end involving a third women, Willie (Janice Rule), an artist that paints a mural with groupings of reptilian anthropomorphic beasts that include a pregnant female (like herself) and an alpha male standing erect with his huge "cock" (maybe blurred in some copies) which I presume represents her cock sure husband and possibly lover to the pair of Mildreds. This very surreal film some what of a black tragicomedy (if you can force it into a genre at all) evolved from a dream director, Robert Altman had, so don't expect a nice neat traditional Hollywood ending. I loved the film! One of his best IMO. It explores the female psyche so well, its hard for me to believe a male developed this from his own dream. The film is also a time capsule from the 70s. Millie loves the color yellow, drives a "French" mustard colored Pinto ( not to be confused with English mustard, she corrects the cops as they look for her stolen car) and has an apartment decorated in a combination of slick mod and lacy kitschy furnishing, all in yellow. Lots of double knit halters and peasant blouses fill her closet, all in yellow, of course. This cult classic is worth viewing just for the trip back to the groovy years. Would someone please comment about the reptilian art? Who was actual the artist?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Women? and one genius behind it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Altman is one seriously unpredictable filmmaker. He can make light-hearted, comedy of the mainstream like Popeye and Dr. T and Women, but then out of left field, he gives you something like this. A masterful art film. His versatility is worshiped in the film industry. Watching this film, you can see his extraordinary talent. It's one the most carefully prepared and well edited thrillers I've ever seen. The story is very common to film, it's execution is what makes it so fresh and entertaining. The film drones with it's repetitious soundtrack. It cuts back and forth to symbolic images. The performances from Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spackek are abnormal, and so is the environment they live in. How it compares to his other works, I don't know. But, to those who are avid Art-house film-goers, or fans of the modern day Altman, Paul Thomas Anderson, cannot miss out on seeing this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Altman's 3 WOMEN (1977) with Shelley Duvall, Sissy Spacek &amp; Janice Rule, has remained my all-time favourite picture since I accidentally caught in on the Z-channel at 3 in the morning back when I was like 13... It remains Altman's least trademark work, filled with lots of non-sequitors, a very dream-like logic and structure, hints of surrealism, absurdism &amp; devastating tragedy, one of the most original motion picture musical scores of all time (by Gerald Busby) and unquestionably Shelley Duvall's strongest, most moving and engaging performance of her entire career, it is also her single starring role... and the films ending segment, which ends in the strictly impressionistic, ambivalent surprise of Altman quietly 'pulling the rug out from underneath you', for my money perfectly compliments the rest of the film by slyly leaving everything you have just seen (and any of it's possible vague inflections about the human experience, and how and whatever any of the film intended to represent or comment on) completely and 100% up to your own personal interpretation... just as Donald Cammell's equally brilliant PERFORMANCE (1970) also succeeded in portraying and also shares practically the exact same deus-ex-machina of it's last final frames of film as does this largely unheralded, bona- fide Altman masterpiece, which has only managed to gain an incredible amount of momentum and word-of-mouth acceptance as the grand old dame of 1970's art house cinema of which it truly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman's hypnosis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film-makers seldom go for the character driven movies as there is a high possibility of getting rejected by the audiences. Apparently Altman's risky attempt has been acclaimed because of the emotional spectrum being projected throughout this movie. If you are looking for an intellectual content in this movie, you will be disappointed. I presume that the director may be following a postmodern approach in order to prevent us from logical thinking. Like an anomaly this movie has a linear screenplay. So that the viewers would not be spending much time, thinking of it's chronological order. So basically the director's intention is to hypnotize the viewers with a relaxed mood and that's what makes it special from the other character driven movies.It's an irrefutable fact that Robert Altman was inspired by the movie Persona (Ingmar Bergman) to make this movie. Also the movies like Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive belong to the same category. Three of them acted really well, out of which Sissy Spacek's performance is outstanding. And the cinematography is mediocre with the normal camera movements. Three of them have very different personae. Pinky was a timid and immature girl. Her personality was rather submissive. She finds it awkward to interact with her colleagues. Eventually Millie was instructed to take care of Pinky. And they become roommates. Pinky thinks Millie is perfect and gradually she observes Millie. Pinky even tries to read Millie's diary secretly. Along with their friendship they trade their personae gradually. Millie introduces owners of her apartment, Willie and Edgar. Their personality was mutually exclusive. Edgar was a complete extrovert but Willie was always silent. She never talks to someone. The rest of the events seems like a dream sequence and it's difficult to find an explanation for it.We can find that the three women Millie, Pinky and Willie shared something common.1) Three of them were betrayed by Edgar; Edgar was the husband of Willie and boyfriend of both Millie and Pinky.2) They were metaphorically represented as daemons in Willie's pictures near the swimming pool in their apartment.3) Although they were the slaves of Edgar, they betrayed in a triangular way as well; Willie --&gt; Millie (bar); Millie --&gt; Pinky (apartment); Pinky --&gt; Willie (Willie's home)Eventually we can find that their minds complete each other according to the Freudian concept of psychoanalysis(Id, Ego and Super-ego). There is no intellectual conclusion in the world of emotions. It is meant to experience the emotional spectra produced by the director. It makes different impacts on each viewers and that cannot be expressed but only felt. Certainly I'm looking forward to watch the other movies of this genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wonder what it's like to be twins;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still discovering Robert Altman's films, and after a few deceptions (not so much because those I watched were bad movies, but because I had high expectations), this one was a nice surprise. It's a movie that could only have been made in the 70's, it's one of a kind. From the few popular movies Shelley Duvall has been in, this is one of her finest. I couldn't help but smile when she says "What's the matter, haven't you ever seen twins?". Sissy Spacek is easier to catch on screen, she's also great in this.As of the amazing performances, we're introduced to a dreamy like California scenery, there's nothing unusual about those two words in the same sentence, but the atmosphere is almost ethereal, from the pastel colors to the apathetic people all around. I kept thinking if they did that just to spite Millie or because they simply wouldn't bother to listen to anyone. Millie's situation is so anguishing, it's really similar to one of those dreams where we talk and talk but people don't seem to notice, like we're ghosts. I know the character wasn't near being pleasant, but I felt sorry for her frustrated social efforts just the same.I had no idea what the film was actually about when I started watching it, and as Pinky's obsession with Millie developed, I figured it was going to be a very well plotted drama, or something like it. That it is, but it's something else, too. If we pay attention, from the start, there's a strange feeling lurking about, like something's not entirely right...or real. It's no coincidence that Pinky's real name is Mildred, which is also short for Millie (also, Willie...), and both women seem to enter some sort of fusion, there's something that ties them together. Besides, there's another woman, of enigmatic behavior, her importance is revealed further along. For now, all we know is that she paints those exotic printings inside the pool. As of Pinky's accident, which might as well be related to those paintings, she suffers a drastic change of heart, now she IS Millie.It's not revealed to us whether her accident caused her some kind of neurological damage or the beginning of some kind of mental illness...but I'm not so fond of these realistic explanations, not coming from a movie like this. Especially because it wouldn't explain that last scene, where the three women appear to have reached some sort of weird organization, featuring different generations...perhaps they're supposed to be one? I'm not sure of the meaning for the metaphor, all I know is that it's a very intriguing movie, giving us a lot to think about at the end, and it sure is an interesting story about what the experience of being a woman means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, no one can deny the film of not having great ambition. The first two acts are really, really good. It's the last act that truly transcends the film into something utterly intriguing and endlessly terrifying. The film never makes anything too obvious, and it never spells out anything, but its power stems from its seemingly simple execution. The climax (if one could call it that) is truly unnerving. The leads are both truly fantastic in this. This is strongly recommended. It reminds me of both David Lynch and Roman Polanski in its sort of opaque themes, and that's a huge compliment. Shelley Duvall has always been a very underrated actress, and this is a prime example of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of mood, less plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mildred 'Pinky' Rose is a (very) young girl from Texas who tries her luck in sunny California. She finds a job at a geriatric institution where she meets Millie Lammoreaux. Millie looks so confident that the heavy insecure Pinky soon sees her as a role model. This becomes creepy soon when Pinky tries to become Millie. In fact Millie is a lonely and insecure woman who hides her uncertainties behind constant babble. She becomes annoyed with Pinky and treats her very rude. So rude that Pinky tries to commit suicide. She is in a coma for a couple of days and when she wakes up she has taken over the personality of Millie including her rudeness.That's the main storyline of this movie but not the whole story. This movie is more about mood and atmosphere than it is about a plot. In fact Robert Altman worked out the film without a full script and he wasn't sure about how to end the story. The atmosphere is what makes this film a beautiful and sometimes creepy travel through the minds of the three women. There are long sequences of the paintings from Willie, the third woman. And there is a frightening dream sequence which shows a nightmare that Pinky experienced.In fact the three women are tied by a male: Edgar Hart, the husband of Willie who owns a saloon and the apartment where Millie and Pinky share a room. While his wife is pregnant he sleeps with Millie and when Pinky is transformed into Millie he easily switches his attentions. So the only male in this story with an important role is portrayed as an absolute cheater and loser. The film suffers under the fact that it isn't made with a worked-out script. While the title is 3 women the film is only centered on Millie and Pinky and the character of Willie doesn't come forward very clear. There is hardly any interaction between her and the two other women and it seems she only communicates with them through her paintings (especially with Pinky). Then there is the role of the twins who also work at the institution. They are mentioned a lot in the film and you see a lot of shots of them. You expect that they should play an important role but this part of the plot is never worked out.What about the two main characters? It's hard to identify with them. Millie is an irritant female who seems to never shut her mouth and bothers people who are not interested in her. The reason for this is that she is so lonely that she intrudes in other peoples lifes and as a consequence is ignored by them. Pinky seems to be a very shy girl without real knowledge of society but she has a hidden agenda. The way she tries to imitate Millie shows thoroughness. When her parents are shown you understand she comes from a rural background and was most probably withdrawn from all experiences young women have in their teens. Her head injuries after her suicide attempt transform her in a sexual loaded woman who knows all the tricks to seduce men. But when there are stressful moments she immediately becomes the shy country girl as portrayed in the first half of the film.I think 3 women could have been a masterpiece if Altman hadn't got this image of what this movie would become already in his head before he starts shooting. For the director the sequences are much more important than a worked-out plot and in the end the film suffers underneath his vision. But he managed very well to create this dreamlike and creepy atmosphere which makes this movie more than just a psychological drama. As a viewer you feel the tension when Pinky intrudes the life of Millie and as this movie seems to become a story about a stalker the roles are exchanged and you start to feel sorry for Millie who has an enormous guilt about what happened to Pinky. Then there is the dream sequence and the child-bearing of Willie which is filmed so intense that I was shivering watching this scene. Still I'm left with the feeling that so much more could have been made with this plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those pictures that offers viewers something to argue about ad infinitum, and everyone could be right. None can argue, however, about the quality of the performances given by Ms. Spacek and Ms. Duvall. I watched it for the first time last night, and read some of the user reviews today. I see the movie as a mural (there was a nagging use of murals painted on the bottom of swimming pools) that depicts the personality of three different characters common to the psychic development and desires of all women: that of being mothered and nurtured, that of being accepted socially and sexually, and that of being creative. A kind of Three Faces of Eve but not in one body and soul if you will. At the end, all of these desires are met by finding role reversals within the circle of three that satisfy their desires. If anything, the film also paints in the mural an unfavorable inset picture of the male, a barrier that a woman must face and overcome before achieving her completeness. This is a picture that shocks one into thinking, something Robert Altman movies usually do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willie, Millie and Pinky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen 95% of Altman's films, and I would say '3 Women' is in the upper-middle echelon of his body of work. Stylistically and thematically, it reminds me mostly of his 'Images' from '72. And as others have mentioned, Altman basically derived the film from a dream he had. And yes, this film is like a dream; from the almost Jungian imagery of Willie's murals that are archetypal and could possibly denote the collective unconscious, to the idea that Pinky is basically reborn after falling into the pool(Altman said the water in the movie symbolized amniotic fluid), we are in a virtual dreamscape. Identities are reaccessed, and seem to shift as a barren desert engulfs them. Maybe it is about the cycle of life, as each of the three women, seem to embody some stage, or step on the ladder of life? We are introduced to these characters in a nursing home (where people are again in water), and leave these character's lives, after Millie helps Willie give birth (symbolic possibly of Willie channeling or embodying Millie, or vice-versa) to a still-born. They all only seem to hang out with one man, that being Edgar, and in the end, live together a mesh of each other. But this is a dream. So one interpretation could be as good as the next. Or as irrelevant as the next. However, I wonder what Freud would think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but fascinating. Grab it if you can find it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Altman's excursion into Bergman territory is a symbol-laden exploration of personality, highly reminiscent of the Swedish master's "Persona." But Altman's version is memorable in its own right, especially for the stunning performance of Shelly Duvall as Millie, a dippy working girl who takes her style cues from McCall's magazine. I haven't been able to get this performance out of my head in the 22 years since I first saw it. The scene where she plans a dinner party for friends is one the most poignant I've ever seen. And who will ever forget the way her yellow skirt always gets caught in her car door (I'd love to know who came up with that touch -- Altman, Duvall, or serendipity?) For that matter, I can't even forget her mustard-yellow car ("French mustard, not American.") Sissy Spacek is nearly as memorable in her supporting performance as Pinky (or is it Mildred?), Millie's childlike roommate. And Janice Rule, Woman No. 3, is consummately enigmatic. Some of Altman's flourishes seem self-consciously arty, and the plot takes some bizarre turns, but this movie is never less than fascinating. I was ecstatic to find it on PBS last night after trying in vain to track it down for many years (needless to say, I taped it). The only major flaw in this movie is the music soundtrack, one of the most irritating and pseudo-portentous scores ever composed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Unrelated Paragraphs About This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 Women is an acute, interesting portrait of a girl played by Sissy Spacek who starts work as a nurse and becomes attached at the hip to a colleague, played by Shelley Duvall, who wears a tight, thick emotional shell. After an accident, Spacek and Duvall seem to swap personalities, Spacek because she's absorbed Duvall's pain and feelings so much that she's begun to be lost during Duvall's accident and projects what she misses, and Duvall's shell has unwittingly come down, revealing that at the core, she is that shy, clingy, lonely little girl that Spacek is, and because they're repelled by the spinach between the teeth that they can only see in someone else, they once again repress and undercurrents and aggravating tension ushers in. It's an extremely interesting plunge into the deep end of sensitivity and loneliness and the impressions on both.But, I don't know why the film is called 3 Women. There is another woman, a painter, who lurks around, punctuating the film every here and there with shocking paintings. These paintings have an effect on Spacek and Duvall, but the film focuses brilliantly on the clashing psychological tentacles of those two women. This woman may have an effect on the story and the other two, but to install her as an official part in a trio with them doesn't quite make sense. For instance, Degas, Monet, and Renoir are a trio, because they all took part in the same things and were influenced by each other in an equal amount of ways. The Godfather, GoodFellas, and Taxi Driver are not a trio, because the first two involve the same things and respond to each other while Taxi Driver only shares with them the common trait of an Italian-American director. Perhaps that's a clear enough analogy to the misstep in considering the story a portrait of three women instead of two.3 Women has an extremely aggravating quality as well as a profound and thought-provoking one. Firstly, the music is repetitive, pretentious minor-key chamber music in the worst possible way. Second, the film has a scene where Duvall is desperately helping an abandoned woman give birth to a child in an apartment, hurrying Spacek along to get help. Spacek simply stands outside the apartment and watches in at the agony. This part of the scene is about five minutes long, or seems like it. However, I must give credit to Altman, because it was certainly intentional.</fullReview>

The third woman of the title is a pregnant woman (Rule) who runs a bar and paints murals. The best thing about this bleak Altman film is the brilliant performance of Duvall as an unpopular girl who thinks she is a social butterfly. Altman should have stuck with the directing because his script is unfocused and pretentious, as it veers into the arty world of Bergman's "Persona" with some psycho mumbo-jumbo sprinkled in. Not one of the director's better efforts but a sub-par Altman film is often more interesting than the best work of many other directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHAT AN UNDERRATED CLASSIC!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 14 on Encore. I was dumbfounded as to what it meant then. I'm now 25 and a big Sissy Spacek fan, so I decided to see it again. MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK!! It's never, EVER been released on video!! SO I had to do some scouting on ebay and a fellow who had it recorded off of Cinemax sold a copy to me. After all these years, I still don't get it and I am GLAD I don't get it. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!! It is like being inside a dream, a hallucination. Nothing makes sense, but it all does. There really isn't a huge plot, and if you read other users comments they can tell you what it is. Shelly Duvall and Sissy work in an assisted living home and their personalities somehow mix and switch. There's also a third woman (DUH!) played by an actress I have never seen in anything else, Janice Rule. But pay attention to her and EVERYTHING ELSE YOU SEE because it skips back to what happens earlier in the film. As any of you who know ANYTHING about this movie (or have read the other user comments) Robert Altman got the idea for this movie in a dream. Now I don't know who I'll be offending by this, but I'm not a HUGE Robert Altman fan. But this movie is SO different than anything I've seen that I just HAD to fall in love with it. The tone and atmosphere is so engrossing and sucks you in that you really don't care that it is a little bit over two hours long and doesn't move fast. You kind of think to yourself, "where is this going?" and you LIKE the fact that you do. I remember when I first watched this with my mom many years ago she said at the end "what the HELL did I just watch?" It's got symbolism, atmosphere, an eerie dreamlike feel to it and LOADS of images that stay with you. I think it is Shelly's best work and some of Sissy's too. The third woman is great as well. I would like to applaud EVERYONE who worked on this. If any of this sounds interesting to you, GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO SEE THIS TREMENDOUS MOVIE!! Makes me mad that studios don't produce these type of "character driven" movies anymore. I think maybe the 70's was the only time a movie like this could exist. Studios weren't afraid to take chances then. Write 20th Century Fox and DEMAND this movie come out on DVD. You don't always need an explanation for every movie you see, some movies, like life, don't have happy endings, or endings at all. Like one previous reviewer said, "just see it with an open mind, and TRY to sleep afterwards. You'll have the most amazing dream." I couldn't agree more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day I Met the Great Robert Altman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film somewhere in 1980/81 and after all these years (and 1000s of films seen) still have some unforgettable Images(!) from it in mind. As I recall, was this my first Altman movie. I became a great admirer of his work after seeing this and his other masterpieces (Nashville, M.A.S.H., Images, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, etc.) Now I know that 3 Women along with Andrzej Wayda's Man of Marble and Luis Bunuel's Discreet charm of...are "guilty" (main suspects) that I become a 'cinema fan' for life. They all showed me what Cinema could be and should be. For me, film is an art form and directors who have made (let's say) 5 such films as Altman did (so different but all (listed above) so excellent) are Artists. Details about 3 Women? Fascinating story, great performances (hats off to all 3 ladies, I still see Janice Rule in those pools), everything in right place. And all that is director's "fault", somebody has to direct (and in this case the same master even wrote the screenplay) all these efforts. But see for yourself. Film is a visual art (Images!). Words cannot describe all the pleasure one feels when experience such film like 3 Women. The 70's were obviously the golden years of Cinema in my life. So many fantastic movies! For me it's hard to say this film is one of Altman's best simply because he made so many great films, but it is my sentimental favorite. It was my first Altman and one of first 10/10s in my book. Glad to meet you, Mr. Altman. I recommend this film to all grown-up viewers all over the world. Open your mind, free your soul and see with your heart. Excuse my language. I forgot to remember to learn English better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sissy Spacek seemed to be cast as the "weirdo" only because of her obvious stereotype in the aftermath of Carrie. Many amateurish technical faults (painfully sliced camera movement; jerky panorama). For a while I was angered because directing style was like cheap Kubrick, story seemed like from some wannabe Stephen King and music reminded me of The Shining. But then you realize....this thing came out 3 years BEFORE The Shining.Themes loosely mirror All About Eve and Road House. The title is horrible ("3 Women" is a bad title, no matter what the context). And it's rather slow -- a very downed tale of 2 women meeting through work and eventually becoming roommates, that's it.I believe the end has something to do with the guilt the women feel, therefore their apparent obligation for Woman #3. That's why #3 asks "Why are you always so mean to her?" regarding Pinkie.If only she knew.Don't go out of your way to see this, but if you get the chance, sit through it.(And there must have been some chemical leak in that desert, because those people were just bizarre.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character study meets Rod Serling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of the movie is like a quirky character study. This part was intriguing, if strange and cringe-inducing. Millie is a woman who thinks she's in the center of life, but in reality is far from it. In scene after scene she is ignored, or made fun of behind her back. A naive Pinky (whose real name is also Mildred, while Millie is short for Mildred), comes into her life first as workmates, then roommates. Probably due to her limited experience she thinks Millie is just wonderful, while Millie sees her as first a convenience, then a nuisance.Then, the movie turns into the Twilight Zone. Here's where it all falls apart. After a vulgar browbeating by Millie, Pinky attempts suicide and, possibly due to brain damage from the attempt, changes personality and has problems remembering her past. The new personality is what Millie thinks she is, but this time it's real. A brash, confident, and actually nasty, self-obsessed person-and very popular. In a dream, remnants of Pinky's memory come back to her, and she starts to revert to her former self, or some amalgam of the two personalities. The final scene makes it seem as if the entire episode might have been the dream of the third woman, Willie (get it, the names are so similar, ha ha). Here, Millie is the mother to Pinky, and Willie may be the grandma or Millie's sister. Did it happen? Did they kill Edgar, the ne'er do well who was involved with all three, and just create some alternative family? Who knows. And more importantly, who cares? I normally don't give any mention to music, unless it's really bad or really good. Here, it's the former. Terrible, spitty flute playing tries to make this seem arty, but is just annoying and out of character for the scenes.This is an utterly forgettable experience, with no concern whatsoever for any deeper meaning. The acting is the only saving grace here. Shelley Duvall is both pathetic and creepy, while strangely engaging. Sissy Spacek really makes the character shine with tiny expressions that convey very well. She's believable both as a simpleton and a sophisticate. It is original, however, I'll give it that. Overall, unsatisfying and irrelevant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two types of film in the world: those you figure out, and those that take you along in directions you cannot understand initially. This, of course, is the latter (else I wouldn't be mentioning it), a film in which the viewer is not worthy of the first watch and certainly requires a second.Based on the director's dream, 3 Women is a film about multiple identities and Primal Scene. Two women, played perfectly by Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacek, struggle desperately for identity while a third, played by Janice Rule, entangles their imaginations with her primal and haunting art. As the women's personalities grow closer and simultaneously conflict with each other's developing personalities, the loud and noisy world of men begins to lose its necessity for their existence, and they begin to violently reject it, only in the most subconscious way.This is a film for symbolism. Colors, water, desert, advertising, everything is used for multiple, layered effect. Nothing is supposed to be taken merely by face value, and indeed it can't, because afterall, the haunting rhythm of the soundtrack will keep the viewer's heart racing even when it seems nothing particularly sinister is on the screen.Definitely a film for people who get into weird, abstract cinema and deep, didactic exposition.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked up this DVD from the public library, mainly because it is part of the Criterion Collection, which usually represents pretty good films. But egads! I'm sorry, but adding spastic flute music and very, VERY long fades of bad art work do not a good movie make. It just drrrrraaaaaaggggggggggggggggggged, and I felt like Robert Altman was thinking, let's make the worst movie we can, add some unbelievably pretentious and overblown "arty" elements to it, and see how many sheep out there we can get to say "oooooooo, wow, it's AMAZING! So cutting edge. So cryptic." Guys....it's awful! I usually can live without violence in movies, but when Spacek did a header into the pool, I cheered out loud. However, what followed seemed like an hour of hospital room coma scenes and I thought, my GOD, it has to get better. And that's what kept me watching, as I think is the case with many folks out there. We need to just find the ability to chuckle at ourselves a bit and say "ok, Altman got me on this one." Don't watch it again and again, searching for the meaning in it all. In the literature included with the DVD there is a statement, something like, "It was Altman's goal to shoot the entire movie with no screenplay." That explains why we see, literally 45 seconds of footage of a person walking from a car into a bar. Just walking. Nothing's going to fall on his head. Nothing's going to happen. He's just walking. Still walking. Anyway, if you want to watch a good movie about dysfunctional relationships and women, rent "The Hours".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek) is an introverted young woman starting work at a health spa in California. She is so shy that on her first day at work, she doesn't even challenge her co-worker Millie Lammoreaux (Shelley Duvall) who mistakes her for a client. Millie needs a roommate and Pinky quickly snaps it up. However Pinky's quiet loner nature turns Millie against her. After Millie berates Pinky, Pinky takes a suicidal dive into the pool leaving her in a coma. When she wakes up, there's a change in Pinky and Millie finds strange occurrences perpetrated by Pinky.The first half is fine with Spacek and Duvall playing to their comfort zones. I kept wondering where this movie is going with this. Then it takes a hard turn into Single White Female situation. That is a great turn but it doesn't continue as I expected. It goes into a surreal sojourn in some kind of poetic journey. It's definitely a surprise but I'm not convinced that it's a good surprise. I think a more simpler road with the two girls would be more compelling especially considering the third woman is only a minor character. Maybe there's a point in the surreal poetry that I missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek) is an awkward adolescent who starts work at a spa in the California desert. She becomes overly attached to fellow spa attendant, Millie (Shelley Duvall), when she becomes Millie's room-mate.Roger Ebert named this the best film of 1977, but despite the praise, for twenty-seven years, the film was unavailable on home video. Thank you, Criterion, for finding these lost gems and giving them the proper treatment they deserve! What we actually have are two women, both named Mildred (though neither goes by it). Yes, there is a third, but the relationship between Pinky and Millie is the core here. And it is odd. Not only are these two actresses very unconventional in appearance, but they are just so strange. While Robert Altman deserves a great deal of credit, the real stars of this production are Spacek and Duvall, who transformed this from a script into a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One of the best movies out there"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 women is about identity theft. For example, one young girl arrives at the job on her first day, and meets a self-confident worker, who ends up having a room to rent in her apartment. The new employee is marvelled by the other and after she tries to commit suicide and recovers - inherently takes over the personality of the self-confident worker. It is done in such a crafty way, that the viewer has no real idea that it happened. Hence making this moving one of the best movies out there.I really like the character of the self-confident worker, because she was so strong that the indifference from the actual circumstances did not even put a dent in her self-confidence. She was so sure of herself, and at the same time it was so utter misplaced. For example, she would go to the doctors lounge on her lunch break, and sit next to doctors and keep on talking and none of the doctors would respond to her. She just sat there talking and talking away. They took no notice of her. When she got up, she would say, it was great talking to you, I've gotten go now, see you all tomorrow. And there would be little or no reaction from the doctors, still she would get up and walk towards the exit, being in seventh heaven.(It was a Criterion movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful moments, but didn't quite work for me on 1st viewing - but I'll watch it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel a bit stupid on this one. Lionized by most critics as a neglected masterpiece, I certainly liked it, and respected it's lofty aims, but didn't flat out love it. The two lead performances by Sissy Spacek and Shelly Duvall are wonderful, and the film has more than its share of powerful and creepy moments. But the film ? based on a dream Altman had, and not trying to make any literal sense ? feels overly self-conscious and arty at times. I found the music intrusive, almost shouting 'see how weird this is?' And a lot of the symbolism, like the paintings that run through the film, feels a bit heavy handed and obvious. Alternately some of the plot twists feel flat out arbitrary. This is often compared to David Lynch's dream films Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway. But I found both of those films a little more fun, and they felt more cohesive in their dream worlds, even if I didn't always know what was going on. Now, having said all that, I do look forward to seeing it again. I've often found some of my very favorite films are complex and challenging works that don't quite jell for me on 1st viewings, only to have those petty annoyances fall away on a second look. In any case, if you're up for something challenging, this is a terrifically acted, unique and brave film, and certainly worth a look, whatever your personal reaction. And - since it's a film that plays on subconscious more than literal levels - I suspect no two people will react to this exactly the same way.</fullReview>

Their souls can be identified with the musical score. ...one of the most eccentric, yet (or because of this) most wonderful scores ever composed for a movie! I can't imagine a superior music for this film. In some scenes you hear only three instruments; they "try" to play in a harmony, but they are caught in mistunes."Three women" could hold you forever, if you are ready to.

		<shortDescription>A buried treasure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 Women is one of Robert Altman's best films as well as one of the most interesting buried treasures of the 1970s. Sissy Spacek (in a performance almost as creepy as "Carrie") arrives at work at an old age home and quickly insinuates herself into the life of loser co-worker Shelley Duvall. Duvall, in a performance that justly won her the Best Actress Award at Cannes, is at her quirkiest as a feckless wannabe who has no idea that she has absolutely no life. Her "friends" snicker at her warm greetings and her co-workers avoid her. Why Spacek invades her life is a mystery. That may very well be Altman's point. These pathetic lives are interchangeable. The film reaches an almost surreal level when Duvall and Spacek help pregnant wacko artist Janice Rule (the third woman of the title) give birth...the "3 Women" live happily ever after...What it all means is up to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the strangest and most intriguing films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie very late at night on a PBS channel some 3-4 years ago and it's stuck with me ever since. It took me up until 3 or 4 months ago to figure out the title of this film and who directed it after searching for plots that had something to do with this film. I managed to narrow it down after remembering the lead character in the film was played by the same woman who played Jack's wife in The Shining (Shelley Duvall, of course), but I still have not been able to find this film on video anywhere.I have a feeling this is one of those films they only play late at night and it's for a good reason. When I stumbled upon it, I immediately felt like I was dreaming something (then I later learned that the idea for this film came to Altman in a dream). Then when I realized I was awake, I was drawn into the film and mesmerized by it. There is a very, very strange subliminal quality in the way that this movie was filmed that you can never quite put your finger on and the stop-start score is very effective and especially chilling in its effect. I can't imagine what watching this film in a heavily intoxicated state would be like.I would give anything to see this film again and if any of you ever get the opportunity to view this film on PBS or any late night film channel with the courage to show something interesting and unusual, DO NOT MISS THIS FILM AT ANY COST! I had never seen anything like "3 Women" before or and I have never seen anything like it since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time on TV. Never heard of it as one of Altman's films. I gave it a shot for the cast and of course Altman. It has this 1970's eerie sort of style. Reminds me of a bit of Scorcese's Sisters with the exception that this one is not as bloody. The haunting music is a constant reminder of something bazaar is going to happen. The almost silent appearances of Janice Rule's character is mythical and symbolic.I think this film is a symbol of a filmmaker who hadn't sold out yet and it shows the experimental and creative quality of what filmmaking is about, which also represents the era. Perhaps now the style of filmmaking is gear toward entertainment in which a film like this with the experimental quality is suppressed. I have to admit, after this film, I am looking at Altman from a different angle. Since I discredited him for making Gingerbread Man, now, he had regain my respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Altman masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being one of America's most unpredictable directors, Robert Altman is typically shuttled into two narrow categories: expansive, multi charactered grand opera, and small scale character studies."3 Women" lies somewhere in the middle. A cross between "Mulholland Drive" and Bergman's "Persona", "3 Women" is a daring piece of cinema that glides along the edge of weirdness and somehow manages not to fall off.Dreamlike and ethereal, Altman's darkly humorous psychodrama about the odd friendship between two female sanatorium workers (Pinky and Millie) takes its time getting its hooks into you. But when it does, it's mesmerising.The late 70s Southern California setting is appropriately creepy for Altman's tale, with vast barren deserts, sweltering heat and sun baked walls. It's the perfect landscape for Altman to ponder his themes of identity and...well I'm not quite sure what the film tries to say. On the director's commentary track Altman claims to be clueless as well, recounting how the film came to him in a vivid dream.The film involves a character called Millie (Shelly Duvall) who works at a sanatorium. Altman portrays her as a cliché of post teenage femininity. An airhead and thoughtless consumer, she's the byproduct of a vacuous society, existing only to please men, try on clothes, cook and look pretty. Enter Pinkie, played by Sissy Spacek. Pinkie idolises Millie and wants to be just like her. She takes Millie's social security number, habits and even house, as she gradually becomes her twin. The notion of twins is repeated throughout the film, as Altman suggests that man latches onto identities, forging our own habits and sense of personality by emulating others.The third woman in the story is a character called Willie. She's a pregnant women who drifts silently through the desert, always with a melancholy look on her face. Her husband is Edgar, a clichéd oaf of a man.From here on the film begins to paint a rather odd relationship between it's characters. The young, sex starved airhead (25ish year old Millie) begins to move in on Edgar, leaving the pregnant Willie sad and lonely. Essentially the young adult is stealing the man from the mother. The child, played by Pinkie, grows resentful, feeling that attention is being drawn away from her. She throws a tantrum (literally throwing herself in the pool), after which she re-emerges a new woman.Pinkie has now matured, becoming a young adult herself. She's sexually awakened, flirts with men and has become a magazine reading slave to social trends, just like Millie. But Millie herself has changed. Shocked by Pinkie's transformation she begins to grow worried. She's now a concerned parent and worried mother, forever fretting for Pinkie. She leaves behind all her old habits and evolves into Willie.Pinkie, now increasingly more "adult", begins to flirt with Edgar. She's usurped both Millie and Willie and now claims the prise (Edgar) for her own. Eventually the film ends with the 3 Women killing Edgar. Millie becomes a mother, Pinkie becomes the child and Willie becomes a grandmother. Without a man to dominate and consume their attention, these 3 women live alone in the desert, assuming the usual gender roles, but this time in a sort of weird matriarchy. So in a sense each of the women represents a kind of Id, ego and superego relationship. Willie the Supergo and conscience, Millie the self serving ego, and Pinkie the Id, completely childlike. On another level, all 3 women represent a single body, each character representing different gender/age traits that are picked up and discarded as the girl journeys from childhood to womanhood and eventually to death. So these 3 "women" are essentially in a state of flux within one "body". They're at war, racing from birth to maturity, frantically reconciling and vying for identities, all evolving around the conquest or winning of the male Other.8.5/10- Fascinating stuff. Watch how the film loops on itself, each of its environments symbolising different stages in Pinkie's evolution. We begin in a home for the old (which ironically has what looks like a birthing pool), then systematically travelling from adolescence to post adolescence to the dry wilderness of maturity and death.Worth two viewings. Who knew Altman does Lynch better than Lynch himself?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Altman is pure genius. I cannot think of a film that creates poetry from the sprawling conversations, languid mise-en-scene and chilling performances as well as this film.While other films achieve brilliance with more didactic approaches (agnes varda's le bonheur) poetic strangeness (immamura's the eel) social satire (ang lee's the ice storm) or dream like frenzy (fellini's Casanova) this film achieves with wandering observations, unpointed scenes and internal conflicts that are both funny and dramatic.His performance style is so uniquely wonderful.. and recent work such as Gosford Park confirms this...but I think he had his most idiosyncratic performance style happening here...and of course in "A wedding" and "Quintet".There is also something camp about this film -- that conjures the recent work of Todd Haynes.</fullReview>

Pinky, immediately starts to like Millie, and becomes fascinated with her and when she finds out that Millie's roommate left and she is looking for a new one Pinky, immediately becomes the new roommate. The two of them start to bond with each other but soon realize in many ways they are the exact opposite of each other. But one day after an accident occurs all that is going to change. Winner of The Best Actress Award for Shelley Duvall (who plays Millie Lammoreaux) at The Cannes Film Festival, The LAFCA Award for Best Actress at The Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards and The NYFCC Award for Best Supporting Actress (Sissy Spacek, who plays Pinky Rose) at The New York Film Critics Circle Awards. 3 Women has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved (especially Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek), good cinematography, good film editing and good art direction. 3 Women, is a very well crafted film. The film has an excellent script and is very unique and original and the whole film feels kind of dreamlike and the film apparently is supposed to be according to writer, director and producer Robert Altman who based the film on several of his dreams. The film has great character study, and is very compelling and thought provoking and just kept me interested until the film ended. The film is also a nice looking film and we have some excellent performances here from the two lead actresses. 3 Women, is in many ways a small film but it is very powerful and has a big impact and I absolutely loved it. A masterpiece of a film that I'm glad is on DVD so many others can discover it.</fullReview>

Another genius film from the 70's. In this era of mindless reality television. This film is shot like a documentary and the acting comes, (as all great acting should) from a very impulsive - dangerous place. This is by far my favorite Altman film. Perfect.

		<shortDescription>Robert Altman is an unappreciated genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Robert Altman. He has made some of the most unique motion pictures that we are ever likely to see, and you can always rely on Altman to create remarkable characters in his films.Although everyone tends to state that Nashville (1975) is Altman's masterpiece, I think that honour goes to Short Cuts (1993). However, 3 Women is a close second.I remember seeing this really late one night a few years ago, at about 1:30am. I had already seen some Altman pictures, and especially wanted to see this after reading how good it was.I was just surprised at HOW good it was. The music score from the opening scene immediately caught my interest, indicating that this would be something special.The story had me gripped from start to finish - it didn't even bother me that it is such a slow moving film, as I wasn't eager to have it come to an end!The performances are outstanding. 3 Women provided Shelley Duvall with the greatest role of her sporadic career - she plays Millie Lammoreaux so well that it's difficult to picture anyone else doing it. I think I read that Altman allowed Duvall to write most of her dialogue and Millie's dialogue is what makes the film so special - that sounds strange when most of the time she's talking about recipes for her microwave oven that can be cooked in 20 minutes, but believe me it's true! Duvall won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for this film, but an Oscar nomination was sadly not forthcoming.Duvall is supported brilliantly by Sissy Spacek, who should be applauded for taking the role of Pinky Rose after her star-making, Oscar nominated performance in Carrie (1976). Although she was in her thirties at the time, Spacek is consistently childlike in this film, even looking about 13 years old! I found her endearing as "sweet" Pinky and somewhat disturbing when she comes out of the coma, transforming into "horrible" Pinky!Janice Rule has little to do as Willie, but some of her facial expressions are first rate.This is a hard film to describe and difficult for me to urge others to see it - not because I don't think it is wonderful, but because it NEVER seems to be on TV and has NEVER been on videotape (and I doubt it will ever make it on to DVD, either). However, if you should ever catch it, you should not be disappointed. Believe me, you'll be engrossed in five minutes flat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Altman Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps one of his best. Altman captures the sense of things being out-of-kilter as few movies have. The images that still haunt me after all these years are the paintings in the swimming pool. The one-sided relationship of Sissy Spacek to Shelly Duval. Everything in the movie is dream-like, as it should be since it was inspired by a dream. I wish I could see it again but it isn't on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Altman's third best film (after Nashville and McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller), I think is finally gaining some ground, even by the tough critics. It's a beautiful piece about identity, identity in America, the Southwest, the late 70's, and purpose in an arid state of flux. If you don't like Altman, you're probably not even reading this stuff (unfortunately; sorry Reagan and Nixon; no politics here, but..), you should be gleeful that this film bombed and even some critics ravaged it in '77. SPOILERS** - I won't intentionally discuss the plot, but I might, by accident. Shelley Duvall, who seems to creep most people out (except in THE SHINING, which makes sense) is fragile, outgoing, swept away by purple and yellow whirlwinds of yuppie cuisine, while never losing her standards of excellence, while maintaining her role as the heroine. Sissy Spacek (one of my personal favorites since BADLANDS) should have won a Supporting Oscar as Pinky, one of her most chameleon-type characters ever, with Janice Rule (great in THE CHASE) as the Third Woman. This is a truly original film. I don't care if Robert Altman dreamt this or he was fighting Hollywood's issues in the late 70's (which he was; correctly); whatever. This movie will take you to places similar to Electra Glide in Blue a few years earlier (Robert Blake, Elisha Cook) in terms of American Southwest justice (or anywhere, really), but with a tone of expectation beyond the mood or the inevitable forces of nature to explain it to you (i.e. government, religion, good cars) and prompts you to take flight for a bit and stick it out to see WHAT JUST MAY happen or not, juct 'cuz. After ANNIE HALL, this was the 2nd best film of that year even if you don't get it (I'm still working on it and I'm no kid). There are areas of grey and pink going on here (beside the paintings) that could you remind you of Taos or Paris or that perfect canyon of confusion once you start a new JOB! This flick has FINALLY been released by Criterion on DVD (unbelievably) and it is totally find-able for anybody (I guess for Altman fans, which I am)...whoever. Unless you need plenty of car crashes and aliens and bad diaglogue and acting, you might find a palm tree here in this gem (which was discarded for many years) or not. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"3 Women" was filmed in 1977, and it has that 70s look to it. Their apartment, around a swimming pool, was much like the apartment I lived in during the early 70s. I watched it mainly because I am a fan of Sissy Spacek, who was 28 here, but looked closer to 18 or 20.By any account this is a strange movie, and Altman surely enjoyed writing and directing "his dream", but that alone cannot make it a good movie. Spacek and Shelly Duvall both are fine actors here. Funny, in some quiet dialog Duvall asks Spacek where she is from, "Near Longview? Is it Quitman?"Quitman, Texas, is actually where Spacek grew up!I am frankly amazed at the several "user reviews" here saying what a great movie it is. The first thing that hit me is how much the industry has raised the standards of costuming, filming, and background sounds and music over the past 20-plus years. My rating for this movie, considering others I have seen, is "5" of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>warning: contains spoilersBut maybe I don't need to issue that warning, if a spoiler is something thatreveals movements of a plot, because this film didn't really have a plot...ew, I really didn't care for it. It's not that I'm so attached to plots. I like things without plots, often I do. But this film, man, it was like being trapped in a horrible waiting room for two hours, a waiting room that reeked of cheap lemon air freshener, no, a room that smelled like a lemon candy that's been sitting in the mouth of a dead person for a month. It was like an acting class from the seventies where all the chicks are sleeping with the teacher. It was like an acting class from the seventies given a giant budget and told, 'you are brilliant, share yourself with the world. Bestow upon the world your macho sexual desires for underage chicks that weigh 80 pounds. Be generous! Make the duration of the film more than two hours. Yes, put in the weird chick with a big floppy hat. Have her wear eyeliner! Put in guns, blood, for God's sake, throw in a foxy pair of twins and do not stop there, put in an EXCRUCIATING childbirth scene, where the baby is a corpse. Oh, the brilliance! It's blinding me!" Okay, I'm being a hater, I know. I'm being a hater cos I hated it. There was nothing I liked about it. Ick. Self indulgent with no universality, no plot, no beauty, I didn't like the acting style. So American, so stagey. Nasty, awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70's cinema not quite ready to be unearthed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Altman is often highly praised even through his lesser achievements. But I had high hopes for this film I'd never heard of. Spacek and Duvall are some of my favorite actresses and I was ready to see them bring about a really meaty delivery. Instead this film and its ideas are as dated as the costumes. I have also recently viewed Bergman's Persona which was first and far, far superior to this languid, dull attempt at the psychological puzzle. There were no character developments that anyone could possibly be interested in, and the whole film is underscored by one of the most annoying, overused score in any film I've ever seen.I loved the performances of these actresses, but there is no script or anything of interest to put them into context. There are a series of events that at this point are mundane and uninteresting if you've seen any of Altman's films. Sure, this is an attempt at the extreme, but for my time there was zero to no payoff. At least Bergman's cinematography alone makes his film memorable. No such luck here. The imagery is heavy-handed and obvious. Sorry guys, NOT a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and surreal, but plot less, pretentious and ultimately pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say up front, if you don't like artsy films, run! A decade and multiple viewings after my first exposure to "3 Women," I remain ambivalent in my feelings for it.To provide true spoilers would be nearly impossible, since there is no discernible plot to this film ? merely themes. Introverted Spacek (fresh from "Carrie" and tackling a somewhat similar role) befriends outgoing Duvall, who no one really likes. The third of the three women is artist Rule, who has little screen time or purpose to her presence.The entire film feels like a dream (or a nightmare, depending upon your tolerance for it) and ends with the most ambiguous final scene ever, leading one to wonder if perhaps it was the dream of one of the three characters (or perhaps it's the ending itself that was the dream). There's plenty of pointless dialogue and situations, and weirdness abounds. The performances are excellent, the visuals stunning and the score is appropriately inscrutable. If only there were any sense to be made from it.After 27 years, it finally received the lavish video release that it deserves, complete with a stunning widescreen transfer and an audio commentary by director Robert Altman (though the commentary fails to shed much light on the enigma that is "3 Women"). Like all Criterion discs, the price tag conjures up images of rape (I don't get why Criterion discs are 5 times the price of their studio-released counterparts), but it's well worth it for those willing to take the risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot tell you exactly why I have loved this film from the moment Ifirst saw it. I just did. I waited in vain, for a couple of decades, for it to come out on video and quietly rejoiced when it came out onDVD.On second viewing, I realized that it casts a spell that transcendscasting, the script, storyline the visuals. I think, personally, that itshaunting quality is born of some peculiar alchemy, born of all itselements, the combition of casting, script and visuals. Not thatmany of its individual elements are not captivating. I especiallyliked Ms. Duvall. Sissy Spacek is incredibly beautiful. The art workis spell-binding.In the end, I think, its message remains ineffable. Is it a feministparable? Is it about the triumph of the human spirit? Is it about theredemptive power of simple human decency? Is it about theimportance and power of character to transcend and transform? Is it about the depth and complexity of all human souls, even thesouls of the untutored and unprivileged? I could go on. That is probably what makes this film so haunting. It is about so many things. But there is something just plainhaunting about it.And it is rare that a film is as enchanting as you recall it being,especially after almost 30 years. Only very special films are. Thisone is. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schizophrenic Altman finds middle ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Altman's 1977 film 3 Women, which he wrote and directed from a dream he had, is not a bad film, but not a great film either. It is one of those films, ala Robert Browning, whose reach exceeds its grasp, but not in the good way. It is intended to work on a dream level, yet it is too realistic in its detail for much of the film to be seen as all dream, and not quite bizarre enough to be real dream, especially in its far too forced, and ultimately failed, ending.Some critics have likened the film to Ingmar Bergman's Persona, but this is a stretch. Even though that film is a bit overrated in the Bergman canon, 3 Women is nowhere in that league as a work of art: not as film, social commentary, nor work of symbolism. It has some elements in common with Roman Polanski's Repulsion, about another female misfit on the verge of insanity, as well as to the later, and far inferior, David Lynch mystery film Mulholland Drive, which was also about two women in a dreamy scenario.The film follows the life of two lonely women who can only be called 'losers'. Millie Lammoreaux (Shelley Duvall) is an ugly worker at a California old folks' health spa. She is unpopular, shunned by her co-workers- who ignore her blather despite her not realizing it, yet lives in a world of her own making, where all people like her, she is among the popular set, and life is made better by magazine ads and cooking recipes that involve all pre-processed foods and no real cooking ability. She is so clueless that every time she drives her mustard colored heap of a car her yellow skirt always gets caught in the door, and hangs outside. She also wears hideous yellow bathrobes with hoods to her apartment complex's pool, yet thinks all the men desire her.She becomes co-workers and roommates ($55 a month- those were the days!) with an even odder girl who comes to work at the spa, one day, and seems to lack a past, even though she claims to be from Texas, like Millie. Her name is also Mildred, although she goes by the nickname Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek). Pinky is a redhead who seems almost autistic (as she would be labeled these days), and is even less capable of existing in the world....The third woman of the film is an older woman, Willie Hart (Janice Rule), who is pregnant, cold, silent, and paints bizarre man-hating pictures of pregnant gargoyle-like creatures on tiles and in pools, that seem to betray her bitterness, especially toward her no account husband, Edgar (Robert Fortier), a buffoonish would be macho man, and ex-stunt double in Western films, who is as big a joke to his sex as the two girls are to theirs, due to his penchant for guns, motorcycles, and beer. The two of them own the apartment complex, The Purple Sage- a sort of pre-Melrose Place Melrose Place for losers, the two girls share an apartment in, and also own a shitty bar, Dodge City, out in the desert, where macho loses race dirt bikes...Then, Altman tanks the film with wan surrealism that fails...Clearly the film is trying to show that all three women are merely aspects of one person- likely Millie, since Pinky is a younger Millie who shunned her name, and Willie is an older Millie whose name's first name is an upside down M...Despite its oneiric pretensions, and some pluses, the film, as a whole, never fully comes together, and ends as a pale muddle of Freudian nonsense, and pseudo-symbolism; such as Pinky's death and rebirth in the pool, that, while interesting, at times, is best described as that misfit beast- 'the noble failure.' Robert Altman has always been a hit and miss director....and, unlike Michelangelo Antonioni's best films, which often seem to end not at their chronological ends, this film's ending is not the work of a carefully placed artist's inventiveness, just stylized randomness rationalized after the fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Altman portrays a group of women who apparently start switching personalities. Much of the movie is left deliberately vague, but that adds to its neat factor. As in every Altman movie, the dialogue often overlaps, and the cast members are clearly making up the roles themselves.Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall do as good a job as one can expect from them. But don't be surprised if the whole movie confuses you; "3 Women" is not any kind of overblown Hollywood production. It's just Altman doing what he does best. Worth seeing.Making up a social security number. Hmm...</fullReview>

Did not find it funny, clever, or cute despite someone calling this a 'black comedy' there is nothing comedic about it, and I find it to be disgusting because it is a waste of time and has weird ugly looking women all throughout it whom I find to be very annoying to listen to talk and they have nothing good to say. This movie is rubbish. If you want to watch something equally as engrossing why not go to a home that has weird and whacky ugly men and women and listen to them talk- you might get just as much out of them if not more than you would from watching this piece of a crap film.</fullReview>
