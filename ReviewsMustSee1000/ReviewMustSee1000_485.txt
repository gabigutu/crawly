		<shortDescription>Crackerjack Thriller with a message...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? Well for starters there is the best chase sequence since The French Connection. Then there is Will Smith as an actor - not just a star, though later in the movie he is admittedly overshadowed by veteran Gene Hackman.There are two layers to this movie: On the surface is a pacy thriller with edge-of-the-seat chases but underneath lies a telling commentary on government surveillance. It is one of those truth-in-fiction stories which makes its point about government intrusion into privacy dramatically and effectively.There are references to the classic, The Conversation: The surveilled couple talking in the park, and the Hackman character's premises are an obvious recreation of his workshop in the earlier movie. If you haven't yet seen The Conversation - see it before you see this one - you will understand the Hackman character a lot better (besides, it is a superb movie in its own right).Oh, and Jon Voight is terrific as the bad guy...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how I missed this in theaters, but I watched it for the first time tonight. I almost gave it a 10, because this is as good as the suspense/action drama gets. Somebody on the DVD special features called it "...a combination of Crimson Tide, The French Connection, and 3 Days of the Condor." From my list of favorites I'd also say it has aspects of Marathon Man, The Fugitive, and The Firm. Will Smith, whose work does not thrill me 100% of the time, is terrific, and Gene Hackman could not have been better. They also receive support from some great character actors, many of them UNCREDITED (a fact which blew me away). My enjoyment was enhanced by being familiar with Hackman's The Conversation, in which he plays Harry Caul, one of the world's greatest audio surveillance men. His hideout/office in Enemy is reminiscent of Caul's digs, and the photograph which the bad guys have on file for him is of his character from The Conversation. I sort of wish they'd named the new character Caul, giving long-term continuity to the story. I'm running off at the fingers here, so I won't elaborate on the location, direction, etcetera, but will end with SEE THIS FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like this one, also beeing somewhat realistic (not in every detail of course).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I like this one. I like the cast, the visuals are well done, but what is more important is the plot that I like really much. It's not the most sophisticated plot of all times, but I think it's quite good, and to some degree, realistic. Of course it's not possible to move sattelites that quickly, or zoom in on a videotape that much and still have crystal-clear visual, but quite some technology seen is realistic today, or in the near future. This is an hollywood flick, all right, so they have quite much action and everything looks very easy, steering a sattelite seems to be no harder than playing a video game, what makes it all seem a bit unrealistic/sci-fi-like, but today's technical posibilities are quite large, and continue to grow, so informing oneself about the issue (I mean the real world issue) is not a bad idea.To give you some points to think:- It's routine for the credid card companies to document every transaction made with the cards, go figure who gets the docs if police is investigating.- Every call / fax done is documented for billing, go figure, who...- At least for your ISP it's possible to read every unencrypted email you send or receive, go figure ...- Today there are MANY cameras in public areas in Great Britain, with numbers still growing.- Face recognition software is already being used in combination with some surveillance cameras.- Dictation software that can interpret your spoken word and convert it into written text is being sold to you today, maybe some organisations have much better versions at their hands ...The list could go on, but what I want to say is that one should think about the posibilities and listen to what the politicians say, and what they want to allow the federal organisations.You want to be able to still _enjoy_ the movie in some years time, not thinking of it as being somewhat normal just as everyday life, all right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller - Hackman makes it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sucessful lawyer Robert Dean is passed information by an old friend without noticing. Seconds later that friend is killed and Dean is targeted by a group within the Government who wish to cover up a conspiracy involving the murder of a congressman. With the Government's full weight of surveillance equipment brought to bear Dean turns to ex-NSA agent Brill to help protect him, find the information and get it out into the open.This is much better than the ususal summer crash, bang, wallop stuff we usually get fed. It's greatly helped by the sense of paranonia that runs through the whole story from the Government's power and corruption at some levels. The film starts well, with 'everyman' Dean being drawn into a game of cat and mouse, framed for a crime he didn't commit and forced to go on the run from Government agents. Will Smith carries the film only so far but it realy gets interesting when Hackman turns up as Brill. He casts light on the ability of the government and is almost able to play them at their own game. Brill makes an appearance when the film starts to become too much of a staight chase movie.To me the use of Hackman as Brill is the best bit of casting ever and makes this film stand out as being clever. In the 70's Hackman played a surveillance expert in Copolla's The Conversation. The film ends with Hackman being monitored himself, with him ripping his house apart looking for the bugs. What makes his casting as Brill so good is that Brill is where Hackman's "The Conversation" character would be 20 years on - it feels like it's the same character again. The director also deserves a lot of praise - he manages to keep the pace up throughout the film, whether it be scenes of chasing action or technological pursuit. The script helps as well - the conspiracy and the paranoia is strong throughout.Smith is good in the lead, but he isn't quite as good an "everyman" as classic actors as Cary Grant or James Stewart were. Smith also struggles to carry the whole movie and the chases do get a bit samey after a while. Fortunately Hackman is brilliant as Brill, he is a classy actor and brings a lot of weight to the film just as Smith begins to feel the strain. Jon Voight is also good as the villian of the piece. The supporting cast is deep! There were so many famous faces in small roles that I really felt this was an allstar cast, despite the fact that it's a Smith vehicle. Gabriel Byrne makes a fleeting appearance, Ian Hart is there, Jake Busey (son of Gary) shows up, Jason Lee (actor in many Kevin Smith films) witnesses the murder, a gorgeous Lisa Bonet has a small part, James Le Gros, Regina King etc etc. The cast is well packed with famous faces - they don't all get the chance to put on a show but it adds quality at all levels.Overall this is a fancy chase movie, but good direction, a strong and deep cast and a fantastic Hackman all make this film much better than it could have been. The last scene of the film is a little too upbeat but other than that it's pretty good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy of the State (1998) Review: This is a different direction for many. Will Smith for one and some noticeable comedic actors are here, but this is no comedy.Enemy of the State is quite a movie. What is the main point of this is the plot. It works in many ways. In a situation like this, anyone with connections and power can have access to such technology to track down anyone who knows far too much. It's quite real. Scary in a real sort of way.Another truly strong point here is the acting. Will Smith and Gene Hackman deliver excellent performances. Smith showed great emotion and Hackman had conviction. Not just these two were great, we have Jon Voight as well. But what really got me is the acting from other characters as Seth Green, Barry Pepper, Jake Busey, and even Jack Black. These people are great especially Black who is really acting here! Black should have realised that comedy is not his thing if suspense and drama are as he is great here.Overall, we get great acting, a fine plot, and fast, character development and fast and intense action as well. Sound like a winner to me. Enemy of the State is fresh and original and clever. One of Smith's finest movies.The Last Word: Don't miss. Gripping and Suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting plot, will make you wonder who's watching you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Voight, Will Smith, and Gene Hackman are the three stars who make this movie interesting. Voight is a rogue NSA operative and Smith quite accidentally gets on his trail without even realizing it. Hackman provides the key to exposing the crooks and facilitating a reasonable ending. Watching this movie makes you wonder how much of the surveillance depicted can really be done today by our governments. Although the movie has its share of violence, and an ending out of Reservoir Dogs, it also is sprinkled with some good humor. If you like action and espionage, then you'll like this movie. The DVD picture and soundtrack are both excellent. I give the movie overall 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping - Got My Attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled onto this thriller while channel surfing in an Istanbul hotel room. I missed the first 20 minutes, but it didn't take long to be drawn into the story. In fact, the action is so fast and gripping that I didn't dare get up to take a pee for fear of missing something. Now that's gripping!Earlier today I saw a report on cameras no larger than the size of a pill that can make a movie of your digestive tract, from mouth to anus. Now if such miniature devices are already a reality, then some of the tracking technology used in this film must be close to reality - maybe too close for comfort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The murder of a congressman is caught on tape and Robert Dean (Will Smith) has it. He has to save his family career and life all in 2 hours! Although the plot twists aren't always surprising they are convincing. Gene Hackman plays the role of the paranoid informant wonderfully but Will Smith can't help being funny no matter how hard he tries. Tony Scott shows the action from surveillance camera and telephoto angles giving an edgy feeling throughout the picture. Most of the chases are on foot keeping car chases are kept to a minimum. The chases technically well done but seem to be missing an over the edge quality like most of the movie.The story moves along at a good speed making it a good action movie with a solid plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite action-films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy Of The State is one of the few movies I went out of my way to see in the theater ( I'm a video-rental guy) and it's indeed a grand action-movie. The big surplus is of course the great messages behind the film. It entails a fear that we all have in some degree, the loss of our privacy. Of course all the Hollywood-elements are present: the returning catchphrases and jokes, the over-dramatic scenes, etc. but Scott never goes too far. The pacing is great and the film's over before you know it even though it has a relatively long run-time( for an action-movie) of 120 min. Will Smith is solid but Gene Hackman is the one who steals the show. It's the first movie I saw that starred him (I was only 10 when the movie came out and I've been a big fan ever since.Tony Scott's new movie, Deja Vu, really is a lot like EOTS in many ways but I still deem EOTS to be superior. Deja Vu is great of course but I guess I add some sentimental value to EOTS. It's really a must-see for action/thriller fans and I do not say this lightly.EOTS fully deserves it's 8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conspiracy theorists who enjoy films like JFK and Conspiracy Theory will have a lot to enjoy with Enemy of the State. For a film that came out almost 10 years ago, it seems just slightly ahead its time. I don't remember everything about 1998, but I do know that things like DVD was in it's nascent stages and although the internet has been part of our vernacular for almost 20 years now, the technology prevalent back in 98 as opposed to now is light years apart. And in the post 911 days, having the idea of our privacy abolished is pretty much upon us. Maybe not to the extent perpetuated in this film, but we are pretty much under Big Brother's watchful eye all the time. When you walk into a bank, a restaurant, a convenience store or any public place, you are photographed and recorded and your image can be recalled with a simple enough click of a button. Even today when you call places like phone company's or pizza parlours you hear a recorded message that says this call may be recorded for quality purposes. We are being watched and kept tabs on everywhere we go and in everything we do. In this vein, Enemy of the State is a marvel. It is a film way ahead of it's time. No one could foresee the tragedy of 911, but now that it is part of our history books, films like The Siege and this one are that much more clairvoyant.Will Smith plays a Washington attorney whose life is turned inside out when he is given a disc that has a political murder on it. He doesn't know that it does and when an unsanctioned government spook squad comes after him, he is confused and out of his element. Gene Hackman plays Brill, who might as well be an older version of Harry Cauld, his character from Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation. He is a communications expert that has basically gone mercenary and no longer does the dirty work for the CIA and other seedy government factions. Smith needs his help attempting to understand what it all means and how he got entangled in this imbroglio. While Smith is the star of the film, it is clearly Hackman that steals the show with his vernacular and expertise on the subject.The film is also blessed with so many bit players that are now either famous or semi famous that it's like watching a Robert Altman film such as The Player. There are that many famous faces in here. Barry Pepper, Jake Busey, Jack Black, Jaime Kennedy, Jason Lee, Gabriele Byrne, Tom Sizemore and Jason Robards all show up in the film in supporting roles. Add to that the incomparable Jon Voight and you have one hell of a cast.Enemy of the State moves at a break neck pace. It is directed with a kinetic urgency and Tony Scott shows us why he is one of the best in the business with his style. I can't imagine many haven't seen this, but for those that haven't, it is definitely one of Jerry Bruckheimer's best. And that is saying something.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most entertaining thrillers of the late 1990's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An successful attorney from Washington D.C. by the name Robert Dean Clayton (Will Smith). Which Robert without his knowledge is given a video by his college friend (Jason Lee). Which his friend is trying to hide from mysterious strangers, who been after him until he dies unexpectedly by a fire truck. In that video has a murder of an top political elderly man (An uncredited:Jason Robards Jr.) and the man, who responsible for the murder is a corrupted national security agency man (Jon Voight). Now Dean's normal life is been after by a lethal team of skilled NSA surveillance team. They are ruthless and they will do everything to complete their mission until a mystery man (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Gene Hackman) helps Dean to be away from NSA and destroy, whoever they are responsible for destroying his life.Directed by Tony Scott (Beverly Hills Cop 2, The Hunger, True Romance) made an extremely entertaining thriller with plenty of action and humour. This was one of the biggest hits of 1998. It was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Beverly Hills Cop, Con Air, The Rock). This has an good cast, includes:Lisa Bonet, Regina King, Stuart Wilson, Jack Black. Loren Dean, Barry Pepper, Jamie Kennedy, Jake Busey, Scott Cann, James LeGros and Gabriel Byrne.The original cut on the DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This enjoyable film is extremely entertaining and never slows down. Hackman's mysterious character is loosely based on a film by Oscar-Winner:Francis Ford Coppola movie titled "The Conversation". Which some critics and fans of Coppola's picture will call this an uncredited sequel. Seth Green, Philip Baker Hall and Tim Sizemore appears uncredited. Panavision. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The smartest thriller ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1998, I was only about seven years old and therefore I couldn't see it in the theaters because of the rating, but my guess is, the entire world got a wake-up call to the horrifying truth about their government. And the thing is, everything that happened in "Enemy of the State" is very, very possible of happening. But that's just me thinking, 'cause it was over 11 years ago and and I couldn't remember if I tried. Did this movie do the same thing to the government as "Jaws" did to the beaches? Perhaps.The movie is about a highly accomplished lawyer named Robert Clayton Dean played by Will Smith in the performance of his career and makes an extremely believable character and expresses his emotions of anger and paranoia just perfectly. Dean accidentally gets a videotape of a covered-up political murder and in most of the movie, he doesn't realize it. But he's aware that the people (NSA agents) chasing him are watching him for sinister purposes. Robert Dean is also one of the smartest characters in the history of films, as he is able to outsmart a corrupt agency who have practically everything on him, such as satellites, tracers and cameras.Gene Hackman also stands out as the gruff, foul-mouthed former conspirer and government agent named Brill, who has had experience in surveillance technology and assists Dean in getting away from these dirty agents. However, Hackman doesn't show up until after the first hour, but that demonstrates his character who has spent most of his life hiding and it shows the secretiveness of Brill. Although the role is somewhat smaller, Hackman makes the best of it.And as for the NSA agents played by Jon Voight, Barry Pepper, Seth Green and Jack Black.....all of these guys are DIRTY, and I mean that in the truest meaning possible. These guys are ruining an innocent man's life, screwing up his credit cards, and even wrecking his marriage just so they can get away with what they did. Believe me, you are gonna find yourself HATING these guys, and I mean it. And as movie villains go....you're supposed to hate them, sometimes in other movies, you might be amused or not feel anything at all, but "Enemy of the State" does what it's supposed to do. Also, they're very realistic 'cause they aren't stupid and they know what they're doing with all the technology they have.Most of the film's thrills comes from the suspense rather than the action, as much of Tony Scott's films are like. The chase scenes such as the beginning when the NSA guys are going after Zavitz and when they're chasing Dean in the hotel and on the streets are terrificly shot and edited. Also, later on the action comes in after Dean and Brill run from the agents is also a highlight, and it's pretty hilarious after Dean asks Brill why he blew up the building and he reacts by saying "Because you made a phone call!" which demonstrates how careful he is. And of course the ending stand-ff between the agents and the Italian mob is absolutely bad@$$ in the true sense of the word.I absolutely love "Enemy of the State" and support its position as one of the best thrillers of all time, because its very smart and doesn't treat the audience like they're a bunch of idiots. Buy it, rent it or borrow it from a friend, and watch the movie that happens to be the smartest thriller ever made....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, perfectly cast, thought provoking thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an excellent, well thought out, intelligent, masterpiece of a thriller! It's the best film I've seen since "Fugitive-The Movie" It is well done in so many ways that I don't know where to begin, so I'll just mention the high points that come to mind immediately. First of all, Will Smith, Gene Hackman, and Jon Voight are so well cast in their characters that it is scary.Jon Voight is so good in his character as the sophisticated, cold hearted, fiendishly clever villain that it seems the part was made for him and only him. What a bad guy! You had to hate him (like Ernest Borgnine as the mean stockade Sergeant in "From Here to Eternity"). His character was so cold, calculating, and uncaring about humans, other than himself, that it was a pleasure to watch and try to understand his take on the events that took place,and how he justified his views.Gene Hackman, as Brill, was such an integral part of this fast moving, thought provoking film, that without him as the perfectly cast ex-CIA Agent, the story would not have worked (and with him, it worked so very well). Hackman was a pleasure to watch, and his character was so fascinating and he played him so well that Smith, at times, just shook his head when I doubt that it was in the script.Will Smith's character needed him so desperately, that it would have taken three or more very good actors to fill in all the missing pieces that "Brill" did alone and was such an interesting character to watch every second that he was on the screen. The whole privacy issue part of the plot was dealt with so well that one had to give it serious thought after the film ? the pace of the action didn't allow for (discussion type) deep thought during the film. As the plot unfolded, "Brill" explained to us (the viewers) much of what was going on through his conversations with and schooling of Smith's character. A technique that I enjoy, because we learned as he learned - as much as they wanted us to know at any given point in time in the story.Smith's character was beautifully cast in the typical "Alfred Hitchcock" formula of placing a somewhat ordinary person in an extraordinary situation, and then, we watch to see how he uses his wits to cope, while we subconsciously place ourselves in his situation and think at each step, what we -ourselves- would do in such a scenario. Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A labour lawyer, Robert Dean(Will Smith)is embroiled in a controversial NSA cover-up when a former college pal from Georgetown(Jason Lee)leaves a recording of the murder of a Congressman(Jason Robards)at the hands of Thomas Reynolds(Jon Voight)the head of NSA because he opposed a Security act being passed regarding wire-tapping at will anyone they deem a possible threat against America. The disc is what Reynolds needs or it will certainly hit the fan in a major way. Reynolds tools all his resources putting his crackpot team of surveillance wiz-kids and footmen on the hunt for Dean, whose life is thrown into a tailspin thanks to his supposed ties with the mob and a source(Lisa Bonet)who gives him information from a Deepthroat named Brill. Brill, it turns out is Edward Lyle(Gene Hackman), a former NSA man himself removed from the agency he loved after an Iranian cover-up in the early 80's which sent him underground. His identity is uncovered once Dean meets up with him in an unfortunate state of affairs leading to both being on the lam. But, having a skilled technician who understands the world of surveillance and security breach(obviously, I was reminded of Coppola's THE CONVERSATION the entire time Hackman appears on screen;I believe they even use a photo of Hackman from that film when they search his background files)will lend Dean a helping hand in catching Reynolds and company making one false move or statement turning the tables on them in using their own methods on them.Exhausting, thrilling, pulse-pounding roller-coaster doesn't let up once Dean is on the run. Smith and Hackman make an ideal team and the film plays at the entertaining, fast-paced level of THE FUGITIVE where Dean is continually running for his life at every turn trying every way possible to remain one step ahead of his pursuers. We get a glimpse inside the world of those who sneak a peak into our privacy..it's scary and we come to understand that this flick might just be a cautionary tale as well. The supporting cast of young Hollywood at the time(Jack Black, Seth Green, Jamie Kennedy,Scott Caan, Jake Busey,Barry Pepper)is enormous. One of Tony Scott's best films, this film may not be at all realistic, but is a hell of a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This grabs you by the throat, with an iron grip!! A private citizen (Smith) an attorney no less, is under suspicion, by a govt. department that doesn't have a customer service number for the public. Not in the yellow pages anyway. When a Congressman Hammersly, (Robards) discovers that this bill, the Privacy Act, would actually kill a couple large companies in his district and also end up exploiting, (his suspicions tell him)many Americans needlessly. He is asked by an official from the Government Dept. with no customer service dept. (Voight) to vote 'Their' way instead of what Hammersly wants. The good Congressman tells him basically to go to Hell. Shortly after that disagreement, the Congressman has a severe heart attack....and dies. A good man gone, the story just begins. Mean while enter Smith, who happens to get caught in the middle and is inside an investigation of a Mob-'heavy'. Look out this spells trouble! Coinsidentally the FBI just happens to be investigating this Mobster heavy (Tom Sizemore)while Smith is delivering a video to him to let him know that he is going to have to testify in court, that he is being indicted! This does not sit well with this over-bloated megalomaniac. So the mobster, threatens Smith. On and on this goes and gets more interesting. Will Smith does fantastic work in this out of control thrill-rider. Enter Gene Hackman, a retired, former 'spook' for the agency, who worked in Iran before the 'fall' of that country. Hackman is a 'dramedy' delivering player, who without his help, making 'Brill' the character he portrays, this would not be the film it ended up as. The rest of the cast plays out convincing roles as well, this was a wonder-working story. Not all movies are equal, and this is one that shines. Even with years passing it, this feature spreads out it's events actions, reactions, problems and solutions masterfully. Our director Ridley Scott is a 'marvel' set up and execute mind. He takes and makes the interesting, even more so, by the way he lays it out. The story takes on a pace that moves fast and kind of makes your heart go to your throat, inasmuch as feeling as though you are trying to escape the long, reaching arm of a very secret agency, who's job, is watching everything possible out there.Hackman, Smith Byrne, Bonet and Voight are well a 'sturdy' force playing out there respective characters, putting it together in this 'mix' and blending a winning thrill-chase of an enthralling story!I recommend this work of dramatic excitement highly. Again and again. It makes you think twice...and then some. BLEND THIS!!(*****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent paranoia action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawyer Robert Dean unwittingly (and unwillingly) comes into possession of a computer disc showing the secret service murdering a senator. The secret service promptly set to destroying him with a combination of constant surveillance while deleting him from computers everywhere. In desperation, Dean turns for assistance to off-the-grid ex-CIA man Edward Lyle (Gene Hackman).This scarily believable thriller features both Smith and Hackman on good form, in a paranoia-based story which illustrates both how much we rely on computers and also how much surveillance is already in place. It works both as an action potboiler and also as a thought-provoking piece.It is also noteworthy for the number of well-known faces in small supporting roles, some of them uncredited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith is harried, harassed and hunted by Jon Voight's National Security Agency teams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surveillance as depicted in movies is an interesting topic. The movie The Anderson Tapes (1971) already depicted wall-to-wall surveillance by numerous government agencies as a robbery plot unfolded. In Enemy of the State, the National Security Agency (NSA), which exists, has hugely enhanced surveillance capabilities with satellites and on-ground teams, as in The Conversation (1974). Gene Hackman, wearing glasses, appears in both of the latter two movies.Jon Voight is a rogue NSA bureaucrat who directs operations. He and some of his team kill a Congressman (Jason Robards) who is standing in the way of a bill in Congress that extends their surveillance powers. (By now, such powers are common, so that art has preceded reality or quickly intuited it as is often the case.) Ironically, the murder is filmed by a bird watcher. When Voight hears of this, he sets his teams to work recovering the film, murdering more people, and covering up. Will Smith comes into possession of a disk with the film, and he becomes the harried and threatened protagonist, later assisted by an irascible ex-NSA agent (Gene Hackman). The movie plays out as a fairly conventional decent thriller.I found interesting the depiction of the hands who do Voight's dirty work of the actual surveillance and murder. He has two teams with these separate functions. They are young, their clothing doesn't identify them, and they are glued to their electronic devices just as if they were any youths you might see playing video games intensely, only their toys are far more sophisticated. The kill-team has more young men who do their searching, running, and gun-pointing work without hesitation. They do not kill indiscriminately at all, but they will if ordered to. The State cannot operate without the loyalty and unswerving obedience of these young men. I have the feeling that they believe in what they do (that they are the good guys and their superiors identify the bad guys for them), but also their superiors know how to exploit their psychology. These young men like the taste of the chase, the hunt, the power, the action, the voyeurism, and the winning, plus they are submissive to boot. It was annoying for me to see these young squirts operating like little Nazis. Is this real? I mean, does this portrayal capture some elements of reality among those who "serve"? I think it does. Liberty is in huge danger from a government that recruits and trains such people, and from the millions who know nothing of it or approve of it.In the end, here's another irony. These submissive men who always take orders have to make a decision on their own when Voight is in danger, and they make a hasty, emotional and wrong decision, which is their downfall and his too. Under pressure to think straight, they fail to do so. Their capacities are purely mechanical. They are linked as one to their computer screens and electronic signals. Their minds have atrophied in other ways. In fact, the movie never shows these young men as characters or persons. They are not developed as such in the screenplay. This is fitting.Voight is given several speeches in which he justifies the NSA's spying. The movie is not unbalanced. Nevertheless, since he commits a crime and since Will Smith is the hero, the movie comes down on the side of controlling the surveillance and spying capacities of government. Will Smith's wife delivers opinions that take that point of view, so there is a kind of debate in the script. However, it's a thriller. The movie does stop and focus on the human element a bit when Will Smith's former girl friend (Lisa Bonet) is murdered, but it is not particularly strong in bringing out the negatives of surveillance. The bird watcher is killed, for example, and the movie quickly moves on. It has to, in some sense, because he is not a major character.Voight is a rogue within the NSA. We are not given all that much direct intimation that the government is vastly overreaching, and that its power against individuals is crossing a line into police state. Yet the movie does leave that general impression. I am sure that other Hollywood thrillers have explored in more depth the excesses of the State itself. If not, they will. And they will be getting into scenarios in which the President becomes a dictator. I've seen a good many foreign movies that go back 20-30 years, like those by Costa-Gavras, that are simultaneously excellent thrillers while exploring government oppressions of various kinds and focusing more intensely on the effects this has on individual persons. These are not done in the more or less standardized Hollywood style that tends to veer off into superficial entertainment.None of this stops or has stopped the State's progression, but it doesn't hurt to raise public awareness of the growing police state via popular entertainment like this.</fullReview>

In District of Columbia, born and raised, in the courthouse is where he spent most of his days. Pleadin' out, lawin', objectin' all cool and chasing some mob boss outside of school. When a couple of agents were up to no good, started killin' congressmen in the neighborhood. He got one little tape and the NSA got scared, and said "You've murdered your girlfriend in cold blood so there!" Will, he whistled for a contact and when he came near, the license said 'Brill', who had a security fear. If anything he could say this cat was rare, but then they got captured which lead to despair. They pulled up to the mob house around seven or eight, and Will yelled to the NSA "Yo I'm your negotiator!" There was some killing he was luckily spared to reclaim his life with a breath of fresh air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film delivers!! There are several espionage films out there about what the government is really up to these days, but this is one of the few that really catches my attention. The story is well paced and won't let you down that's for sure. Will Smith stars and his acting is extraordinary here. Gene Hackman also portrays his character solidly if I say so myself, and Jon Voight does well too. All the other characters are fantastic and won't bore you, giving lots of emotion to the film. The action is great and will keep you on the edge of your seat till it's all over. I love the chase sequence that ends with a fire truck and a crushed bike. The end gun battle was nice and it all remains realistic at the same time without being over the top. Yes!!! The score is fantastic and gives a somber feel to the film. Loved it! This film truly is a first rate thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..exciting film..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I add my vote to most comments posted here as this being an excellent film. It is hard to imagine that the silly kid Will Smith ("Robert Dean") played on TV to become the capable actor he has become on film. "Enemy of the State" certainly documents that.I also agree that the film was made way before its time, and certainly cannot be "dated". It also documents how innocent people become embroiled in very complicated and dangerous situations, with having done nothing to cause it. "Big Brother" is all too relevant in this film, and one can imagine it's much worse now since "the Patriot Act" is in full-swing.As all users mention, many actors-actresses cast at that time have become major stars. However, it IS the old-school guys who make the film believable......Gene Hackman (" Brill") and Jon Voight ("Reynolds") do stellar acting-jobs, with the help of countless smaller roles.This is one "chase" and shoot-'em-up" film which did not bore me and I could truly relate to. I've watched it three times this week, so you can see that I enjoyed Tony Scott's directing and THE STORY David Marconi put on the screen. Regina King ("Rachel Banks") definitely added to the suspense of "Enemy of the State" - a good family film.SO, Guys - be careful what you do in today's world - don't take it for granted that everything is rosy and safe. Bravo !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outset, Enemy of the State looks like it may be another formulaic thriller, and while that is true to a certain extent; I really wouldn't hesitate to name this film as one of the best of it's type simply because the plot flows excellently, and the film is a lot of fun to watch; those qualities always being among the most important for a film like this. The film handles the central theme of privacy and the Government interfering in people's private lives. Of course, there's also a conspiracy that the plot is driven from. The plot begins with the murder of Congressman Phillip Hammerson, which is promptly covered up and made to look like a suicide by a politician named Thomas Reynolds. This has reverberations for a lawyer named Robert Dean, as unfortunately for him; a birdwatcher he knows caught the whole ugly incident on tape, and as (bad) luck would have it, Robert Dean happened to be in the same shop as his old friend during a police chase. It's not long before the man and the agency behind the murder start to pull the lawyer's life apart...The film stars Will Smith, who is great in the lead role and provides the film with its main asset. He doesn't strike me as the lawyer type, but Will Smith has a great charisma and pretty much lend himself to any role he's given; here, he ensures that the film is always interesting. Enemy of the State is not your average action flick either; the film does feature stunts and a few explosions, but these are never the main focus of the film. Much of the excitement is sprung from the interaction between the central characters and the storyline, which results in a more engaging film. There are a few chase sequences which are very well executed, however and these add to the film's overall quality. Enemy of the State is directed by Tony Scott; a director with a penchant for making often decent, but never really brilliant thrillers; but this one is at the top of his oeuvre. The film co-stars Gene Hackman, who is good, although I've never been a fan of his; plus a number of other familiar faces, such as Jon Voight, Jason Lee, Seth Green, Gabriel Byrne and Jack Black, who steals the show as usual. Overall, this is an excellent and entertaining little film that comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance... But this time style wins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy Of The State is a nice action flick. But the special formula, used by Tony Scott, to make us like the movie, doesn't include great action, or great storyline. It has style, that includes an interesting general idea of the movie and great camera angles. The general idea, the movie was based on, is that you can be spotted anywhere in the open by the satellite, and be followed by it. The camera angles, and images that take us to the satellite and back add a lot to the intensity, which is already high. The movie is fast paced and never boring.The plot is very simple. Murder, involving high rank officials, is taped. The tape falls to the hands of our main hero, Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith). Those involved will do anything to get rid of the evidence, and the chase begins. The plot turns to be superficial once Edward Lyle ( Gene Hackman ) gets into the picture and the ending is even less convincing then that. But the intensity of the movie, being always on the run, the cast and the style clearly compensate for the lack of plot originality.Good refreshing movie, that stands itself out from other action flicks with general storyline, by being stylish and having an innovative idea.</fullReview>

Will Smith is great as a straight man for a change with hardly any of his typical one liner....aw damn, lines. The supporting cast, however, is what makes the film shine, that and a truly smart script playing on our paranoias and fears of being watched. This is a film where everyone in it, is somebody. Jaime Kennedy from the Scream movies, Seth Green from Can't Hardly wait, Gabe Byrne, everybody is in this film.

		<fullReview>Bruckheimer is guilty of fronting some of the most stupid movies in existence -- one look at his resume confirms that. Tony Scott is just as guilty (as director) of churning out tripe. They've conspired before, so why would we expect anything worthwhile as a result? We've seen it all before; this is basically "Inner Space" plus the intrigues and strained marriage subplot from "The Firm". Lots of long panning shots...dark, underdeveloped and jerky, as is most of Scott's work.The problem here is not the moronic plot, or that it's about evil government; in fact, it tries hard to present the facade of being politically neutral. The problem is, the whole thing is laid out for dummies, with absolutely no ambiguity about who's good, who's bad, or what arc each character will follow within the story. In short, who cares? How are we entertained at all by this?Ah, there's the rub. The supposed entertainment value comes from the illumination of the star power, and hence it's built from the actors up. Everything is designed to play to each celebrity's strength: Smith as a lawyer (so that we perceive him here as royalty), in order to meet Hollywood's affirmative action quotas in casting, yet he's tough and jive when necessary, so as to pass authenticity muster with the audience.Hackman is the real reason this exists though; huge chunks of "The Conversation" were ripped off in order to make this (with none of the storytelling brains), so that he can give us more of his glum authoritarianism. Whole sections of this obviously try to see and hear the narrative in the same manner as Coppola, but Scott doesn't have a clue.Most insulting, though, is how the ethnicities are stereotyped. The Chinese couple is depicted as befuddled. The 'Italian-American' depictions involve men slathered with hair grease, leather blazers, wife beater shirts, lots of guns, boiling pasta, and exploding jars of sauce. Sizemore, as the Boss, is flanked by a fat, dutiful wife and fat, cheeky kids. In order for us to accept Regina King as the wife, she has to be Hollywood's conception of a 'strong black woman' (whatever that is), propped up by her status as an 'ACLU lawyer', yet she is hysterical, jive and sexually compliant -- they couldn't find a dumber actress if they tried. Is this any match for "No Way Out/The Big Clock"? Comparing leading black men in film, is Smith any match for Denzel Washington, who's done smart things like "Fallen", or for Larry Fishburne, who can support things on the order of magnitude of the entire "Matrix" series by himself? Nope... all in all, it's the usual collection of deeply insulting, intellectually vacant, preachy, pandering nonsense, that owes its existence purely to the theft of ideas from better predecessors.</fullReview>

Taking its "innocent man accidentally caught up in political corruption" story from such films as Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, and Sydney Pollack's Three Days of the Condor, they turn up the high- tech volume in an attempt to create the ultimate action film. Robert Clayton Dean, played by Will Smith, is a devoted father, husband, and attorney shopping for a sexy gift for his wife. What he doesn't know is that he was given a videotape from a friend (Jason Lee) regarding the recent murder of a U.S. senator led by corrupt National Security Agency official Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight). Now Reynolds is after Dean to cover his tracks or, as the audience soon finds out, frame Dean for Rachel's murder.

		<shortDescription>Privacy vs Security</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers for this movie wetted my appetite and I went expecting, and the movie delivered. Enemy of the State is tense, fast paced, action packed, and very cunning in the way the characters manipulate the world around them. Right from the beginning we are confronted with cunning and evil spies seeking to manipulate and control the world. Enemy of the State is the new generation of spy thriller and succeeds in what it sets out to do.A bill is being passed through congress which would allow the security agents to invade the privacy of private citizens. They would be able to monitor all conversations and transmissions and be ready to grab any insurgents before they are able to act. This does lead to implications because nobody is able to lead a private life and the only private place would be your head. Thus the main thrust of this movie is the line that separates ones private life with national security and where that should be drawn.This is not a new theme as it is the major thrust of George Orwell's 1984 in which Big Brother knows everything about everybody and monitors everybodies movements. Of coarse this is probably for the betterment of society but such things quickly downgrade into a totalitarian dictatorship. The National Security Agency (NSA) in Enemy of the State is like Big Brother except that they are blinded by the philosophy of protection of the state. Constantly throughout the movie they speak of America being the most powerful nation in the world and because of this they need to protect themselves from international terrorism. Such protection involves being able to monitor everybody to attempt to root out terrorists before people die. Those working for these people believe that it is for the betterment of the state, but there is the issue of people's privacy.That is the other part of the movie, and the filmmakers are biased towards this idea. They support privacy over national security, and thus if security laws invade people's privacy then they are bad laws. Even though the NSA makes pleas of being able to monitor people to save the state, these pleas fall on death ears as we see innocent people suddenly becoming enemies of the state and being killed simply because they interfere in the NSA's plans. In fact, their desire to protect the state moves over to the absurd where the innocence of the state is being destroyed in their desire to preserve the state.I guess this is the new generation of spy thrillers now that the Cold War is over. They attempt to turn the Muslim fundamentalists into the bad guys but generally it does not work. Instead the more popular movies are those in which the state is the enemy and the innocent person is the hero. This seems to be the more popular because it is still the right verses the left, as it was in the old communist movies. The right verses the left seems to be a popular theme and now that the old leftist regimes have gone, the only vestage of the left that needs to be attacked is the big government.</fullReview>

The story is really interesting and doesn't let you down like a lot of conspiracy theory films. It's really emotional at times and with Smith's acting you can really feel his pain and frustration. The story is also surprisingly post-modern, it feels like it could easily be set today rather than 15 years ago when it was made. This is a stunning thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh Prince on the Run.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that was perhaps a bit ahead of its time, "Enemy of the State" stars Will Smith as a family man on the run from the government after unknowingly obtaining information about a politically motivated murder. Because the government (a.k.a. Big Brother) can see and hear virtually everything he does, he is helpless until he gains the assistance of an old, paranoid and tech-savvy character played by Gene Hackman.Seeing as how it was made in 1998, it should be noted that "Enemy of the State" pre-dates the Patriot Act, making it relevant and powerful even 11 years after its release. Obviously much of what the government does in this film is exaggerated (is it?), but the script is whip-smart and thanks to brilliant pacing and a directing style from Tony Scott that shows restraint, you feel like you are there with the characters and the action never lets up for a moment. The paranoia built up within the film is contagious and what makes it truly great is that you'll walk away from it with something more to chew on than what the average blockbuster has to offer."Enemy of the State" is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and is perhaps the smartest and one of the best films of its breed. The film is nothing if not consistent and despite a strong showing by Will Smith, Gene Hackman completely steals the show. Why he didn't win any awards for his performance in this film is beyond me. Jon Voight has a turn as the villain and Jason Lee gets an early but pivotal position early on in the film. Look out for bit performances by comedic actors Seth Green and Jack Black, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-rated and thought-provoking action thriller - 85%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember going to see this at the pictures when it was released but over time, my memory of it began to fade save that my impression was that it was a great action thriller. Thankfully, the BBC were able to refresh my memory on Saturday night and therefore, I was able to watch this again with my Better Half. And you know what - it still is a gripping and classy action conspiracy film that surprises as often as it entertains, assuming you can stand Tony Scott's never-stand-still direction.Will Smith plays hot-shot attorney Robert Dean, chasing mobster Pintero (Tom Sizemore) and unaware of the politically motivated murder of a congressman, instigated by shady politician Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight). But after a video of the murder is discovered, Reynolds sends his NSA guys after the tape which finds itself in Dean's unknowing possession. Soon, Dean's life falls apart and he finds himself chased by government agents wherever he goes. But as he desperately tries to discover why this is happening to him, his only hope lies with a shadowy individual known as Brill (Gene Hackman)...The first thing that surprises you is that despite the director of "Top Gun" at the helm, this is a brilliantly written and thought-provoking thriller that doesn't patronise you with techno-jargon. The second thing that surprises you is the quality and depth of the acting - stars like Jack Black, Seth Green and Scott Caan pop up in the casting but all actors deserve praise as everyone is convincing. But the most surprising thing is how under-rated this film is. This film grips like a pair of Michelins and offers something more than your usual Jerry Bruckheimer helping of explosions and cool styling yet nobody seems to be talking about this like they should. There is a slight sense that this sort of stuff is out-dated these days as technology continues its relentless advance and the numerous gaffes about map coordinates and the accuracy of spy satellites may damage this films credibility somewhat but by and large, this is a quality film.Maybe I'm being harsh on Tony Scott - I'm a huge fan of his brother Ridley, though - because this film would be a fine addition to any directors CV. "Enemy Of The State" remains a class above most action thrillers, feeling more like "The Fugitive" than "The Running Man" which can only be a good thing. It's also good to see a modern film with Gene Hackman in, before his self-imposed retirement and we can only hope he changes his mind soon because he is a genuine Hollywood icon. In the meantime, enjoy a movie that thrills and excites but also makes you think in equal measures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screenwriter David Marconi uses the thriller milieu to assault an America in which subversive computers tap our phones for trigger words. Will Smith showed early promise as an actor in his lead role as a D.C. lawyer named Robert Dean whose life is ripped apart because he has evidence that a congressman was murdered for going up against a bill that would enable the US government to spy on its citizens. Unrealistically, the noble congressman is mentioned as a Republican.It's not the government that is the enemy, the script contends, so much as officials and bureaucrats who exploit the power of their positions to increase their own ends and cover their footprints. Jon Voight's murderous NSA official is actually acting in his own personal interest, doing anything he has to do to get a communications bill passed that will make his job easier and more lucrative. He has the congressman murdered because he's the crucial opponent. Everything else unfolds from the murder conspiracy.This, the quintessential thriller for the information age, was directed by Tony Scott, who films technology the only way that doesn't diminish the charm of the film. As Will Smith's Robert Dean ducks through Washington, struggling desperately to decipher his sudden assailants, the story is unraveled before us with video recording from spy satellites, surveillance cameras, audio devices, bugs, wiretaps and other such domestic gadgets. As with nearly every Tony Scott film, no shot seems to last more than two or three seconds.This enormously entertaining spy film is as briskly paced as one could ever expect, gathering around two hyperkinetic chase sequences, and coming to a head in a cunning deception that initiates a signature Tony Scott sense-bashing, ultraviolent shootout. Though the double- cross is clever and the gunfight is extremely intense, the situation borders dangerously nearby ludicrous, for a film that has made such an effort to be taken seriously. In its action and violence it is in too much of a rush to be much of a character film, but then that complements its paranoia.On the whole, it succeeds. Aside from its central characters, Enemy of the State seems crowded with stars who, at the time, had yet to be stars, playing bit roles of all kinds: Seth Green, Jack Black, Jason Lee, Jamie Kennedy, James LeGros, Jake Busey, and Scott Caan, and fleeting roles by established stars like Gabriel Byrne, Jason Robards, Lisa Bonet and Stuart Wilson. Will Smith is sincere and human as a virtuous lawyer who is sucker-punched by the abused muscle of the nation. Gene Hackman, as I am coming to realize is his secret to such consistently persuasive and charismatic performances, feels outright doubtless of every line of dialogue and every nuanced action. Voight's bureaucrat seems firm in his mind that his work by some means transcends the law, resounding the true echo of more or less the entirety of neo-Conservative politicians in America. "We are at war 24 hours a day!" "You think we're the end of democracy? I think we're democracy's last hope!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was simply an unbelievable movie. From start, to finish, you will be held on the edge of your seat. Fast paced, and action packed, yet still with plenty of depth, plot, storyline, and suspense, this is likely one of my favorites. Will Smith does a great job in this movie, as does Gene Hackman. This film and the messages in it are far more relevant today than ever before.. and should be seen by everyone. How this movie managed to pull in a 7, while Dickie Roberts pulled in a 5-6 is simply unbelievable to me as well. This movie is severely underrated, and I highly recommend it to everyone. I don't know a single person who has seen this movie and didn't enjoy it. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and fast-paced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to paranoia-thrillers there is a lot to live up to. In the days of the cold war these kinds of movies came in droves. There were communists, UFO:s and strange government agencies on every corner. This is very much an update of that classic genre, and a good update to boot.Will Smith is the somewhat controversial but successful young lawyer that gets drawn into controversy by accident. Soon the Orwellian American government is chasing him with every means available to them. Including groups of seemingly cloned agents, satellites, helicopters and every kind of surveillance you can think of.What makes this movie work is undeniably it's pace. This is a real neck-breaker almost all the way through. Sure, believability suffers sometimes (not least in the end without revealing too much) but this can easily be forgiven since this is such an entertaining ride. The mix is also given extra flavor by the use of a bunch of good actors. Gene Hackman, Jon Voight and Will Smith all do good work.Whether this is a good commentary on the increasing surveillance we face in our everyday life i won't say. I recommend instead that you watch this because it's a thrilling and fast-paced thriller that entertains the whole running time. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen EOS 3 times now, I watched it last night and enjoyed it more than I did before.EOS is simply a riveting action thriller which goes at the speed of light. It is the best part of a decade since the movie came out, but if even half of what we saw in EOS is to believed then it is frightening to think of what technology is out there today and what it is used for.The acting led by Will Smith, Jon Voight and Gene Hackman is top notch. The action scenes are roller coaster like and the climax of the movie is one of the best for an action that I have seen.All in all EOS is a thought provoking action thriller, a very good one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Certainly one of the best, if not the best movie of the 90's, along with Office Space, Jurassic Park, and Terminator 2, to name a few. Though I want to make one thing clear, I am NOT a Will Smith fan. A lot of reviewers go on about how they love Will Smith, and saw the movie just for him. Will Smith is a good actor, but a lot of things he does simply suck. I feel he has made some of the worst music ever created, and has done some very bad movies and TV Shows (Fresh Prince of Bel Air...that show makes me vomit). Now that I have made this clear, I can go on with the review.Though, as unfond of Will Smith as I can be, I have no problem with his performance here. I actually think he does a terrific job, as he does in Indepedence Day, but other than that, well, you get it. Gene Hackman also does an outstanding job as does everyone else. The acting in this movie is great.The storyline in this movie is as far as I can tell, pretty original. But I'm sure someone somewhere knows about a movie that they "totally ripped off", as it seems it is the same situation with every movie. But whatever, it doesn't matter. The storyline is so compelling it will get you absolutely stuck in it. Irrisistable.All in all, this movie is fantastic. Great chase scenes, and an incredible ending. This is one of my all time favorites, and everyone should rent this movie and see if they like it. And remember, there watching you...(it's cheesy, but since almost every reviewer has done I felt the need to include it.)10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whoah, great surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy Of The State is a great movie. I rented the VHS today with the intention to get a mediocre action movie but I was pleasantly surprised. I never liked Gene Hackman's acting much but I think he performed one of his best in this movie. Will Smith on the contrary felt a bit misplaced in this role. He truly shined in Bad Boys which is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time but here he didn't seem to fit in much. Thumps up as well for the woman who acted Smith's wife in this movie. The scene where she and Smith were arguing was very well done. And last but not least John Voight was a great bad guy as usual but he will never be as good again (at least for me) as his performance of the blind man in U Turn. That was truly superb.As for the rest of Enemy o/t State I really liked the way the movie evolved towards the end. I must have thought about 3 or 4 times "this is it, they're going to get the bad guys and the movie is over" but something unexpected always happened and made the movie go on. Something I've never seen in a Hollywood action movie before which I can only applaud for.Also the guy who played the character that gets killed in the very beginning of the movie is a great actor. I just can't find or remember his name but I've seen him in a lot of other movies. It does surprise me however that he signed to play such a small role in this movie since he's among the big stars in Hollywood.All things together the movie was a great enjoyment. I rated it 8/10 which is certainly not bad on my action movie scale. A recommendation for every fan of the action or thriller genre.</fullReview>

This is leading to a murder, by a muli-millionaire. So then the people who work for the millionaire, try to do anything they can, to get that from Smith's bag. Along the way Smith meets up with Gene Hackman, who helps Smith along the way.Suprisingly good pyschological thriller, has Smith and Hackman in good roles.

		<shortDescription>Exciting, frightening film about the 900-pound gorilla that's already in the kitchen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie?geez, hard to imagine this film being made nearly 10 years ago!?I was more moved by the technical wizardry than tuned into this jumbo-sized chronicle of the national security state gone awry.That, and I remember feeling so friggin' irritated with Carla (Regina King) for bitching about Robert (Will Smith) doing business with Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet): The Claytons' home has been broken into, the NSA has framed him, his high-powered legal firm has fired him, and his reputation has been trashed in the D.C. papers. So this stand-by-your-man wife throws him out of the house without giving him a chance to explain.Keep in mind Carla is an ACLU attorney and has just the day before given Robert a lecture about how our rights are being trampled by the state. Their lives are unraveling from some hostile agent, and she's getting emotional about some old flame he still has to talk with occasionally? Women! Turns out Carla's bitching is the least of his troubles:A high-level National Security Agency (NSA) schmuck (Jon Voight) has a Congressman (Jason Robards) killed for refusing to support a new Patriot-Act-like surveillance law. The murder takes place in a park where a wildlife camera captures the entire scene on tape. The camera attendant (Jason Lee) soon figures out what he has, and so does the NSA team. The chase is on. Camera guy makes a disk then by pure chance the disk, enclosed in a portable video game, winds up in Robert Dean's Christmas shopping bag. Unbeknownst to Dean, his seven-year-old son raids the package and takes the game and disk with him to a friend's house on a sleepover. The chief complication in the plot underlies Dean's relationship with Rachel. In their university days they were lovers; yet Dean uses her now and then as a go-between to obtain first-class PI work from a shadowy investigator named Brill (Gene Hackman).Eventually, Dean and Brill have to hook up to confront the statist goombas who are ruining everyone's lives to retrieve the damned tape. Brill is a former NSA wonk forced out 20 years ago by upper-level spook-management screwups. Off the grid and underground, he's an aging libertarian high-tech loner with a grudge. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, another ordinary guy thrust into extraordinary circumstances and being pursued by overwhelming force: template number 1 in the poor writer's cheat book. This go around, we have dire warnings about and examples of NSA invasions of privacy.Even if it had a resonating story, this movie is dead. When will they learn not to cast poor actors (Smith, Bonet) near good ones (Voight, Hackman). It just reminds us. Smith never convinces.Worse, the reason this was made was to leverage paranoia about a very real agency, who does do profligate, but passive monitoring. The message would have real impact if they hadn't larded it up with so many technical fantasies. Also, if the mission had been carried out with some official blessing, instead of by a minor internal thug. The truth IS scarey, as is the threat they are countering. A real film could be made of this, something meaningful, but no one would watch. I wonder whether we really are a stupid people or that we would rather be frightened by clearly fake threats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best thrillers out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith definitely doesn't disappoint the audience. He's extremely talented actor, and he adds his own charm to each character he plays. Of course some might find that annoying, but in the end his charm is what makes even the otherwise unlikable characters sympathetic. I read that Tom Cruise was first considered to play the main character. There are people out there who love Cruise but I personally could not like Robert Dean if played by him. I think I've only seen one movie by Tony Scott before, and that was Domino. In Domino I was annoyed by the overuse of the special effects and weird cinematography. In Enemy of the State Scott's input is clear, but it is definitely easier to follow this one. Sure, weird effects are used, but not all the time, and while some shots are still "artsy" in a way, it doesn't affect the whole movie, just few scenes, during which it's not always easy to even notice. Enemy of the State is an excellent thriller. It's the antagonist that makes you sit on the edge of your seat - NSA has satellites and basically eyes everywhere, how is one person going to outrun all that? I love the use of NSA as the antagonist, since it feels all powerful, and it makes the film still very current. This is one of those movies that make conspiracy theorists wet themselves, yet isn't too far fetched. All the chase scenes are excellently executed, and the feeling of helplessness is extremely thrilling. The only annoying thing is that sometimes the technology doesn't seem believable. Would there really be a surveillance camera in a lingerie shop that would be good enough for someone to almost get a full 360 degree view of the shop? That didn't seem real. Enemy of the state is a marvellous movie. It has clever twists and interesting characters, even if most of them are just plain annoying - all that is saved by Will Smith's charisma, and the main character's family. That way there's at least someone who to root for. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. This is, no doubt, one of the best thrillers out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A nightmare-vision of "the surveillance society" provides this political thriller with its sinister backdrop. Spy satellites, hidden cameras and all sorts of high-tech paraphernalia are seen being used by the National Security Agency to routinely monitor and even destroy the lives of the individuals they're watching. Their power and efficiency are awesome but when, as in this story, the staff involved are taking their orders from a top official who's gone rogue, things soon get very threatening.A U.S. Congressman, who's opposed to a new Bill that's designed to make government snooping more extensive, is met at a lakeside location by high-ranking NSA Officer Thomas Brian Reynolds (Jon Voight). When Reynolds fails to change the Congressman's voting intentions, one of his operatives kills the politician and makes his sudden death look like an accident. Shortly after, when the authorities arrive on the scene to investigate, a nature photographer is seen removing a videotape from a nearby hide and the NSA immediately swing into action to locate the recording in case it contains any incriminating evidence. Photographer Daniel Leon Zavitz (Jason Lee) soon discovers that his tape contains a full recording of the murder and quickly makes a computer disk copy before going on the run from the NSA agents who are already pursuing him.During the high-speed chase that follows, Zavitz bumps into an old college friend who's doing some Christmas shopping and drops the disk into one of his bags before running away. Successful Washington DC lawyer, Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) doesn't realise that he's now carrying the disk and watches in horror as his old friend's attempt to escape his pursuers ends in his death after he's knocked down by a fire truck. The NSA rapidly realise that Dean probably has the disk and take swift action to hunt him down. In order to discredit him as forcefully as possible, they spread false information that leads to him being fired from his job and his wife being given the impression that he's still in a relationship with one of his ex-girlfriends. Suddenly unemployed and thrown out of his home by his wife, he then discovers that his credit cards have been cancelled and his bank accounts have been frozen.Dean, who doesn't know who he's being chased by or why, remains bewildered until he meets up with a former NSA agent called Edward "Brill" Lyle (Gene Hackman) who'd spent time working for the Agency in Iran during the 1979 revolution. He's an irritable and belligerent man who, having been a recluse for many years, is reluctant to get involved in Dean's problems, but is in reality, the only hope that Dean has of getting himself out of the predicament he's in. After some uncomfortable initial exchanges, Brill explains to Dean exactly what's happening to him before they team up to carry out a series of actions to enable Dean to get his life back on track."Enemy Of The State" hits the ground running and never stops for breath until it reaches its exciting climax. Predictably, for this type of thriller, it's full of well-choreographed chases, well-executed stunts and numerous explosions but also has more substance than the average action movie because of its interesting story and the cautionary nature of what's depicted on-screen. Highly effective editing techniques complement the rapid pace of the action brilliantly and there's a consistent tension that makes it a real edge-of-the-seat movie.The quality of the acting is superb throughout with even the minor roles featuring top-class actors. Will Smith does a great job as an ordinary guy who suddenly finds himself caught up in something he doesn't understand and Gene Hackman and Jon Voight are both excellent in their roles.This movie, which was a great box office success, is exhilarating to watch, visually impressive and simply great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Will Smith become the inadvertent target of the National Security Agency and the way they monitored him so closely, I couldn't help thinking, how could 9/11 have occurred? Should you feel all warm and secure we've got all this monitoring or should you be afraid, be very afraid?Will Smith was already in enough of a jackpot trying to deal with Mafia hoods muscling in on a labor union he's representing. But he accidentally comes into possession of a tape showing the murder of a member of the House of Representatives played in a brief cameo by Jason Robards. Robards opposes further monitoring that NSA bigwig Jon Voight is fighting for and Voight is right on the scene. That could embarrass a whole lot of people.Fortunately Smith comes to the attention of old CIA guy Gene Hackman who helps him figure out his predicament.As for the rest of the film it kind of has an ending, a bit more complex to be sure, but an ending like a plan coming together on one of those old A Team television episodes. As for the surveillance all I can say is George Orwell's vision is coming close to reality.Interesting film, non-stop action when it gets going like an Indiana Jones film. Fans of the principal cast members should find it pleasing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a more than decent conspiracy thriller, although in saying that I do remember being way more impressed and freaked out by all the big brother technology when I first saw it in 98 than I did now in my re-watch. Most of the techno stuff is now so common place that we don't even consider it and it doesn't feel like such a threat as it did back then.I liked the cast here a lot, Will Smith does a great job as Robert Dean whose life is turned upside down after an old friend slips him evidence regarding a congressman's murder. Dean quickly loses his job &amp; his wife, has his bank accounts frozen and becomes a fugitive whose only hope is a cat loving mysterious former intelligence agent played by the very cranky but oh so good Gene Hackman. Jon Voight is also worth a mention as the head bad guy, as is a very sweaty and bloated Tom Sizemore as Pintero, the mob boss.Some great action sequences along the way, although far fetched to a degree as Will is just a lawyer but after he goes on the run suddenly becomes an action hero, able to evade bad guys, scale balconies and use a pump action shot gun like a hit man. The ending is well done, a little tricky including an excellent shoot out.Exceptional secondary cast here too including Barry Pepper, Jack Black, Lisa Bonet, Gabriel Byrne, Jason Lee and two second generation stars teaming up in Jake Busy and Scott Caan. 2/10/16</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene of the State.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy of the State (1998): Dir: Tony Scott / Cast: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Regina King, Barry Pepper: The enemy in question is not asked within the compounds of the screenplay but rather in our own view on political issues. Will Smith plays a lawyer caught in a scheme where he must clear his name. Recycled plot yet director Tony Scott builds upon mystery elements to render it more detailed and a tad more intelligent than perhaps it is perceived as being. Smith gains accidental possession of a disc containing footage of the murder of a congressman. Gene Hackman appears after a third party is murdered. Scott shows skill here after making the highly overrated Top Gun and the vampire gore fest The Hunger. Smith is effective as a lawyer placed within a dire situation where he must clear his name. We know the outcome to this and that everything Smith lost he will regain. Hackman is in top form as a mysterious contact who has laid low for a very long time. Hackman is the reason to see the film specifically for his methods of outsmarting the enemy. Jon Voight plays the villain caught on camera committing murder and makes Smith's life difficult when he pursues a device placed in his possession. This will ultimately arrive at the standard shootout. Regina King is standard issue as Smith's wife. Pure action that should please fans of the genre. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller that becomes more relevant by the day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For certain aspects in life, there are specific things the average person has no control of. How other individuals interact with each other, how well a piece of operating equipment works or how technology advances itself forward are just a couple of examples. In the current world of today where computers are basically apart of everyone's lives, it's not that difficult for someone to find information on another person. All anyone has to do is go to any search engine whether it be Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask etc. and they'll at least get 2 to 3 webpages about or are connected to them in some way. It's the scary truth, being on the internet is not always the safest place to be. Looking back on Enemy of the State (1998) it seems that director Tony Scott and writer David Marconi have produced a piece of cinema that is an underrated gem that feels more significant now than it ever was the year it was released.The story is about an attorney/family man Robert Dean (Will Smith) being unknowingly jammed into a big government conspiracy about a rouge senator Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) wanting to pass a bill that'll begin invading the privacy of the US residents. What Dean has that he doesn't know about is a videotape that a suspect hid in his bag that had visual evidence that Reynolds is behind the killing of congressman Hammersley (Jason Robards) who supported individual privacy. The idea of homeland security has always been a controversial topic since the concept was ever brought to fruition and using that as an undercurrent for the script's plot was a thought provoking move on Marconi's part. As stated before with technology being a much bigger proprietor for internet access, the ability to be researched is a lot easier than it was displayed in this movie. Dean ends up being hacked from all directions - his house &amp; mobile phone, home and satellite. Now there's that, the internet, social media and a slew of other devices that make it easy to track someone.Another part about the writing that is effective is how many times Marconi will keep the audience guessing. Every time there's a point where progress occurs, Marconi writes in an event that creates a new roadblock and a new solution plan has to be made. It's clever because most scripts are cut and dry with either one or (maybe) two remedies to a problem. This at least has three or four and its uncommon, which is good because it keeps the viewers guessing. The only component to the writing that doesn't make sense is how a supporting character was able to figure out where the FBI was located. Isn't the FBI supposed to be covert in their operations? It's a little weird that their main office doesn't seem to feel so secret. Other than that, almost every step of execution to this story is woven in such a way that'll have the viewer on the edge of their seat.The acting is well done too. Will Smith as Robert Dean plays his character differently compared to other past roles. Throughout the majority of the running time Smith plays his character like an average family man; humble, respectful, caring and not cocky. Occasionally a small bit of the old-school Will Smith humor arises from the cracks but for the situation he's put into, sarcasm sometimes feels like it was needed. Tagging along side later on is Gene Hackman as Edward Lyle, an ex-NSA agent who knows the inner workings of the system and provides some frightening insight to how things run inside the government. With Hackman being a lot older, he plays it up as a grumpy man when he's hungry and although he's not the nicest sounding, he does care at certain instances. Behind these two are a ton of other cast members consisting of Jason Lee, Scott Caan, Jake Busey, Stuart Wilson, Regina King, Lisa Bonet, Gabriel Byrne, Jack Black, Jamie Kennedy, Larry King, Tom Sizemore and even Seth Green.The cinematography provided by Daniel Mindel had a interesting look to it as well. Since this film involves surveillance of various individuals, the camera will have numerous angles to sit at. That means being hidden cameras in various objects, or among the buildings and street property. Then there's also the satellite tracking cameras that usually fly straight down to the location that's being focused on and then watching what's going on from a bird's eye view. Now obviously, the flying down from space to earth is CGI but after that it looks very real. Mindel later worked on other big budget films like Mission: Impossible III (2006), Star Trek (2009), its sequel and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). The music composed by Trevor Rabin and Harry Gregson-Williams appropriately has the right mix of synthetic and organic sounding orchestra. There are also two main themes, one for the film and another for Hackman's character. They are not that memorable but they do show up more than once and that's good. The action cues aren't as well developed but they do elevate the experience.Besides one plot hole being a bit too noticeable, the rest of the film is fine. The large cast of actors are effective in their roles, the cinematography carries lots of bird's eye view shots, the music is appropriate and the writing has smart context in its narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinetic cacophony of cinematic brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott's Enemy Of The State is a sensationally kinetic, hyperactive espionage whizbanger that doesn't let up for a goddamned second. It's classic Scott, all edgy, blurred lines filmmaking with a relentless pace, eclectic cast and excessive amounts of unique style to go around. It's the precursor to his purely distilled style which can be found in Man On Fire, Domino and Deja Vu, with leftover residue from his 90's action aesthetic, observable in True Romance, Last Boy Scout etc. When an obstinate US Senator (Jason Robards) refuses to go along with a new bill being pushed through that allows the NSA full access to any citizens private phone calls, emails and communications via state of the art, scary technology (even by 2001's standards), he's discreetly dispatched by a letcherous, sociopathic NSA honcho (Jon Voight playing coldly ruthless to a T). Only problem is, a nature photographer (Jason Lee) accidentally gets footage of the murder. It gets passed off to hotshot lawyer Robert Dean (Will Smith) via circumstance, and from there the chase is on. It's a wicked chase too, one that doesn't let up for its entire two plus hour heart pumping runtime, with no moments to breathe whatsoever. Gene Hackman quasi reprises his role from Coppola's The Conversation as Brill, a crusty, high strung ex NSA agent who's gone rogue and paying dearly for it, as he assists Dean in his quest to bring down the corrupt agency. The film is somewhat ahead of its time, outlining invasions of privacy and corruption that seems tame by today's real life scandals. As thrillers go it's a gem, jumping from one explosive escape to the next, never sacrificing character as it hurtles along. Hackman's grumpy jadedness is a perfect companion to Smith's incredulous everyman, making a dynamic worth following. Voight makes a terrific villain as well, really amping up his scenes with a sick self justification. There's a jaw dropping supporting cast well. Jake Busey, Ian Hart, Jack Black, Seth Green, Gabriel Byrne, Loren Dean and Barry Peoper all show up as various NSA rats. Lisa Bonet, Regina King and Ivana Milicevic are awesome, and Arthur Nascarella and Tom Sizemore have nice bits as hammy mobsters. In the tradition of 24 and The Bourme Identity, it's a loud, chaotic blast of a thriller and one of Scott's best works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that's hard to follow the only good thing is the eye candy scenes of one Regina King!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just again watched some of "Enemy of the State" for the first time in many many years and again I felt it was a hard film to follow with to many plot twist and to many characters who fade in and out of the story it's a little hard to understand! Yet it has star power with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, it can be called many genres from spy, thriller, action, and mystery drama, yet the plot centers around D.C. with a video tying top National security people to political murder, and then soon the NSA and other people get involved. As the action and fast pacing of this thriller blends action and technology to a new level. The real treat for me was the Regina King scenes she was great as Will's caring and sexy loving wife! And that scene in which Regina sports that silk dark sexy black colored bra I loved that was the best part of the film it made my day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crime-Drama-Thrillers has always been my favorite mix of genres and I was very excited to finally get to watch Enemy of the State. Not only because it was a different role for Will Smith but because of the great all around cast. And boy does it have a great cast. It turned out to be nothing too special. I think it's a decent drama for a Saturday or Sunday morning viewing on cable, but I cant say I'm going to willingly watch it again.The cast truly is terrific though. When you have Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Barry Pepper, and even Jack Black all in a movie together you expect greatness. They all give note-worthy performances, but I think the film lacked some focus in this area. At times it tried to give back stories to every one of the characters, even the ones we weren't really suppose to care about. If it were to have focused on only a select few of them, the film would have been more effective. Because of the lack of focus, you end up not really caring for any of the characters.I did really like the premise of the film. It deals with privacy and the effects and impact it has on everyone when it's abused. You begin to question to yourself just how much of our lives are watched and monitored. But I do feel like they could have gone even further with it and made it more personal. The Lives of Others is a much better film based around a similar premise. The film does feel original though. I didn't feel like they were copying any other action film even nearly 20 years after its release. You also definitely feel the 135 minute length. It could have used about a 20 minute trimming job. So with the possible pacing and focus issues the film turns out to be a solid drama, but one that also feels a bit disappointing at the same time.+Original premise +Fascinating privacy concepts +Cast -Pacing and lack of focus issues -Weak supporting characters -Feel the length 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Scott's over-the-top NSA thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) is a Special Adviser from the NSA. He is pushing for passage of a surveillance bill and he kills a congressman to get it. However a wildlife camera set up by Daniel Zavitz captures the murder. He goes on the run and bumps into college acquaintance DC lawyer Robert Dean (Will Smith). He slips Dean the tape and Reynolds directs the NSA to track down Dean. They use all their powers to discredit Dean before he even realizes that he has the tape. His investigator Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet) directs him to Brill (Gene Hackman) who is a secretive investigator that she uses. He is able to convince his wife Carla (Regina King) but they kill Banks and frame him for the crime. He tracks down Brill who reluctantly helps him. It turns out that Brill was a former NSA agent. The NSA tracks down Brill's hiding place and he's forced to go on the run after blowing the building up.I like the ideas and the premise of the NSA surveillance. Sometimes Tony Scott pushes too far on the razzmatazz techno gadgets to silliness. He certainly pushes the wild over-the-top tense action which also goes too far at times. I really don't need all the yelling. The story doesn't need it. All the noise and flash bang overwhelms the possible cat and mouse game. Will Smith stays in his character no matter how ridiculous the story gets. I really like his first encounter with Gene Hackman although the story gets a bit too chaotic in the last act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Clayton Dean is a successful Washington D.C. attorney who without his knowledge is given a tape that ties a top official of the national security to a political murder. Instantly every aspect of Dean's life is targeted by a lethal team of skilled NSA surveillance operatives, who wage a relentless, ultra high-tech campaign to discredit him and retrieve the incriminating evidence, Dean must protect the tape to reclaim his life and prove his innocence. This film starred: Will Smith, Gene Hackman &amp; Jon Voight.Enemy of the State was released in 1998, and in my opinion is a good suspense thriller, Will Smith is again awesome in this movie, like he is in pretty much every movie he is in.

After he receives some important evidence to a political crime,Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is soon being hunted by a group of professionals working for the NSA.

		<shortDescription>Precautionary tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being particularly fond of Will Smith, I gave this one a pass when it opened- but, being VERY fond of the late Tony Scott, I took it upon myself to sit down and finally watch ENEMY OF THE STATE. It was worth the time. The story of an innocent man getting caught up in The Machine is always worth a look; it could happen to ANYONE, and George Orwell and Franz Kafka and a whole lot of other people have pointed this out, again and again over the years. THAT'S what makes ENEMY OF THE STATE interesting: a man minding his own business gets caught up in the gears of The Machine and we see just HOW that Machine can masticate a man. It's happening for real even as I write this, and the mere notion is frightening. Who do you turn to in such a situation? Smith turns to Gene Hackman, who seems to be reprising his role from THE CONVERSATION (his hideout looks a LOT like the hideout he had in THE CONVERSATION). There's a lot more action in ENEMY OF THE STATE than there probably needs to be, and the neat way everything is resolved in the end- in a shootout- is typical Hollywood shorthand, but Smith's anger at being put upon by The Powers That Be rings true- as does his wild-eyed fear of The Machine. Let this one serve as a precautionary tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent But Slightly Forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to be honest about this film, it was decent when it came to story, characters and action, but for some odd reason it is very forgettable. I feel that the copious amount of well known actors gives the film a positive and negative effect. At times it brings humor and effective story progression but at other times, the extreme amount of characters takes away from the story. Some are more annoying then anything, but I digress. Its not a terrible film, it just doesn't' really catch the attention of the viewer. The acting from Will Smith, Gene Hackman, and Jon Voight is, as expected, enjoyable. The story is basic, which doesn't take away from the tone of the film. The subject matter is interesting enough. Again, there is nothing truly wrong with this film, it is just very insignificant in the grand scheme of cinema viewing life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the perfect thriller for a Saturday Night In.Will Smith puts in a fine performance in a serious role as a lawyer who is being chased by the establishment and framed. He handles serious roles very well and portrays the frustration and confusion of the character with great skill. Jon Voigt is excellent as a Government Official and manages to keep that calm persona throughout.It is Gene Hackman who steals the film though for me. Playing a mysterious character whose role and background are kept quiet until the end, he manages to portray a sense of urgency, secrecy, menace, dramatic irony and purpose. Yet he still keeps a vague sense of humour at the same time.There are a couple of good subplots in this film.. One which was totally unnecessary to the plot and one which appeared to be until the clever ending.I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say "Nothing thrills like thriller". When you have actors like Will Smith and Gene Hackman under the direction of thriller specialist Tony Scott, it is gotta be a nice ride and the team does not disappoint. Although it's hard to believe Will Smith in a character who is running helplessly for most of the time still the thrills are there and pacing is just right. Other actors also provide good support. Background score is average. Screenplay is tight most of the times. Movie also provides the food for thought about the important issue of national security versus invasion of privacy. Nice one if you are craving for a thriller any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one undeniable thing about Enemy Of The State, it's the sustained pace it unfolds in: no timeouts, the scenes flow together really fast, so it is quite hard to get bored.The premise is somewhat rather classic but one gets easily carried away by the plot, thanks mostly to the dynamism. Everyone portrayed their character well and the direction was pretty good. However, one could deplore the messy outcome, and the fact that the movie relies a bit too much on obvious convenient elements, sometimes little credible, especially regarding all the technological aspect.Enemy Of The State is an effective action/spy movie which, besides his first layer, also arouses interesting questions on matters that can always resonate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action Thriller That Tackles The Individual's Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action producing-directing team of Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott is back with another thrill-a-minute ride called Enemy of the State.It is a spy-thriller about a group of rogue NSA agents who kill a US Congressman and try to cover up the murder.It stars Will Smith and Gene Hackman, with Jon Voight, Lisa Bonet, and Regina King in supporting roles. The film was written by David Marconi and directed by Tony Scott. Robert Clayton Dean is a lawyer with a wife and family whose happily normal life is turned upside down after a chance meeting with a college buddy at a lingerie shop. Unbeknownst to the lawyer, he's just been burdened with a videotape of a congressman's assassination. Hot on the tail of this tape is a ruthless group of National Security Agents commanded by a belligerently ambitious fed named Reynolds. Using surveillance from satellites, bugs, and other sophisticated snooping devices, the NSA infiltrates every facet of Dean's existence, tracing each physical and digital footprint he leaves. Driven by acute paranoia, Dean enlists the help of a clandestine former NSA operative named Bril.The film is an action adventure first and foremost, and once we absorb that notion, it turns into a satisfying thriller.But nevertheless,it's good to see an action thriller have a story that has some real meaning and issues that may open quite a few eyes to the fragility of the rights of the individual in a world where things are moving too fast to control.And it definitely satisfies needs of those who crave for quality entertainment as much as the needs of those who like some food for thought.Obviously,Tony Scott on solid form and Will Smith confirming his action headliner status in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith &amp; Gene Hackman is enough but this is actually an amazing film too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only ever feel really bothered to review films that I think are truly brilliant and this is no exception. It is a lot more real and true than most people would think or have you believe. I watched a documentary recently about surveillance systems around the world and apparently the things that are used nowadays and are supposed to be new were actually made 40 years ago. That being said everything in this film I could imagine will most likely be very possible, weather its is being used today by governments is a different matter but if I had to say I would guess it is. I don't want to say much about the film it's self but it has got one of the best ending's to a film I have ever seen and even though it's on for just over 2 hours it feels like a 90 minute film. The story has everything you need in a thriller and has moments of humor as you would expect from Will Smith. It also has probably my favorite quote ever in film spoken by Gene Hackman about gorilla warfare and how to use your weakness' as strength's. All in all I just love this film and watched it again yesterday for the first time in about 3 years, and even though I have now seen it around about 10 time's it just seems to get better and better every time. Brilliant film, brilliant acting, brilliant story, AMAZING ending and truer to reality than you would like to think.</fullReview>

A very clever use of the available technology. I know it may have been a little advanced for its day, but its well within the realms of possibility today. As far as performances go, well Will Smith did a decent job as Robert Clayton Dean; the usual wise-cracks, but also some nice acting in-between. Gene Hackman did an excellent job (as ever) as Edward Lyle, as did Jon Voight as the cool calculating bad guy, Thomas Brian Reynolds. Honourable mentions must go to; Lisa Bonet as Rachel Banks, Regina King as Robert's wife, Carla Dean, Jake Busey and Scott Caan as the heavies Krug and Jones, Gabriel Byrne as Brill and Jack Black as Fiedler.Quite an enthralling and captivating film. It does take a bit of time to get going but once it does it keeps the pace pretty well until the end. If I have one criticism, it's that it's far too long. I enjoy a complex plot as much as the next guy, but this one did take a long time to tie all the various threads together. Over all a film with some very nice touches and some decent performances but I guess it's one you can't watch too many times.

There's the rub: the movie was made circa 1998 but what happened three years later?? (Clue: 11th. of September.) I am amused at the fact that I just accept all this technical trickery in 2012, and yes, I can look for any address on this planet by searching with Google Earth in my living room. I don't think it is too far fetched to believe that the US Government (or others) have the abilities of surveillance and control that this movie portrays, and I am slightly amused now that it is probably necessary, and desirable.

		<fullReview>"Enemy of the State" puts Will Smith in a classic Hitchcockian situation. He's in the wrong place at the wrong time and nefarious government agents are after him. The electronic hardware they use to track Smith and tear apart his life is frightening. This film might have been an above average thriller, but the introduction of Gene Hackman as a retired agent who helps Smith elevates it to sublime levels. Hackman subtly invokes the character of Harry Caul, the reclusive snoop he portrayed in the 70's classic, "The Conversation". Jon Voight continues his second, or is it the third, career as a villain. Lisa Bonet, who should be making more movies, is fine as a mysterious woman from Smith's past. Regina King provides solid support as Smith's beleaguered spouse. All in all, a classy ride. I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

Basically, the movie talks about the government spying on people.The acting is very good. Will Smith proves that he is action star we all like him to be.

		<fullReview>Edgey, novel and fast moving,full of great original gags around well framed personal and political struggles. A great achievement, the authors hold the accelerator right down well when moving and take it right off to build creative pace for some personal moments. The film is notable for its many well bound creative sequences and screen shots like the incomplete dialogs between Smith and Hackman and the uncertain case for the object of the chase. One of the most convincing and engaging sequences is the rapid and convincing way the team are able to follow the carrier using satellite - mirroring in practice the reality of the extensive future use of GPS, as it develops now. This film is well worth watching by a wide range of people. For those sensitive to violence and bare body moments there is nothing gratuitous with the normal level of both for that genre . Some of the sexual references are, like the one raised by a child at the end, really funny serious moments. While the orange moggy should take an Oscar for setting one of the unexpected scenes of clever pace craft and character, our little moggy would have done just that bit better lying upside down in Hackmans lap while he set the time bomb off in his own home . What a clever twist (" I told you not to use the phone!")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie an 8 not more. it could have been better if not of its flaws. Certain events and characters just seem to appear in the movie spontaneously confusing the viewer by means of clouding the previously clear storyline. I.e Rachel Banks ; in this movie she didn't fit in, i wasn't comfortable with her role, so either the director should disregard the character completely or give it the time and development the role deserves. i the whole movie she appeared like 5 minutes in total and every time i see her i get mentally and logically uncomfotable. how come such a role that has huge impact on the plot appears so little? i hate it when film makers do that! so she died so i thought, OK now ill just enjoy the rest of the movie without the confusion surrounding her (i have no idea how she has any affiliation with the main structure of the plot) so i watch and towards the end pops up another character (mafia boss which i didn't even know existed) without any preface/ pre- familiarization and its not one of those movie twists that explains who he is after a confusing scene. and TBH the whole ending was down right unsuitable for all the work up that preceded it since the beginning. Around the last 25 minutes the movie feels obviously rushed. still i think there is no movie post 2000 in this genre that does it better, this movies has all flavors of thriller and suspense. the part when tony says he sold the tape to the mafia boss, why don't we see that? still most of the flaws is towards the end probably because of this rushed state.</fullReview>

Will Smith, as a sometimes-clever-sometimes-stupid lawyer gives a very usual performance. Others are OK.Some of the sequences in this seemingly high-octane thriller might look little far-fetched, but nevertheless it is an enjoyable.

This comparison is so unflattering to EOTS that one wonders why the film makers harp on about it so much. If anything it proves the decline in artistry, ambition and intelligence in the intervening decades, a decline which has if anything accelerated since EOTS was made.A routine and hackneyed plot concerning Will Smith happening upon an incriminating piece of evidence leads to the usual harum scarum chase. Some of the action sequences are well done, but of little originality.

		<fullReview>I've seen this film at least 8 times and it just gets better every time, and that's my criteria for a 10. Longevity is the key to a classic film. Take for instance North by Northwest, I saw it in 1959 as a teen and just saw it recently for over the 40th time and it's still as good as it ever was. Enemy of the State is in the same genre and 10 years plus after it was released, it's as great as ever. How can you go wrong with Wil Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight heading a topnotch cast where Gabriel Byrne, Jason Robards and Tom Sizemore play small, but key roles and Jack Black, Barry Pepper, Jake Bussey, Seth Green and Jason Lee are in the supporting cast. The story itself is well written, highly engrossing and superbly directed by Tony Scott. This one has everything a proper action-adventure thriller needs to achieve success and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast thriller with privacy at stake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A political murder video ends up in lawyer Robert Dean's hands and makes him the target of the NSA The invasion of privacy, the question of politician's concerns, the drive to survive is Tony Scott's crime thriller.Opening with a controversial political assassination, Enemy of the State is instantly engaging and what follows is an intense and opinionated open plot that makes you wonder about political agendas and the much talked about invasion of privacy.David Marconi's script investigates the devices used by the NSA to track anybody who's an everybody and the investigation into the lives of the organisation is almost spooky with the technical devices used and the fact that anyone could be listening to your conversation. Whilst many may argue it is obviously sceptical, you cannot help but wonder what happens behind closed doors.The pace is consistently active with an investigation into the murder of a congressman turning into a thriller and drama once Independence Day actor Will Smith enters. The plot revolves around a man who finds a tape of the murder in his possession and then turning it over to Dean with his awareness. The NSA then track Dean into finding this tape that will unravel their organisation if ever exposed. The chase scenes at the beginning are well handed, maintaining enough realism without diving too far into exaggerated stunts or technical superiority. Dean's story adds drama to the mix with his business dealings with an ex-girlfriend and a struggling home life because of it.Smith's charm isn't fully active but he gains enough good will and drama to maintain the clueless act of a man who really does not know what is going on. Gene Hackman's Brill is one of the closed off intelligent guys that you have to love. That hard hit business like style with an own agenda and the little cheek the Unforgiven star brings is exquisite.There are lapses and unrealistic moments. You have to wonder if the NSA could have done more to obtain the tape in a more quicker fashion and the final showdown is an overstretched coincidental mismatch that you have to feel is too finely played, as if it is purposefully played without consideration of realism.Regardless this 1998 picture is a timeless thriller that generates high drama and tension through a controversial ideology and engaging narrative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for about the 6th time. It was a Sunday afternoon TV broadcast and, even with commercial breaks and knowing the story so well, I raced back to the sofa so I wouldn't miss a scene. As a suspense/action spectacle, this film has it all: imagination, engrossing topic, a solid script, and a visual pace that keeps you glued to the screen. It's real genius, however, is found in the uniquely interwoven assortment of strong characters who are all intense, intelligent and colorful and as different from one another as they could possibly be and still be in the same storyline. The actors and the characters they play, the plot, the dialogue, the direction, and the "message" all add up to one of the most entertaining and audience-centric movies ever made. For a movie that is 10 years old, it remains a gratifying pleasure to watch...more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another movie about the little man being targeted by the government (the pigs inside who try to get to the top even if it means killing innocent people).Lucky us Will Smith (the best actor this days i believe) knows how to take the garbage out, even if it doesn't look like it in the beginning.You can even admire such a person, who's all life has been marked black by the government, getting him fired, making his wife go against him etc...ago... and i do believe I liked the plot, the action and the actors- great work!The concept of the movie overall, is to uncover that privacy is an illusion, and you can be watched and heard even when you don't expect it. the movie was taken 10 years ago, and now days there are pin sized cameras, or microphones that can be everywhere. So are we really alone? Also, the movie makes you think that the movie was taken 10 years ago... and i do believe I liked the plot, the action and the actors- great work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith plays a lawyer who receives information that the government does not want to be leaked. When he is discovered, he becomes an innocent victim and becomes discredited so that he cannot say anything about what he has been given.The storyline to this movie is a very good one. It deals with the issues of being under constant surveillance. There is also a lot of tension to keep you on the edge. Will Smith did a very good job and proves that its not just comedy roles that he can do. Gene Hackman was electrifying in his role. I was however disappointed with the lack of action in this movie. There were many moments in the film which I really felt they could have made decent action sequences out of.Although Tony Scott does make very good movies, I have eventually come to realise that he can't really make proper action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit long but an entertaining big budget Hollywood action thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy of the State is set in Washington DC where New York congressman Phillip Hammersley (Jason Robards) is assassinated at an isolated lake by politician Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) because of his opposition to the Telecommunications Security &amp; Privacy Act which Reynolds is trying to get passed as law. Reynolds thinks he has gotten away with it but wildlife photographer Daniel Zavitz (Jason Lee) has a digital camera placed at the lake to monitor &amp; record Canadian Geese, the camera filmed the whole incident in super high quality &amp; Reynolds is clearly visible. Reynolds sends some men to take care of Zavisz but he manages to get away &amp; slip the video footage contained on a disc to labour lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) before he is run down by a fire engine, unsure of how much Dean knows Reynolds &amp; his men set out to ruin his life &amp; discredit him as well as get the video back...Directed by Tony Scott this political conspiracy action thriller is a neat little reminder of the sort of society we live in, that we basically have no privacy anymore &amp; plays on our fears surrounding it. Originally widely released as an 'R' rated film running a little over two hours an 'Unrated' extended cut has been subsequently released containing an extra ten or so minutes, I will be basing my comment on the original theatrical cut. The script by David Marconi takes the all to relevant issue of privacy, covert Government surveillance &amp; whether we have the right to do what we want when we want without politicians or the people &amp; agencies who work for them knowing our every move. Certainly here in the UK there are CCTV everywhere, maybe the highest percentage in the entire world in fact &amp; the whole 'Big Brother' is watching you mentality is used very effectively in Enemy of the State which plants it's allegiance on the side of the individual &amp; that things are going too far with questions like who are going to monitor the people who are monitoring us? The film also paints an all too believable picture of how this new technology could be used for more sinister purposes. So here's a big Hollywood film with a surprisingly relevant message about an important social issue which is unusual. The film maintained ones interest throughout, the story is good, it's entertaining to see Dean's life fall apart &amp; there are some good if slightly low key action scenes. It's not perfect though, at over two hours I must admit it did feel quite long at times, the ending is rather stupid as it descends into more traditional silly Hollywood thriller territory &amp; stretched the films credibility a bit while the Reynolds character played by Jon Voight is given virtually no motivation &amp; his stock villain character is at odds with everyone else.The film has that big budget glossy look about it, lots of elaborate chases including one through an expensive hotel &amp; a cool car chase between two trains. Having said that there are no really huge set-pieces apart from a building blowing up, there's a lot of foot chases which are alright but not that spectacular to look at. The violence is fairly tame &amp; by Tony Scott action film standards the body count is very low.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 Enemy of the State is as well made as you like with high production values. Apparently Tom Cruise was originally cast as Dean but he had to pull out since he was still filming Eyes Wide Shut (1999) &amp; that's a good thing since Will Smith is great in this role, he makes Dean so likable with lots of boyish charm &amp; amusing quick fire one-liners. Love him or loathe him he's perfect for this sort of part. Gene Hackman puts in a good performance too although he takes nearly an hour to turn up. Jon Voight seems a little flat &amp; not at his best. Surprisingly respected actor Gabrile Byrne only appears for about a minute in nothing more than a cameo. Amazingly Tom Sizemore is uncredited in what is a fairly large role.Enemy of the State is a great action thriller that I am sure most people will be able to relate to in some way, sure it eventually goes into silly Hollywood thriller mode but it's none the worse for it I suppose. I just wish it wasn't quite as long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good if you don't watch many movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger, and just growing into my love of movies, I would frequently complain that film critics always hated the mainstream movies, and would only give favorable reviews to the weird, artsy ones. While there's some truth in that, there's a reason for it too. Movies at the multiplexes can often become repetitive, and don't have as high of an intelligence level as the average viewer. This problem gets worse as the number of movies one watches increases, hence the term "critic" comes into play. Such is the case with "Enemy of the State." It's great until you start thinking about it like a critic, then you recognize all the seams and problems.I am getting off on a tangent, and I apologize. To be fair, "Enemy of the State" is above par compared with most entries in the conspiracy thriller genre. It's fast-paced, well-acted, and pretty smart. Sure, at times it goes over the top, but I'm willing to forgive because of all it does right.Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is a lawyer who has to go on the run after he comes into possession of a tape that has the recording of a congressman being murdered. Soon the government is onto him, tracking his every move, and the only one he can trust is the elusive, and slightly paranoid, Brill (Gene Hackman).Probably the best thing that "Enemy of the State" has going for it is the performances. Will Smith is one of the most underrated actors around. Usually limited only to brainless summer action movies, this allows him to show his acting talent while still in a genre that he's comfortable with. Smith's character could have become another generic action hero, but Smith is smart and talented enough to play Dean as a human being, not a writer's construct. Dean is a normal man trapped in an extraordinary situation. The little things make Dean more believable: how he acts around his family, what he does, how he talks, etc. This makes him more believable, and elevates the film. The script calls for him to do some dumb things, but Smith manages to soften the blows considerably. Yet at the same time, Dean does some smart things too (some of which I believed, some I didn't). He knows how to cover himself without being told (a rarity for someone who is a lawyer, instead of a cop or something). For example, when he finds a woman dead and realizes that he's being framed, he doesn't just run away or try to make it look like there was a struggle, he picks up as much evidence as he can and then leaves.Smith is supported by a talented cast. Gene Hackman is Gene Hackman, only a little quieter and without as much bravado. Credit goes to Hackman for underplaying his character's paranoia so as to not make Brill look like a nutjob. Jon Voight, well, one gets what they pay for when they see him in a role like this. Regina King is cast against type as Dean's wife, who's not a tough, but instead a normal wife, and she plays it well. Lisa Bonet is terrific in a small role, but Bonet makes her three-dimensional with the screen time that she has. It's a wonder why the former Cosby kid doesn't get any more roles as an adult (for my money, she's better as an adult).There are also a lot of up and coming (at the time) stars who make appearances here: Scott Caan, Barry Pepper, Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, Seth Green, Gabriel Byrne, Tom Sizemore, Jason Lee, Jason Robards, and Philip Baker Hall.Tony Scott is a great choice for this material. He keeps the pace fast, and things never let up, but he doesn't shortchange anything. Nothing seems like it was left on the cutting room floor. The gimmicks he is known for are very restrained, and help serve the material instead of hurting it.Still, sometimes the film goes over the top. Perhaps the budget was too big for its own good, but the amount of force that was after Dean seems excessive (the film could have lost the helicopter-if the Voight's character wanted to be discreet, would he really have made it look like he was going after the number one person on "America's Most Wanted?"). Additionally, the script makes some dumb moves. As good as Will Smith is, he can't cover up some of the blunders, like calling his house when he knows it's bugged.I enjoyed the fact that this film was geared towards adults, instead of a teenager movie with more violence and language. It allows for some interesting plot developments to happen, and it allows the actors more room to breathe. Considering this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, it's a sad memoriam for the films he used to produce before he "sold out" and only made big budget brainless action movies for the teenage crowd. This is his last, more adult-oriented big-budget movie that ISN'T a complete downer (like Black Hawk Down).Strangely, with all of the fuss about the Patriot Act and personal security these days, "Enemy of the State" doesn't manage to find a deeper level with its uncanny resemblance to today's world. Maybe that's for the best though, so the viewer can enjoy it on its own terms, cause it's a fun ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment we first see him, Will Smith starts running. Moving throughout a urban, aggressive jungle, the character of Robert Dean can't take a breath being chased by the Almighty eye of the political power and having no private space or time to rest (any coincidence with real life is; just a coincidence :)), making the movie an exciting and fun roller coaster trip.Tony Scott, is far from his brother's zone, but his less universal movies are done with a huge professional production, and you can sure trust them your time and money because it is pretty much sure that you will have a blast time and end satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done Govt Big-Brother paranoia story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy of the State is a good suspense thriller about an innocent caught up in a government crime conspiracy, even if some of the plot line is material we've seen before.Will Smith does a great job as an average Joe inexorably thrust into the role of a targeted victim on the run. In true X-Files paranoia fashion, the government baddies uses illegal spy technology to invade Smith's private life and later chase him, and Smith doesn't even know what they're after.Gene Hackman, as Smith's unwilling ally, is always good in these action thrillers (think French Connection), and he serves as the impetus by which the audience learns what's really going on. He was once one of "them," an ex-technician, and is familiar with all the scurrilous spy practices and technology. The contrast of Hackman's seasoned, knowledgeable, and paranoid character with Smith's more naive hero provides a clichd but functional teaming.Exciting chase scenes maintain high levels of tension, but some look suspiciously familiar (like the tunnel/storm drain scene "borrowed" from The Fugitive). Also, it's pretty silly to see views from the "spy satellite," when the car they're tracking through Baltimore or Washington is always the only one on the street. The mystery develops well, and is punctuated by several close-calls in the pursuit. It builds to an unexpected and extremely rewarding conclusion. This film is a good watch for any fan of the suspense/thriller/action genres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably Will Smiths best film to date and almost certainly one of the best thrillers around. Tony Scott directs the film excellently, he builds tension and directs the action scenes with flair and combined with a good script that has an engrossing storyline this film is very good, definitely one to watch. The story starts off when a politician is murdered, the act is watched over by NSA deputy director(I think) played by John Voight in an excellently villainous performance. He doesn't realise that he has been captured on film inadvertantly by a bird watcher. When Voights NSA(national security agency) team hunts down the witness, they chase throughout the city to retreave the tape from him, the witness drops the tape in a bag carried by Will Smith without Smith knowing, anyway the witness is killed and their attentions turn to Smiths character Robert Dean. They precede to ruin Deans life, to try to get the tape which for a long while he doesn't realise he has. The plot develops at a great pace as Robert Deans life becomes increasingly endangered, he then meets with Gene Hackmans character who reluctantly helps him out, he then also becomes a target himself when they discover that he is ex-NSA. Anyway the film is always interesting as it unfolds, there is great action and Smith is brilliant in the lead. All the actors in this are excellent particularly the thre leads Smith, Hackman and Voight and overall the film is a great piece of cinema. 9/10</fullReview>

The pacing is very tight, the plot holds together fairly well. And I just LOVE the climactic scene that plays several plot lines against each other.It has been commented that his is sort-of a sequel to THE CONVERSATION, especially for Gene Hackman's character. While it doesn't quite fit, there are definitely parallels between the two stories; and I think that should be seen as a great complement to this movie. Certainly they are both very well portrayed stories about the art of spying, and the ethical responsibilities of dealing with sensitive information for national security. And also the difficulty in finding the balance between the needs of the state, and the freedoms of the individual.The supporting cast for this is alsouniformly excellent; especially the tech roles performed by Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, Jake Busey and Ian Hart. I'm totally drooling with envy for those guys. And Jason Lee's role as the victim caught in the middle ofthe situation was cool as well.Definitely worth seeing for an intelligent escapist thrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Smart and fast-moving techno-thriller. More intelligent than most of Scott and Bruckheimer's combined back-catalogue, this delivers the goods with a number of exciting chase scenes and some original, nifty spy gadgets and jargon. A congressman who plans to block a bill that will increase the government's right to invade peoples' privacy is murdered. The murder is unwittingly taped, and when the evidence is planted on hotshot lawyer Robert Dean (Smith), he soon finds his life in ruins and government agents dogging his every move. Smith is cool, although clearly acting more like a grown-up than in previous movie roles. Hackman, as ex-secret serviceman Brill, is dependably dour and cantankerous, giving a human touch when the movie's tech-heavy vibe threatens to take over. Support from the likes of Voight and Bonet is great, and there are lots of other familiar faces to spot too.I'm not usually a fan of conspiracy movies, but this one kept me hooked.

		<shortDescription>Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so well-made that it scares me. The possibility that the NSA could be monitoring us at every moment makes you wonder. They know every move we make so maybe the only privacy we have left is really inside our heads. This movie was so smart, thrilling, and fast-paced that you'd almost think it was real life. Will Smith is engaging as usual, but I think Gene Hackman and Jon Voight steal the show. I wish Hollywood made more intelligent movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Serious Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet again, another blockbuster for Will Smith the following year. This time, his role was much more believable, and interest in the plot was carried through to the end of the film by the established leading actor, Gene Hackman. It seems that Will Smith's films are far more enhanced when he has an experienced leading actor to bounce off like Tommy Lee Jones or Gene Hackman. It is at the time when Gene Hackman makes his appearance in the film that you are almost about to fall asleep. He comes in at a time in the film when Smith can no longer carry the audience through to the end with his home boy personality, and a much needed grounded personality steps in to take the audience through to the end. Gene Hackman gives weight and credibility to a film which could easily have just been relegated to the status of a commercial film. The way forward for Will now is to team up with other established leading actors so that he can mature into the film acting world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is basically that Dean a lawyer ends up on the run from the NSA, after he ends up with evidence against them (a video tape.)This is a very compelling Thriller. The tension is there all the way through, with a bit of humour thrown in as well. I particularly like the clever way that Dean(Will Smith) evades his pursuers, with the help of Brill (Gene Hackman). Also there is quite a large hi-tech element, which is particularly effective, as we view the action from satellites, and surveilance cameras, and the like.There is plenty of action, but the whole film is well focused, and all the action is there to move the plot on, there is little or no padding. Overall a film well worth watching.</fullReview>

Frustratingly one-sided but at least Will Smith got his chance to even the odds near the end of the long tale.Not a very credible film though -- the incredibly naive NSA techies, that really stupid scene where the computer can interpolate 3D views of a 2D satellite picture, Smith's lame wife... all these spoiled an otherwise believable story that warns us of the perils of uncontrolled technological abuse.</fullReview>

And when deputy director Jon Voight's plan boils to the surface, how the NSA Admiral in charge bangs his fist on the table... this is probably as much of real life within that agency as outsiders will ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Budgeted Paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has one real purpose. Make you paranoid. It succeeds. It's also more topical now that when it was released too. In any case, Will Smith plays Robert Clayton Dean, an intelligent, respected lawyer who comes into possession of some very sensitive material. The kind that gets you killed. Naturally all sorts of fun follows from there as you could probably have guessed. Wiretaps, plants, bugs, agendas, tons of chase scenes, murder, lies, cover-up, Black Ops, body bags, etc.Without launching into specifics, it goes without saying the story has faults, is this plausible and such, but it moves at such a clip that there is very little time to debate. The cast more than adequately carry it through. Will gives his usual cool, controlled performance. Gene Hackman is his usual good self and Jon Voight turns in a subdued performance that benefits the material. There is also a substantial supporting cast of recognizable faces. Jack Black, Seth Green, Barry Pepper, Mat Le Gros, Jake Busey, Loren Dean, Scott Caan, Jason Lee, an unbilled Tom Sizemore and the always serious faced Gabriel Byrne. If you are an avid movie-goer, these faces go a long way in sustaining interest.Lastly for a production from half of the Michael Bay / Jerry Bruckheimer alliance, this is relatively relaxed (for lack of a better word). Enemy Of The State is still a high budget, highly stylized product, but it feels nowhere near a music video as some felt their other projects have been. The story isn't the tightest, characters are written knee deep and the ending is a little too neat, happy, pat, but it's another notch in Will Smith's career and a half decent watch in it's own right. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So THAT'S what the NSA looks like inside!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, right. It's straight out of the mind of a Hollywood production designer. If you're interested in the National Security Agency -- its history, what it does, how it works and a whole lot more -- read James Bamford's "The Puzzle Palace."On with the movie comments: I've never been a Will Smith fan, but he does okay here. In fact the whole cast is good -- Gene Hackman and Jon Voigt particularly. The problem with this flick is that after the initial setup, it's one big chase. For action fans that's fine, but for folks interested in stories with more layers about surveillance, I point you toward Francis Ford Coppola's "The Conversation" or Alan Pakula's "Klute" -- in fact, it looks like they took the Harry Caul character from "The Conversation" and put him in here twenty or so years later! At the end of the day, I think Tony Scott, writer Marconi and producer Bruckheimer succeeded in making an action thriller with the message: "you can always be watched." But this isn't a classic paranoia flick (unlike "The Parallax View" or "Three Days of the Condor"), but it works. Definitely worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly entertaining yet annoying high-tech thriller about a young, brash, and very successful Washington, D.C. labor lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) who's supposedly happy life is turned upside down by a scheming N.S.A executive, Reynolds (Jon Voight) whose small unit of desperate cronies try to get a small piece of crucial evidence from the lawyer that's the key in solving the murder of a Congressman (the late Jason Robards, who's unbilled here). However, Robert is lucky enough to find help from an underground intelligence expert named "Brill" (Gene Hackman). The problem that I had with the film was it got so carried away in the second half, then I had lost my interest in it. Despite that, the performances here are good and so is the photography and editing, which are excellent. "Enemy of the State" could have been a masterpiece, but blows it at the end. Besides Robards, Tom Sizemore, Seth Green, and Philip Baker Hall also appear uncredited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Paced Techno-Thriller with Dubious Technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Enemy of the State I thought it seemed to be a very up-to-date version of Hackman's "The Conversation", however to confuse both of them is misleading and frankly inadvised.The Conversation is much better in terms of story, character development and intelligently directed, whereas Enemy of the State relies on fast-paced video feed, special-effects, good characters and its fast-paced techno-thrilling story that uses "Dubious" technology.I guess it doesn't matter to the casual viewer that most of the technology or the aspects/role of the NSA seem impossible, its more of a thriller or an actioner than credibly realisitc, and it doesn't matter that in the Lingere shop everyone seems incredibly beautiful...Anyway, whether or not the technology or the role of the NSA seem impossible or not there is no denying that this is a good watch, but you kinda feel that half way thru you don't know where its going - and then it seems to turn its Anti-Surveilliance Message around onto the bad guys, using their tricks against themselves...By that point I was kinda thinking "what?! - this film starts out as an anti-surveilliance film, now its pro...if not for surveillance, wouldn't Jon Voight have just killed the old man and gotten away with his murder?"Anyway, with all the problems of technology and changing the plot for no reason, its a good enjoyable yarn that sometimes doesn't know whether to base its premise in fiction or reality and unfortuently for the film it gets very blurred and the viewer can be left with a hanging question on their minds "how much was that real and how much wasn't?"This film is good, but I'd prefer the Conversation more.Overall: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you have read correctly. This is my number 153 movie ( outta 750 about ). It is very thrilling, the action is good, the actors do a good job, and the story is good. Enemy of the State is about a stolen video. On this video you can see that any politician was murdered, by his rival. Robert Clayton Dean ( Will Smith ) gets that video , when his friend, who is chased by the murderers, meets him in a shop for underwear, that Robert wants to buy for his wife. This murderers know pretty soon, that Robert has that video. So they have to search for him, but the point is, that Robert does not know why he is chased by them. The former NSA-Agent Brill ( Gene Hackman ) tries to help him to get out of his situation, but he does not want to endanger himself. Robert loses the trust of his wife, but finally he gets his life back. Enemy of the State is a very good action film, because it concentrates on the story and not on the special effects or the action. I recommend this to people who want to see an action-film with a (very?) good story and good actors. Highly recommendable. All in all, I rated this movie 9/10. WELL DONE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"THE TRUMAN SHOW" for Everyman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ENEMY OF THE STATE delivers a somber message while pulling us along with the adrenaline rush. That message: "I love my country but fear my government." Will Smith plays a labor lawyer who becomes the unwitting victim of an Candidate for assistant director of the National Security Agency. Smith has accidentally received an extremely damaging video of a assasination of a US Congressman whom was opposed to a bill which would give NSA broad new powers to investigate American citizens. The coincidence involved in Smith's inception of the video is the weakest element of the film. Also, unlike DIE HARD's John McClain, Smith's character has no background to enable to fight back the overwealming power brought to bear on him. Only his association with a shadowy character portrayed by Gene Hackman keeps him alive for much of the course of the movie. The picture is largely plausible, except for the speed at which "spy" satellites are engaged to track Smith. Certainly the ending is highly plausible, though it does require another stretch of "coincidence."Thank goodness, Smith is along for the ride. Without some humor to leaven this movie, ENEMY OF THE STATE would probably be an unwatchable horror tale. It CAN happen here (and probably DOES). Remember that while you are watching the end credits...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the fastest moving action films to come out in years, Enemy of the State grabs the audience and holds on until the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy of the State is the unlikely story of Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) who is the unknowing recipient of a tape showing the politically motivated murder of an uncooperative Senator. Even though the premise is a little bit farfetched, the movie as a whole is so relentlessly entertaining an fun that it is possible to overlook things like that. Will Smith is excellent in his role, and the extensive supporting cast also does a very good job. However, I think that the best quality of this film is the way that it was made. The extensive use of surveillance camera cinematography make the spectacular chase even more paranoid and intense, and the technology displayed in the film is also very impressive.Enemy of the State should be noted especially for the fact that it was able to take a very unlikely premise and turn it into a great action thriller. The way the film was put together allowed for the audience's attention to be entirely consumed while the visually intense film whipped through the story of a man being chased by people he doesn't know so that they can get a tape that he doesn't even know he has. Luckily, Dean is a defiant man, otherwise the agents who came to his door early in the film would have had a quick look through his purchases, found the tape, and everyone would have lived happily ever after (except for the Senator who was killed, of course). Enemy of the State is just a good action/thriller. It is well made, well-acted, and very interesting and fun to watch. It presents a chase scenario beaten only by the legendary Fugitive, and later rivaled by the excellent Arlington Road. Definitely a must-see for any action fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TITLE: Enemy of the StateRATING: *** (out of ****)A Review by BroncoWill Smith has become really popular since "Independence Day" and "Men in Black". I really enjoyed both of those movies and now he is starring in a action movie. The last action movie he did was the good "Bad Boys" and can this movie live up to that? And the answer is a definite yes.The movies begins with a murder of a Congressman. The murderers are Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) and his thugs. Unbeknowist to them, the whole murder was recorded by Daniel Zavitz (Jason Lee) and once they find out, they go after them. And, meanwhile, Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is shopping and he runs into Zavitz running from the thugs and Zavitz slips the tape into his shopping bags and he doesn't know about it. And now Dean's life is turned upside-down as the thugs are after him and the only person that can help him is a mysterious person named Brill (Gene Hackman). This movie has a lot of action in it and it keeps at a good pace. The performances are done well especially Hackman as Brill. And you can't forget Voight who also does an excellent job as the villian. And I also must say that the thugs were chosen very well. There is a little humor in the movie and most of it is rather funny (especially one scene where Dean is taking off his clothes). One big flaw in the film is the ending which is just one big shootout where most of the people in it die. But it does wrap everything up but it's just a little silly if you ask me. Action fans should definitely check this movie out. It's definitely not the best but it's definitely not the worst out there. Fans of any of the cast shouldn't be disappointed but Hackman isn't in it that much suprisingly. An overall good action movie that is recommended. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Octane Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As movies go, this is a pretty good movie, and worth seeing at least once. There are several lapses of logic, however, which shouldn't happen in a good thriller. The tension should be maintained by the fact that not only is it fast-paced, it should also have a logical integrity.For instance, the second that Dean knows that his conversation with Rachel Banks (ultra-gorgeous Lisa Bonet) has become public, the first thing he should be doing is walk to the nearest department store and get a change of clothes, shoes, socks, and cell phone.Secondly, him calling home after being on the run is totally illogicalfrom the character's point of view (of course, it keeps the chase going...).He may not be a tech-head, but as a super-slick lawyer, he should at least have a clue that they're on to him.And what's more. It's as if the bad guys are all cutouts from a funky version of "Hackers" - they seem way too young to be hardened covert operatives. It is as if the makers wanted to give the audience an alternative side to root for.And what's even more, Hackman's oratory on how the NSA is tapping all conversations that come up with the words "Allah" or "bomb" is, to me, totally unbelievable. There is no voice-recognition softwareout there that can reliably distinguish between "bomb", "boom" or "bam", in everyday conversation, over a phone line, not with all the regional accents out there ("buuuhm", "bahwm", "bom").And, you get to find out what happened to the guy (well, almost) from The Conversation, after he tore up his room looking for bugs (he's living in a copper wire mesh loft, to "keep out the radiowaves"). ;-)All that aside, even though this film feels horribly familiar (Mission: Impossible, Hackers, The Firm), it is entertaining, although it doesn't spend very much effort on developing an interesting plot, the effects are exhilerating. And, I do love high octane thrillers.</fullReview>

Gene Hackman is terrific, he always puts an effort into his work and it shows here. The rest of the cast are just okay. The premise is totally unrealistic, but it's only made to entertain and feed us total rubbish about the National Security Agency.Tony Scott's direction is average, this is the same guy who directed the very stylish 'The Hunger'. The framing in this film is horrid! I only watch Widescreen movies and was disappointed that Tony didn't always frame the shots very well.For filler, this movie will certainly pass 2 hours at quick speed, but at the end of the picture you'd probably think it was a waste.As usual, I highly recommend viewing this picture in widescreen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smith's blockbuster season goes on and on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith shows off his under-rated acting ability again during his rich vein of blockbusters, in what is a scary tale of governmental surveillance and Big Brother.Labour lawyer Smith is passed an encrypted video tape without his knowledge, and is being tracked by Jon Voight until he turns the tape over - difficult as he is unaware that he has it.Gene Hackman links up with Smith as he attempts to determine why he is being chased, and why the government is messing his life up. Smith has contacts with former girlfriend and shady investigator's agent Lisa Bonet, and this brings to the fore all kinds of turmoil within his marriage and his family.Smith is excellent as he investigates and rebuilds his life, and the natural humour he brings to the role makes this - along with being a rather disturbing film on the espionage front - much worth seeing and excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing film. True, that in the past, Mr. Smith has not been brilliant at picking movies. But this film really does give him credibility as an actor. He plays a labor lawyer who accidently gets caught in the middle of a well planned and executed murder, and finds himself on the run from the very people how are meant to be protecting him; the government. All the hype about "It's not really paranoia; they're really after you", does come through in this film, and in some ways, it is very, very unnerving. Smith is bugged and monitored right down to his wrist watch, and all under his nose.I loved watching this film. As fan of anything like this action/drama/thriller, I think it is one of the best I have seen yet. The plot line is bloody amazing, with every single loose end tied up into a very intricate and complicated story. Every single thing that you could possibly think of - "Well, what about this....." - has been thought about and is aken care of. It had me sitting on the edge of my seat.The end, for me, is rather disappointing, but it has to be said that a "Enemy Of The State - Part II" would just be stupid as no sequel could compare to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my personel favorite movie, because the plot made lots of sense and it was very nerve-wracking. There were also great acting in it from Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Regina King, Barry Pepper, Scott Caan and short yet great appearances from Jason Robard and Gabriel Byrne. The movie makes lots of sense, nothing controdicts itself. The only improvement I would have made would be to put either Samuel L. Jackson or Denzel Washington in place of Will Smith, because Smith is in more funny movies, and this movie was pretty dramatic in some parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Bruckheimer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has many of the qualities seen in Jerry Bruckheimer movies. Lots of action, a "modern" score, and a high degree of intensity. In fact, the intensity is overdone at times. It is directed by Tony Scott, who has directed a number of Bruckheimer films. Will Smith and Gene Hackman both give good performances, and they work well together on screen. Jon Voight also does a good job as the villain. I've heard people say that the in real life the NSA has become a stumbling bureaucracy that couldn't act the way it is portrayed in the movie, and I've also heard people say that government surveillance is getting tighter all the time and that personal privacy will soon be a thing of the past. In any case, this movie is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I call a perfect movie. The director really did a great job. I don't think it could be any better. The plot was phenomenal. A corrupt NSA man murders a high-standing politician in a park, where, a hundred yards away, a nature photographer set up a video camera to photograph the wild geese. It accidentally records the murder. The NSA finds out about it and goes after the guy. The photographer gives the tape to Will Smith, without him knowing about it. Then, he is chased around the city by the NSA. Will Smith is perfect for the role, and Gene Hackman does an excellent job as the ex-NSA dude who helps Will Smith. The plot twist at the end was very clever. The movie was very fast-paced and full of action. A great technological thriller. This receives a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Will Smith movie to date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed ENEMY OF THE STATE very very much. I like Will Smith, even though I found WILD WILD WEST very disappointing, and I thought this movie looked great when advertised. I was not disappointed. This is by far better than any of Will Smith's movies so far.Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) seems to have an average American life. He has a pretty wife and a fine young son, as well as his own house and a successful job as a lawyer. But when he accidentally finds himself with evidence of politician Thomas Brian Reynolds (Jon Voight) killing somebody, his entire life is in jeopardy. His job destroyed, his reputation tarnished and his life in danger by Renolds and a gang of military soldiers and hackers, he turns to a friend, Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet). She leads him to Brill, (Gene Hackman) a paranoid informant who is also on the run from the government, to help him.The acting in this movie is great. Will Smith is at his absolute best in this movie, but the spotlight does probably belong to Gene Hackman for his part as Brill. Seth Green also does a great job as what started as a cameo and became a vital part of the movie. Jon Voight is superb as the evil politician, Lisa Bonet does well as Smith's ex-girlfriend, and Regina King does a fair job as Smith's wife. All of the characters are cool and interesting, especially those of Smith, Hackman, Voight and Green.The action is this movie is terrific. There are some very entertaining chases, both car and foot, as well as gunfights and explosions. The ending is also pretty cool. The realism is a little far fetched, (especially when Will Smith goes into a lingerie shop and there are tons of good looking girls modeling it all over the store) but it is believable enough for the viewer to have fun.I really enjoyed this movie and will buy it first chance I get. Go out and rent it and enjoy, you'll probably feel the same way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Hackman is Brilliant in almost everything he does, including Enemy of The State. I'll admit I'm not a big action movie fanatic, but this one won my time to watch it. If you like action films that have to do with a lot of what's going on today and make you think (about your privacy in this case) then this one you should watch. Usually if a movie is action every single minute it seems to take away from the acting, but not in this case. Gene Hackman and Will Smith seem to combine perfectly in this playing off each other. The ending may have been a bit predictable, but not that bad to not watch it. Action/suspense fans should get their hands on this one. I rated it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept of this movie is almost mind-blowing. To think that the government has the capabilities displayed in this great movie sends chills down my spine. I'll tell you what gives me chills more than that, Barry Pepper. The gorgeous young actor who plays operative James Pratt. Yes, he's on the bad boy squad, and yes, he murders a few people, but I can't get this guy out of my mind. Forget watching the movie for entertainment, I watch for him. Sorry, Will Smith, but you've been upstaged by a young Canadian actor who's incredible demeanor blows your wit and charm right out of the proverbial waters. What I can't believe is the way Barry Pepper can hold his gun like it's another appendage. His serious scowl and cutting eyes make the rest of the world receed into the background. This guy is all I could think of when I saw this movie. I can't wait to see him in future films. I also have to give a nod to Jake Busey (Operative Krug)and Scott Caan (Operative Jones). Jake Busey's unconventional features make him gorgeous in the not so gorgeous way. It is curious the way he draws people in with his perfect imperfections. Not to mention the guy can act a bit, too. And as for Scott Caan, I have always revered his sometimes forgotten father, James Caan, as a sexy side note to good films. I can see that Scott will not have a hard time following in his footsteps. No problem at all. Just keep your eye out for that Barry Pepper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense? What suspense?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was rather disappointed in this film. The trailers and video slip cover would have you believe this film is a suspense thriller. It isn't. There is zero suspense or mystery in the movie, and it would be better if there were. Will Smith's *character* is not aware of what is happening to him or who is responsible for it through most of the film. But the *viewer* knows all along who did what, why they did it, why they're after him...even exactly what they're doing to try and trap him. What could have been an edge-of-your-seat conspiracy thriller is reduced to a ho-hum action flick as we watch chase scene after chase scene where we know exactly who the chaser and chasee are.The movie isn't badly made or anything. It's just very standard fare. It looked like it would be better, and with a subtle shift in focus, it could have been much better. I felt like I was the victim of a bait-and-switch.I give it a 5 out of 10. This movie is almost the textbook definition of an average picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Enemy of the State" is fast, intelligent, and thought-provoking. It's a cut above the run-of-the-mill action flick we are used to from Hollywood. Gene Hackman and Jon Voight are welcome presences here, and Will Smith is establishing himself nicely as an action lead. The references in other reviews here to Hitch's recurrent device of placing an unknowing innocent at the center of dangerous events he does not comprehend are, I think apt. The technical side of the surveillance and tracking technology portrayed are, I fear, only slightly beyond the pale of reality.The production values are first-rate, and the pacing is breathless.Finally, the civil liberties issues the movie raises in an age where the public demand for security seems to be resulting in a government appetite for more stringent means of poking into our affairs, are extremely apropos.</fullReview>

By some quake of fate he suddenly realize what it's all about and manages to solve the situation, thereby saving himself, his newly won friend, and, not least, his family. Oh, he also saves his country.Sounds like a turkey, doesn't it. Well, Hitchcock used the theme lots of times, and very few of his films are regarded as being turkeys, right?Lots of directors have tried the concept thru the years, and very few has succeeded. This is one of the lucky moments when the script-writer and the director managed to make it gel.This is really a Hitchcock-movie for the nineties. Good actors, flashy cinematography, great tempo (so you won't notice the holes in the script) and also a little message as a bonus.Terrific entertainment.

		<fullReview>On the level of pure escapism, this is a good movie. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the viewer's attention throughout.Tony Scott's direction keeps the action flowing and the viewer guessing as to what will happen next.Will Smith as the main character is good, however, he still conjures up memories of the "Fresh Prince" in his performance. Even in the face of adversity, he still manages to come up with those smart-ass one liners.Gene Hackman in a role reminiscent of "The Conversation" (1974) is excellent as always and in my opinion, steals the film. Jon Voight fast becoming everone's favorite high-tech villain, turns in a chilling performance as the chief baddie. And yes, that was the same Lisa Bonet who was in the original Cosby Show and shines in the role of Smith's ex-girlfriend and contact.I'm always amazed at the stamina of the actors in those Hollywood style foot-chase scenes.

		<fullReview>Every once in a while a film comes along that grabs you from the get-go...keeps you on the edge of your seat...is a thriller that makes you want to come back for more again and again...This 'aint it."Enemy of the State" is a 'fun' film. The deeper into it you go, the more things you just can't believe. How can someone pack this much conspiracy into 2 hours? It's fun to try and predict what is coming next (however, this wasn't that difficult at times). Although Hackman had a limited role, I think he played it well. For what they gave him to work with, you really can't condemn him. Will Smith .... hmmm.... ok boys and girls, can we say "Out of character actor"? My only question is "why"? I could name 100 other actors who would have done a better job, and more importantly fit the part better than Will Smith.I have to admit though, there was something that I liked about this film. I would LOVE to work in a place with all those cool toys. :o)If you're looking for a fun film with tons of non-stop action, but can do without Oscar-caliber performances and solid characters, and wouldn't mind a storyline that has more holes than a sponge, and an "intense drama" that turns into a slight comedy at times, then go ahead and watch "Enemy of the State".My advice? Watch it early enough so that there's time for Baywatch. You'll need something to take your mind off of it.RATING: 2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Conspiracy theorists of the world unite." Indeed.Before I say what I liked about it, let me get off my chest what I did not. Will Smith is no BMW 7-series driving lawyer. I loved him in both MIB and Independence Day (see my comments), but he did not carry off this part well. It's not his fault, it was poorly cast and directed. Harrison Ford or Michael Douglas have played richer characters (brain surgeons and elite rich, etc) who've been making good money for many more years then the baby-faced lawyer, yet they don't aspire to tool around in a $100,000 car; and how did he end up with an 8 year old son if he was busy in law school?Further, the whole-subplot with his wife was crappy. See Tom Cruise in The Firm for a much more plausible tale of a couple turning a threatened marriage into a shared effort to extricate themselves from the trouble. The Firm or The Fugitive showed how a person whose life has been destroyed wrongfully should play it. Sorry Will.And the dialogue was unbearably cheesy. How many times must we hear "this conversation is over" or "I have to take this call"? Gimme a break. Boring.Anyway, I've yet to see a film with Gene Hackman that I didn't like, especially because Hackman is simply excellent (he's kinda like a Morgan Freeman, always upstaging the ticket-selling top-billing younger names such as Hugh Grant, Keanu Reaves, or Denzel Washington, although Washington can actually act with him).In EotS, you've got to be amazed at the possibility that all that went on could be going on in real life. And disgusted that politicians whose power comes from our tax dollars would turn and kill innocents in the war games of their mind. That scene where they chased down Zavitz was tough - how can a person win against such an onslaught?This movie is tense, it's quite a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could be better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I overally liked this movie, but there were little leaks in the plot at some times. Also, the high - tech equipment which the movie was full of seemed a bit surreal. Well, this is only my opinion, though, some people say that it's quite believable. This is a really good thriller and there was not little action in it too. There are humorous moments in the plot, as in almost any movie nowadays, and that also gathers the viewer's interest. The plot was really smart, as you'd expect for that kind of movie. Actually not a bad movie but according to me it has some drawbacks.Rating: 7 of 10</fullReview>

Oh to be in Gene Hackman's shoes; he only had to learn two lines:"Get in the car!" and "Get outta the car!" which he repeats ad nauseum.Which, when added to the most moronic lawyer in recent cinema history - Will 'I think I'll make a few phone calls' Smith makes for impassive viewing.

		<shortDescription>Will Smith and Gene Hackman make this paranoid flick entertaining....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie. I never would have thought so when I saw the trailer because it looked like another paranoid flick spawned by the X-Files. The acting is decent and it really didn't have as much violence as I thought it would. Will Smith is convincing in his role as a union attorney (lawyer or whatever the hell it is...). Gene Hackman did a good job as an ex-NSA agent, blowing things up to cover his tracks. The chemistry between the two of them is good. I thought that the ending with the mobsters and NSA agents was just great. Nothing better than seeing idiots blowing each other away.All in all this is a good movie and I recommend it to anyone with some free time. ***1/2 stars (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Will Smith movie that's actually good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm sick of seeing Will Smith playing a bad-ass in EVERY movie he's in (I won't even bother to see "Wild Wild West"), this movie is actually good. It's kind of weird at first seeing "action hero" Will playing a lawyer. But the movie is good enough to overlook that. However, I wish they'd make a movie where Will portrays a human being rather than a walking, talking, over-inflated ego who's not afraid of anything. Anyway, the story itself is interesting. This movie will make you question the same issue that is questioned in the movie: where should the government draw the line with surveillance technology? A particular thing about this movie that stands out is its cast--well at least everyone other than Will Smith--though they're not given much of a chance to show their ability. The very talented Jon Voight is in a role that had a lot of potential but doesn't get anywhere. Another very talented actor, Jason Robards, has a few minutes of screen time--he's practically invisible in the movie. However, Gene Hackman's performance is great--he makes this film even more enjoyable. Also, it was nice to see former Cosby kid Lisa Bonet in his film--I had not seen her in a while. I rented this film and I liked it so much that I saw it twice. Good, solid action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is BY FAR Will Smith's best movie to date. It was nice to see a change of pace from his other roles which all seemed the same in ID4, Bad Boys, and MIB(I'm not even considering seeing Wild, Wild West)The performances were great, especially from Gene Hackman who gives his best one since his Oscar winning role in Unforgiven. The suspense factor was through the roof for me. For two hours I was glued to my seat. There were surprises around every corner. And I really hated the villain(Jon Voight) in this movie. I mean I REALLY hated him, which is more than you can say for a lot of films in the genre which have villains you could care less about.I was a little more suspicious of the government after seeing this movie. I got the same feeling from The Truman Show. Are we really being watched every minute of the day without our knowledge? It made you think, which is more you can say for Smith's other movies which relied heavily on SFX.My overall review: Great action thriller worth the money for a rental. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Age: 13A congressman is found dead in a river, he presumably died of a heart attack. But nature photographer Daniel Zavitz, played by Jason Lee, has proof that it wasn't a heart attack that killed him. His video camera has recorded the murder and now the NSA, the murderers, led by Thomas B. Reynolds, played by Jon Voight, are out to get him. Zavitz slips a copy of the tape into the bag of Robert Clayton Dean, played by Will Smith, who then becomes chased as well. Robert goes to a man named Brill, played by Gene Hackman, who is reluctant to help but does anyway.Enemy of the State is a great film, with great acting performances from everyone, the main leads and the supporting cast. It also has some great action scenes, as it is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The plot is good and the film is definitely not stupid or predictable. This film is very entertaining, not only from the action and plot, but it also has occasional humour, like the whole blender thing. With a terrific ending climax, Enemy of the State is a great paranoia thriller.Australian Classification: M 15+: Medium Level Violence, Medium Level Coarse LanguageRating: 84 out of 100</fullReview>

He was adequate in the role any more than that and you have been decieved. Jon Voight is suffering from Groundhog Day syndrome.

		<shortDescription>By far it is Will Smith's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies that were produced by Jerry Bruckheimer always guarantee one thing - excitement. That is what I expect from this movie and that's what I got. It is pretty much slower than Bruckheimer's last 3 but it still darn good to spend a two hours with.Plot is somewhat unoriginal, but who cares about originality when they can present it THIS good. Superb exploration of paranoia that builds up at first act and highlighted in the greatest chase scene between Will Smith and the NSA agents.Will Smith was surprisingly great in this movie! By far, I think it is his strongest on-screen performance. Gene Hackman was darn cool, as always, for his brief screen time. Smith and Hackman's chemistry works perfect and no doubt they are the best on-screen duo in 1998. Jon Voight, on the other hand, was so-so in his megalomaniac villain role, making him somewhat wasted for an actor like him.Other casts are great as well. Regina King kicked a** by delivering her strong performance as Smith's wife. Barry Pepper (that cool sniper from 'Saving Private Ryan') was great as the NSA agent, so was Jake Busey. Gabriel Byrne was ok, considering his next-to-no appearance role. But I was surprised to see Tom Sizemore as that mafioso and he did a good job. Also Seth Green (Scott Evil in 'Austin Powers'), didn't expect him to be in this movie and he was very cool...!Technology features are great, and actually it's quite believable (except that one for the lingerie shop).Action scenes are great, relying on chases rather than explosions. Although one would wish that there were more actions thrown in. Highlight include the chase between Smith and the agents at the hotel.Overall, a great piece of filmmaking. Watch it while you can. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this movie did as well at the box office as I expected, but this is nonetheless a great movie. I think Will Smith wanted to break away from the mega-blockbuster July 4th weekend type thing. He wanted to do a movie with more feeling. He pulled it off well, and Gene Hackman gave a good performance. I think they worked well together. It is truly amazing how technology has advance, though, as everything in the movie is actually real. Gives you the chills when you think about it, but it is exciting at the same time. The climax to this movie is excellent as well. Another very well done movie with superstar Will Smith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this expecting it to be totally mediocre, but at least worth a 3$ rental. I was pleasantly surprised to find this very watchable, thrilling, and something I'll probably rent again. Will Smith is great and easy on the eyes. All the acting was very good, though Jon Voight has popped up in so many movies lately I am starting to get tired of him. I didn't figure out how it was going to end, and the final showdown, plus how the main characters outwit the bad guys was great. Tom Sizemore I didn't recognize at first since he's put on so much weight, but he was fantastic. I give the writers extra points for not going for the cheap shot and having the bad guys kill Gene Hackman's kitty (if they had, I would have only given this movie one star, and probably not watched the rest). I thought that they did kind of beat you over the head with the "SURVEILLANCE IS BAD" message. After the first half hour it was like, ok, I get the idea guys. The various fictional super-sophisticated tracking devices were cool, and Tony and Ridley Scott always shoot their films beautifully. Oh, and the woman who played Will Smith's wife kicked a**!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is as believable as any other movie out there (you could find technical exaggerations in this as well as in any other movie). All Hollywood films must be taken with a grain of salt.I found it very enjoyable. It was not boring at all, unless you're a teenager constantly looking for more things to get blown up. The plot is twisting, but "follow-able". You must mentally keep up, but you are rewarded time and again for doing so. You will not be "fooled" in the end by some minor character saving the day by killing the bad guy "in a nick of time just before he kills the main character". I hate it when movies do that, and this movie is a clear level above that style of plot.Bottom line...yes, there are parts of this, like any other movie that, if you scrutinize them, are indeed far fetched. However, the "far-fetchedness" of this movie doesn't slap you in the face..you must be a technical person looking for it (and even then, the things that are displayed in the movie *could* exist).Good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the many flaws, the chase scenes were so riveting that it won't really matter.Will Smith plays Defense attorney (Yep, that's right. Will Smith playing a lawyer!) Robert Dean. Out of the blue, an old high school friend (coincidence!) runs into him, secretly gives him a gameboy with a weird game inside and continues running from these people who are after him. Next thing you know he's dead, and the chase resumes, this time after Smith; The weird game in that gameboy wasn't a game, but footage of a murder cover-up between two politicians. And the people after him are top secret government agents who already have him bugged. There's lot's of cliches in this movie; elements ranging from "The Game," to the 1981 French film "Diva"...but it's done so well, you barely even notice.Pretty good supporting cast: Gene Hackman, Jason Lee (from the Kevin Smith movies), Garry Pepper (the sharpshooter from "Saving Private Ryan") Tom Sizemore, Gabriel Bryne and James LeGros.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God knows how many times this story has been told, but rarely has it been told so well. Enemy of the State is one of my five favorite films of the year, and the film couldn't be more exciting. Will Smith gives his best acting job yet, as a tough lawyer, and family man, whose life is destroyed when he is persued by the NSA for a tape that contains the murder of a US Congressman (Jason Robards). Gene Hackman chews up the screen as the former NSA operative who is now in hiding who helps Smith. Hackman and Smith have great chemistry together making them the best on-screen duo of 1998. Jon Voight could have been just a little better, but he did a fine job as head of the NSA. Everyone else in the film turned in fine supporting performances.Although, at times, it may seem a bit illogical, and the film does contain a few minor flaws, all of the action and suspense do a fine job of covering that up, and for that reason, I give Enemy of the State a 4 1/2 out of 5 star rating. An extremely fast-paced, exciting, brilliant, intriguing, thought provoking, clever, cat and mouse, action suspense thriller from the Simpson/Bruckheimer team.</fullReview>

It has many references &amp; brilliant homages to The Conversation, from having Hackman play virtually the same character 20 years down the line, to having a great recreation of the surveillance scene in the park, &amp; having Hackman have a den/workshop just like the one in Coppola's classic.

		<fullReview>A tautly made, smart and slick thriller blessed with credibility and intelligence.Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is a happy, financially successful man with a beautiful wife (Regina Kind) and handsome son (Jascha Washington). He has a top paid job, a luxurious house, and everything an all-American citizen could ever conjure up. Until...Dean's life has suddenly turned upside down into a nightmare of violence and incidents moving at tidal wave speeds.ENEMY OF THE STATE has plenty of speed, exuberance, excitement, and a solid plot to back up all of the usual action scenes. The performances in this film were essentially superb from Voight again capturing attention as the demented main antagonist to Hackman as a lone herman geek who specializes into tapping through the main Government program. Will Smith (MEN IN BLACK) shines as the na?ve lawyer, innocently caught in a gigantic conspiracy implicating the U.S. government.ENEMY OF THE STATE has a fascinating tone which allows the viewer to be enriched with explosions, unique camera angles, and lots of interesting futuristic toys such as satellites, tracking devices hidden with subtlety inside clothing, and high-tech computers which monitors voice prints and records conversations and pictures.Will Smith is grand for he always injects plenty of humor in even the most utmost dangerous situations. The laughs are abundant, but they do not serve as a distraction from the film's focal point.ENEMY OF THE STATE is a motion picture that also handles the theme of "invasion of privacy" with plenty of maturity and respect. The film also tackles the issue of "National Security Vs. Civil Liberty." How far should the government go in sustaining National Security? What are the real ambitions of the government and why do they often act in such a covert manner? Are threats to U.S. Security truly as dangerous and detrimental as alleged or is paranoia too overblown? The answers to these questions cannot be given away without spoiling the film's plot twists.ENEMY OF THE STATE is a fine treat for the eyes, mind, and soul. The film is generally a well-done thriller with a loophole or two in the film's plot and characterization. The narrow escapes from treacherous dangers may also seem implausible and improbable at times. The idea of ENEMY OF THE STATE itself is not entirely original. Still, ENEMY OF THE STATE remains a fast moving film with great chase scenes and a story line built with sympathetic and strong willed characters. The direction from Tony Scott is blended with decent technical skills. The conclusion is definitely poetic justice!RATING: *** out of ****.</fullReview>

It doesn't use Holocaust or World War II to conceal its weaknesses and it doesn't strive for social significance or Academy Awards. Such honesty should be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thrilling movie makes you want to believe that nobody has any privacy anymore. Off course this is true. Everybody is bored with the so-manieth ad saying they have exactly want you want! But let's face it. Nobody believes that a person can be followed day and night by satellite cameras. Where in the world can you trust on all bright skies all day and night? In the desert! And who's there to follow? Nobody! Three camels and a snake. So reality factor: 0, zero, nada, nothing, noppes, nil, very small indeed.On the other hand, it's just possible that you want to go out and see an action packed pursuit movie with some superfluous violence and chases, a few paranoid people (nice role by John Voight) and a bunch of real American heroes (Will 'Going to Miami' Smith and Gene Hackman). Then go see the Enemy of the State! Dumb, stupid action factor: 10 on 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fast moving conversation piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fast paced, convincing, occasionally witty thriller based on the all-intrusive surveillance technology the U S is saturated with. Rising young black lawyer Robert Dean (Will Smith) accidently becomes the possessor of a tape showing rogue National Security Agency operative Reynolds (Jon Voight) rubbing out a congressman who was opposing more powers for the agency. All of a sudden, as the NSA electronic spooks get tapping on their keyboards, Will's life starts to fall apart. he loses his job, his credit cards are cancelled, his wife leaves him and he's on the run from guys who can photograph his shoelaces from satellites 150 km above the earth, tap into anybody's computer, and send vans laden with surveillance gear anywhere in the U S (though we only see Washington and nearby Balitmore.)Since this is a thriller, we'll stop there with the story, save to mention the welcome appearance of Gene Hackman as Brill, reprising his "Conversation" character as a crusty technician forced by his work into making a moral decision.Technically this is a very clever film. It uses surround sound to the limit and manages to provide effective visual imagery of sound communication. It's not as innovative as the movie it pays homage to, "The Conversation" but it provides a spectacular kaleidoscope of colour and sound to denote the technological monster unleashed on Robert Dean.For me,the real interest in the film is not the whizz-bangery but the theme - has modern technology made government uncontrollable by the electors? There is a significant scene mid-way through where the senior management of the NSA, including Reynolds the rogue meet to discuss the bugging of a hitherto supportive congressman who is rather cross at being bugged himself. (The bugging has been done by Brill using NSA equipment.) The Admiral in charge bangs his fist on the table and declares. "We're going to find out who did this and punish them - unless it was a legitimate operation we don't know about." The NSA are not the only government buggers around; there are the FBI and the CIA (ostensibly confined to off-shore operations)to name a couple.The NSA has the greatest surveillance clout, however. It is descended from the U S World War 2 Defence Intelligence and codebreaking apparatus and expanded mightly in the cold war. Brill describes it in the movie with "18 ares of mainframes", monitoring all phone calls in and out of the U S listening for words like "bomb" and "Allah" to justify its vast budget. One might well ask what is the point of an organisation which can re-arrange the credit cards of someone it doesn't like but cannot eavesdrop on Saddam Hussein's cell phone.Jon Voight is rather robotic as Reynolds the rogue NSA director. (The portrayal is said to be based on Robert McNamara, Defense Secretary during the Viet Nam War - if so, it is a very unfair one). Would someone so smart and ruthless really want to totally destroy all remaining civil liberties just to move up a slot at the Agency? The NSA computer nerds are more plausible - all young, pasty and enthusiastic. To them it's a vast game played with taxpayers' money and never a question as to right or wrong ("a warrant - don't make me laugh.")Another interesting message is the potential for abuse of even the humble in-store surveillance cameras by law enforcement zealots. At one point, the NSA manages to identify Brill by illegally commandeering an in - store tape.As thrillers go, this one defies Samuel Goldwyn's dictum ("if you want to send a message, send it Western Union") and both entertains and provokes. It will, I hope, give both the Left and the Right in the U S reason to doubt the integrity of the national security apparatus, and call for greater oversight-for 15 minutes, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy of the State is the first movie that I have ever walked out of, well crawled out of, from sheer boredom. Will Smith, the oh-so-wooden Will Smith is on the run because he gets accidently given a disk which contains evidence that shows a top government official as an accesory to murder. Thus Will Smith is on the run, and boy does he run.Couple the running with a script that makes the Tellytubbies seem like Oxfordian Shakespearean Masters students, eg: Will Smith to Gene Hackman: "You need me like I need you...now lets run...?!?" Add more than enough Bruckheimer explosions, and of course some running, take out any hint of suspense, add a few "big brother - all seeing eye" conspiracy theories and make Will Smith a successful attorney with a BMW and TA DA! The sales of Orwell's - 1984 rocket!Enemy of the State is sheer boredom. It is boring because the action has all been seen before, and the weak storyline does not help. It is boring because it all seems completely formulated and written by a committee, and it is boring because it goes on far to long without anything actually developing. I would only suggest you see it for the same reasons you would go to see "SpiceWorld" - whatever those reasons may be. As for me, I am rather going to sit at home and watch the paint dry. At least Will Smith as a preppy lawyer isn't involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for TRUE ROMANCE, and BEVERLY HILLS COP and THE REF, I'm not a big fan of either Tony Scott or Don Bruckheimer, respectively. But this was a lot of fun and surprisingly thought-provoking. The beginning was obvious and a little clumsy, and the climatic shootout was a rip-off of TRUE ROMANCE. Plus, I didn't like the cheap gag involving the Asian couple. But other than that, I really liked this movie.For one thing, instead of Scott's pyrotechnics overwhelming the movie, here they fit right in and added to the paranoia. Some people griped about the gangster subplot, but except for that shootout, I thought it worked well. It was a legitimate excuse why Smith's character wasn't clued in right away on what was happening to him, and made him look smart when he otherwise would have come across dumb. I liked Smith as well; he's becoming quite the actor. It was also a nice casting touch to have twentysomething white males as the bad guys. I especially liked Barry Pepper here. Voight was a better villain here than he was in THE RAINMAKER.But the real treat of the movie was Hackman. One of the better character actors of all time, and the way he and the film refer back to his classic THE CONVERSATION is also very well done. Those glasses were a nice touch too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the smartest thriller, but an intelligent action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one scene in Ridley Scott's otherwise dreary "Bladerunner" that has stayed with me. It's the scene where Harrison Ford uses a computer to zoom in and in (and in) on a photograph, until he discovers an important clue. It wasn't the first time it was done ("Blow-up", of course) but the digital aspect gave it an immediacy that was quite exciting. I remember thinking, however, that the image couldn't have contained that much information - a silly thought considering it was a futuristic drama - but I had time to think about it and to challenge it's authenticity.Tony Scott's "Enemy of the State" plays with real-time digital and satellite technology so convincingly that you don't really have time to disbelieve it - it's happening before your very eyes. It has such a propulsive forward momentum that it's hard to dislike - it's never boring, which is almost reason enough to recommend it (how many Hollywood films have you seen recently that weren't boring?).People have been criticising it for not being in the same league as films like "The Conversation", but I don't really think that's the point - it may not be the most intelligent of paranoia thrillers, but for an action film (which it more closely resembles), it's quite intelligent indeed (did any of you SEE Independence day, Godzilla, Armageddon etc ?).</fullReview>

Excellent movie: perfectly casted, photographed, scored, developed, and the best of all, quite enjoyable! A great duo: Scott and Brucheimer, although they have worked together five times, including this one, I keep this movie and Crimson Tide. Both movies dealt with the ambiguity of the reason. And thats the point: "Who has the true reason in a warfare". And I am not talking between adversaries, Im talking about the differences that there are within the same team. And thats the world we live in: the refinement of strategies, the refinment of war. Can you criticize America for protect, not only their citizens but all the people in the world who plays the same system that they do. But, at the same time, nobody want to be watched and that is logical too. A war procedure is a war procedure and technology gives the rest, that is the situation and we all are going in that way. No guilties, just victims of ourselves: the price for the use of the language, for the use of the reason.The only thing that Im not too much agree about the argument is the random thing, I mean Robert seems like an impeccable guy, why then have to suffer that challenge? Anyway, there are always a challenge for everybody, no matters how big.The end of the movie recalls me too much to "True Romance", thats very cool. Dont miss it...</fullReview>

It is just a shame that Hollywood feels the need to add lame one-liners and silly sight gags (THE CAT REACTS TO SEX ON TV!!??), which undermine the seriousness of the subject and the story. Then there are some faults I can't quite comprehend, like the mike hanging on the top of the screen when Smith tries to contact Tom Sizemore when Will's life is starting to fall apart. The plot itself has some inconsistencies, but a close examination will only lead to the perhaps total destruction of the movie's credibility.Don't expect too much, enjoy Gene Hackman's older version of the man he played in the Conversation, and the references to that film and you'll have a good time, though it has to be said that it could have been a much better film if some effort was put into it. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a long tradition of conspiracy movies and it borrows from many. Faceless bad guys with their own agendas, massively powerful secret government organisations. We love these movies because we would love to be able to be a part of these organisations. We want to be the techie guy manipulating the satellite as it tracks the quarry. We want to be the guy co-ordinating the microphones and the cameras following the couple talking. We want to be the computer operator looking through bank accounts and personal histories. Information is power and we crave it.Jerry Bruckheimer doesn't seem to have lost too much of an edge in losing his long time production partner Don Simpson and the movies fairly rocks along at a breakneck pace. The plot is involved but not too complex, but what makes the movie is the references. This isn't a blatant remake of any movie in particular, but from The Conversation to All The President's Men, its heritage is clear.Gene Hackman (star of The Conversation - indeed, his case photo in this film is a still from The Conversation - and a previous Bruckheimer film, Crimson Tide) is superb, Jon Voight (another link to the 70s spy movies and Mission Impossible bad guy) is joyously bad, Jason Robards' cameo (linking to All The President's Men) is welcome. Then you've the ultra-90s face of chic, Will Smith, toning down his wisecracks, but proving that he can act and forming another partnership with a well decorated partner. First with Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black and now with Oscar-winner Gene Hackman.The gadgetry is wonderful, if a little flawed sometimes (it seemed pretty cloudy to me with some of the satellite tracking :) but it doesn't overshadow the base premise. We are worried, in these days of mobile communications and huge databases, about the potential. It gives us hope that one man can beat the whole of the government's secret service. While the 70s film might not have had the good guy winning, the 90s are different.It's a slickly produced, well considered film, something for the film buff, the action seeker and the conspiracy theorist. We want to be Will Smith, but we, probably, want to be the NSA spooks more, because all those toys would be fun :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was prepared for the worst, but I needn't have worried. This film grabbed me from the start, Jason Robards drawing me in with a measured performance as a congressman unwilling to support a bill eroding civil liberties. From the hyperactive opening title shots the story rockets along in glossy, video clip fashion. Robert Dean (Will Smith) copes quite well as his world unravels and his need for physical fitness increases. His wife, played by Regina Belle, is a weak point - she is rabidly opposed to the government intruding in people's lives and spends much of her time wide-eyed and ranting about it. I would have thought that, being a lawyer, she'd have a more balanced view on the place of laws in society. Gene Hackman was a stand-out and it's nice to see Lisa Bonet back in the limelight playing a world weary old flame of Dean's.The story itself has enough elements of action in it to keep the abuse of government power theme interesting despite having heard it all before. The only criticism is the all too neatly wrapped up conclusion to the film. How can there be any happily-ever-afters after experiencing such gross invasions of privacy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy of the State thrills, chills, and delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best action thrillers of the year, with an all-star cast is director Tony Scott's paranoia flick, Enemy of the State. Many other movies have tried to win over the audience with stories of paranoia and government corruption. However, this movie is in a class all by itself for its vivid portrayal of how far the government will go to cover-up deceit and corruption. Before the audience even has a chance to read the opening credits, a heinous murder of an innocent elderly man takes place. True to Hollywood thrillers, the left-over evidence, the man's car is driven into a lake to discard the evidence. The elderly man (played by reknowned actor Jason Robards) is killed, not because of what he knows but because of what he should not know. Nonetheless, a bird watcher doing some serious bird watching catches the entire footage of the murder on video. While the bird watcher copies the tape for his pal; the feds, led by Thomas Brian Reynolds (Jon Voight, perfectly cast as a bad guy) are hot on his trail. And I mean HOT! The modern technology that is available on the streets, and to the government is so advanced that just when the audience gets used to seeing one gimmick, another gimmick is introduced. The bird watcher, a young guy in his 20's, is chased by the feds all the way from his apartment into the city of Baltimore until he runs into his old Georgetown buddy, a prominent lawyer named Robert Clayton Dean (played by the always likeable Will Smith). Dean is in the lingerie store shopping for a present for his wife, a fellow lawyer named Carla (Regina King). Unbeknownst to Dean, the bird watcher drops the original video footage into Dean's shopping bag, and the chilling begins. The bird watcher continues running until he is hit and killed on the freeway by a truck. And thus, the action begins. With all of the modern technology available, the feds, led by Reynolds begin destroying the almost-perfect life around Dean in order to make him turn over the "goods." His entire life begins to fall apart as he desperately tries to save his marriage, destroyed because of his former girlfriend/business associate Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet). Not only that but his bosses, the Mafia, newspapers, and the feds take turns wreaking havoc on him for various reasons. When asked by his law firm bosses about his extramarital affair with Rachel, he shoots back and asks one of them if they have ever cross-dressed. When that boss goes to protest, he interrupts, and says, " Yeah, none of your (expletive) business." Yes, Robert Claton Dean is flawed, but he is human. The events taking place in this movie, and the amount of control that the government has over the American public is scary. The government, at least in this movie, feels that they have the right to go snooping wherever they want to, however they want to, whenever they want to. On privacy, Voight's character says," Privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it. The only privacy left is inside of your head." The real thrill of the movie is in the chase. First, he has to find out why the government is after him. Then he had to figure out who set him up, why and how can he get his life back, if at all possible. Dean makes a very wise move by enlisting the help of Brill. There are two Brills', one played by Gabriel Byrne, and the other played by two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman. I won't tell you who the real Brill is because then that would give away too much of the movie. Brill is an ex-military specialist/agent who paranoia leads him to turn an old, abandoned warehouse into a state-of-the-art security fortress. The ending was super clever, but almost up until the last minute, no one could guess what would happen. Paranoia and the loss of privacy may be the main central themes in this movie, but the action and suspense far outweigh them. This is definitely Will Smith's best role yet, and the movie made me a huge fan of the "real" Brill. Enemy of the State is one of those rare movies that thrills, chills, and delivers the goods to the audience. It was worth every penny, and I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes thrillers, and everyone else looking to see a good movie. Don't be the last one to see this great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, the natural continuation or conclusion of "The Conversation"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surveillance. High-tech. Corruption, murder, coincidence, accidents, etc. All you would want, really, from a film of this genre. A much better exploration of "watching the watcher" than similar films (such as "Conspiracy Theory"), and, obviously, owing an awful lot to the classic "The Conversation". Indeed, several of the shots are identical, and the character played by Gene Hackman is very much along the lines that his character in "The Conversation" would have become over the past 25 years. I think it is brilliant from the opening shots- a man is recording the ordinary life of birds on a lake. He also happens to catch a murder on film, and so the film begins its "Watching the Watcher" theme. A classic? Depends what it is you want from your films, but this is definitely good philosophy and good entertainment.On the question that has been raised about techy nerds playing along- surely these are the very people who would be in charge of such an operation? Young enough, and isolated enough to not care about the problems they cause their subjects? Au fait with technology designed to drop bombs down chimneys in Iraq? Sufficiently qualified that they can use this technology to track down people within the United States? If they don't exist, I am even now living in fear of where the next cruise missile will land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining movie full of action and adventure, despite the commonplace plot and fair acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the plot in Enemy of the State was NOT complex. It was not suspenseful or an on the edge of your seat thriller. However, it was entertaining. The plot revolves around the conspiracy theory again. The movie plays on the audiences' paranoias of government agencies such as the NSA. We have seen more than our share of these plots manifest themselves in television and movies lately. Will Smith gives an average performance, but he's no superstar. I thought the movie's clever use of special effects combined with the unveiling of sci-fi spy technology made the movie more bearable. But the film does bring up an interesting issue: the look at the role of government in society today. It leads us to question the powers of such an entity and its effects on everyday life. But, the social statement is probably lost somewhere in the lingere shop. By the way, I'd like the address of that shop from Jerry if possible. Overall, it was a slightly above average film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big brother is probably watching you, if big brother can be bothered. But I already know that! Enemy Of The State has nothing of value to add in that regard.Expect the worst from officialdom because it's probably worse than you think. Yes that's probably true too but it's tiresome to be told the same thing again and again in films.Enemy Of The State is a chase/action film centred about the electronic surveillance of citizens by the state. Director Tony Scott (Top Gun) has gone hi tech and sometimes (hopefully) over the top to show how satellites and electronic bugs can be used to hunt down a fugitive.The assumptions are these: Some government agencies and officials are corrupt and won't stop at murder to get what they want. The same officials have access to very, very sophisticated equipment including satellites with which to chase a fugitive. Honest citizens beware.Now I'm a bit tired of all of that and more than a bit bored by chase films that don't flesh out their characters.Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Lisa Bonet and Regina King make up space for the mayhem but, with the exception of Gene Hackman, you're not likely to care very much.The film is well produced and its mostly male target audience will get off a little on the violence and excitement but Enemy Of The State is very shallow indeed. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I breathed out at the end of the film, but I'm not sure how long I was holding my breath.... This is the best action film in ages, certainly since Patriot Games, Crimson Tide etc. I don't mind remakes if they are entertaining in themselves, and if there are any plot holes or inconsistencies in this, there isn't time to think about them. A real roller-coaster ride from start to finish, and I actually liked seeing all the bits pinched from other films, as they often were improved in the process. Don't expect a comment on privacy vs. national security, it's not that sort of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, but very thin movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was fun for its action, but as a "Comment", extremely thin. Rather than writing a story about technology and privacy, it uses technology and privacy as the starting point for an extended chase. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable chase. Good cast, with Voight looking like the archetypal Federal heavy, like Robert MacNamara with computers. Smith in the "Diva" role, the innocent receiving a very dangerous piece of information, is as good as he always is. Last but not least is Gene Hackman, the grizzled elder techie, looking even more grizzled than Tommy Lee Jones in MIB.I saw several other movies in the same cineplex, each outboomed by the noise leaking over from Enemy and now I finally saw Enemy. As I suspected, it was louder than anything else in the "Plex".As a resident of Baltimore, where many movies are shot, I always get a charge out of seeing familiar sites. I really wish I had been on the street when Smith was hanging from a hotel balcony in his underwear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie surprised me a great deal when I went to see it. I primarily went because I like Will Smith, but I came away thinking "Wow". It's got a great storyline, and reminded me a bit of Conspiracy Theory.The first part of the movie was a little slow, but it provided a good base to work from for later plot developments. Gene Hackman was excellent in his role, which pleased me a lot as I'm not a Hackman fan. It was quite scary to think of all that might be in the world of telecommunications, and it made me wonder how much really is 'just hysteria'. It provides an interesting comment on the issue of privacy and surveillance, not just in the U.S., but worldwide. All up I'd give it a 9 out of 10, and a strong recommendation for anyone who loves action/suspense films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie. I'm too young to recall All the President's Men, or The Conversation which was made the year I was born so I haven't seen it. And these are the two films that Enemy of The State are supposed to have ripped off. From what I've read it's true but so what. I think the majority of films these days have taken bits and pieces from other films. I think most of the time the film-makers do this purely out of respect and admiration for the films they are getting bits and pieces from. But back to the film, from the very beginning it had me thrilled. The credits I thought were visually amazing and for me there wasn't one bit of the film I was bored or dis-interested. Will Smith is very good in his role as the pursued innocent lawyer Robert Dean and does as critics say "A Jim Carrey" He is in quite a serious role but manages to keep a light comic touch to it. Gene Hackman is excellent as the illusive Brill and Jon Voight does the standard evil politician role. It was great to see Lisa Bonet again after a long absence from the silver screen. The computer hackers are slightly amusing but just annoyed me most of the time. But I do love this film even if it did take a lot of ideas from other films. It kept surprising me right up to the end when Hackman and Smith double-cross the bad guys. This is a great film, I loved it and it will keep me paranoid of people listening and watching my every move for a LONG time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The BIG action film producer Jerry Bruckheimer and veteran director Tony Scott have made the conspiracy thriller Enemy of the State starring WILL SMITH as Robert Clayton Dean a DC-based labor lawyer who finds his life turned upside down when he is given a tape(secretly) of the murder of a congressman by Thomas Reynolds (JON VOIGHT) and his small hit squad. When Reynolds discover that the murder was taped he sends his thugs to go after Robert. In the process, they destroy his life by having him lose his job, his credit, and his wife, Carla (REGINA KING), who worries when she receives pictures of him and his former girlfriend and lover from a recent affair, together. As Dean goes to her for help he finds Brill playd by GENE HACKMAN who is an angry, ex-NSA agent thad reluctantly helps him. Audiences seem to like plots where an everyday person gets caught up in extraordinary circumstances. From Cary Grant in the Alfred Hitchcok hit "North By Northwest" and on of Harrison Fords best "The Fugitive," to John Travolta in "Blow Out," and Robert Redford headlining "Three Days of the Condor,". Jon Voight has been playing the villain in his recent movies like in The Rainmaker,Mission: Impossible and Anaconda and he does a good job in Enemy of the State but Gene Hackman is better as the ex-covert operative and only possible salvation for our bewildered hero. This is a great thrillir and another winner for Bruckheimer,Scott,Smith,Hackman,Voight.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artificial intelligence...keyhole satellites...sound like something out of a futuristic sci-fi novel? Not so! After watching this movie, you may rethink trying to get away with anything that you don't want anyone else to know about. This could very well be the 1984 (referring to George Orwell's future looking novel) of the 1990s. In this case, Big Brother is the NSA under the auspices of Deputy Director Reynolds, played by John Voight (Is this type-casting? Think back to Mission: Impossible). Will Smith was not a very believable attorney, but plays an excellent unknowing victim seeking to regain his life. Gene Hackman, as Brill/Edward Lyle, once again turns in a spectacular performance as an ex-NSA communications specialist who went underground after the fall of the Shah in Iran. The technology used to track Robert Dean's (Will Smith) movements throughout the movie is stunning, if not shocking and eerily accurate. The ending of the movie is fast-paced and full of action, but you better pay attention at the beginning of the film if you want to be able to fully appreciate the ending. There's an interesting twist of fate. Definitely worth a full-price admission. MUST SEE!</fullReview>

Although I've enjoyed all his movies I've seen (Bad Boys, Men In Black, Independance Day) none of them have really shown his acting ability. Enemy of the State does. Gene Hackman (as usual) gives a great performance. This has all the aspects of a good action movie, and throws in some great acting, and that made it one of the best of the year for pure entertainment. Jerry Bruckheimer has provided another winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starring Will Smith... and some REAL actors, too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typical popcorn actioner, though I was surprised by Will Smith's performance, because I almost always hate him. The real highlight for me, however, was the supporting players in this film, a veritable who's who of "actor's actors" and critical darlings, most notably Detroit's own Tom Sizemore, playing a bloated (sorry, Tom) Mafioso with glee. His performance alone was worth the relatively reasonable $6 I paid to see this. Somebody get Mr. Sizemore a leading role! He owns every movie he's in!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's closer to the Fugitive than other genre action films of late, though not as good. Gene Hackman was wonderful of course. Jon Voigt was very good as well. Will Smith did quite well but for him to be playing a hot-shot union labor lawyer at his obvious young age was a little difficult to believe. I had heard the film was full of neat gadgets and things. While it did have some...it did not have some of the gadgets I would expect it to have..Such as bugging devices that allow you to throw lasers on windows to pick up vibrations of sound off window panes etc. It's also ultimately a rather formula action film A much better than average one but still not a great or classic film by any means.There was another couple of scenes which bothered me because it showed a contempt for the audience. How do I mean this? Well, when you include a throw-away scene, a slightly comic scene where Will Smith tries to buy lingerie for his wife..... you don't have a glaring continuity error within the scene to prove to the audience you aren't really paying much attention to what's going on so we can get away with this.... Okay... Smith buys lingerie for his wife... and a young lady is modeling a revealing type outfit. Smith tactlessly says his wife's bust is larger than the woman in front of him.A little later when we see his wife....her bust is smaller than the models in the lingerie place.Why was the line necessary if it wasn't true... Why would he buy too big lingerie for his wife as a Christmas present? And as a hot shot lawyer would he be as nervous and naive about this as he played it?And then later on still.... the wife is wearing the perfectly fitting garments.huh? How can this be?Wow...must think we're stupid....Well... it's a minor series of errors, but these types of things show how little some film-makers care about their product and the audience that views them.Really enjoyed some of Hackman's line readings though. Worthwhile for this type of film.</fullReview>

I saw it by myself opening weekend and thought it was excellent - clever, a little frightening, funny, and full of really good-looking men. I'm a little embarrassed by this estrogen-driven post, but it had to be said. Will Smith was his usual cute self in a very convincing performance.

However, it also serves as a reminder that high levels of technology can come at a high price. Much of the technology in this movie isn't as science fiction as most of us would like to believe, although the satellite imaging would take MUCH longer to process, and would be virtually useless in a heated chase, it could be used to track someone who wasn't aware that he was being chased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I think I was the only person in the Theater not to love this film. The bulk of the movie is just watching Will Smith run away from people. It takes a long time to get into the story, and I was never really captured by it. Gene Hackman and Gabriel Byrne (although he has a very small role) were the bright spots in the film. I like Will Smith, but this is his first move that I wasn't very fond of. The dialog was weak, and I just don't consider watching somebody run for 1 1/2 hours qualifies as entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally like Will Smith, but the previews for this movie generally didn't grab me. That was, not until I heard the excellent tag line from one of the previews - "It's not paranoia... if they're really after you." For some reason that line clicked in my head and I decided to see this movie.The movie was what I would describe as a time-filler. Nothing more and nothing less. But, there are worse ways to spend two hours of your time.The highlight of the movie would definitely have to be the cast. Will Smith plays his usual character, with maybe slightly more depth than usual. Gene Hackman is, of course, a masterful veteran performer. It's great to see Lisa Bonet again, even in a minor role. Seth Green and Jaime Kennedy also contribute small but memorable performances. And, it was really cool to see Jason Robards in the opening scene.As far as "techno-thrillers" go, this wasn't too bad. The technology aspects of the film didn't choke the life out of it, as those elements typically seem to do in most films of this type. The action isn't quite as involving or spectacular as I was hoping for, but it does keep things moving along.All in all, I don't think anyone will be kicking themselves if they wait for a video release of this movie. Or, for that matter, the network television premiere. See this only if you've seen everything else and just want to kill time for a couple of hours.My rating: a 6-1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Enemy of the State expecting a rather silly "the NSA is out to get me" type action flick, but it proved to be very clever and genuinely suspenseful at parts. Will Smith gives what is easily one of his best performances (as he gets a part that isn't best described as "cocky hotshot"), and everyone else does a top-notch job as well. The script was fast paced but still cohesive, and the movie never turned into a big gunfight. My chief complaint was the chase scenes (of which there were several) due to the fact that they are shot from roughly 23 angles, all constantly being intercut. I guess it was intended to make it more intense (and give the idea that there are a multitude of cameras watching everyone), but the gimmick ended up simply making it difficult to tell just what was happening.So long as you're not in the middle of a chase scene, the movie is great. And while it obviously pushes the limits of reality at points, it is still believable enough as to not be a large distraction. The entire thing is worth seeing just for the climax, which is quite intelligent and funny. Recommended viewing for fans of the genre, and even those that don't generally like this type of movie will probably enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Enemy of the State" over the Thanksgiving weekend. Overall the movie is well thought out, realistic enough in how the technology is used (and abused), and how the characters are developed. The one questionable exception to this is the role played by Gene Hachman. He's apparently an ex-NSA operative who, some 15-20 years ago got a raw deal but has accepted that it was nobody's fault and bears no grudges towards the agency. Yet he's gone underground, cutting himself off from society, yet staying up on the latest hi-tech developments in surveillance. Do people like this really exist? Still Hackman is so good an actor that he breathes believability into any role he plays. What made the biggest impression on me was the portrayal of the power an individual who you will never meet or see can know so much about you and do so much to you with very little effort or concern. As in "Mercury Rising" the big bad man is some over achieving, remorseless NSA division chief with his own agenda. Somehow he manages to instill so much loyalty into his small group of techies and bag men that they will steal, violate, and even kill at his command. The movie is definitely worth the price of the ticket if you like hi-tech action flicks. If not, then renting the video will not diminish the content very much. I gave it an 8 because of the superb acting, the believability, the timing of the action, and the script. It should be doing better than it is for this time of year, but the audience nitch is just a little too focused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Enemy of the State" is popular entertainment at its best. It takes believable characters and puts them in extraordinary situations, without losing any of its credibility. If you've ever since "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," one of his videos, or late night talk show appearances, you only have seen the sarcastic, silly, version of Will Smith. In "Six Degrees of Separation," he showed he can act drama. In "Men in Black" he showed he can hold his own with weary vet Tommy Lee Jones, and in "Independence Day" he can help carry a blockbuster. With Enemy of the State, he proves he can do all these things at once, comedy, drama, hold his own with a film vet (in this case Gene Hackman), and help carry a blockbuster. Gene Hackman does a wonderful job of essentially reprising his role of Harry McCall, the quintessential paranoid thriller "The Conversation," nearly 25 years later. There are no heroes in this film, people die for all the wrong reasons, and the villains (especially Jon Voight) are respectable people of society, who do naughty things when they think no one is looking. How bad can a movie be, that has two-time Academy Award Winning Actor Jason Robards in a three minute cameo. And it was nice to see Lisa Bonet back on the scene in a decent movie role. Enemy of the State is big-time entertainment done with intelligence and humor. Must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story with a few nits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, the storyline was good. We are living in an increasingly paranoid age, where a balance between government surveillance and personal privacy has not yet been struck. The movie does an excellent job of playing up this point, through the use of the control centre, spy satellites, bugging devices, and miniature cameras. If you're not already thinking that the government is keeping track of everyone, you will leave this movie thinking they are.The camera work is good in a lot of places, showing the scenes from the view of some video surveillance equipment. They did a very effective job with one of the themes of the movie: we are being watched by someone, in some way, every day of our lives. They were able to put this point across without being so blunt as to hit you over the head with it.The only real problems I had with the film was the trendy "shakey, documentary-style" cinematography: I've had enough of that from NYPD Blue, Law &amp; Order, and every dark, conspiracy-laden film in the last three years. Sometimes the camera is shaking so much you can't make out the action that's taking place. Give me a break, please.Also, the ending of the film is too clean. We have the formulaic happy ending, where everything is wrapped up in a neat little package, and all the characters get to go on with their lives as though nothing has happened. The truth is that people have been killed, conspiracies have been made public, and the surveillance continues -- by effectively ignoring these events, the movie loses much of its impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action/Adventure with little character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Enemy of the State, an action/adventure film from Touchstone Pictures, the real enemy could be us, that is, all of us who do not take action to protect our privacy whenever possible, and to control government agencies. That is the feeling I was left with after viewing this movie. In the film, a rogue National Security Agency Director and his team commit murder, then endeavor to regain evidence of their crime and to murder the individual who unwittingly has had this evidence planted on him.The film's pacing is high-speed, as is most of its editing, giving the viewer little time to consider the plot. Although much of the visual and audio spy equipment shown probably does exist, I can only hope that much of it does not. I can only hope government computers are not listening in to our telephone conversations waiting to hear certain words which will trigger recording and investigation.This is not a film that leaves much time for thought. Most of the film's running time is eaten up with just that--running, as lawyer Robert Dean (Will Smith) is trying to escape from the NSA team. Gene Hackman is a welcome sight as an information source and protector of Will Smith's character, but he is essentially repeating his role as Harry Call in 1974's "The Conversation," a far better film than this one.Among the NSA bad guys chasing Will Smith is Barry Pepper, who appeared in "Saving Private Ryan." Mr. Pepper is active in this film but we learn little about him. Also familiar to us from "Saving Private Ryan" is Tom Sizemore, who appears here as a mobster. But his talents are largely wasted, as there is no real character development for him either. Jon Voight, who plays the NSA Director, has made far better films than this. While the action sequences and effects are quite good, they don't make up for the lack of character development. The only character we really learn about is Will Smith's, and this we must learn on the run.I came away somewhat disappointed in the movie, but more aware of the risk to my privacy, and of the need to control government agencies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The paranoid citizen genre (is it really a genre?) is not dead after all. Just different. Movies in the category usually involve many more psychological thrills and intrigue. Enemy of the State delivers in a 90's sort of way... non stop action. After the first 10 minutes you better hope you don't have to get up to go to the bathroom, because this film doesn't stop until the credits roll.Will Smith is good as lawyer turned enemy of the state, Robert Clayton Dean, and Gene Hackman as Brill, an ex-NSA agent and current paranoid citizen #1, gives a solid performance as always (upcoming Love Boat: The Movie a possible exception). Jon Voight plays a great dirty politician (is there another type these days?).Well thought and put together into a tightly woven story that leaves sparse little time to develop characters, or even add dialog. You get your money's worth, but don't expect to think too much. That is all taken care of by the film makers. This is as much a commentary on the audiences today and their willingness to be "wowed" by a fast pace and special effects as it is a view of the production companies willingness to go with what is proven to make money and not to take too many chances. Don't get me wrong though. This was a good movie and I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now in the ideal universe, this film would be average fare: engaging, well crafted, respectfully participating with the audience (rather than preaching or dumbing down)... Fact is, most action/techno thrillers are crappy and unbelievable so "EOTS" winds up looking a lot better than it may be.Story is well crafted and, where a "Mission Improbable" completely falls apart for two acts and whimpers resolution in an excruciating expository conclusion, "EOTS" actually works to bring two storylines together with precision structure.Gene Hackman reprises Harry Caul as only he can, and if the sacrifice for great action is an understanding of the character's interior reality, go see "The Conversation" for backstory.Will Smith is a calculated necessity for big box, and I figure if he was ten years older I'd've believed it a lot more. He does journeyman work with admirable energy, and Voight continues his bad govt. franchise effectively.The real star is the tech-based frenicity of the pursuit of the Wrong Man scenario. It works. The supporting characters move this baby along rapid fire: in that bunch there is quality and they reveal a surprising amount of personality, a key to making the genre open up. Love that gent from "Pvt. Ryan", the bible-quoting sniper. Sizemore rocks as the Mob Cheiftan. And Jack Black, the satellite guy.Never give them a chance to breathe, always advance the plot. There are some logic errors in the story, mind you, but not to worry: as a viewer you are engaged to the point of overlooking the little stuff to stay on the ride. Totally worth a full price ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technological thriller meets expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1970's and 1980's, a rash of spy movies were released, all with relatively similar plots and characters. However, we soon tired of this genre and we went looking for something new and exciting: the technological thriller. Although the two themes are fairly similar, techno-thriller movies tend to depend more heavily on society's supposed paranoia about the advancement of technology. The latest installment of this theme, starring mediocre Will Smith and the reliable Gene Hackman, is one of the best of its kind. After disappointments like "The Net" and "Johnny Mnemonic", "Enemy of the State" offers some new life to the genre, but is by no means perfect. The movie starts off slowly, but builds rather quickly with plenty of suspense and action to go around. Unfortunately, the acting is less than superb and there is an abundance of Will Smith's vapid one-liners. Centering around Smith and a well obfuscated tape of a congressman's untimely demise, the movie runs full speed ahead with little or nothing to get in its way until the violent and cathartic ending. There are a few ugly cliches and unoriginal themes thrown into the mix, yet the movie maintains its ability to proffer up good fast-paced action and accordingly dire implications up until the end. I must say that I commend Bruckheimer whole-heartedly on his casting decisions. Hackman, star of a few spy movies in his day, gave a commendably cynical performance, and many familiar faces were welcome in this youthful cast. Jason Lee, of "Mallrats" and "Chasing Amy" makes a disastrous appearance, and Jake Busey pops up sporadically from the mob of antagonistic thugs. All in all an enjoyable film and equally deserving of four stars out of five.</fullReview>

The entire 2 hours and 8 minutes feal like they are in fast-forward, such that even the sappier dialog scenes wiz by. *Enemy* is a cross between the conspiracy ideas in *Conspiracy Theory* (though no where near as slow), and the fiendish technology in films like *The Net* (though the technology is a little more believable.As a software developer I am often disappointed by outrageous technology in films. With *Enemy* I am pleased to say that I wasn't left with that feeling.Finally, it's worth mentioning that unlike *The Seige*, *Enemy* actually succeeded in making an action film with a bit of a moral message: "where do we draw the line between protecting national security and infringing upon the privacy rights of the individual".Go see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows that whatever your bad day - it could get a lot worse. Full of high tech toys that I wouldn't want to have watching me, it's a movie full of paranoia that leaves you a little paranoid when you leave. Special effects aren't everywhere, but excellent when used. Story line starts out interesting and builds up a lot from there. Fully exciting from start to finish and if you know Will Smith, you know that there are funny one-liners dropped in from the get-go. Regina King has the same loud but loving wife role that she played in Jerry Maguire. Gene Hackman is great as always and Jon Voight plays the same part he has lately - very articulate man that you can not stand. All in all, I give it 3 thumbs up. I recommend seeing it at least twice at the theatre. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 8 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very high energy thriller, reminiscent of Three Days of the Condor and the Conversation, told at the speed of an MTV video. Will Smith ably underplays the role of the hip and very smart Black man that was created, but seems to no longer be played, by Eddie Murphy in "Beverly Hills Cop". Despite all the technical wizardry and plot twists, the story "works", and only occasionally calls for a "suspension of disbelief". The only modest failing is that you don't come away from the movie remembering any great performances or scenes. But as a concept picture, it will provoke some serious thought about the surveillance capabilities of the secret service. An 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fast paced link in the government intrigue chain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy of the State starring Gene Hackman and Wil Smith is a quintessential Tony Scott action film. It is peppered with action, explosions, and edge of your seat chase scenes. Extrapolating on themes from such government paranoia classics as "Three days of the Condor", "The Anderson Tapes", and most particularly, "The Conversation", director Scott exposes his main character to all the brutality and fear which a government out of control can generate. The film emphasizes the helplessness of the average man when there is not one moment of one day that any of us is without the government watching us. Tony Scott once again uses his camera as an almost speaking actor to push the action along at break neck speeds, and inform us on the sheer terror that the characters experience as they are manipulated by forces beyond their control. The performances bring alive a tight script well worth the money to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Understand when I see an action/suspense film, I judge it based solely on what I want from this genre. EOTS is not Hamlet. Having said that, WOW great film! Bruckheimer for President! The film was paced perfectly; I never looked at my watch. The action was intense. Tony Scott's quick cuts were ok, I am glad they were limited. (can't believe I am saying this but RENT G.I. Jane) The Tech story line was far out yet plausible. The acting was far above average (how does Jon Voight get work?). Great to see Jason Lee in this film wish he had a bigger part. Big Willie is really coming into his own. Gene Hackman, well he is tried and true. Tony Scott used some of his favorite bit players to give me a sense of familiarity. The little kid who played Howard Stern in Private Parts is Will Smiths son's, friend. *Howard Stern Bob a Booey* Regina King I don't know about 227 but I saw 34-28-34 and liked it. The ending is hilarious. When you realize what is happening, if you have even a trace, of a sense of humor, you're laughing out loud. One more time, Jon Voight? He must use the Oak method of acting, cause he looks like wood. How many movies is he going to taint?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Enemy of the State" puts Will Smith in a classic Hitchcockian situation. He's in the wrong place at the wrong time and nefarious government agents are after him. The electronic hardware they use to track Smith and tear apart his life is frightening. This film might have been an above average thriller, but the introduction of Gene Hackman as a retired agent who helps Smith elevates it to sublime levels. Hackman subtly invokes the character of Harry Caul, the reclusive snoop he portrayed in the 70's classic, "The Conversation". Jon Voight continues his second, or is it the third, career as a villian. Lisa Bonet, who should be making more movies, is fine as a mysterious woman from Smith's past. Regina King provides solid support as Smith's beleaguered spouse. All in all, a classy ride. I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Distinctly uneven but generally entertaining, Enemy of the State casts Will Smith as Robert Dean - a Washington-based attorney who inadvertently finds himself at the center of a far-reaching conspiracy involving the murder of a well-known congressman. Director Tony Scott - working from David Marconi's screenplay - infuses the film with an expectedly kinetic sense of style, while producer Jerry Bruckheimer's presence can be felt in even the smallest moments (something that's particularly true of the random bits of quirkiness among the supporting characters). And although costar Gene Hackman - essentially reprising his Conversation role - acts circles around Smith, Smith's charisma and likability certainly goes a long way towards engendering the viewer's empathy. But at a running time of almost two-and-a-half hours (!), there's simply no denying that Enemy of the State is right on the verge of being disastrously overlong (the inclusion of a needless third-act sting probably doesn't help matters, although it does lead into a ludicrous yet enjoyable climax that's oddly similar to the finale of Scott's True Romance). Still, the movie is - on the whole - an astonishingly fast-paced and sporadically intelligent thriller that's generally as mindlessly engaging as Bruckheimer undoubtedly intended.</fullReview>

When I saw this at the theater, there were plenty of us libertarian/conservatives who thought it was a pretty damn serious condemnation of the Klintoon administration. It just goes to show that privacy infringement and government snooping are a) nothing new and b) causes for alarm for anyone who loves the Constitution, regardless of political party or philosophy.

		<fullReview>I think I have hit on an interesting little prank, that if enough of us participate, just might bring this domestic spy thing to a screeching halt. The practice I propose is sort of a low-tech variation on Hackman's (love that name!)plan to turn intelligence technology upon itself and its masters. All can play. I think one of the nonviolent techniques we might be able to employ to frustrate these spooks is as follows: The next time you call someone, even if it is a routine call to a buddy, you ex wife, your banker, the hair stylist, or the pizza place, read the following announcement at the end of the conversation. It goes without saying that this announcement should be read at the conclusion of all calls to foreign countries. If you are a Democrat, a liberal, have ever attended a protest rally, written your congressman or the local newspaper you can be sure you are on their suspect list. The goal is to get as many other people as possible under surveillance and raise the raw data base to infinity.Please keep your line open for a call from me soon.At the end of your conversation read as rapidly as possible the following announcement. Be sure to read the key words slowly, clearly and distinctly, however."Before hanging up I would like to have your permission to conduct the following exercise: This is a test of the overload capacity of the National Security Administration's data mining information acquisition software. This caller, in voluntary cooperation with other patriotic citizens in your area who believe that such domestic spying in addition to being an unconstitutional infringement on the privacy of American citizens, as well as doing nothing to actually enhance national security and in defiance of Federal, State and Local authorities has developed this system to activate and hopefully overload the detection software by reading the following key words: Beeeep - Osama - Koran - assassinate - bomb ? jihad ? Bush ? anthrax ? Iraq - Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Thank you for your cooperation. If this had been an actual National Security Emergency and not just the Orwellian manipulations designed to keep a pliant citizenry in a state of constant paranoia and fear, the key words you have just heard would have been followed by: Information - on how to effectively eject these brigands from the offices of trust they have successfully stolen from legitimate candidates.News - without the slimy fingerprints of Karl Rove all over it.And Instructions - on how to non-violently overthrow this government.Good by and good luck." Try this little prank on all your Republican friends when you call them. When the 700 Club has its next telethon ? call in and read these key words to them. That should start things moving. Why should we progressives be the only ones under Bush's magnifying glass?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look what the liberals did! They came up with a reasonably exciting, technologically imaginative, charismatically performed piece of fluff that points a pristine finger at EEEVIL Republicans for trying to take away our civil liberties. This silly movie came out three years before the average person had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and the barriers preventing law enforcement and intelligence agencies from sharing information were all in place. So Enemy of the State seemed as paranoiac as it was entertaining. Even in awful movies, Will Smith is fascinating to watch--if he were any more charismatic, the speakers on your television set would start screaming like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally. Jon Voight has lost all his youthful handsomeness (and in its place has arrived a delightful evilness). Tom Sizemore--in a small part--looks anything but small. Gene Hackman, sporting a really cool, old fart haircut, once again shows he can do almost no wrong.What were left with is an interesting homage to Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, but without the emotional depth and claustrophobia. The screenwriter(s) want us to believe that, even with Saint Bill in the White House, those bad, bad Republicans are only a murder away from destroying all our liberties.I enjoyed EOTS even though, inevitably, it destroyed itself with chases and bullets and whizbangishness. By the time of the big shootout-- remember Sizemore?--Gawd, what a great name for this part!--the good guys emerge virtually unscathed and the bad guys are all dead, laying on the floor of the kitchen of some Goodfellas restaurant. The shootout took about, oh, a week to complete. I got up and made a sandwich and, when I came back, all the Glocks and Berettas were getting low on ammo.Ultimately, it was a silly, fun mess and one can't take the paranoia and the lefty-loonyness too seriously. Just sit back with your baloney (in tribute to the script) and watch the skies for the G.O.P.</fullReview>

Thumbs up for the soundtrack and the excellent casting because Smith's presence brings in some humour.

		<shortDescription>Irresistible action flick! Watch before judge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people are about to watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production, I'm pretty sure they are usually expecting to see some really "good waste of time". Films like "Bad boys", "The Rock" and "Con air" are very common, typical, mindless action flicks, a kind of movies you use to switch off your brains with.I must warn you: even though you find Bruckheimer's name behind "Enemy of the state" and it's an action movie too, I can declare it's high above those routinized films, much more than just a good piece of crazy action and a flick you view just to amuse yourself after a hard day. Don't believe what others may say, I'm telling the truth here.It's intelligent, unhesitating and it reminds me of older classics made at the turn of the '70s like "The French connection" (also starring Gene Hackman). Only difference is that this one is much more intensive, reckless and million times more faster, I've never seen anything quite like this before."Enemy of the state" is definitely and simply the best "chase" movie ever made. You don't see as forceful and direct pursuit in a movie every day. It's impossible to explain why this is so exceptional action movie. This may sound like a clich but you have to see it for yourself. One thing is for certain, if there's one Jerry Bruckheimer production that everybody remembers as a remarkable classic 20 years from now, it's this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undeniably Thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene in this film where Robert Clayton Dean is inside a women's underwear store and he says "I should've got my wife a watch." Talk about the line that coyuld've m,ade this movie obsolete. Say what you want about the acting, but you got to admit, it is thrilling. To have something this up in your face (the end of privacy) is entertaining. I liked this film. And I though the acting by everyone was excellent. Will Smith (who I usually think is fair in acting) shows he can really act and gives good emotion and feeling as a man who has lost his life, his livelihood because of a tape. When a man drops this tape into his possesion (and he doesn't know it), he becomes the target of the latest technology of being spied on. Sure the plot is good, but the thrills are electrifyingly great. We see not only Dean's troubles, but the sleek and powerful movement that is tracking the guy. Smith's best film and Hackman and Voight's better ones. Featuring Jason Robards and Gabriel Bryne unbilled and such young ones as Seth Green, Scott Caan, Barry Pepper, Jake Busey, Jack Black and Jamie Kennedy. Terriric. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fast action thriller. A Baltimore attorney (Will Smith) ends up with a video tape of a U.S. Senator being murdered by a corrupt political enemy. The bad guys need to ruin the credibility of the lawyer now on the lamb. His house is bugged; his credit cards don't work; his phone is tapped and even his shoes are bugged. A whole lot of interesting chases. And spy tapes so good it is scary. Also in the mix is Lisa Bonet, Jon Voight and Gene Hackman. This can be a little stressful watching, but worth every minute of it.</fullReview>

Aaron Sorkin didwonders to give the film cogent dialogue and Will Smith bringsmuch to the table. But far too many plot "twists" are downrightimpossible (example: the panoramic replay of the lingerie shopscene) and if the viewer dares take a step back, they will shortlyrealize how completely unrealistic it is for so many people to beinvolved in such a huge conspiracy and have so many tools andfunds at their disposal. Suspension of disbelief is one thing,turning your brain completely off is quite another. Enemy of theState is nothing short of eye candy; the brain will go hungry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping thriller with a sense of humour.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was on the edge of my seat watching this movie and it was gripping from beginning to end. I loved the use of talented actors, some in very small almost cameo roles (eg. Gabriel Byrne), which added a lot of credibility. The other thing that appealed to me was the sense of humour - so many thrillers can be intense and exciting, but without that lightness of touch. This one has humour as well, so even while the characters are in peril, there's a chance that they will say something amusing to lighten the mood. Overall, the premise of the movie is a scary concept - more so because it's probably becoming true. Great performances from Will Smith and Gene Hackman, but from many others as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unintentional Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy of the State is a most annoying film. Even with an intensely unoriginal story, it could have been quite good. Unfortunately, by deciding to treat the audience as if its members were stupid, the film falls on its face. It is, literally, incredible.Will Smith can act very well, as seen in Six Degrees of Separation. Unfortunately he mailed in this performance. Weak direction seems to have left everyone incapable of deciding what Smith's character should be: the smart, wise-cracking lawyer or the action hero? In North By Northwest Cary Grant never appears to have the full measure of the situation into which he has been thrust, rendering the film and his portrayal believable. In Enemy of the State, Will Smith seems to go from intelligent but confused dupe out of his depth to omniscient and omnipotent hero for no apparent reason. How?Gene Hackman is, as always, eminently watchable and believable. Unfortunately, he has done this film before, played most of the characters better, and he must have known this cheap imitation of "The Conversation" wasn't even in the same league as the original. Two other great actors, Jon Voigt and Jason Robards, are wasted in this film. Robards' cameo at the beginning shows the impact a great screen actor can have in the smallest of roles. His proves in many ways more intriguing than any other character, and he's dead after the first five minutes!The silliest thing about the film is the technology represented: satellites taking real-time, moving images of *infinite* resolution through clouds visible from the ground; call tracing which takes place in barely a minute, with 'kewl graphix'; ability to rotate a three dimensional image taken by a single *fixed* camera. Further offending the viewer are blatant and incessant product placements and excessively relaxed techno-geeks who are so stereotyped it's disgusting...not to mention the various ethno-stereotypes in the film, which annoyed me though I am proudly non-PC. Ugh.This film is so ridiculous as to be an unintentional comedy. Hollywood wonders why Americans are perceived as buffoons they are not, and why some fellow countrymen seem to be convinced of endless government conspiracy?! More a Hollywood conspiracy to create audience stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller with a message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about violation of privacy, about use and misuse of surveillance. It's primarily against it, and it shows throughout how such can be used to invade people's privacy and unlawfully be used against the common man. The film's depiction of misuse of surveillance certainly gives a disturbing insight to how it can ruin a regular Joe's life in no time, but I can't really say if said depiction is accurate or powerfully unrealistic. My knowledge of satellites and GPS isn't sufficient to determine that. The plot is very good. It moves at a good pace all the way through the film, there isn't really any point where it slows down. It's relatively easy to follow, as long as you pay attention, without being overly simplistic. The acting is decent enough, there aren't really any fantastic performances, though. The story is told with an appropriate(never too much) amount of humor that lightens an otherwise bleak and unsettling look at a world of limited privacy. The thriller parts are well-executed and exciting. The action, though there isn't much of it, is pretty good too. The ending is a pretty good climax to the film, but early in the film, I expected something very different, and, even though I've seen the film three times now, I can't really decide if I like this better than what I would have expected. The ending scene, as it is, is fairly climactic and fast-paced, but it doesn't really contain any real thriller elements. In fact, very little in the last 1/4 consists of thriller material, which disappointed me, as everything up to that point was all thriller, and little to no action. I don't know if director Tony Scott felt that the film needed a surprise ending, if he felt that the film lacked action, or if he simply lost track of the film's style. But the last part of the movie is too action-based and contains far too few thriller elements, considering everything in the film that led up to that point, in my opinion. All in all, a good thriller with a good message that is fairly well-executed and sufficiently well-presented. I recommend it to fans of Will Smith, thrillers, and Tony Scott. Also, people who are interested in the subject might want to check it out, too. 7/10</fullReview>

For example, a 360 degree image of something can't be taken from a regular 2D security camera. Also, during the action sequences, the camera seemed too close, which made the scenes more confusing than enjoyable. All this leads up to a very unconvincing and unbelievable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This flick bothers me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enemy of the State (EotS) is, in my book, quite overrated. It's a technically wonderful film, has a fair amount of decently managed intrigue, has a good cast that plies their wares as well as would naturally be expected... but the story arc is clumsily managed and the social/political implications are poisonous and ultimately work against the film's ostensible concerns.Those surface concerns are related to the maintenance of basic freedoms in a constitutional republic; and EotS tries and (sadly) sort of succeeds in selling certain specific concerns as central and palpable.The specific concerns raised by EotS are red herrings, and have little- to-no business in enlightened discourse among participants in a democratic republic. Concern that an out-of-control technocracy, armed with advanced tech tools, threatens our rights to privacy and freedom is misplaced concern.So: Where *should* that concern be placed?It should be placed in a broad social regression to bland acceptance of the homogeneity of private media control into fewer hands, with less and less real reportage available to inform us in a way that serves the most important requisite of a sustainable republic; an informed polity.So EotS dangles a hi-tech boogieman red herring, putting people in danger of swallowing that herring whole and going to sleep.What's more dangerous; that a technocratic nomenclatura are going to reach out to intrude into our lives? Or that we're going to turn on our TVs and *invite* system-servile pr1cks into our homes to "remind" us that our political masters love us?; that Saddam Hussein was a "real" threat to the U.S.?; that implementation of a national system of health care risk pooling will necessarily drag "death panels" in its train?; that we must unceasingly feed the beast of overheated economic activity lest that ravenous beast turn on us to sate its bottomless hunger?Which is more dangerous? Which is more real? Which is more immanent?EotS is another in a long line of popular films that attempt to get people worked up over a simplistic hyperfantastic "eeee-vil" system; which depiction winds up having an actual downside; by distracting us from *real* concerns, which are quite visible as you look around you.While some may accuse me of relegating more real-world importance to this flick than it would pretend to, I would reply that such a dodge is disingenuous. You can't have it both ways, and neither can this flick, which reeks of an attempt to cop the prestige of edgy, "timely", realpolitik. You can't craft a movie to convey this kind of "social relevance", and then deflect criticism by remonstrating that it's nothing more than a mere action flick snack.I see EotS as a sort of period curiosity; not something I would willingly invite into the tabernacle of my heart, as an artistic product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Henry and Kristl witnessed Enemy of The state</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I love Gene Hackman." Kristl said, "He is a good actor and he plays this grumpy cynical reluctant character so well. Maybe a bit too well. And Will Smith does equally well as the gawking advocate who sees his live fall apart because he happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. His 'what-the-hell! or why-does-this-happen-to-me? expressions are priceless.""The ending is hilarious. The way it connects to the start of the movie, that was a nifty trick.I mean that mob involvement at the start seems more like an irrelevant side story to give Will Smith a background and it doesn't surface back until the end, but then it suddenly shifts back into the story.. " Henry nodded,"It is also nice how the plot shifts gear gradually, from a spying thriller, to a chase part and then to a 'fightback' part, turning the tables on the bad guys.The ending is nice because it is Will Smith who thinks of it. He is grown from a hapless victim into a desperate fighter.""This movie shows the skill of Tony Scott in keeping you from losing your suspense of disbelief by grabbing your attention and never letting go.. The whole plot is in itself filled with loopholes, impossibilities and inconsistencies, but because the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, you never get to think: 'wait a minute..how..." Kristl said.Kristl continued. "But there are odd turns. For instance, at first they follow Will Smith via spying devices, but then somewhere along the line they start to following him visibly and shooting at him. Shooting him seems to me an impractical way of getting hold what Will has. And if they wanted to capture him, they could have done it by having the police arrest him. And that the whole thing was staged as a training exercise for the benefit of the other agents might work at first, but those agents must have smelled a rat when people started shooting and dying.""I found it a pity that the key scenes are shoddy work. The murder of the congressman in a park in broad daylight is simply impossible to belief. The changes of being spotted are just too high, which of course happens.. And that key scene with the cab where Will Smith gets connected to Gene Hackman is another example of shoddy work. Who was that guy who picked him up? Who did he work for? Gene Hackman? Why did he pull a gun on Will Smith? How come Will just happens to see Gene passing by and recognize him? And why did the people pursue this cab. " Kristl added, "I never quite understand car chases in thrillers.. The moment someone is aware of you following him and tries to shake you off, the reason to follow that person is gone,. And, in hindsight, that Will is told by a mobster that the FBI is spying on them is too convenient. ""The shootouts and chases are fun though. And that scene were Gene blows up his house. Hahah. Those agents see that count down and go like.. ^$&amp;$ the place is going to blow." Henry laughed, "Yet, Tony didn't quite handle the last fight as well as he could have.. A Tarantino or Sam Peckinpah would have done it a lot better, using slow motion, different angles and tricks like that. ""You can say Tony is not such an artful director as his brother, but he is skilled at dishing up an action-packed movie and Enemy of the State is a movie you ought to watch because of the action packed thrill. It does not make much sense when you start to think about it and it certainly has no depth or message that you can take home with you." Kristl said, ""A sit back and enjoy the ride while it lasts movie?" "No, a fire and forget movie." Henry said."Hah!"</fullReview>

He being of the modern masters at frantic editing and the lamest personality subplots available to the mass ticket buying public while pandering to the point of groan inducement.But his fixation on Big Brother and its evil deeds is always welcome even if it has to be dumbed down and packaged as suburban swiss cheese. The failings here are the aforementioned attempt at home life and its modern configuration of clichd marital misunderstandings and children with a detached, but sharp electronic elevation of self and situation.The visuals are the star here and the pulsating pacing. It grabs and never lets go. Spinning so wildly that the viewer barely has time to notice the inane dialog and the cartooning stereotypes (especially the Italians but not limited to that particular piece of cardboard).It is a liberal wet dream handled in a heavy handed manner, but if you are the dreamer it is a fanciful fulfillment with an artificially induced climax. This is a Hollywood thrill ride with a fortune cookie philosophy that can easily be digested for the non discriminate political scientist and the Orwellian cliff note/Wikipedia set.</fullReview>

I think that this movie worked because of it staff and the story. Great performance by Will Smith(Robert Clayton Dean),Gene Hackman(Edward 'Brill' Lyle) and Jon Voight(Thomas Brian Reynolds). Also all the other actors and actress gave a good performance. The plot was nothing that special but it worked greatly.One of the scenes i liked was the shooting scene.It was a little overly dramatic for my taste but the shooting was surprisingly not that violent.Anyway the movie was a great watch and it kept me entertained for almost the whole time.

		<fullReview>"Enemy Of The State", is a good piece of entertainment from a duo of filmmakers that have brought many such pieces to the screen. Having said that, if we had 1% of the gee-whiz gadgets that this film had, and they worked with 1% of the efficiency that the film portrays, Osama Bin Laden would have been apprehended before midnight on September 11th. The balance of Al Qaeda would have been rounded up within a day or two. Orwell's vision in, "1984", is tame when compared to the absolute instantaneous control this film portrays the US Government as having over any citizen they pick. A good story needs good actors and this film has at least a trio of fine performers. Will Smith is a man whose career is still just in the early stages of what should prove to be decades of success, and he already has one Oscar Nomination to his credit, Jon Voight already has an Oscar on his shelf, and one of my favorite actors without condition, Gene Hackman, adds yet another great performance to his resume of films. There are real government agencies portrayed in the film, but they are portrayed in a science fiction like manner. No film crew is going to get inside of The NSA, and no amount of name dropping of publicly known satellite names, like "Keyhole", make this film's portrayal of data gathering any more believable. The NSA wishes they could do what this film gives them credit for. However if you really want to know what they can and cannot do, there are many very good books that share the little information that is in the public domain. Much of it is dated, but like the first Stealth F117-A fighter, when we (the public) were finally shown the plane, it was already an antique, an incredible and still very useful aircraft, but one that had been around for many, many years, and was already several generations old. Watch this film for the pace and entertainment of a great chase from beginning to end. Just do not take the technology too seriously, and don't allow it to raise any level of paranoia you may have. One fact about The NSA that has been documented is that they can review less than half of what they collect. This is not due to their competence level, rather the shear volume their systems flag for review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced but dated "the government is watching" thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a post-9/11 era, moviegoers are no longer fazed by the idea that the government can utilize technology to the fullest extent in tracking and monitoring citizens. We also understand that this (debatably) infringes upon our civil liberties. Since then, dozens of films have warned us of the dangerous extent that technology can take us to, and that rubs off some of the sheen for government agency thriller-lovers trying out "Enemy of the State" today as opposed to over ten years ago.A great movie is never dated and "Enemy of the State" definitely is, with Will Smith's hunted character Robert Dean getting all angry at Gene Hackman's gibberish description of a GPS, which is secondhand knowledge for first graders these days. We all know the power of satellites and how the government can bug anything with a mic, tracer or camera. In 1998, we didn't. So there's little novelty to this movie for anyone well-versed in post-9/11 thrillers -- even for those who've seen more recent Tony Scott-directed films. "Enemy" must then hinge more on its story, which it didn't when it was released, and the story is just average. It's a bit unfair to what was probably a better movie in its day, but time is one of film's most challenging tests.Starring Smith when he was riding high off of "Independence Day" and "Men in Black," "Enemy" is about a lawyer who accidentally comes across evidence he doesn't know he has that would expose a giant murder cover-up by that National Security Agency. Naturally, the NSA, led by Jon Voight, wants it at any cost, and using all sorts of technology strips Dean of everything. This convinces him to start running, where he eventually crosses paths with a former NSA tech (Hackman), who represents his only chance of shaking them off.Though the originality of the film fades with age, what improves is the who's who in the cast. In addition to Smith, Hackman and Voight, small roles are played by Jason Lee as the guy who plants the evidence on Dean in the first place, Jack Black as a tech servant of the NSA, Barry Pepper as an NSA field op ("Saving Private Ryan"), Jamie Kennedy, Philip Baker Hall, Lisa Bonet, Gabriel Byrne ("The Usual Suspects") and Scott Caan ("Ocean's Eleven")."Enemy" is your typically fast-paced thriller with the government going after the lone fox. It's a bit on the longer side, but it moves quickly at most points. Its only a weak story as far as drama and relationship. Dean's relationship with his wife (Regina King) throughout all this and their history of him cheating on her with Bonet one time years ago pops in and out and breaks the over-arching concept that should be driving the movie: Dean wanting to figure out what the hell is going on. He doesn't seem to wise up to pursuing that answer until much later on.Dean's relationship with Brill, Hackman's character, also feels forced and pointless. They have a "I need you as much as you need me moment" in the second half of the film, but when Hackman doesn't even show up for the first hour, you can't legitimately believe it's true. At this point, the film almost tries to switch into buddy action movie when it's much better as just a techno-thriller. For 1998, the concept of a thriller where an average upper-middle-class lawyer suddenly gets thrust into a nasty chase with the government would definitely be an appealing one -- it would be an easy character and situation to empathize with. But while team heals all, it definitely hurts some movies and particularly those with weak stories containing patchy subplots.</fullReview>

Unaware that someone has slipped him crucial and damning evidence, he becomes the target of yet another rogue element inside America's limitless and out-of-control administration.Gene Hackman plays a conspiracy theorist grandee, a sort of bad-tempered Master Yoda, who has seen the force from both sides. Of all people, he knows how dark it can get. Pretty soon his and Smith's paths cross, and the result is a proverbial roller-coaster ride. It's tense, dramatic, murderous, and over-the-top unbelievable. But it's fun though.Will Smith is an unlikely choice as an action hero. I don't wish to seem unkind, but he has ear issues. I mean; as a freshly bathed baby he must have been suspended by them from a washing line in order to dry in the breeze. They seriously compromise his ability to be taken seriously. He tries to be a black funny-man, but Eddie Murphy has already got that role sealed and embossed with his name. And when he tries to be serious, those lobes are right behind him, flapping about and taking the mickey.When things really go pear-shaped for Smith's character, I am surprised how unsupportive and disloyal his wife is represented to be. It seems incredible that they could ever have got hitched in the first place, and is certainly proof that he made a bad choice. I find their relationship even less plausible that all the other hokum.Hackman himself has always retained a subtle craft in the double-dealing game. But here he seems just a little over-the-top like the story. He's good, he's Hackman; but he could have been a lot better.Emphasis is on action rather than thoughtful premise. Sometimes there's a hint of 'James Bond' or 'Mission Impossible'. It's unbelievable, but most of what you want to see is done with skill and flair. I would have preferred Hackman in a more intelligent and studious guise, and a less comical role from say Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington. However, Washington had already done that conspiracy thang in the subtler (and I think, superior) 'Pelican Brief'.Still, there's plenty to keep your interest going. With Mr Voigt doing his 'nasty bloke' bit to perfection. Just don't let those ears spoil your view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems much more Redundant/Relevant now.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie recently, didn't really care for it much when it released (was an adult film sneaking into theaters for will smith and some wild conspiracy theory didn't seem worth it at that time), even now only saw it because my friend just purchased a top of the line DVD player-Projector system and this was the only DVD we had at hand.Needless to say i expected nothing much from this movie.But then again THIS MOVIE WAS MADE BEFORE 9/11 AND BEFORE THE Americans DECIDED TO THROW AWAY CIVIL LIBERTIES AND PRIVACY IN FAVOUR OF A SAFER WORLD (america, which is what the world means for Americans), now somehow this movie seems all the more redundant/relevant.(Will explain letter).As expected the acting in this movie is top class, it has a fair share of names that were either already big or are big now, Scott Caan,Seth Green, Jack Black, Gabriel Bryne etc were all nothings then but since then have moved on to prove themselves as fine actors, hence everyone has done an excellent job even in limited/cameo roles (bryne).The show as expected was stolen by Gene Hackman who has made wise-ass and eccentric his middle names.Technically this movie was merely good but once again Graphics/Visuals were abused. Especially irritating was the frequent pans of the satellite and the overly irritating computer graphics before the satellite would home in on anybody.The movie also had its fare share of bad scenes that were overly cluttered and overdone, most of which involved the chases through the streets the constant chatter on the radios and frequent pans of the satt.,tech. involved, was jarring, especially distasteful was the scene where Will smith meets Lisa in the open.On the other hand the first contact with Gene and Bryne was brilliant, Bryne was clearly wasted in this film.I also didn't care to much for the showdown at the end, the events and thoughts leading up-to it were brilliant but the actual conclusion left me with feeling of "BEEN THERE DONE THAT".Even though this movie has very less action and i don't like thrillers to much, the events of this movie are good enough to hold your attention.The movie quiet fast paced but the rhythm is broken occasionally by some scenes that were drawn to long.The movie seems shorter than it is and this is one of the best compliments a movie can receive.IN VIEW OF THE CURRENT SCENARIO THE STAR OF THE MOVIE HAS NOW BECOME THE PLOT.The movie seems even more relevant now that the patriot act is a reality, the premise of this movie gives conspiracy theorists like me (there is no way a 180feet wingspan plane can make a rectangular cavity of 90 by 40 in the pentagon), as well the ordinary moviegoer a lot to think about, maybe living in fear of the government everyday is just as bad of living in fear of the terrorist.Reduntant again because the act is reality now and people have already made their choice haven't they, and besides this movie does seem somewhat over dramatised.A good thriller that will certainly please the fans.But a large number of overdone scenes and abuse of technology make this movie fall well short of greatness.Do watch it when in the mood for a thriller though.-s large number of overdone scenes, abuse of technology.+/-s Patriot Act conspiracy theory anyone?.+s seems more imp. now, great acting (Even in the overdone scenes),solid cast, fast paced seems shorter than it is.total 7/10 ( not considering the fact that it exceeded the non-existent expectations there are a large number of poor scenes and maybe expectations will make them seem worse, also this movie wasn't that highly rated when it released so the late rise in fame has to be considered).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a thriller, this movie was great when it was released in 1999. But today (Nov. 2006) it's dynamite. The protection the U.S. Constitution provides can be, and has been, eroded whenever threats seem overwhelming. From the "Alien and Sedition Acts" of John Adams, through the Japanese-American concentration camps during WW II, past the Red Scare and Blacklists of the Cold War to our own time's Patriot Act et al. In time, we've had the opportunity, and wisdom, to correct these abuses. Ya'd think we'd learn and avoid these pitfalls the next time. Nope.Each new threat seems unique and requires more power "from the people. ""Who's going to monitor the monitors?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Gestapo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Enemy of the State" is in many ways a throwback to the paranoid political conspiracy thrillers which flourished in the post-Watergate atmosphere of the seventies and eighties. At the centre of the plot is a proposed new law which would give America's National Security Agency greatly increased powers to carry out surveillance of citizens. A prominent Congressman who is leading the campaign against the controversial bill is found dead in his car. The police assume that his death was an accident, but he was actually murdered at the instigation of Thomas Reynolds, a powerful NSA official who regards all opposition to the bill as tantamount to treason. Reynolds discovers that an ornithologist named Daniel Zavitz accidentally caught the murder on videotape while making a film as part of his studies of Canada Geese and that Zavitz intends to pass a copy of the tape to the press. Reynolds sends a squad of hit men after Zavitz, who is killed in a road accident while fleeing from them, but not before he has managed to slip the tape into a shopping bag belonging to Robert Dean, an old college friend, whom he meets by chance in a shop. Reynolds now turns his attention to Dean, a high-flying labour-relations lawyer. In order to discredit Dean should he ever go public with the tape, Reynolds starts a smear campaign as a result of which his credit cards are stopped, he is fired from his job and his wife is convinced that he is having an affair. Dean is forced to go on the run, but at first he does not know why. He does not even realise that the incriminating tape has come into his possession and believes that he is being persecuted after falling foul of a prominent Mafioso whom he has run across in the course of his work. He only realises the truth after he enlists the help of Edward Lyle ("Brill"), a former NSA man now working as a freelance investigator. With Brill's help he begins to turn the tables on his persecutors. Director Tony Scott has had something of a chequered career. His early film "The Hunger" was clearly made with the ambition for it to become a stylish art-house classic but merely ended up as all smoke and mirrors and no substance. He has, however, made some much better films, including "Top Gun" and that excellent thriller "Crimson Tide" (which also starred Gene Hackman). For most of its length "Enemy of the State" is an equally well-made thriller with some first-class chase sequences. The tension is maintained by the device of having the director's camera mimic the surveillance cameras keeping Dean under observation, suggesting that he is the victim of an all-seeing, all-powerful enemy. The film is, however, rather let done by its implausible ending, but there is a good performance from Will Smith as Dean and a very good one from Hackman as Brill, a curmudgeonly and reclusive man but one who is basically decent. The casting of Smith in this film is a good example of the racially colour-blind casting that was starting to happen in the eighties and nineties. After years of being excluded from major roles by Hollywood's unofficial colour-bar, black actors increasingly began to take starring parts in the sixties and seventies. Most of these, however, were either in "blaxploitation" movies or in films with an explicit race-relations theme. Smith was one of a group of actors, such as Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman, who began to win parts that could equally well have gone to a white actor. (Had Dean been white, only a few lines of dialogue would have needed to be rewritten). The film was made in 1998, during the Clinton years, but tries to remain neutral in party-political terms. Both the murdered Congressman and Reynolds's hard-line ally in Congress are Republicans. The main threat to liberty in this film, as has been pointed out, comes not from the Government, or from elected politicians of any ideological hue; the campaign against Dean is not authorised by the President, his Cabinet, or by Congress. Rather, the danger comes from unelected bureaucrats like Reynolds who, if granted too much power, will use it to pursue their own agenda. The film has taken on a greater topical relevance since 9/11. One of the most pressing issues in contemporary political debate is where the line should be drawn between the Government's duty to protect its citizens against crime and terrorism and the individual citizen's right to privacy. This film comes firmly down on the side of individual liberty. One cannot, of course, be sure whether the NSA actually does have the technical abilities to carry out the level of surveillance shown in this film, or whether they do exceed their legal powers to the extent that is implied. Even if the film does not depict America as it actually was in the late nineties, it can be interpreted as an Orwellian vision of the near future, a dystopian warning that if Americans do not guard their liberties they could be confronted with a home-grown version of the Gestapo or KGB, armed with a more sophisticated technology than was available to either of those organisations. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic 3/5 star action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty straightforward, entertaining Bruckheimer. It's got lots of action, often unnecessary. The characters tend to take time out form very serious situations to crack one-liners, or repeat throwaway lines designed exclusively for the trailer. But throughout, amidst the action and serious points about privacy smuggled in along the way, its just an action thriller where the good guys win.Will Smith does his classic, all action everyman, capable of a steadying irreverence when it's all getting a bit po-faced. For the second half of the film he's partnered with Gene Hackman, in a cameo reprise of his paranoid spook of The Conversation: at one point a still from that film is even used. The rest of the cast is good, with a tranche of high-calibre turns.The story is often sacrificed for fun and games but I do think that the final act is well paced and executed.

		<fullReview>The first time that I saw "Enemy of the State" advertised, it looked totally formulaic and idiotic. It appeared to be about someone planting something on Will Smith, so Smith has to take matters into his own hands. I thought: "Oh, and I bet that they didn't know who they were messing with when they put it in HIS pocket." When I saw the movie much later, I was surprised. Now, I will admit that parts of the movie are predictable (such as the end), but the whole thing about surveillance was actually quite interesting, especially with the recent NSA scandal. Therefore, this movie seems better many years after its release than at the time of its release (just the opposite of what one would expect).So, it's not a masterpiece by any stretch, but worth seeing. Also starring Gene Hackman, Barry Pepper, Jon Voight, Regina King, Ian Hart, Lisa Bonet, Jake Busey, Scott Caan, Jamie Kennedy, Jason Lee, Gabriel Byrne, Jack Black and Jason Robards.So have YOU ever gotten the feeling that you were being watched?</fullReview>

Jerry Buckheimer also used Sam Valenti as one of the characters in the movie as well as on CSI Las Vegas. Just some interesting things I noticed as I continued to view this movie. It was well written and only could be presented properly by the combination of the actors chosen. You have to stay focused on the movie every minute to watch how different situations all lead to the end result. It made me want to sit down and discuss the entire thought process with the writer of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith and Gene Hackman (who, despite being a supporting actor, makes the movie), star in (my own opinion), the greatest movie of 1998 next to AHX. The movie's based on Robert Dean (Smith), a lawyer who's at the wrong place at the wrong time; dropped with a device that's bugged and can be traced, he finds himself in the middle of a game of chicken and he winds up being the chicken. A corrupt congressman, the one wherein originally orchestrated the entire plot to find this device, doesn't care who has it or for what reason, but wants it by any means necessary and at any price. And for the world to mean the tape, I guess it's a question of.. "get busy living or get busy dying."Personally I enjoyed the movie. It was my favorite movie of the year, only second to American History X. This thing kept you in suspense until the end but it still had a few too many giveaways for how this would wind up. (Such as when Smith peered through the window at the FBI agent in the last 10 minutes.) Regardless, it was a good movie. The camera movement was very well choreographed and thought out. On top of a pulse-pounding beginning... the last scene... heheheh.. took the cake. If you haven't seen it you know what I'm talking about."What is it going to take to get that tape back?" "......." "The end of the world."9/10. Great movie. Definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The genre for this film is: action/thriller. This film deserves 7.0/10.I had never seen this film either in the cinema or on television, but I bought it on DVD and I was glad to buy a good, watchable movie.Will Smith, Gene Hackman, and Jon Voight take the lead roles. Will Smith plays his attorney character with seriousness and attitude. Gene Hackman is excellent and I wish he could have been given more screen time, his partnership with Will's character Dean looked good. The main semi-bad guy was played but Jon Voight, brilliantly portraying a man who is ruthless in having to cover his tracks and upping the stakes.The other cast members are a surprisingly good supporting list, Regina King and Lisa Bonnet, Jason Lee, Jack Black, and Gabriel Byrne, and I must mention a superb uncredited performance by Tom Sizemore, as mobster Boss Paulie Pintero.The main theme for the film is the level of corruption that can occur with high ranking government officials (National Security), and the high level of sophistication when someone is targeted for surveillance. Once the scene is set, it is interesting to see how those that are being surveyed can hit back.I loved parts that were just chasing about, running around like cat and mouse, those action scenes were great. Trust issues and loyalties those themes were prevalent. The final sequence in the film was surprising good, a clever and darkly comical twist. The action parts were good, the camera work great, but my one complain is the soundtrack, or lack of it, well that is if you don't count the Christmas jingles since this movie backdrop was set in that period.So go on and see this :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSIn a modern world where espionage and computer technology are at greater and greater levels, in 1998 "Enemy Of The State" was scarily close to the news.In the film itself we are introduced to Congressman Philip Hammersley (played briefly by the late Jason Robards) and Thomas Brian Reynolds (Jon Voight). Reynolds is heavily infavour of a new bill involving national security and monitoring of the public. Due to Hammersley's rivalry, Reynolds has him removed from the picture. The flaw with this situation is the event is caught on camera by a nature researcher (played by the amazing Jason Lee). The nature researcher's involvement is all too briefly before passing on the material to the unaware lawyer and family man Robert Clayton Dean (played by Will Smith in his finest role). From this point on, Dean's life begins to fall apart and he eventually meets the enigmatic "Brill" (Gene Hackman) and attempts to regain his life.First things first, "Enemy Of The State" is a quality film. In Will Smith and Gene Hackman it has a match winning partnership who provide enigmatic banter when they finally meet and who's characters develop a strong friendship. As well as the two main stars, there is an outstanding support cast. Tom Sizemore is excellent as Pintero the mafia man. Seth Green, Jack Black, Jamie Kennedy and others are excellent as the computer operators aiding Voight in his pursuit of Smith. Added to this superb cast an outstanding plot and special effects and the creators of this film are onto a winner.Truth be told, it's hard to think of many criticisms. The film resolves rather too well perhaps, with the explosive conclusion being convenient if memorable. Other than that, there really is little to complain about. Perhaps a distinct feeling that this film is a once in a blue moon performance is important. Certain feels I always feel I could watch over and over again without much problem, but certain others do feel like they might drag after the first viewing. This film feels just in that way. "Enemy Of The State" is an amazing film, but perhaps only when viewed for the first time in months. Truthfully though, this feels like I'm clutching at straws to make this film seem worse than it is.When "Enemy Of The State" was released in 1998 it was a powerful piece of cinema based on a topic incredibly relevant to the times. Nowadays the topic is perhaps even more relevant and the film does not disappoint. One of the most underrated films of the last ten years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw The Color Of Money without knowing it was a sort-of sequel to The Hustler, and I still haven't seen the earlier film, and I still think Scorsese's is great. I have seen and loved The Conversation ? but its resemblance to Enemy of the State is minimal. Hackman's character is similar, but the two films couldn't be more different. This is a big, brash Will Smith action vehicle, yet comes across as more thoughtful and intelligent than most of the breed. Maybe it's the canny casting of some of Hollywood's brightest young indie stars in supporting roles. Maybe it's the paranoid direction by one of the best and most underrated action directors around. Maybe it's that Smith only gets down to his pants once. But this is enjoyable from start to finish, and contains a masterful double-bluff around half way through when Gabriel Byrne turns up.</fullReview>

Governments and to a lesser extent corporations are doing everything and anything in their power to quell opposition and to control the people. You don't have to live in a country like Singapore or China, where you can be punished for viewing 'objectionable' material. Unfortunately governments throughout the western world are using the guise of national security to crack down on their own citizens. We may never know where this tracking technology could take us, because within the future we could be punished on the grounds of morality?

It shows the viewer perspectives and an idea of how the future world could be looks like, namely like the world of George Orwell: a world of spies and monitoring the people whatever they do and wherever they go... The movie shows in a very amusing way what for abilities the secret services have, to change, manipulate, or even destroy someone's life...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoying this movie depends on the type of viewer you are. If you are simply looking for 2 hours of continuous action, you came to right place. As far as a memorable film that gives you something to learn or love-I don't think so.Most action movies are extremely exaggerated and unrealistic; and that's okay. However, I'm kind of tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. Once again, the movie put an ordinary man(Will Smith) in an unordinary circumstance. Then, they took the NSA and exaggerated this entity way out of proportion. As far as eye-popping action, it definitely delivers. But, you will take nothing out of the theater and probably won't ever watch it again. If you liked this movie, check out Spy Game for a little different approach.2 1/2 out of 4 for the action</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film might be the most important one for the new millennium. It has a political message and this message should be heared. Even and especially after Nov. 11, 2001.And as Billy Wilder once said: "A film which does not entertain won't cause anything", it's one of the best and intelligent "spy thrillers" of the past couple of years. Much, much better than for example "The syp game".And last not least, it's definitely one of the best performing attainments of Will Smith ever seen.Get the movie on video, watch it and be assured that the story around the "No Such Agency" NSA is anything else than fictional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an extremely fast paced action packed thriller that will keep you glued to your seat from beginning to end. The action begins right from the start of the movie and just never stops for a second. The dialogues (although very high in the swearing department) are great and I think that Will Smith and Gene Hackman were perfectly suited to their roles. The story never lags and and is full of suspense. In other words, it was excellent. Highly recommended for those looking for a good action film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Enemy of the State" is an engaging piece of hokum. On levels of credibility and plot it's all rather dumb, but it's handled with enough aplomb to carry it along."Enemy of the State" is about how Robert Clayton Dean must fight to regain his life, after he is accidentally slipped a tape showing the murder of a Senator who was opposing a new privacy bill that would get in the way of the NSA (members of which bumped the good senator off). The leader of the bad guys is played deliciously coldly by Jon Voight and, in the manner of all good screen villains, he will stop at nothing to make sure he is not caught! This creates a ludicrously paranoid plot in which you must suspend disbelief as huge satellites are swung around the globe, people tracked through huge computer simulated maps of buildings, images flung around the place with abandon as the NSA track down the elusive Dean and the tape. And when Dean teams up with Hackman's Brill, we're subject to more laughable high tech jinks.What saves the movie from complete farce is the frantic direction of Tony Scott. When he's engaging in the chase scenes, Scott is constantly employing cuts to observe the characters from different media - above, to the side, below, etc. The whole movie is invested with an extreme degree of urgency at these points which is refreshing, although a tad excessive - Tony Scott camera work comes across like a caffeine overdose of times, never staying still. That aside Scott's enthusiasm pushes the movie along at a pace where you're never bored, and the sheer coolness of satellites swinging above earth, and maps springing up at high speed drags you along while rarely giving you pause to contemplate the sheer idiocy of it all.The acting is grand. I would have said at one stage that Will Smith will never be Oscar material but as he's just been nominated I may have to eat those words. Certainly he's fine here and he gets to show that he can fit in the standard cut-out lead of a movie, in a role that isn't very demanding. Voight has stronger screen presence as he constantly tries to get Smith, and Hackman similarly out-shines Smith due to his veteran stature, but the cast get by with little to complain or praise about.Overall the movie is aptly summarised as "enjoyable nonsense". It will never be a classic because it doesn't have nearly enough of the correct elements. Without Scott's zest the movie would quite likely have fallen apart but, as it stands, we're left with an implausible but above average techno-thriller. 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enemy of the State seems to have much in common thematically with the twisty thriller No Way Out: a high-ranking government official covering up a murder, pursuing the one who knows the truth. However, where No Way Out features uncertainty and subtlety, Tony Scott relies on the tried-and-true companions of Jerry Bruckheimer-produced flicks, namely black-and-white morality and soapbox preaching about same. Instead of Kevin Costner's twice-compromised double agent, we have Will Smith's pure-as-snow lawyer. Instead of Gene Hackman's venial sin blown into gigantic cover-up by a sycophantic aide, we have Jon Voight's unremorseful political murders. Instead of Sean Young's ditz, we have Regina King yelling at the TV about woefully mistaken legislators and their plans to spy on all of America. One's buttons aren't pushed so much as sledge-hammered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith is surprisingly good, in an almost straight role, and Gene Hackman provides amazing support in this average conspiracy thriller. Tony Scott creates a fast paced, exciting story, but it just doesn't quite seem to do the job. The surveillance teams seem more like disorganised techno geeks rather than NSA, and the feeling that all this should be happening outside the normal everyday life just isn't quite reached. The hotel scene in Ronin manages this more than anything in this film. If the story seems fantastical to you, the ending will blow the roof off your belief scale. Saying that, it's not bad entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some great scenes, but some terribly thin ones, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parts were great, parts were really bad. Gene Hackman is always watchable, always magnificent. This movie was no exception-- whenever he was on screen it was a first class thriller. The classic John Voight was also good-- but the problem with him is that he is such a great actor, and he mostly plays villains and profoundly sleazy bad guys. Thus, I hate him him whenever I see him-- but that's great acting!Will Smith is another matter. He is generally likable, and he does his "Aw shucks" with attitude shtick pretty well-- but it only partially fit in in this movie. The attorney and family man persona written for him was largely out of character with the situations. His was a boorish, clumsy, and I thought impolitic (read: stupid) lawyer. His relationship with his wife and kids was fake, slap-dash, and one dimensional. It was inadequately conceived and portrayed; I was genuinely surprised to discover that his character was supposed to have been married to that woman. At first, I just assumed she was just a chick. It was as if the writers stuck that in because they thought the movie should have heart, or whatever. His beef-witted self-absorption and almost fanatical ego-tripping lead to a series of disasters not only for him, but for everyone he comes into contact with. To paraphrase the old saying-- With friends like him, everyone automatically has a ton of enemies.So what's the deal with that? Is Smith a "one note" actor? Nothing wrong with that, just cast the poor guy in appropriate roles. Or is it that the suits in Hollyweird only see him in terms of this hitherto one characterization? If he can do more, someone ought to consider writing up a part for him, as his "'tude- dude" routine is getting tiresome. It worked in Independence Day, and the mighty Men in Black-- but it tanked in the Wild Wild West, and greatly diminished Enemy of the State. There is a scene where Hackman's "Brill" character encounters Smith's confused lawyer for the first time. Hackman makes eye contact with Smith from across the crowded public place, and then silently mouths the two words of a popular expletive containing the "f" word. Dang-- given how obtuse and annoying -- and dangerous -- the Smith character was, I thought Hackman hit the nail on the head! Like Hackman's Brill, I found myself angry at the Smith character rather than sympathetic or concerned.This could have been a classic, or at least a great flick. As it is, it is a jumble of wonderful, intriguing suspense, and crap. Can I say crap? Smith's part made it a "3," Hackman's was an "8.5"-- I gave it a "6."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie lacked any suspense and further Will Smith was not convincing as a lawyer. The only bright spot was Gene Hackman and further was the only reason I rented the video. The film deals with a tape showing the execution of a senator or congressman, which falls into the hands of Will Smith. In typical fashion the bad guys want the tape back because it implicates them. The film tries to add substance by preying on the increasing paranoia which inflicts the American public. Lastly, the second half of the movie was better due to Hackman's almost constant presence. A Hollywood formula picture with poor acting by Will Smith. In conclusion, I do not dislike Will Smith. In fact I enjoyed his performance in "Six Degrees of Separation" (1993).</fullReview>

Clinton couldn't even get that kind of coordination of efforts if he did it.Too long by 20 minutes. Nice equipment used, most of which does however exist and in use today with even better quality devices. Over kill was the demise of this film Jerry. Hackman, great as usual but why Gene? Why this film. You did carry it but not soon enough. And yes, we do have satellites that give much closer and detailed pictures even through clouds. You'll never see any of just how much this movie is true to life, even all the tech stuff and how it is used. "Our" "government" is out there to protect their selves 1st, us 3rd or 4th. Just don't cram it all into a single 2 hour movie. Still, all with most negatives aside, 6-7 out of 10. Watch it once... at someone else's house for free or 99 cents rental tops!

The trials and tribulations he went through after he unknowingly received evidence of "the events" targeted him for the "treatment" at the hands of the NSA cheif stretched belief to close to the breaking point -- it was too similiar to Sandra Bullock's The Net.Additionally, I felt there was too much of a "Cat and Mouse" hunt for him, dragging along for too long during the film's mid-point. If 25 minutes were edited out, the film would have been tighter.The resolution of the film (and the restoration of the lawyer's life) was thanks to a secretive and sharp-witted techie-savoir played by Gene Hackman, was worth the wait, thought the film's middle portion did push it a bit.Best things about the film: Will Smith and Gene Hackman can carry it off.Worst: Pursuit scenes were too drawn out; Technical abilities of U.S. gov't were just too exaggerated (practically picking of the time from a watch from a satellite.</fullReview>

On top of this it was produced by the Bruckheimer/Simpson team, which had not produced a movie that has left me wanting more since this.

Then he says in that favorite higher pitch stressed voice, to no one in particular "I told you I'd get my blender back!"Other than two chase scenes, this is how predictable the entire movie was.Of course Will Smith's acting is as good and dedicated as it usually is and the special effects used are very well done.

		<fullReview>Firstly this was the finest mainstream Hollywood action film of the year, not a great feat considering Godzilla et al, but something to be proud of. The plot managed to be both complicated, and plausible, taking a few nice twists, and Will Smith put in a great performance as the lead. I don't think it's a a big step from his earlier, more comedic turns in Bad Boys and Independence Day, but he's certainly one of the more charismatic of young Hollywood's actors. The direction was pure testosterone from Tony Scott as usual, and can get a little tiresome, but he uses the surveillance cameras and team of watchers well, giving a nice spin on what are fairly conventional chase scenes. It could do with being 20 minutes or so shorter, like most films these days, and Jason Lee dies too early (when will anyone but Kevin Smith give this man the lead role he so clearly deserves?).

		<fullReview>The movie falls completely apart at the end, but before the last ten minutes we have a rootin', tootin' action movie full of technological wizards, chases, shootouts, a hero climbing the face of a hotel in his underwear, a couple of murders, voyeurism, the loner hero's pet cat, and two mismatched protagonists against the National Security Agency, with the FBI as the unwitting good guys this time around. It's the kind of movie in which every vehicle seems sooner or later to explode in a fireball.Now, we have to ask right off the bat about verisimilitude here. The NSA (or, pardon me, what appears to be a "rogue group" within the NSA) murders a senator (Jason Robards) who opposes their plan to surveille everyone in search of terrorists -- or whatever. They have satellites at their disposal that can read your credit card number from 150 miles in space. If they want to know something about you, they don't just plant a bug in your phone. They plant a dozen bugs in your home and one or two tiny cameras as well. They ransack your place and plant transponders in your shoes, your pen, your pants, your belt, and -- well, I lost count.The reason I raise the question of exactly how realistic all this wizardry and chicanery is, is because, as you might know, as this is being written the Executive Branch of the government, it turns out, has been using the super-secret NSA and Special Ops to surveille its own citizens as well as anyone else on the planet, and without resorting to any of that tedious "getting a warrant" business. The Executive Branch has assured us that only "terrorists, terrorist supporters, terrorist groups or similar groups" are targets, and of course we believe it, although I must say I'm awfully glad I'm not Barbra Streisand anyway.The movie was released in 1998 before the 9/11 attacks and, boy, have things changed.The acting is pretty good. Gene Hackman is finally beginning to look his age, and it's about time. Will Smith I didn't find a convincing actor but he certainly looks the part. He seems handsome, energetic, and has ears the size of radar antennae that contribute to the film's considerable comedic element. Jon Voight is good too, as the Congressman who wants to impose surveillance on the country. The movie doesn't treat him cheaply either. He's given a home and a family whose respect and warmth he enjoys. The Special Ops guys working for the NSA aren't your usual ugly pock-faced heavies either. They all look no more than thirty. They're pale, fresh faced, and they dress not in black suits but in sweatshirts, watch caps, and Reeboks. They're physically empowered but they're also able to instigate all kind of high-tech chicanery. And they can trace a phone call from a pay phone in less than a minute.The story isn't very complicated. The MacGuffin is a videotape recording of Robard's murder, which comes into Will Smith's hands. He links up with Hackman and the two of them are on the run for the rest of the movie. I really don't know how accurate the technology is. Maybe it's just somebody's patched-together fantasy. The NSA spy satellite that tracks pedestrians on earth just sends out nothing but a signal in Morse code -- "CQ" -- repeatedly, which only translates as something like, "Is anybody listening"? I doubt that there are any credit card numbers buried in that. I hope the rest of the technology is equally unrealistic, otherwise this movie is much more spooky now than its makers ever intended it to be.</fullReview>

I've been dragged into plenty of the things in my time and not once have they been manned by ridiculously attractive blondes in their underwear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continuity please</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyable film, However, surely the filmmakers not divert some of the huge production costs to ensuring decent continuity within scenes. I could not believe the shoddy scenes where camera shots from behind showed a glass being held then cut to front and glass was not in hand. This shows that the basic elements of making a film bear no relationship to the money spent. This very poor continuity was present throughout the film. Do the director and editor not see this when viewing the film? This shoddy aspect of films seems to be more prevalent these days. It is a shame as it spoils the viewing experience as one can clearly see that multiple takes were knitted to together to make a short scene. Can't simple exchanges be shot in one go?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A question for you all: What following plot do you think is more realistic ?A ) The FBI know the existence of alien beings that have been visiting planet Earth and are keeping a lid on thingsB ) The FBI are cracking down on possible subversivesI`m sure we`d all pick answer B which is the plot for ENEMY OF THE STATE but for some reason THE X-FILES whose plots often revolve around answer A is a show that is far more convincing if not realistic than ENEMY OF THE STATEI do have to admit I`m not into conspiracy theories possibly down to the fact I have no strong politics so the idea of a shadowey government bureau bumping off people who know too much doesn`t really appeal to me especially in the way it`s portrayed here . I blame producer Jerry Bruickheimer myself since the only way a film like this can work is if it`s subtle and Jerry doesn`t do subtle , he does explosions and chashes and shoot outs and loud music and smart one liners . Seriously chaps if you walked into an underwear store and requested to see what sort of lingere was on offer what sort of reaction would you expect to get ? I know the movie is complete fiction but scenes like this detract from the alleged serious tone of the movieAnd a short comment on the cast : Will Smith , Gene Hackman , Jon Voight , Gabriel Byrne , Tom Sizemore , Jason Robards and Jack Black . You`d think with a cast like that this would be a great movie , but the cast are often underused , Sizemore and Robards are only in uncredited cameo roles while Hackman is more or less absent until more than halfway through because the production seems more interested in action rather than character or persausive ideasSo sorry Jerry I didn`t think much of this movie which is a great pity because it might have had some potential and if you think I`m being over critical ask yourself this : Why would INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS be more convincing than a political thriller like ENEMY OF THE STATE ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a dumb little movie with a lot of chase scenes and techno-crap used as filler to gloss over the fact that they have no story, just an idea that never really draws us into the action. The racist stereotyping of Italians was offensive but not distracting.The plot is about the National Security Agency tapping phones and doing cool surveillance tricks. The story is too worn out to even repeat. The Voight character kills a Congressman to get some privacy bill passed but it's caught accidentally on tape and Voight uses about 50 people and untold millions of dollars to get the tape which came into Will's possession. Yada Yada Yada. There is a major mystery thrown in. Why does Will not run over Regina King to get to a willing Lisa Bonet. Regina typecast as the hysterical Buppie wife (Jerry McGuire) has a lingerie scene where she actually looks fat. EEEWWW!John Voight gives a first rate performance as the villain, and Gene Hackman is Gene Hackman. Will Smith is a disaster. This is Will's first "serious" starring role and he's so wooden and predictable the director and writer had to give him some jokes just to help the audience to wake up and pay attention. His excellent comedic timing serves to illuminate the fact that the man has no particular acting ability.Except for Hackman and Voight none of the cast shows any depth or substance. The bad guys were particulary droney.The obligatory techno-geek was the exception giving a first rate impersonation of Oliver Pratt. Guess after paying the Fresh Prince there was nothing left in the vault for the real Oliver Pratt.The first 2/3 of this flic make a Steven Segal movie look like "Gone With The Wind" but just when you're ready to give up hope of any entertainment Gabriel Byrne shows up with a first rate cameo. Then we get Hackman who make the movie come alive. The payoff is excellent and saves me from wasting 2.5 houre of my life.Wait for the video and Have a Nice DayJimmy Bagga Doughnuts</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manic, but little believable plotting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film containing chases and explosions - many and varied - but not much in the way of believable gadgetry.The chases go on far too long and do little to advance the story. To make it worse, the cutting throughout is manic, making it difficult to follow at times. Not that I felt inclined to do so by the second half.In a film built around a technological theme - and the basic story premise, a murder being caught accidentally on camera, is a first class start - it is a must that the technology should be believable. And it isn't.Jokey teenagers playing with digital enhancement, satellite targeting and so on - it just doesn't cut the mustard. Generating 3D imaging from 2D digital imaging - same. There are just too many impossible/improbable things going on to make this even remotely believable. One or two, yes: but the movie is based on such technology and as such has to have at least some basis in fact.A movie very loosely similar in tech themes is "Sneakers". This is a tech comedy, very well engineered and with a plot line that follows logically. "Enemy" doesn't seem to know what genre it falls into - and it shows. Comedy can be effective in lightening a drama, easing the way into the next dramatic scene but this is different: the comedy runs in the background all the time and it just doesn't (dare I say it) compute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outlandish conspiracy thriller; does anything good ever happen in Washington, D.C.?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georgetown attorney Will Smith gets help from conspiracy-expert Gene Hackman after a videotape has been passed to him showing a Washington, D.C. Congressman being ambushed and killed by the Director of Security and his goons. Highly ridiculous Tony Scott-directed thriller with laughably bad dialogue and secondary characters. The overripe screenplay also manages to work in the requisite formula car chases, lots of resident break-ins (with countless close-ups of locks being picked), a sub-plot about Mafiosos, and another story thread about an F.B.I. investigative team who rank as the most incompetent dummies ever seen in a political suspenser. Smith--sticking his jaw out like an offended child--isn't really right for this part, though personally that is to his advantage; whether chasing after a cat or feeding Hackman pretzels after Gene's hand is nearly shot off, this character (as written) is tiresome and foolish. It's nice to see acting veterans Hackman and Jon Voight square off, but the picture is so flabby and brainless it defeats them and everyone else. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enemy of the State</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first couple of times I saw this film I got confused, but seeing it again I can at last make more sense of the story, and appreciate it as a really good conspiracy thriller, from brother of Sir Ridley, director Tony Scott (Crimson Tide, True Romance). Basically Congressman Phillip Hammerson (Jason Robards) is murdered by politician Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) after declining negotiations about a new surveillance systems with satellites. Raynolds doesn't realise it, but the murder was caught on tape by someone, Zavitz (Jason Lee), and on the run he plants the tape on mild-mannered lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith), unknown to him, and soon after, Zavitz is killed. The NSA (National Security Agency), working with Reynolds, are now delving into Dean's life, and not long after he loses his job and wife, Carla (Ray's Regina King). Soon enough though, he realises he is being hunted, after he finds his house trashed, and (after his wife chucks him out for having a fake affair) when trying to check into a hotel, his cards have been cancelled and his case is stolen. With help from contact Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet) (the one the NSA made out he had an affair with), who has contacts with the mafia, he meets her contact, retired NSA agent Edward 'Brill' Lyle (Gene Hackman), who reveals many of his bugs. Dean is now on the run from the NSA, who has also framed him for Rachel's murder, and he does eventually find what they are looking for. He and Brill do eventually decide to help each other, since both seem to be targets, but they do eventually get captured, but don't worry, Dean is clever enough to find ways out of things. Also starring Stuart Wilson as Congressman Albert, Laura Cayouette as Christa Hawkins, Loren Dean as Hicks, Saving Private Ryan's Barry Pepper as Pratt, Harry Potter's Ian Hart as Bingham, Jake Busey as Krug, Scott Caan (son of James) as Jones, Gabriel Byrne as fake Brill, James LeGros as Jerry Miller, Dan Butler as Shaffer, then less known Jack Black as Fiedler, Jamie Kennedy as Jamie, Seth Green as Selby and Saving Private Ryan's Tom Sizemore as Boss Paulie Pintero. Filled with many great chase sequences, near-misses, escapes, conspiracies, and brilliant acting from Smith, Hackman and the supporting cast, this is an unmissable thrill ride. Will Smith was number 51, and Gene Hackman number 42 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

And the laws for terrorists are even harder than the laws they wanted to install in this movie. But who is a terrorist and who is normal? So this movie is getting old very fast. Btw, the acting was not very well although there were excellent actors such as Jon Voight and Gene Hackman in this movie. The acting never got me really and it was not very convincing.

		<shortDescription>Slick, but insulting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The murder a U.S. Senator at the hands of NSA employees is accidentally caught on film. In disk form, this recording ends up in the hands of Wil Smith, who plays the same character he plays in every other of his films, but with a different name. Working using agency resources, but apparently without any accountability, the operatives attempt to retrieve the film, and tie up any loose ends that happen to pop up, including Smith, who finds reluctant help in Gene Hackman's character, a former NSA man himself.One the one hand, this film is an interesting demonstration of how videotape and bugs can be used in investigation. This is the only bonus this film has to offer, save for the capable, but not spectacular, performances by all the players. It was also the source of great insult. First, we are to believe that the opposite side of an object (away from the camera) can be extrapolated from available video. To put it simply, they expect me to believe that they can see a lump in my back pocket by looking at a picture of the front of my body. Second, is it really feasible that a mid-to-upper-level NSA bureaucrat will have helicopters and satellites at his command to manipulate as he sees fit so he can chase down one man without any of his superiors knowing anything? Don't try to rationalize or think of a way. The answer, is NO. It's never even really explained why he should care to have the Senator murdered in the first place except for the passage of a security bill. There was some reference to the fact that he wasn't as high up in the agency as he should have been, but motive was never clear, and I have a difficult time believing he did what he did because he was such a damn fine American who wanted to look out for the rest of us.I understand we're supposed to suspend disbelief, but when it's that belief that is being played upon for the movie to be effective, that rule goes out the window.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining, if ridiculous plot around someone who inadvertently knows something he shouldn't. This leads to a series of exciting chase scenes featuring some 'lucky escapes' for our hero. Throughout it remains difficult to suspend belief. The characters are at best one-dimensional stereotypes. However, the main difficulty is with the Will Smith role. Again he is a black man, thus ignorant of all the technological gadgetry (similar to Men In Black). Essentially, he is cast once more as a 'dude' surviving on his wits. And of course his family is black. Would a mixed race relationship be possible in an American film? Or would that be too offensive to a US audience? After all such relationships do happen (cf Barack Obama's parents). In summary, fun for all the family (provided they all have a mental age of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surveillance, bugging: Is it a question of national security or the right to privacy for every individual? That is the question screenwriter David Marconi and director Tony Scott ask in the action-thriller "Enemy of the State". It would be interesting to watch the pair searching for answers, if the promising basis would not just be used as a peg to hang action and "coolness" on. This topic would be excellent for a dark thriller with tense atmosphere from start to end, but too much "coolness" (sorry for using it again) ruins every connection to the protagonist. There seems to be no need for any kind of character development, once a character is established, that's it. But that seems to be the price we have to pay if we enter the cold world of Jerry Bruckheimer, master for heartless action. Still, Gene Hackman had an interesting part and made the last third quite enjoyable for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me make one thing clear: I don't mind a movie being unrealistic. I love movies that contain science fiction elements, magic and other supernatural stuff.But.This is not a supernatural thriller. It's supposed to be a high tech thriller. It's supposed to show us what could happen to an innocent man who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Simply put - it doesn't do that.Watching it I felt like observing a magician as he puts a rabbit into a hat, only to reveal it a few seconds later shouting 'Ta-daaaaa!'.Apart from several minor plot holes, those are the three things that made me turn away in disgust the most:1) One man accidentally films a crime with a movie camera. The bad guys kill him right away. He sent a copy to a friend of his before he died. The bad guys kill him right away. The friend gave the copy to our hero - Will Smith's character - before he died. The bad guys... What? They try to damage his reputation? Why?!2) When the friend gave the copy to our hero, the scene was caught by a store surveillance camera. This is just a plain, ordinary camera. Yet the bad guys manage to turn the image in some magical way to see what was hidden behind the back of our hero. Some tech indeed.3) Some bad guys disguised as cops try to search our hero's flat. He tells them: 'Not without a search warrant.' Another bad guy listening in on the scene, stroke with awe, says: 'Damn, he's good.' Ahem. An American five year old knows that the police needs a search warrant. Our hero is a lawyer! But... 'Damn, he's good...'Let's see... 8 stars for the story idea and the style of the movie. -2 for the plot. Makes an average of 3. Stills seems a bit too much though...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some SpoilersThis movie has everything one could want in a clichd, improbable, and uninspired "action" thriller. I tried watching this once and turned it off about half way through from sheer lack of interest in the endless chase scenes. I watched it on FX tonight just to see if I could get past the pedantic and worthless opening hour. Despite a second half that does start delivering some interesting dialog between Hackman and Smith, it still lacks any of the tension that makes a movie like say, The Fugitive, work.Serious Problems:1. It breaks the major rule of spy-type thrillers: The hero needs to have some level of intelligence. The protagonist, lawyer Dean, is about as empty-headed as it gets and he's supposed to be a high-priced legal mind! Even my grandmother knows that the local cop can trace a phone call but after personally witnessing that the bad guys are NSA, have killed his ex-girlfriend, planted bugs on his person, etc. etc. etc. HE STILL MAKES A PHONE CALL which is, surprise, surprise, traced. This and countless other really stupid moves by many people including Hackman's Brill character (he leaves his surveillance equipment on so that the bad guys can see that he is leaving his "office") make this movie next to unwatchable.2. The major surveillance methodology in this movie is spy satellites tracking our lawyer. But retasking spy satellites is next to impossible and VERY expensive. They also do not just pan around the landscape. Amazingly, these can.3. Plot contrivances abound. Just like in the TV show ALIAS, the writer feels a need to advance the story by having the main characters do stupid things so that they can be in danger again so that another chase scene can ensue.All in all, this is one of the most boring "fastest paced" movies ever made.3 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not in the same league as All the Presidents Men or the even finer 70s paranoia classic The Conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I hate doing this at Christmas." (Jon Voight as Thomas Brian Reynolds, NSA)'This' pertains to murder, fraud and general evil doings against a gamut of innocents at, worst of all, the festive season. Umm, sounds vaguely familiar, nay pertinent, given recent world events.Being a Simpson/Bruckheimer production you know this isn't going to be a gradual, thoughtful exposition of American mores. No, this is a loud and crushingly obvious exercise in conspiracy shenanigans. This is not in the same league as All the Presidents Men or the even finer 70s paranoia classic The Conversation. Yet, in times riddled with postmodernism, there are a plethora of direct references to these seminal films.Jason Robards (star of All The Presidents Men) bites the dust courtesy of one of Voight's wicked charges, David Pratt (played by Barry Pepper, so good as a religious psychopath in Saving Private Ryan). Unfortunately, for the high echelon bad guys a bird watcher has inexcusably videoed the gruesome scene at the lake (De Palma's Blow Out anyone). Said 'twitcher' is chased around the streets of Baltimore (care of some super-duper satellite technology) until he careers into an old Georgetown mate, in mid-chase, in a lingerie store. The friend is top lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) and he's busy trying to spice up his marriage. Are you still with me?Essentially, this is all about privacy and people's lack of it. As Voight's' bog-standard bad guy makes abundantly clear, "Privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it. The only privacy left is inside of your head. You think we're the end of democracy? I think we're democracy's last hope."The crux of the tale centres on the deterioration - he's bugged (mainly by teenage geeks who munch crisps and act like their monitoring a soap opera), battered, fired and on the edge of divorce - of Dean's privileged life, but for film fanatics the real pleasure is in Gene Hackman. He plays Brill, an ex-NSA agent and a dead ringer for the 'bugman' in The Conversation. In fact, a photo of him from Coppola's masterpiece is surreptitiously added to the action and there is a surveillance scene in a Washington park that mirrors the 70s film completely - beggars with mikes in their newspaper, a married man talking to a secret love. Tony Scott (True Romance director) has been excessively referential, but fun.Ultimately, this lacks the same wit or chemistry of Con Air and The Rock, but it possesses energy and clever gimmickry. Silly, but watchable.</fullReview>
