		<shortDescription>Do You Know Those People Across The Street?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to what you may think initially, nothing happens by coincidence on `Arlington Road.' Outstanding performances by Jeff Bridges (As Michael Faraday) and Tim Robbins (Oliver Lang) highlight this taut thriller about terrorism in America, a disturbing film instilled with a sense of loss, fear and paranoia. Director Mark Pellington perhaps does not mine this vein to the depths, but there is still a silver lining in this movie, which contains elements of two of Alfred Hitchcock's classics, `The Man Who Knew Too Much,' and `North By Northwest.' Had this film been made forty years ago, in fact, Hitchcock would have been at the helm and we would have had James Stewart instead of Bridges and Richard Widmark in place of Robbins. When Jeff Bridges stars in a thriller, you can usually bet that the project is going to be a cut above the average fare of the genre, and this one is no exception, arguably his best of it's kind since `Jagged Edge.' This is a riveting film, and the tension builds steadily throughout as we uncover, along with Faraday, the dark secrets which ultimately lead to an explosive climax. The excellent supporting cast includes Joan Cusack, Hope Davis and Robert Gossett. A trip to `Arlington Road' is a jolt to the senses and may cause you to stop and rethink a few things about your life. At the very least, you're going to want to finally meet that neighbor who moved in across the street last year. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but resonant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like every year, there's one or two films which are far from perfect but nonetheless shake us up in ways better films don't quite do. Last year, it was BULWORTH, and this year, it's ARLINGTON ROAD. Obviously, after all that's happened this decade in America, from Waco to Oklahoma City, the time is ripe for a movie to explore the cracks in the American dream which brought about events like those. This film ultimately asks more questions than it answers, but that may just be a condition inherent to this type of film. More troubling is two things: (1) Though I agree with those(and I'll try not to give away too much here) who theorize the ending changes the whole perspective of the film, there are still too many key narrative cheats(a conversation Robbins supposedly had with Bridges' son seems unbelievable, and the traffic light scene near the end also is) to make it fully effective; (2) The film seems a little confused of what it's about; it is a study of one man's psyche, or the nation's?Still, ARLINGTON ROAD shouldn't be dismissed. There are troubling questions explored, and you don't have to be a conspiracy nut to believe those so-called "fringe" hate groups are entering the mainstream at a frightening rate for a so-called "civilized" society. The ending is also powerful, and though I understand it, more than anything else, was responsible for the delays, I applaud whoever was in charge for not changing it(though again, how they got there is another story). Bridges' performance is another thing which makes more sense once you look back with the ending of the film in mind, and it doesn't seem like over-acting. Robbins is a little more problematic; there are scenes where he's convincing, and then scenes where he goes over-the-top and shouldn't. Hope Davis doesn't have a big part, but she injects a lot into it as usual. But the biggest surprise here is Joan Cusack. Anyone who thinks of her only as a (good)comic actress will be in for a shock; there's one scene involving her which is the scariest in the film.Again, ultimately, while it leaves you with nagging doubts about the quality, ARLINGTON ROAD makes you think enough to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "how to" on making a good thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Arlington Road" is the perfect example for how thrillers should be made.A good story, a good atmosphere, good actors and voila! you have got a good thriller. "Arlington Road" has got it all and it's a near perfect movie that is a must see for the thriller fans.The intense beginning sets the mood for the rest of the movie. It's atmospheric and tense right till the good ending. I'll admit that there are some slow moments and some distracting plot lines but it doesn't take away the tension or ruins the atmosphere in any kind of way.The movie is very well casted with Jeff Bridges as the more and more paranoid getting Michael Faraday and Tim Robbins as his neighbour that he begins to suspects of being a terrorist. Both main actors pull of really well and help to created the good thriller atmosphere that this movie has.Good thriller with a great atmosphere, story, actors and ending that will stay with you forever.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bridges plays the same character as always, but fits nicely into this part. Robbins plays a very back stage part for most of the film, the main concentration is on the small minded paranoia of Bridges. Brilliant film which brings home some harsh, hard truths about American society and security. An interesting storyline, which excels beyond the average Hollywood thriller, the typical guessing game of the goodies and baddies plays a secondary role to the real story. A uniquely intelligent terrorist thriller from Hollywood. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard core, High Octane thriller with a terrible, disturbing ending. ***1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ARLINGTON ROAD (1999) ***1/2Starring: Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis, Mason Gamble, and Robert Gossett Director: Mark Pellington 117 minutes Rated R (for intense violent content and some language) By Blake French: "Arlington Road" is this year's "Breakdown." It's filled to the rim with hard core, high octane tension and suspense-so much that it is almost hard to catch your breath throughout the movie's running period. Fueled with first rate performances and a script that is understandable and clear, this may be one of the best thrillers. The movie starts off with a boy, named Brady Lang, who stumbles down Arlington Rd. with blood dripping from his body. Jeff Bridges, who plays Michael Faraday, a single professor who teachers a course on terrorism at a local university, observes this terrified and injured child from inside his car as he drives by. After realizing the nature of his wounds, he dashes out of his car to help. Michael rushes Brady to the nearest hospital, in result he saves his life and meets some people whom he will soon wish he would have never laid eyes on. Wow. What an exhilarating opening scene. While it may be a little over the top, it does provide the setup needed for such the brutal, bloodthirsty film this really is. It is not a film for younger viewers, and I would check into it some more if you're faint of heart or squeamish in any way. This movie takes itself seriously for every second of the way, unlike many other "scary" movies out there today.Brady Lang belongs to a new family down the block from the Faraday's, consisting of Oliver, the friendly dad, Cheryl, almost eccentric wife, and their children, who are very bizarre acting. Quiet and suspicious, almost as if they are holding something back. When Michael and his girlfriend, Brooke, meet the Lang's, they introduce them to his son, ask them over for dinner sometime, and look around their new house. Oliver is an architect currently working on a shopping mall somewhere out of town. But wait! When Michael was over there last he saw the blueprint to his "so called" mall, and knows that this is no mall he his constructing. This makes Michael very wearily of his neighbors, especially when he beholds Oliver's mail and discovers that there may have been a name change sometime ago in Lang's past. He brings these things to the attention to Brooke, only to have her call him paranoid and that his occupation is getting to his head. That is also what his old buddy, FBI Agent Whit Carver, says to him when Michael asks him to do a background check on Oliver.Things really heat up when Michael discovers the truth behind his friendly neighbor's secret identity. Movie posters and newspaper ads suggest it. Previews and reviews reveal it, and by the time the film takes an unexpected turn in the third act, the only one suspecting Oliver Lang to be just an ordinary person is Michael. "Arlington Road" is smart enough to develop Jeff Bridge's character with feelings, flashbacks and an emotional past, rather than showing us the details of his past marriage. It is also smart enough not to develop a romantic subplot between Michael and Brooke, beyond the suggestions and interest in each other. It stays on track every inch of the way; all the scenes further the plot a little bit at a time. Leading us with a perfectly structured, flawlessly planned out thriller. The performance by Jeff Bridges is so great and certainly Oscar worthy we actually buy into the paranoia plot and end up caring about him so much this movie's ending actually hurts to watch. It ruins the entire production. The last twenty minutes of this movie arrant just unbelievable, but the closing scene features a sense of injustice, unfairness, and is unsettling beyond comprehension. All of this and I still have not revealed the actually end to you, and will not. But I hated it, and think the majority of an audience will join me in saying as the closing credits arouse on screen their jaw dropped off their face and hit the floor. However, I do think the film is unconventional because of the thematic structure it used for its closing and subject madder. If it would have concluded in a predictable, usual fashioned people would complain about that too. It proves how much we care about the characters. And at the same time allows us to realize that this film deserved better, somewhere down the road, it deserved to be much better. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW******** ******DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!********In real life, successful plans (especially military ones) allow for things going wrong, things not happening in the right order, unexpected events and unreliable information. The 'Fog of War' is a major factor in any situation, even with today's technologies. Clever plans have a great amount of tolerance built-in, so they can be changed to fit current circumstances as parts of them succeed or fail, especially when you have little direct control over the situation.Not so for Robbins' character's terrorists.- Bridges' character beats up Robbins' badly enough so he feels comfortable leaving him alone but not so badly that he's unconscious. This is all part of the plan, we find out. How could Robbins' character rely on not being either restrained, knocked out, taken to the police or even killed by Bridges' character?- Bridges' character spends just long enough fighting Robbins' for a bomb to be securely planted in his car, but is in a hurry enough to leave a live and unrestrained Robbins. How could Robbins' character possibly plan for this?- Bridges' character, a civilian academic in a disturbed state of mind, has enough stunt driving skills to speed through acres of pedestrians in the middle of rush hour, so that he'll just see the noon delivery van disappearing into the FBI building. If he misses the van or arrives before it, or if the van itself isn't on time, the bomb won't get into the building.- In real life he would have wrecked the car (and maybe damaged or set off the bomb) or been stopped by the police before he was a quarter of the way to the FBI building.- What if Bridges had parked his car outside and gone in the building by foot?- Bridges character HAS ALREADY PHONED the FBI building to warn them about the bomb BEFORE he sets out. Why didn't Robbins' terrorists break his mobile phone when they planted the bomb in his car?- Why didn't the FBI building close its gates after the warning? Surely they would have at least stopped the white delivery van Bridges' character specifically tells his Agent friend to investigate.- Why the heck is Robbins' character trying to convince the world it's the work of a crazy individual anyway? How does that draw attention to or advance his cause?- Worst of all, why does Robbins' character embark on an elaborate six month charade of dinner parties, psychological warfare, deliberately injured children, campsite kidnappings, faked car crashes, hidden blueprints, hostage taking, phone tapping, name changes, car exchanges, etc etc? All he has to do is deliver a briefcase sized bomb fifty yards past a small checkpoint. Couldn't he have driven it himself? Couldn't he have abandoned a parked car just outside the building with a larger bomb in it instead?No one would ever devise a plot anything like Arlington Road except a thriller writer desperate to keep the viewer amused.This is why the film should never have been made, because it wraps a brainless mediocre piece of entertainment in the bodies of the 149 adults and 19 children who died in the Oklahoma massacre. It is exploiting a recent real-life atrocity purely for the sake of making money and selling videos. Death = $$$$.It's obscene, and worst of all some people will think this is how terrorists operate in real life. Real terrorists leave arabic flight manuals in hire cars and tell instructors they're not interested in how to land an aircraft, but still manage to kill 3000 people in one day. That's what's really frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, this was one overrated movie. Found it hard to watch, and I have to include SPOILERS to say way. From the camera moves to the music to the acting, this thing was so O!V!E!R!D!O!N!E! I couldn't stand it. Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors, but here he's such an over the top loon that I had no sympathy for him. And I never bought that his discovery of the plot started when he saw a small part of a blueprint that's hidden under stuff on a kitchen table! He saw this for what, 4 seconds? And didn't it bug anybody that the bad guys showed up at such convenient times, as if they had ESP? Jeff reads microfilm about Tim in a library, and voila, Tim is at the library looking over Jeff's shoulder! Jeff reads Tim's old yearbook then falls asleep, and voila, he wakes up and Tim is there! Jeff's girlfriend is at some anonymous mall out in the middle of nowhere, spilling her guts to his answering machine about bad guy Tim, and voila, she turns around and Tim's wife is there! It's these logic problems and the over the top style that make this film unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this twice, and despite its many flaws, I thought this movie was dynamite. This movie has the most effective opening sequence ever. The pulsating techno score, the giddy camerawork, if this movie didn't have that opening, I would have given Arlington Road a 7 instead of a 8.5. The movie had excellent, if sometimes overracted performances, particularly from Jeff Bridges, but I'll give special mention to Joan Cusack, her performance was chilling. Tim Robbins, was disappointing. He doesn't cut it as the villain. He was excellent in Jacob's Ladder, but here doesn't make the grade. The script faltered sometimes, towards the end (But not the ending), because it grew a bit confusing. However the dialogue was excellent and always realistic. The direction was outstanding. I could see no flaw in the direction. The cinematography was also excellent, the editing, too. And the music, just fabulous. I'd like to discuss the ending. After seeing the commercial for this movie and reading the reviews, I knew there was going to be a big, surprise ending. Then how come I predicted the ending to occur?But in a movie like this it didn't matter. Just sit back, and enjoy this for the acting, direction, music and cinematography. And if you don't predict it, the ending will be a big, satisfying surprise for you. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

I hardly ever say that a movie was a waste of my time, but this time there is nothing else I can do: Arlington Road is a complete waste of anyones time!!SPOILERS: It's the intention of Oliver Lang, that Michael Farraday will go to the pay phone, sees the truck, realizes that this truck has got something to do with his son, follows the truck, DOES NOT GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE DURING HIS CHASE (!), sees his son, gets away from his car, goes back to his car, knows where the bombing will take place, IS ABLE TO GET IN THE BUILDING (!)(despite the fact that this is a highly guarded building, and that Farraday doesn't have permission to enter it). Every one of these actions could NOT have been predicted this accurate. And these are just a very few of the many, many unbelievable things in this movie.</fullReview>

The only surprise ending for me was how bad a movie can possibly be at the end. I understand that its "just a movie" but I do like for things to be plausible. After putting up with a whole movie that was just an elongation of things I seen in clips, the ending is the most implausible, no impossible, thing that could be. I am not going to break the prime directive of not giving a "spoiler" but if you are stupid enough to go to this worthless flick, just watch the events that occur at the end very carefully and then you decide if they could possibly have happened that way!

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller ? good paranoia and good ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professor Faraday teaches on terrorism and FBI tactics in Washington, despite losing his wife in a blundered FBI raid on suspected terrorists. When new neighbours move in next door he begins to suspect that the husband Oliver Lang has a double life and may be part of an internal terrorist movement. However as he looks into Lang's past the evidence seems to lead nowhere ? is he just being paranoid?This starts well. It feeds off the US paranoia that has arisen from the fact that they are as likely to be attacked from within as they are from external agents. That said we are really not sure if Lang has a past or if Faraday is just paranoid. This tension is good right up till the lines are drawn in the sand and goodies and baddies are identified. At this point it becomes a more traditional cat and mouse thriller ? but even then it is better than most of the same ilk. The tension builds to a great ending whose only fault is dragging it's point out over a few minutes.Bridges is great as the crumbling Faraday ? he sometimes get a little bug-eye crazy at times but overall he works very well. Robbins is also good for the most part ? his average Joe with bite act is good and his ruthless terrorist (maybe!) has some genuine menace about it. However outside of the main two I can't say anyone caught my eye in particular.- but they were all good nevertheless.Overall this is a superior thriller that trades off USA fear of internal terrorism. The plot may be a little too neat at times, but the ending is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Washington, Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is coming home in the suburb and he sees the son of his neighbor, Brady Lang (Gamble Mason), burnt and wounded walking through the Arlington Road. He goes to the hospital with the child and befriends his neighbors Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack) that live in front of his house in the waiting room. The widower Michael is history professor at George Washington University, where he presently teaches terrorism, and raises his son Grant Faraday (Spencer Treat Clark) alone since the death is his beloved wife Leah. She was an FBI agent that died in action during an assignment with her partner Whit Carver (Robert Gossett). Now Michael is in a relationship with his former student Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis). Soon Michael suspects of Oliver might be a terrorist initially based on a blueprint that his neighbor tells that it is a shopping mall but Michael believes it is a building and with returned correspondences in the mailbox. However his theory of conspiracy is rejected by Whit and Brooke. Michael becomes obsessed and investigates the life of his neighbor. Is Michael paranoid or is he correct in his suspicious? "Arlington Road" is an excellent scary thriller with a well written screenplay. The outstanding cast is supported by excellent lines and a great story of obsession. The conclusion is not predictable and the film has not aged after these years. On the contrary, the theme is absolutely updated. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Suspeito da Rua Arlington" ("The Suspect from Arlington Road")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ending....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...... But getting there is a bumpy road. It might be easier to dismiss this plot as simply a paranoid fantasy had something like this not actually happened. Though the movie refers to an incident in St. Louis where a federal building was bombed, it clearly is based on the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City. And its up to Jeff Bridges to prevent another such incident in Arlington Road. Bridges plays a history professor at George Washington University who specializes in acts of domestic terrorism. In fact, his wife was an FBI agent killed in a botched raid on a separatist farm three years earlier. Now, a new family in his suburban neighborhood seems to have a lot of things they are hiding. The father has changed his identity and had once tried to blow up a government agency with a pipe bomb. He claims to be an architect for structures like malls, but he has all kinds of schematics in his home he will not allow anyone to see. Their oldest child almost blows his arm off with an explosive device. They lived in St. Louis when the previous bombing took place etc, etc etc. Does the family across the street have a future bombing on their agenda now that they live in the Washington D.C. area???I can appreciate the acting, directing, and pacing of this film. It has a good cast and great production values. And the conclusion was well thought out and very, very clever. But there are just too many silly scenes and coincidences that the entire plot is built on. If you apply logic to even a couple of them, then this plot could not get from A to B. How big of a coincidence is it that Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack (the bad guys) end up moving right across the street from someone who so perfectly fits the kind of man they wish to frame? How does Bridges's grad student girlfriend just happen to be on the exact same level of the exact same shopping mall at the EXACT same time as Robbins so she can witness him up to no good? Not possible. No way. Awfully convenient that someone always seems to sneak up behind Bridges or his girlfriend just as they are about to discover something or say something important. And of course the soundtrack always provides a sharp dose strings and horns as they do. I think Ebert refers to these as "stings". And how could so much of the bombing plot be left to the actions of someone not knowingly involved in it? Would this terrorist organization really hinge everything on Bridges being able to drive his damaged vehicle through heavy security and into the targeted building? And why does Bridges's cell phone connection with his FBI friend just happen to disconnect at a time when he could logically explain everything and prevent the attack. Oh, hell. The ending is really cool, at least. The entire film is a good time capsule from a point when Americans were most frightened by domestic enemies. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This incredible, paranoiac, pseudo drama demands the viewer to have paid for his popcorn with his brain.The story also requires a combination of incredible coincidence and a truly paranoid sense of an enemy's (whosoever it may be) cunning, perfection, and evil to succeed.The ending is neither spellbinding, gripping, nor cleverly constructed. The chase was pedestrian and agonizing. I wish I could discuss the ending in more detail but afterwards I suggest that the viewer, if one is foolish enough to waste one's money in attending or time in staying to the end, stop and realize all the coincidences that were necessary for the plot to have resulted in the end result---all of the incredible machinations that had to take place. And that means it started at the beginning; if so, what was all that nonsense at the end about?If ashes or skeletons can vomit, Hitchcock will be vomiting in his grave at the comments by some that there is any suspense or that the twist requires anything less than absolute gullibility of the audience to succeed.I do not usually comment--especially negatively--but I was angered by the insult to intelligence and good taste that this movie was.It was a profoundly silly plot; the acting was wasted. The politics idiotic; the moralizing, unbelievable. This was a made-for-TV piece of junk which for some unknown reason has been expanded to the big screen. What a waste!!!!

What I found, basically, was an interesting thriller with good suspense and good clever twists at the end. It was nicely filmed, too, and I liked the lower-key atmosphere in here.Another pleasant surprise was Joan Cusack, who was very effective as Robbins' creepy wife. If you're paranoid, you should like this story. I owned the DVD and traded it, but would like to see it again.

		<shortDescription>This movie seriously messes with your head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot to say about this movie that I really do not want to say least I give away the plot. As such I will warn you now that if you don't want the movie spoilt then please stop reading now. In a way though, the way this great movie has been crafted, the ending is obvious, but in another way, the surprise that comes out at the end will leave you stunned. Arlington Road is in essence a tragedy. It is described as a thriller, and the one liner on the cover is "fear thy neighbour". What this movie does is that it creates a horrifying aspect in the safety of the local neighbourhood, and the ending leaves us shocked and insecure. In fact, the whole idea is brought up in the discussions that the main character has with his class of Terrorism. The movie opens with a boy staggering down the road and our tragic hero finding him and taking him to the hospital. Through this act of kindness, he discovers his neighbours from across the road, and though everything seems fine at the beginning, he starts to discover things that don't add up. Namely that he claims to have never been out east, yet he receives letters from the Pennsylvania State University. As his suspicions and his paranoia rise, he begins to dig deeper to find out the secrets that this man, Oliver Lang, is hiding. The more he digs, the more he discovers, but the more we want him to simply pull out. In fact his obsession not only drives Lang away, but also his girlfriend, his kid, and finally the rest of society. It is not that he is wrong, his suspicions are all correct, it is just that he his digging into something so deep and involved that he, as one person, has no power to stop it, and the evidence is so circumstantial that nobody will believe him. In the end, he ends up causing the thing that he is trying to stop. As I said before, this movie has all of the hall marks of a tragedy. The main character's fatal flaw is his obsession in exposing the truth behind Oliver Land, and it is an obsession that ends up driving everybody away, and finally destroy him completely. As such I found that this movie was very well executed in that we could see that he was doing things that we, as viewers, felt uncomfortable watching for we knew that he would end up hurting himself, even though he might be right. I guess the question that we are left with, was he simply somebody that stumbled on the plot which they had to remove, or was he being groomed for the position right from the beginning? Either way, they executed their plan brilliantly by not only using somebody who was unconnected in the plot to do it, but somebody that was actively against them. As such, not only do they rid themselves of a potential enemy, all of the blame turns on him as he was the one become more and more weird in the last days of his life over apparently meaningless accusations towards innocent people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very engaging and suspenseful thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a university professor who becomes convinced that his neighbour is a terrorist. He starts snooping around, uncovers secrets and thereby unleashing a chain reaction.A thriller relies on a great story to keep viewers engaged, and "Arlington Road" has that great story. The plot is suspenseful and well thought out, it makes me concentrated on the story to unravel. The unexpected ending is very good, as it brings a lot of parallel to events before, especially the father-son relationship. The ending leaves a lot unsaid, which makes room for viewers to think about the ramifications caused by this twist of events. "Arlington Road" a well made thriller, I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unpredictable thriller which I can't believe I've never seen or heard of until recently. Very refreshing, builds up the tension gradually becoming more engaging within each new scene. I could never guess where this film was going. Bridges and Robbins own their roles, and Bridges is by far the strongest. I had a problem with Hope Davis - her character is either mentally retarded, or very very stupid. Maybe both. Direction and writing are tight, working harmoniously to serve us the goods - and we do get them, specifically in the last act. I would go as far as adding the "twist" to the greatest lists, which include Se7en in that slot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will the Summer Never End?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realise that Summer is a time for films with plots that require little thought and lots of action. I realise that the acting is not supposed to be paramount to the special effects. But the quality of movies keeps on deteriorating, and i don't know how much longer i can take it. When two of my favourite actors--Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins--go out and make a brainless action movie about undercover terrorists, i have to wonder if they've lost their agents, or if they're now in it only for the money.Tim Robbins seems to be doing his best impression of a Stepford husband, with his painted smile, psychotic eyes, and a phony voice that repeatedly says, "come on, buddy, trust me, i'm not a terrorist, i'm just the guy next door." Wink, wink! to the audience. We know what's really going on! But we don't care.Sure, Jeff Bridges is paranoid, but he obviously should be, because his Norman Bates-neighbour is killing his friends, loved ones, and bombing major government buildings.If i could come up with a more contrived story with two-dimensional characters, they could never be as lame as what the makers of Arlington Road have come up with. I think they would have been better off throwing Freddy Krueger into the story, and making Nightmare on Elm Street, Part XIII, where the folks of Elm Street all move to Arlington Road. At least, then, i could forgive them for making a Stupid movie.I suppose i'll have to wait until December 31st for all the good movies to come out, just as i had to do last year, so that all the films could be re-membered for the Academy Awards. Arlington Road should not only be overlooked by the Academy but by every movie-goer out there. See something with more quality, like "South Park."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this isn't your normal film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that everyone is complaining about the ending? If you think this ending is the worst ever, give me your tape, and start watching your 8-year-old's tapes of Disney.If you liked it, see keywords "twist-in-the-end' and look for others like Jacob's Ladder (hey, more Tim Robbins). Ok, the ending issue is over, here's the review."Arlington Road" is not for Disney fans, easily churnable stomachs, or children under 10. (Hence it's R rating.) Jeff Bridges is Michael Faraday, a teacher that teaches terrorism. His new neighbors, Jeff Bridges and Joan Cusack, are normal people. TOO normal. People don't believe Michael, but he is starting to suspect that his neighbors are terrorists. Not even his friend, who works for the FBI (I think, I've seen it once and it was 1999 or 2000 so excuse me if info is wrong), or his girlfriend will believe him.I love films that twist when you think you know them, and this is one of them. The twist involving his girlfriend is just chilling. I said the end thing is over, and it's been resurrected. When a film dares to do what this does, you have to wonder what will happen. I didn't predict this one (mainly because I didn't know). Because of that, I'm surprised because this one had no clue (SPOILER ALERT). When a bomb is planted in your trunk, you try to get out, but Michael didn't know. You feel a churning in your stomach when he dies. You feel sad. (THE SPOILER IS GONE) This is no sugary, Hollywood-esque, happy ending. (Strange comment for twist: Yay? I like twists.)) Don't try predictions. This twist must have taken forever to come up with. Bottom line: See this, but you must be 11 or older.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I have just returned home from seeing "Arlington Road". We both were so upset by the movie that I felt that I needed to communicate our feelings.We are frequent movie goers who are in our mid fifties. We certainly are not prudes when it comes to our selection of entertainment. We almost always pick an action or drama film and are used to not always coming away from a film feeling good.However, this movie today was very disturbing to us. In light of the problems with real life violence these days , we certainly did not need to watch what happened in this film. I realize that we could have walked out when we felt uncomfortable, but as I said, we like action and drama. The way the film ended was what truly disturbed us. The fact that the "bad guys" won and the truth was not told was tragic way to leave the film.We saw this movie as encouragement for all of those "nuts" out there watching it. They could see this and feel that they could also get away with such an evil deed. We are very disappointed that Jeff Bridges would have performed in a movie with such an outcome.I am sure that there were many other people in the theater who felt the same way that we do but would not take the time to voice their opinions.I am sure that my writing this letter will have absolutely no effect on what is chosen for the big screen but I sure feel better for writing it!Nancy Marschak Santa Barbara, CA</fullReview>

The characters have no depth to them, the "hero" evidently has little common sense, the "villains" are flat and undeveloped, the plot is canned melodrama, and the best thing about the movie is its ridiculous ending. Sadly, there is nothing unique about this film; it feels like a quick ABC movie rushed out after the Oklahoma bombing or Ruby Ridge--except the filmmaker had several years to develop it. "Arlington Road" is the film equivalent of a paperback book in the checkout aisle. If a viewer wants impact, watch "Waco: The Rules of Engagement."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>some spoilers aheadA brilliantly acted, well written, fast paced movie about a paranoid college teacher who's subject is terrorism.Many people hated the movie because of the ending. But in truth, it was the only way to end this movie truthfullly, according to the events leading up to the climax. We already learned about the previous bombing arranged by the terrorists--the fbi blamed it on one man--the wrong man. It was all part of a pattern, but a pattern realized by the main character minutes too late. And so, if you rewatch the movie again, you'll notice the hints toward the ending.Besides the ending, it's truly a great film, with action and psycology that gives you that wonderful feeling that "there's no way out of this", much like other horror and suspence classics. and in truth there wasn't, but we didn't want to believe it.the movie subtly hints subplots without boringly explaining them. We only see a brief flashback of Bridges' wife, but that combined with his speech to his class and other dialogue throughout the movie, we feel we know everything about their relationship. we also feel the stuggle in Bridges' new relationship with Brooke. the growing love of grant towards his neighbors and his lack of communication with his father is also added into the mix, as well as the strange behavior of Tim and Joan's children.from the beginning to the end, this movie is filled with twists that we truly don't see coming at all.</fullReview>

The whole impression of a film depends on how it ends, and the way everything falls into place in this one is pure diabolical delight.Joan Cusack's surprisingly subtle portrayal of the apparently ordinary housewife with an edge is perfect and lends the film its particular atmosphere: apart from the few moments of obvious violence, it lives from the general feeling of something evil beneath a surface of normalcy. You may be able to eventually put your finger on what it is you find disturbing. But, you know, you can't prove anything...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An engaging if slightly melodramatic thriller, distinguished by the bravery of its shockingly downbeat ending. Kruger's thematically strong and neatly structured screenplay doesn't pull any punches with its climax and denouement, and that's just the way it has to be. That's the whole point of this story. I'm astonished so many reviewers criticize it. Does every film have to leave you with a warm and fuzzy glow? Can't a movie actually be ABOUT something important? Of course it can, and that sometimes means the viewer has to take a pretty solid kick in the guts. Congratulations to Kruger and Pellington for having the nerve to go through with it, and to those who bankrolled it. And shame on an audience who, in the same year, spent almost five times as much on tickets to "Wild Wild West." For the love of God, America: movies don't have to be as sweet as the candy you buy on the way in. Wake up to yourselves before it's too late.</fullReview>

Additionally, he is overemotional to the point of childishness.He is looking for someone to blame, a scapegoat, for his wife's death in her line of duty and decides that that blame can be shifted to all terrorists or whom he believes are or could be terrorists and the FBI. Additionally, he takes his states of overemotionality out on his college level students in a self-centered and self-obsessed manner; not teaching what they signed up to learn in the class but teaching about his own feelings.Via his dysfunctional state of consciousness, he literally attracts in a real terrorist.

I want to empathise with the characters and situations - imagine myself in the same position, etc..The ending certainly shocked me, to the point that I re-wound the tape to watch it again immediately - not believing it would be served up by Hollywood.However, congratulations to the Producer/Director, etc., for allowing it to happen. It pricks your consciousness and has a massive impact.Why would you want a sugar coated ending. People who enjoy such endings really don't understand the film they watch. Take Jaws/Jurassic Park/Star Wars for example - happy ending, but how many people died on the way? You can't dismiss the whole premise of a film by making the sun shine on everyone at the end.Apart from that I really enjoyed the whole intrigue of the film. So what if there are a couple of coincidences - a number of them are possibly there on purpose. By ensuring Faraday's girlfriend sees him in the car park Robbins' character enhances the conspiracy around him. Culminating in Faraday acting in the way he did and Robbins coming out squeeky clean to continue his menace.Robbins is seen luring Faraday to his fate time and again - perhaps!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very unpredictable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review might contain SPOILERS, read at your own risk.In 'Arlington Road' Michael Faraday, a professor teaching terrorism begins to suspect that his neighbor, Oliver Lang, might be a terrorist.First of all, anyone who claims that the ending was predictable is lying. If you could predict the ending of this movie, I'm afraid no movie will ever surprise you (except ones with impossible endings). I also don't understand, if a movie has a conventional ending, why does everyone complain about how it's typical Hollywood and that they never make anything original, and when a movie with an unconventional ending comes around, people are complaining (again) that they want happy endings and such... Isn't a happy ending more predictable?Secondly, as some reviewers wrote earlier, there are many coincidences in the movie: usually it's one person looking for information on another person, who just happens to show up. For example, why did Oliver go to Michael's office, when he (Michael) was looking at those newspaper articles ? I've also seen many movies with the main character conducting a private investigation, it has been an overused concept. Speaking of overused concepts, why doesn't the police EVER show up during chase scenes?Someone brought up a good point in an earlier review, asking what kind of backup plan did the terrorists have in case Michael doesn't make it to the building? I thought most car chases do end in crashes...'Arlington Road' definitely has an uncomfortable feel to it; that was the intention of the makers of the movie. It's also very unpredictable, keeping the viewers glued to their seats (unless they have a very short attention span). The acting was good in my opinion, especially the tense dialogues between the two families in the first half of the movie.GOOD: The movie has a very unpredictable storyline, the acting is mostly good. The whole movie is very complex and everything neatly falls into place at the end.BAD: Everything goes as planned for the terrorists, too many coincidences and occasional stupidity from the main (good) characters.RATING: 7/10</fullReview>

With its riveting cast, it is astonishing to see how Oscar nominations weren't handed to these great actors. Jeff Bridges is spectacular as a rightfully paranoid professor of his neighbors, who are suspected bombers while Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins combine to make a successfully creepy couple. An exceptional cast and intelligent as well as brilliant story make "AR" one of 1999's greatest and most-underappreciated movies. 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since "Se7en" has a film come along that I can remember being so disturbing. Right from the opening sequence, director Mark Pellington pulls you in and doesn't let you relax for the entire running time.The cast is superb, bar none. Standouts being Robbins and Cusack as the Farradays neighbours. Particularly Cusack, never have I seen a smile and outwardly sunny personality presented so chillingly. It's a compliment to her as an actress that she's good for a few scares even when nothing else is happening on screen. Robbins is cast against type as the villain. Please, Hollywood, do this more often! He too shines in the role.(SPOILERS FROM HEREON.)The film does a good job of allowing us to relate to all of the characters, even the Langs are never passed off as one dimensional villains who don't have a life. Indeed, part of the film's chilling realism is in showing us that people like these do behave normally, they just happen to hold and propagate some very extreme and unpalatable views. As a result of the fact that we grow to like Michael Farraday's character, scenes that could and perhaps DID slip into formula still work, retaining the edgy feel that's present throughout the film. In particular here I'm talking about Farraday being 'discovered' numerous times as he searches for more information. Bridges also deserves credit for portraying realistic paranoia without slipping into histrionics.Yes, the ending is somewhat implausible, asking us to take for granted too many coincidences, but I've let that slide, because to be honest I was that impressed with the movie that this flaw only became apparent after reading some of the comments posted on here.Also, credit to the filmmakers for not copping out with the ending and showing us that, even though we may not like it, the bad guys DO win sometimes. I don't buy the 'movies are meant to be for escapism' argument, because some movies are, but no-one in their right mind would watch "Arlington Road" as an escapist fantasy. This movie deals with reality all the way.My jaw was also on the floor at the ending, and I turned to my uncle and said in disbelief "They CAN'T do that!". He just smiled and said, "That's life". Inside however, I was metaphorically hugging myself for joy that a movie I had thought could not get any better had just managed that by displaying some true courage.Contender for best scene: When Michael goes to the party and the camera perfectly conveys his disorientation as the Lang's and all their friends cackle with laughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and not like Arlington Road? Or vice-versa? At least the plot. It's refreshing to find a movie that doesn't follow the norm.(spoilers ahead)I'll admit that I guessed the ending a few minutes before it got there, but when I figured it out I was rather excited. Maybe that makes me a sicko. Why is it that people are appalled by the bad guy winning every now and then? Although slightly predictable, I really like the twist at the end of this movie. I found myself actually liking Tim Robin's character during this movie. I wasn't exactly rooting for him, but I wasn't upset that he proved to be the smarter man.(no more spoilers)If you want something happy and feel good, turn on your TV and watch Family Matters. If you want action and suspense with a touch of realism, watch Arlington Road.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road is one of the most overlooked movies that didn't deserve to be overlooked. It stars Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges, two big-time actors, but still it received little notice. Arlington Road provided suspense, great acting (Jeff Bridges), and a fabulous plot. If you like complicated terrorism dramas then you should rent Arlington Road. It also provides an inconspicuous (it's at the very end) theory about The Oklahoma City tragedy (IRS building in St. Louis in the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movies with a twist at the end (I promise I won't reveal it here). A good final twist can elevate a film to new levels. It can make a good film out of a mediocre one (Alien 3) or a masterpiece out of an already good one (Fight Club). (For the record, the only thing I don't like is when a film is so obviously built around its twist, that until it comes, it seems plot less; I mean The Sixth Sense). But Arlington Road certainly belongs to the Fight Club category. It had me gripped from the start, even if the plot seemed at times predictable and contrived, the manic energy of Jeff Bridges and the calm menace of the cast-against-type Tim Robbins were enough to hook me. And then it all comes together so beautifully, and all the contrivances are explained in one swift stroke. Chapeau. When a film makes you want to see it again immediately, that's a good sign. Watch this one twice. At least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Did That Movie Get Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot recall a more disturbing edgy creepy movie coming out of a mainstream Hollywood studio. How did it get made? And more specifically, how did the studio, with all its focus groups and test screenings, let it get released with such a suprising downbeat ending?I don't know, but I'm certainly glad we've got the fluke to show for it; a creepy twisty movie that really grabs you right from the start and won't let you go. I got that line from Jeff Craig. Go 60 Second Preview.Seriously though, I'm not surprised this movie made zero at the box office, it's not a crowd pleaser. And I'm also not surprised everyone said I should go see it. They were right, I dug it big time. From the unnerving performances by Joan Cusack and Jeff Bridges, to the interesting script and plot, down to the nice direction and cinematography, I was hooked from start to finish.Yes there are plot holes, but a lot of them can be argued away, and the film is just way to good in the moment not to enjoy it. This isn't a groundbreaking flick, but it is well made, and looks pretty good too. Any film that can make flipping through a yearbook visually interesting is doing its job.Not for the faint of heart, or for those who need formulaic films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road is an expertly crafted movie that for 99% of its running time follows the conventions of a Hollywood thriller. Where this film excels is the ending.It is difficult to comment on Arlington Road fully without discussing the conclusion. Many reviews on this site state that the ending is unsatisfactory, unsatisfying, unjust and leaves you with a sick feeling in your stomach.It is for these reasons that the film stands out from the crowd. If you want a happy ending go and see a Bruce Willis movie. The sickening feeling you are left with as the credits run is worth the entrance ticket price alone.I suspect the writer and director fought long and hard to keep this ending and they are to be commended for doing so.A very good political thriller with a truly great finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoia at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm very easily amused, but I thought this was one of the best movies I've ever seen about the sinking abyss of paranoia. I think it's very difficult to make a believable movie about paranoia, and 'Arlington Road' is very believable--as least, while you're watching it.Admittedly, after you've seen it, you'll see the holes, and how you've been manipulated--but while you're watching it, you'll be just as confused as Bridges' character, wondering, "is he right? Or just a nutcase?"This movie operates entirely on the psychological plane. There aren't lots of cool explosions (well, OK, a few) and there isn't an expensive car being smashed every five minutes or someone's head being blown open with a handgun. Yet it leaves you breathless, panicked, scared, and disturbed. How easy is *that* to do without endless special effects?Some have complained that the timing of Robbins' character catching Bridges red-handed over and over was lame and unbelievable. I think they've missed the point--it adds to the confusion, the paranoia, and the madness of Bridges' character, and to ours also.In fact, the entire movie is structured this way. Just when the plot seems predictable and we think we can settle back and watch it follow a familiar formula, the rug is yanked away and we don't know what to believe. This happens not once, but constantly.If you have to categorize it, think of it as 'The Sting', with a dastardly political agend--in other words, the gentile crime of that 1920's piece fast-forwarded into the dismal world of moral-less America, circa 1999.The ending was extremely un-Hollywood, and left me angry, disturbed, and unsettled. And this, friends, is why Hollywood doesn't make movies like this. All anyone has complained about is how unsettling it is. Well, the next time you watch a movie end in a boring, predictable way, remember that it's probably making more money and wooing more critics and fans than 'Arlington Road'. (Reminds one of what they kept saying in 'The Player': "because *that's* reality!")As an aside, the opening credits were the spookiest I've ever seen. They set the tone perfectly for a movie that reflects the existential, empty, lonely, scary, frightening world that may or may not be right out our very door.If you enjoy watching a movie that will cause you to slam your fist on the arm of your chair, put you in a bad mood for the next day, make you yell at the news "YEAH RIGHT!" and wonder if you'll ever know "The Truth" about ANYTHING, this is your flick. I recommend it to anyone who wants some vinegar to balance the sugar of everything else made by Hollywood, and a reminder that things are rarely what they seem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one chilling movie. It begins with the opening sequence, when we see a little boy dazed in the street, his hand bloody, and Prof. Michael Farraday (Jeff Bridges) comes to his aid. The boy is the son of Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), a nice, suburban couple. But things start to change. Behind the faade of suburbia, Farraday, already paranoid as a terrorism expert and as the widower of an FBI agent murdered in a Waco-style raid, starts to suspect that the Langs are quite different that he expected. From there, the story twists and turns towards one disturbing conclusion.Arlington Road not only has a bizarre and twisting story, but has a unique visual look as well, thanks to director Mark Pellington. In fact, the film at times looks similar the the music video for Pearl Jam's song `Jeremy', which Pellington also directed. Bridges, perhaps the most underrated actor there is, is terrific and has a similar role in many ways to 1994's Blown Away. Robbins is an actor who is so versatile, that he can play both the innocent simpleton (The Hudsucker Proxy) or a conniving senatorial candidate (Bob Roberts), here displays a few new sides to his personality. Joan Cusack is also excellent in perhaps what is even a creepier role. This one will stay with you after the lights come up.Vote: 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road has some good ideas behind it, but the script is so filled with contrivances and coincidences that it is never credible for a moment. Robbins and Cusack are nicely creepy, but Bridges is too over the top and further detracts from the credibility. Bridges supposedly teaches a college course on terrorism in a history department, but it's one of those classes that you see only in the movies, where the prof never lectures from notes, knows all the students by name at the beginning of the term, and the class goes on field trips. The ending undermines the thought-provoking ideas behind it. Another disappointment from Jeff Bridges, following such mediocre fare as Blown Away and The Big Lebowski.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road is an excellent thriller with a perfect plot. It has mounting tension, suspense, and a twist at the end. Even though the characters may show little depth, the great plot more than compensates for this minor weakness. In most masterpieces, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. But with Arlington Road, although the sum of the parts is much greater than the whole, the sum of the parts is still huge. In other words, there is not a boring moment in this film.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Arlington Road" would have to rate as one of the most lacklustre thrillers I have seen in the last few years. I don't quite know how this film is holding down a user rating over 7/10.Jeff Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a suburbanite who lectures on terrorism at the local university. He is a widower who lives with his young son after his FBI agent wife was killed in a siege gone wrong. While driving home one day, he notices a boy walking down the centre of the road. When he stops to investigate, he notices the boy has suffered severe damage to his arm courtesy of a fireworks accident. After rushing him to hospital, Faraday eventually meets the boy's parents who live just over the road from him. Gradually they become friends, but things start to turn sinister when a few shady details of the father's (Tim Robbins) past begin to emerge. Not only that, but Faraday begins to suspect his homely neighbour might be a terrorist bomber, and that he might be planning a local job some time in the not-so-distant future.The storyline, although it probably sounds promising from the above summary, is strictly by the numbers and completely uninspiring. The plot twists are highly predictable and the characterisation, particularly that of Michael Faraday, is downright unbelievable. Sure, Faraday lectures in terrorism and with the recent death of his wife, it would not be unreasonable for him to be a bit on the paranoid side, but for him to suspect his neighbour is a terrorist because he gets the wrong mail every now and then is just plain ridiculous. It doesn't help that Bridges gives a completely over the top performance as Faraday, a man prone to fits of roaring anger and manic depression. In the end, it's really hard to feel any sympathy for him due to this reason alone. Robbins is better as his creepy neighbour, Oliver Lang, but his character could have been fleshed out a bit more too.At several points too, the film tries desperately to drum-up suspense by throwing Faraday and his college student girlfriend into increasingly precarious positions. The problem is, they are handled in such a routine manner that you can guess exactly what is going to happen and these situations just turn out to be downright annoying. On a positive note, the ending is certainly not your typical routine Hollywood happy ending, and this is one of the few pluses in the film.Finally, the one thing that really irritated me about "Arlington Road" was the direction and cinematography. I can't remember the last time I saw a big name film look this bad. The persistent use of shadows (even in broad daylight) and the hazy texture to the images is absolutely not necessary. I assume this camerawork was used to give the film a mysterious aura, but it doesn't and it just makes "Arlington Road" look plain ugly. It would have been far more appropriate to use colour and bright images to act as a contrast to the evil present in the neighbourhood (much like "American Beauty" did). Also, there are far too many close-up shots and quick cuts. At times I felt like I was watching "The Blair Witch Project" rather than a big budget film. There is also an awfully presented slow motion sequence towards the end which I guess was meant to generate suspense, but it is so poorly done and inappropriately timed that I almost ended up laughing.All in all, I was very disappointed with "Arlington Road". It annoys me that with all the wealth in Hollywood, films this ugly and this poorly scripted are still being produced. Good thing I only payed a few dollars to see it on video. I would have been more than a touch annoyed if I dished out $10 to see this trash at the cinemas.3.5 / 10</fullReview>

Farraday realizes that the bomb is in his car, but only too late. Farraday gets blamed for setting all this by him self and Lang escapes with no one knowing that he is the guilty one and moving in another location, this seeming to be a usual way of operating for him and his wife.</fullReview>

If you need any proof of this, refer to the last lines of the movie, where Mrs. Lang asks "Any word yet?" and Mr. Lang answers "No, but they'll let us know.". Looking for their next victim. The fact that Bridges' wife was killed and that he is a conspiracy theory nut was the whole reason they sought him out.Great movie, phenomenal ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that will be dug up many decades from now and folks will be questioning why it wasn't one of the best films of that year.This film is shocking, it's makes one feel paranoid, it makes one question government, security, makes one realize how deep love can go and that is love of spouse/country/political beliefs.This film provides a great performance by Jeff Bridges, with excellent performances by Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack. Most of all, it will get you to think. This is not a film for those who do not want to venture into a different type of a mind of a "terrorist", this is not the film for those who want to see happy endings, especially if you want the government to come in and save characters. It doesn't. This is a film that takes every notion and bends them, especially the subject matter.In 1999, who would wonder if their neighbors harbored any ill will? You do now. In 1999 who would think that terrorist think this way? You do now. In 1999 who would think that anyone as normal looking, white upper middle classed, as those neighbors were associated with fanatics? You do now. this film, for all its glory and mistakes, IS a view into a future..or a past..or both?Many posters are upset with the ending. The ending is shocking, I'll agree. A let down? Nope. Did I see it coming? NO. Hence my like for the film.There is so much in this film from the opening frame to the end, its a shame just to call it suspense, its a shame to just call it a thriller, its a shame just to call it political and its a shame just to say it terrorist get away with it all....it does all of those things, but what it does the most is have you look into the faces of all of this and understand how the innocent can be made into "whatever" by "whomever". The question is, whom do we trust in the climate as the movie proposes? The non-happy ending provides a clue.I recommend this film highly, but only if you are prepared to view it at least twice, open minded, and without politics. It's a hard swallow, but a damn good script that will have you biting your nails at points, and maybe upset you in the end because of the conclusion. But taking risks are important in film, making you think far beyond the time the film has ended are too. Take a chance and view this one, see for yourself.</fullReview>

The movie is pretty relevant as we are living in a world where we can not take anything for granted. There are some important questions and issues raised by this movie that a lot of people need to introspect about.

		<fullReview>This was an intense little thriller, dealing with the premise that your friendly next door neighbours might also just be terrorists. Jeff Bridges plays a widowed college professor who (in a gripping opening scene) comes across a bloody 10 year old boy staggering down the middle of the street. He appears to have been in some kind of explosion and Bridges rushes him into emergency. These first 5 minutes set the tone for the rest of the movie; dark, mysterious and intense with Bridges bordering on hysteria.The boy turns out to be his neighbours kid whom he makes friends with, but while having a beer in their living room he comes across some suspicious blueprints which sets into paranoia and soon has Bridges investigating into who these people really are. They seem normal enough, but... Tim Robbins &amp; Joan Cusack play the neighbours, -what a great choice for the bad guys, giving solid performances and very atypical for terrorists which made them even scarier.Bridges does a good job too, he has a lot of scenes without dialogue, just him running around figuring stuff out, freaking out, driving fast, yelling, he does a lot of yelling and running with big facial expressions.I will say that while the whole movie was intense there were also sections that dragged, so that the pacing felt off at times.The ending was.... unexpected to say the least. I think my exact words were "holy sh!t he ----- and that just happened, wow." Very un-Hollywood, including a scary spin regarding the angle the media takes post event. 2/6/15</fullReview>

The story weaves in nicely, peeling out layer by layer of information with just enough hints here and there. And the gigantic twist at the end is very satisfying to complete the solid story, although the most seasoned thriller watchers may have been anticipating that. What's quite bad about this movie is that there are more occasions of the usual coincidences that happened, which in my opinion could have ruined the build up by created discontinuance and even plot holes. The acting is very nice overall. I like how Jeff Bridges can deliver playing a dad and a grieving-inside husband at the same time. You'll see that Tim Robbins really gave a great job when you see the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this movie back in 1999. Still as chilling as it was back then, even more so some 13 years after 9-11. Jeff Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a college history professor who's wife, an FBI agent, died in a Waco/Ruby Ridge-style raid gone wrong a few years back. Michael finds a new girlfriend and raises his son in a nice bedroom community outside of Washington, DC. Things are going well for Michael until his new neighbors move in across the street. Oliver and Cheryl Lang, played by Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, respectfully, seem like the perfect neighbors until Michael starts to notice strange and even dangerous happenings going on. After launching his own little investigation, he suspects his new neighbors are really domestic terrorists and tries to enlist the help of his FBI connection. However,everyone, including his girlfriend, thinks it's all in his head, and that maybe he's trying to carry on his dead wife's work in her name. Things soon barrel out of control and we end up with one of the best plot twists in cinema history. I give it eight stars. The reason it doesn't get more is the plot is a bit over the top and some of the incidents that unfold are based too much on chance with the probability of them falling in line in real life, unlikely. With that in mind, viewers must keep in mind that it's a Hollywood production, and if things didn't unfold so precisely the way they do, then Arlington Road would be one boring movie. Also of note is the striking news scenes in the movie that seem so much like the real news footage we saw on 9- 11. It makes the film seem that much more real, and eerie, considering it was released some 2 years earlier to the day that changed the world. On a lighter note, you're not gonna be wowed by great special effects or cinematography here, but you really don't need it because this thriller is driven by a great script and a veteran cast. I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrorist Conspiracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Pellington directed this intriguing thriller that stars Jeff Bridges as College University Professor Michael Faraday, who becomes obsessed with terrorist groups(both foreign &amp; domestic) after his FBI agent wife is killed in a shootout with one. He then gets new neighbors, Oliver &amp; Cheryl Lang(played by Tim Robbins &amp; Joan Cusack) who are at first friendly and helpful, but as time passes, Michael becomes suspicious, and comes to believe that they are really agents of a sleeper cell planning an attack on a local target, but poor Michael doesn't realize how important to their plans he is... Compelling film with good direction and acting builds nice suspense to its devastating finale. May strain credulity at times, but bitter irony of the outcome packs a wallop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***warning contains spoiler***I feel some of the reviews of this film were too critical. There were mentions that it contained 'plotholes' - in reference to the end - which I feel forced an overlook to the actual raw performance and tension build up within the film.Jeff Bridges is one of my favourite American actors - a bit of an actor's actor - and he doesn't disappoint with this terrorist thriller. The ending which has been quite heavily slated could have been misinterpreted by those criticising it. Even if Jeff hadn't reached the FBI offices with the bomb in tow, the explosion would have had a big impact wherever detonated and Jeff would have been named a terrorist either way, as there was no one with substantial evidence to otherwise defend him and Jeff (having remained in the car) would be dead.Overall, I felt the suspense was well maintained and the '8' I've rated it was probably slightly generous, however I was well satisfied with the majority of the plot and would recommend the movie to the thrill-seekers of the film industry who have already indulged upon the classic thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another of those films in which carries the "savour the journey instead of the destination" title. The ending was a bit minor, and i felt as if the twist could've been much bigger. Now, don't get me wrong, its wasn't terrible it just left you wanting something... more. The acting was spectacular, Jeff Bridges is a really diverse actor, proving that further in Arlington Road. Now, i don't even like Tim Robbins (for some weird reason I don't even know) but his acting was good, as usual. Joan Cusack was surprising, delivering some creepy yet funny moments. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie up onto the climax, as i said before, it just leaves you wanted something better. However, this isn't any reason to dismiss the movie at all, still a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of this movie and I'm glad I discovered it.If you enjoy suspense thrillers this is a great choice.It is a movie which is about a man's paranoia regarding his neighbours activities and background.His obsession becomes uncontrollable and can be terrifying to the viewers. There is also a feeling of honour and patriotism. Many lessons can be learnt from this - such as how not to jump to conclusions or to judge someone to quickly. This type of conspiracy theory, political film is ideal for anyone with an interest in these subjects.9/10 for acting, script and subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Widowed when his FBI agent wife is killed by a right-wing group, college professor Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) becomes obsessed with the culture of these groups - especially when his new neighbors, the all-American Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), start acting suspiciously. With each twist, the mystery deepens and the question looms - is Faraday just consumed by fear and driven by paranoia, or has a lethal conspiracy been born on Arlington Road?" asks the DVD sleeve.Director Mark Pellington and award-winning scripter Ehren Kruger make "Arlington Road" a fine thriller, from its "gripping" beginning to the "edge-of-your-seat" ending, it's entirely captivating. Mr. Pellington knows how to build suspense, and he elicits fine performances from a eclectic cast. Mr. Bridges' endearing paranoiac hero carries film - like he carries Spencer Treat Clark (as Grant) in the opening sequence. Doesn't that just grab you? Both frightening and neighborly, Mr. Robbins and Ms. Cusack reveal their hands slowly. Mr. Clark and Mason Gamble (as Brady) are genuine. Hope Davis (as Brooke Wolfe) and Robert Gossett (as Whit Carver) keep you guessing, even when you know what's going on. Only the "Movie of the Week" ending overreaches - not necessarily because it's an incredible idea, but because it's just not that kind of movie. This is, more simply, a crowd-pleaser.******* Arlington Road (3/19/99) Mark Pellington ~ Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, shocking ending disappoints traditionalists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road was an excellent film that takes you on a fast roller coaster thrill ride. Without a dull moment, the film hits its peak when an FBI investigator and crime forensics professor (Kurt Russel) discovers the criminal terrorist background of his shady neighbor and antagonist (Tim Robbins).Things go from bad to worse quickly for the paranoid professor/investigator whose wife was killed during an FBI sting gone bad in the events of history that took place before the time-line that the film encompasses.After the professor uncovers the evil bombing plot of Robbins' character, who is living under an alias, and across the street from the good professor, things go south fast. First some tense conflicts ensue, followed by Russel's girlfriend being killed in a "car accident," after getting caught doing some of her own re-con. work, finally escalating to Russel's 9 year old son being kidnapped by Robbins' character before the climatic final 10 minute sequence.Obviously this review is a retrospective, and is intended for those who have viewed the film. With that said, I would like to discuss the climatic ending sequence that quickly became so very anti-climatic to traditionalists such as myself: Why did the bad guys win this one? This film set up all the right pieces for a huge battle at the end between Robbins and Russel, and in the end it was Robbins' evil plot that won. It just didn't add up.Russel's character got set up, killed and framed for the entire evil plot. THE END - The bad guys win??? I'm not denying that this certainly added a unique twist to the typical hero/villain story, especially in reference to a plot based on the terrorist attacks of Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City federal building bombing of 1995. It definitely left you scratching your head, begging for revenge, and wondering why so much injustice was dealt to protagonist, in the same spirit of mega hit "Se7en".The film, now over a decade old hasn't received a version with a plot-changing alternative to date (although alternate endings exist). Personally, I would suggest a revival of this story with a choice of an alternative ending where the bad guys lose and get caught by the FBI along with a warm reunion between Russel and his son. I suppose that enough films with that level of vindication exist, but this was a very well done film and deserves that sort of fanfare to allow for a broader appeal. Just my 2 cents...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Washington University teacher Bridges is haunted by his ex-wife's' fate as a terrorist specialist FBI agent, and has just about started his life over... But as he is - by accident - drawn to recently moved-in family man Robbins next door, who starts to display increasingly suspicious behavior, the old saying "Fear thy neighbor" is given another dimension into his existence...Crackerjack, near-tip-top conspiracy thriller grabs you by the throat from the first riveting minute and never lets go. There is a high level of menacing meanness plus a certain quota of questionable plot credibility, surely...(including a major one concerning the finale) but when the rest is as skillfully manipulative, sweat-inducingly exciting and well-acted (Bridges always excels!) as here, I can happily live with that! In retrospect, especially a post-9/11-one, it also raises sincere, relevant issues on terrorism and what lies behind its motives.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

They start to see each other socially and their children hang out with each other. Is all as it seems....? It's a good film but it has a few dodgy bits that suspend belief, eg, Brooke's (Hope Davis) inability to understand the bleeding obvious when Bridges is shoving loads of proof in her face. I was also confused as to the role of Cheryl (Joan Cusack) - innocent or evil? The film has a different outcome to what you would expect which would shock the viewer more if we could care about Jeff Bridges. Tim Robbins has a far more interesting role and he steals the acting honours. Special mention to Joan Cusack for being scarily mad, I think!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a show by Robbins... One of my favorite movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting too much from "Arlington Road". I thought: OK, maybe a good thriller, but not a masterpiece. I'm proud to say that I was mistaken, and now "Arlington Road" is one of my favorite movies. First and above all, because of a outstanding actor called Tim Robbins. I don't have words too describe his performance here, it's strong and calm at the same time, a show by an actor who knows everything about acting. Maybe one of the best villains I've ever seen, his dialog with Jeff Bridges in the garden is just amazing! I didn't even believe it when I saw it. Since the day I've watched this movie, Tim Robbins acting is the greatest show on Earth for me. Anyway, besides him, "Arlington" has a solid script, that really has something to say, a correct direction e some great supporting cast. Joan Allen is creepy at its best, a wonderful performance. It's a shame that Jeff Bridges didn't represent well the fascinating role that he plays, but this is a minor flaw. "Arlington Road" is forever the show by Tim Robbins... and it's a devastating, outstanding, unforgettable piece of movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't get into this one. The plot seemed totally unbelievable (okay, I know it's supposed to say that this could be happening right next door to YOU, but), it was fragmented and silly in parts (for example, why did Jeff Bridge's love interest have to be a college graduate? Doesn't that go to bad character rather than good in some respects?). I guess what I'm getting at is that I didn't find the situation OR the characters believable. The action etc was okay but really, is it actually even feasible that Tim Robbins could have known that Bridges would 'gun his car' and shoot over security measures to enter the FBI underground parking lot? He might has suspected he was the type of person who COULD do this/might THINK about it but that's a long stretch from planning that this is exactly what would happen. Stretched credibility too far I think. Robbin and Bridges turn in nice performances but for what? A 'been there, done that' twist. Seven it ain't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The conspiracy theory fanatics will have a field day with this film as it will explain what they have believed all along; simply that there is no lone gunman or lone bomber, but a cabal of anarchists that are behind all the dastardly deeds committed in this country. That cabal is, of course, composed of those who would take revenge on a government that is plotting against the people.Jeff Bridges was quite good in his role of a suspicious neighbor, who felt that something wasn't quite right about the man across the street. he followed his hunch until he got someone killed and, ultimately, well, I can't disclose that, can I? Tim Robbins was the neighbor and he performed one of the best roles I have seen him in. But, his wife, Joan Cusack, was the real star as she hid a sinister being beneath that mask of a friendly neighbor. When that mask finally came off, you could actually see how evil looks.The story was excellent and the pacing well done as we were kept hanging to see who would win. It was a tidy ending, but certainly not one you would expect.For one group, it will validate their beliefs; for others, it will pose some interesting questions; for all it will entertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD, DONT READ UNTIL MOVIE HAS BEEN SEEN******I was reading some of the user comments for this movie and have to add one of my own...all you people who claim this master piece of movie making a bad film are wallowing in your own beds of ill educated movie melonchly. I suggest you stick to your big budget action thrillers and your romantic comedies, this is a real movie only to be enjoyed by real movie fans. The reason you can't deal with this movie is it doesn't follow the traditional movie formula watched over the years. We start out with a good guy who has been robbed of his wife and left to raise his son alone, you say "well he will live to the end and beat the bad guy(s)" then we meet his georgeous girl and you say "well she will need to be saved by the good guy and live to the end" and finally we meet the bad guy and you say "he will get got by the good guy and be taught the error of his way just before he dies". Then after this set up Pellington does a real mind job on you and before you know it the girl is dead, the bad guy lives to the end and walks off with a smug smile on his face and the good guy is disintergrated and his memory is trampled on as he is considered to be responsable for the bad guys actions. Now you feel cheated, you watch movies because movie world makes sense to you, everything comes to a natural conclusion and you feel better about the messed up real world we have to live in. This film (despite the slight suspention of disbelief you have to give to ALL films) is closer to real life than in its conclusion than you can handle. Sometimes the good guys get shafted and things don't work out for the best (sorry to have to break this to you)...but hey...never mind...I hear 'pretty woman' is on TV tonight. Just watch that and forget all this bad stuff goes on in the world and escape to fantasy world for a while..you'll be safe there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one thing I've noticed is that the reviewers who gave this film a poor review was the fact that they failed to realize that this movie seemed to be made in order to mimic somehow the McVeigh abolition of the FBI HQ in OKCY. It is for this reason I do give this film a thumbs up instead of a thumbs down. It did a good job of exploring the mind of someone in McVeigh's situation, and showing some possible motive for his actions. It also did a fair enough job of parodizing middle-class America, and building plenty of suspense and tension. However, if you're faint of heart, then you need to see another movie, this flick is rather graphic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight Scripting and A Strong Cast Make for a Thrilling Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From it's tense, nail-biting beginning opening scene to it's grisly, anti-Hollywood ending, Arlington Road is a thriller that's made a plan to plant paranoia into the audience and suck its' collective breath out, and boy, does it succeed.This gem of a thriller stars Jeff Bridges as a professor teaching a history of terrorism course who discovers his seemingly wholesome neighbors Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins are hiding something about Robbin's past. Think American Beauty, but played for thrills rather than drama. As Bridges goes to his neighbor's home for cookouts, dinner, and just to visit, he slowly brings to light the shadiness of who Robbins used to be. Bridges gives a convincing performance as the obsessed professor bent on learning the truth about his neighbors and even comes off as much more intruding and unlikeable in some of the scenes. Of course, this is Robbins' and Cusack's movie, and they are obviously having fun as the devious, scheming couple. All Cusack need do is smile and we sense she is holding up a facade. My only complaint is that Robbin's could have had a few more scenes where we feel more compassion for his character: by the end, we just want to see him die. Also, a few more inspired, sick lines would have have made Robbins' near-perfect.While Arlington Road may be a conventional, even predictable and cliched film at some points, there is much to admire in it: it's frantic score by the always great Angelo Badalemnti, it's equally frantic and effect camera work, and of course, and of course its ending so unseen and downbeat that it makes one cringe. And though there may be some moments of implausibility, weren't there many more in such films as Speed, another film heralded as a thrill ride? 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Haven't you ever watched any spy movies?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers ahead**While it had a few good points (like the acting of Cusack and Robbins), there were some irritating moments that stuck in my mind after watching it that help drag down my opinion of "Arlington Road".First of all, for a movie that strives to be realistic and make a significant statement, it relies on the tired old scheme of having the good guy sneaking around foolishly, trying to gather info on the villains, only to be discovered by the villain and caught red-handed. The viewer is supposed to think, "Gee, he/she'd better hurry up before someone finds out!", and of course the crook catches him by surprise at some crucial moment. This trick is forced on us not once, but THREE TIMES in this movie, and is further driven into the ground by the poor, predictable execution.For instance, Faraday is digging up Oliver Lang's past on a microfiche machine at his work (conveniently sitting right in front of the open door to the hallway, for all to see), and guess who shows up right behind him all of a sudden? Faraday then makes a painfully obvious attempt to hide the microfiche articles from sight, but it's clear that Lang has seen them.But that's not all! On the suggestion of his acquaintance from the FBI, Faraday finds a lame excuse to be let inside the Lang house while they're away. Rudely brushing aside Lang's daughter, he goes into Oliver's study and pretends to make a phone call while rooting through the personal contents in the room. He creeps over to an architectural sketch hanging on the wall. Wait a minute...could it be? Yes, look at that ripped-up area in the corner! The sketch is actually covering up A SECOND sketch, for undoubtedly sinister motives. Hmm...wouldn't Oliver hide his guilty secrets in a less vulnerable and accessible area than the wall? But the stealth mission is cut short by the opportune arrival of Mrs. Lang. When will you ever learn, Farraday? Haven't you watched any spy movies?Apparently, his girlfriend hasn't either, because she follows the same routine and falls prey to another oh-so-sudden appearance by Mrs. Lang. Having chosen to trail Oliver in her car after spotting his shady activities in a parking garage, Brook Wolfe follows him to a warehouse, where he and other men are seen trading some suspicious materials. Brook doesn't know what else to do but call up her boyfriend and report the findings---on a pay phone, complete with bright red trim, just a few steps away from the warehouse. She blurts her concerns into the phone for all to hear, in great detail. Gosh, will she be discovered? Or will she get away to safety in time? Hurry up, Brook! Uh-oh, I'll be darned---someone is right behind you eavesdropping, Brook, and it ain't David Arquette or Wayne Knight with advice on how to call collect. It's Oliver's wife! Should I be surprised? We can just say "So long, Ms. Wolfe; we won't be seeing you again in this picture!"Then there's the hard-to-believe bomb chase/trap thingy at the end, which plenty of other critics have fired at. And I couldn't help but chuckle at the drawn-out, slow motion shot of Faraday running towards the car trunk, his jaw flopping (shown more than once to enhance the "dramatic effect").</fullReview>

Only in Se7en have I ever seen such a gloomy ending, and for being an American film, it is awfully depressing - that's why I love it so much.

		<shortDescription>So much potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers with this movie, I thought it was going to be AWESOME. I'm a pretty big Tim Robbins fan, and the plot seemed great. It had so much potential. Sadly, it fell quite short of the mark.The problem with this movie was that, while the idea and premise were excellent, the actualy script wasn't as good. I think that almost any movie, no matter how dark or disturbing, should at least have SOME comedy, just to balance it out. This, however, had none. It just had a down feeling the whole way through. That, in and of itself, would not ruin a movie, in any way. However, the movie suffers more. For, I would have liked to see more on Farraday's classes that he taught, I was entertained by those scenes, but they were too few and far.Something that always bugs me about a movie is when everything goes wrong for the main character. Don't get me wrong - a sad event here and there is fine - but this movie almost had a sort of sadistic quality. His girlfriend didn't believe him, his FBI friend didn't believe him, no one believed him, despite his evidence. It just felt unrealistic. Another movie that suffers in the same department is "Brokedown Palace". If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. But the thing that weakened this movie the most was the last, I don't know, 20 minutes or so. **SPOILER ALERT**While the idea that Lang had planted the bomb in Farraday's car and all that was cool, the end relied on so many coincidences it wasn't even funny. For example, how did Lang know that Farraday's car would get hit by the bus? Or that he would follow the wrong van and drive inside the parking garage? The unrealism really detracted the enjoyment for me.The saddest thing about this is that the ending was ingenius. While not happy by ANY stretch of the imagination, it was extremely creative and (sort of, kind of) made you think. It makes you look at the news in a whole new light.In conclusion, I thinkt that while this movie had it's moments, the overall film didn't add up. It would be great if someone remade this movie in, say, ten years, and the script had a bit of polishing up.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Menacing conspiracy thriller recalling the Oklahoma bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Pellington's Arlington Road is an accomplished paranoia movie featuring Jeff Bridges as a college professor who begins to suspect his neighbours are right wing terrorists.Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are the neighbours who are not all they seem to be. What makes this movie a cut above your average Hollywood thriller is its exemplary cast, its disturbing storyline and slick direction.Bridges is perfect for the role of the troubled hero driven by an obsession about far right extremist terrorists.Robbins and Cusack make chilling villains, clearly relishing their roles.With tense action sequences, high octane editing, Pellington drives this movie along at juggernaut pace.But what makes the material fascinating is the way he plays with his audience's perceptions of his characters.At times, the film is reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' or the great paranoid thrillers of the 1970s like Coppola's 'The Conversation'. The literally explosive ending also recalls the ticking bomb in Hitchcock's 'Sabotage'.If there is one criticism, it is at times the plot is too neat - do we really have to have our hero teach a course on far right terrorism?It really wouldn't alter the film radically if he were a maths lecturer, a doctor, a computer programmer. What is central to the plot is a man's growing suspicion of his neighbour.The movie recalls the Oklahoma bomb - especially in its final sequence where its montage of television news coverage is chillingly reminiscent of the mistaken assumptions made by the US networks about the real life massacre.This is an important film because of the subject matter and all the harder to watch because of its importance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping action movie but very bleak and ultimately unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The narrative drive is excellent: it's edge-of-the-seat stuff from soup to nuts. I gave it a 7 for this, but there are annoying points about plot and characterisation that made it an unsatisfactory movie for me. Just a couple of examples. How is Faraday (Jeff Bridges) able to get away with teaching a course at his university that is part rabid propaganda and part personal reminiscence? Are his students and colleagues really so dense? What is the point of Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis)? There is absolutely no chemistry between her and Faraday. She sticks with him despite the fact that he is always going on about his ex-wife, and yet she is unable to believe or trust his reasonable suspicions about Lang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is good...but don't watch it more than once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I thought that it was awesome. It had a good ending and it was very unexpected. Much better than I expected it to be from watching the previews and the trailers and stuff. But, later, about a week later, I had some company over, and they wanted to see what was on...so I turned on Arlington Road. I watched it again and saw all the flaws that I failed to realize when I first saw the movie and fell in love with the plot. It doesn't have much action, and when you watch it the second time, the suspense is gone. I like movies where you can watch it over and over again, and still find the movie good. I can watch a couple parts of the movie again, but not too many. I can usually only watch the parts when Jeff Bridges character is teaching his class, and the end, because it's still good. But, I really don't suggest watching this a second time. You end up ripping the movie apart, because the plot in fact, is not as great as you thought that it was. It has a great first impression though. You should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant. From beginning to end. In fact, the beginning and middle part of the film are so brilliant that you start realizing that the ending couldn't possibly be good.In a way you sympathize with both the "good guy" and the "bad guy" in the film, and a film where the "good guy" wins would almost be a disappointment in this film. The reason for that is that it is hard to decide who's the bad guy and who's the good guy. Both persons has both in them...When I first saw this film I realized that the way this film progressed the ending I expected would be disappointing compared with the rest of the film. And with that in mind I didn't enjoy the middle part as much as I should, "knowing" that I would be disappointed in the end.But the ending didn't disappoint at all. In fact it was just as excellent as everything else in the film.All in all this is an excellent thriller, perfect from beginning to end. I give it an 8 out of 10, and recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good thriller now and then...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road starts as a magnificent thriller. And until the end, it walks that line.Danger: if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading (spoilersahead).But the ending of this film ruins it completely. What's the message this movie is trying to convey? Everything the good guy endured was planned by the bad guys just to make him enter the building with a bomb? Such a plan establishes many holes in the plot; anything could have gone wrong. A very disturbing ending indeed. Despite how much the ending ruins this film, it makes people think about current events in real life. That makes it smart. It just doesn't fit the movie. The good guy didn't deserve to die.Considering how good this movie was, the way it ends is a bitter disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To go from "The Dude" in Big Lebowski to David Farraday only proves Bridges is one of the most versatile actors out there. He over-emotes a little in this film but he's great all the same.The film itself is chilling and leaves you asking a lot of questions. Even if you don't believe in right-wing conspiracies and govt. conspiracies you have to acknowledge that this anti-government sentiment is out there in a lot of people; most people are merely annoyed but many are angry and their invisibility is their greatest asset. The way the film portrayed Tim Robbins' associates is one of the best examples. Arlington Road was one of the few films in recent years that really affected me. **** out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intricate, twisting conspiracy noir film with a political agenda bonus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the big wig critics such as Ebert (and many others) hate the plot you think twice about the quality of a film. In this case they're wrong though. Good thing I saw it before I read their captious criticism, though I probably wouldn't have skipped it anyway since J. Bridges is my hero (anyone who plays a character like Jack Baker, from "The Fabulous Baker Boys," is a hero in my book: I'm a Jazz musician). In Road what was more important than the acting was the story - the very thing the picky critics hated. Most people didn't understand Baker Boys either. That makes two J. Bridges noir films that have transcended the critics. That's a good thing. Oscar Wilde - who said an artist is in accordance with himself (is creating good art) if his work creates controversy - would have been proud! This film is like The Spanish Prisoner. Though Prisoner wasn't noir (the good guys win in the end) its plot is an intricate criminal maze that requires the viewer to do alot of figuring. Road's detractors say the intricate plot doesn't pan out, but that's only because these critics aren't stretching their noggins enough. The key clue was when Robbins tells Bridges there are millions of them and suggests a very capable and organized conspiracy. With such a conspiracy all the loose ends could have been keenly monitored and plans could have been alternated according to whatever the key target's actions did next - just like Prisoner. This was the basic premise of the film: an extremely well organized criminal conspiracy. Why so many have difficulty recognizing this obvious feature (I'm no genius and I saw it right away) probably has something to do with how certain types of people are so busy being picky they forget to open their minds. Forget them and watch Road a second and third time. I did and liked it more each time. Highly recommended movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers ahead: I know a lot of people who liked Arlington Road and a lot who disliked it. Out of my friends, there were no guys who disliked it and there were no girls who liked it. That's not sexist, it's a fact. I'll tell you why I think these numbers turned out this way. Becuase it does not have a happy ending. It's not a fairy tale. So I guess it's not a good movie because the hero doesn't kill the bad guy at the end. Give me a break. Arlington Road has the best ending since the Usual Suspects. The ending is the very thing that makes it so great. It's new, it's different, and a lot of people are not open minded and want to see the same ending every time. I'm not one of them. I celebrate movies like this because most studios are not brave enough to make them. Bad things do happen. That's what this movie is saying. It's more realistic in that way than any terrorist film I've ever seen. There are some plot holes in the film and Jeff Bridges does a lot of overacting, but the general idea is very smart. There are a number of edge-of-your-seat scenes. A lot of people complain that the ending is unrealistic because of precision purposes. It was a remote bomb. If he didn't go in, they wouldn't have set it off. It's not like it was on a timer. This movie is good because 1. it has a point: it concerns terrorist acts and Bridges' belief that they cannot be the work of one man, but that people need to blame someone and not think that the threat is still out there. 2. It contradicts everything we think is going to happen. That's great. Who wants to predict what's going to happen and always be right? Nine out of ten movies you can do this with. Arlington Road is not one of them. It is the new, innovative terrorist movie. I understand that a lot of people can't handle it. A lot of people could not handle the Blair Witch Project either. These people are not ready for the future. It's about having an open mind and wanting to explore new ground.</fullReview>

I don't think I want to do that with Arlington Road, a mean-spirited and grim movie, which depends too heavily on the main character acting like a fool. Since Jeff Bridges plays a college professor who is an expert in the very field he's enmeshed in personally, that becomes hard to countenance.In addition, there was little of the "Ah so" factor. In other words, certain things that made know sense before you knew the secret continue to make no sense after you know it. Furthermore, other things which seemed to make sense stopped making sense in the mnovie's greater context.Finally, the basic plot was essentially ripped off from the Warren Beatty film "The Parallax View." Those who have seen both films should know what I mean.My son hates movies with bad endings. I dislike movies with pretentions that can't live up to them.

Really thought-provoking, harrowing, well-conceived stuff.So why, relatively speaking, did it flop at the box office? This is the type of truly amazing thriller that would be a runaway success if Bruce Willis had taken the lead, or Christopher Walken had a go as the villain. But it's better than that - Jeff Bridges is perfect as the nervy, paranoid lecturer and Tim Robbins particularly creepy as his odd, possibly terrorist-related neighbour.And what an ending!This is the kind of film that deserves trumpeting as a major cinematic triumph, but will instead languish in that category filled with films like 'Breakdown' and 'Wild Things' - movies that will become forgotten gems.

		<shortDescription>"The Manchurian Candidate" of our time (?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Arlington Road" was one of the biggest surprises of 1999 in my opinion, and also one of the most underrated films. Maybe because it was released at the wrong time (summer vacations, among "American Pie", "Wild Wild West", "Star Wars", "Big Daddy" and duds like those), being a box-office flop. Maybe because it was wrongly sold. And maybe because it was misunderstood. Some critics and people in general argue that this film is totally absurd, senseless, pointless and there it goes. Oh, what did they say about "Magnolia"? "Eyes Wide Shut" and most of the Kubrick's pictures the time they were released? They just can't get the point of those complex, intriguing films, which don't give you all the answers you want and let you make your own interpretation. The rain of frogs in "Magnolia"? What does that really mean? The black monolith in "2001"? The orgiastic scene in "Eyes Wide Shut"? People are used to see commercial, dumb Hollywood movies, in which everything is well explained and easy to watch. And what do you think about the somehow ambiguous ending of "Arlington Road"?"Arlington Road" is not the kind of film that you like instantly. The first scene, amazingly shot, shows a boy walking along a street, first showing only his eyes. Then we can see some blood falling on the ground. And then we see his totally destroyed arm (sorry if this was too strong, but that's what it is). Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) save his life, and discovers that he is the son of a neighbor couple, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack). They become friends. We discover that Faraday lost his wife some time before during a FBI mission (also shown in a great scene), and he has a son, who becomes a friend of that boy his father saved in the beginning. The film is a drama on its first 30 minutes or something, but then Faraday, who gives classes about terrorism, starts to suspect of his neighbor's behavior. And then... I'll let for you to find out, if you haven't seen it yet. I said some lines above that this is not a instantly enjoyable film. As in "Jacob's Ladder" (an amazing surreal mystery picture also starred by Tim Robbins), you start to be intrigued while you begin to think about the story, (yes) during the film. Some things are obscure and will continue obscure till the end, but it's your job to think about them. Right? "Arlington Road" is a superbly directed, acted, written and edited picture. I had never heard about Mark Pellington, but who knows if he doesn't go to the same way as Paul Thomas Anderson? He has a good sense of timing, being helped by the unquiet film editing. And there are at least three great performances- Jeff Bridges, Joan Cusack and specially Tim Robbins. (If you think his best film is "The Shawshank Redemption", you haven't seen "Jacob's Ladder" and "Arligton Road") But what really differs this from other Hollywood productions is the screenplay. The structure is unusual, thrilling, capturing the paranoia of our society. But the end... Oh, the end! My jaw went to the floor and I couldn't lift it up. You'll get speachless, love it or hate it. "The Sixth Sense" had the best ending of last year, but "Arligton Road" has a more disturbing finale. You'll ask yourself: 'How the f*** was that possible?'I'm just finishing; just two other things. I heard someone comparing this with 1998's "The Siege". But wait... Both films talk about terrorism. However, one is excellent, close to perfection, while the other is a mediocre, idiotic commercial production. Guess which is which. Now try to compare "American Beauty" with a soap opera...Finally, the last thing I've got to say. Have you seen "The Manchurian Candidate"? It's one of my all times favorites, showing the American paranoia about the Communism during the Cold War. "Arlington Road" was produced in 1999, the end of the last decade of the 20th Century, with no Cold War or something happening. But our paranoia nowadays is about the terrorism, which is present in all over the world, for our misfortune. I'm sure "Arlington Road" won't become a classic, but it can be recognized as "The Manchurian Candidate" of our time. What do you think?9/10 -- a edge of the seat thriller with brain</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller with more brains than most (possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's nice to see a mainstream(ish) film, especially a thriller, that manages to, if not subvert itself, than at least make highly ambiguous its ostensible subject matter. On its announced level, the film is a glum, obvious conspiracy thriller, which, cashing in on the modish pessimism of THE X-FILES, capitalises on the acceptability of difficult, non-reassuring endings, where the hero does not triumph against evil. In this, it takes its hero at his word - a professor of politics who teaches a course in terrorism, he says the government will always try to find a scapegoat on which to shift all the blame for a bombing, because it is intolerable to us to think that the threat is still out there, unchecked, unknowable.This daring is especially cheering in that the film had seemed to be going in the opposite direction, suggesting the threat, with American intuition, and diligent research, could be checked. Here the movie uses the insights of Hitchcock, Bunuel, Lynch, Burton et al, in suggesting that bland, healthy, tidy, nuclear family suburbia, the supposed metonym for the State and its ideals, could actually be the cankerous root of its malaise. All those years and money spent pandering to Middle America for its vote has only led increasingly to its disaffection.The film might seem rather heavy-handed here - the destructive terrorist is a structural engineer - but opens up a number of interesting questions. In a film where the only representatives of power - the FBI - are seen to be inept, inhuman and fatally bureaucratic, what does an aggrieved Citizen do to protest, to say no. Can a society of almost radical conformity (witness the McCarthy scaremongering) accomodate dissent? How much does the conservative defence of the gun laws - reference to the Constitution, upholding the State - actually equip opposition to the State?These questions are further complicated by the example of the Individual, the very American Fenimore who becomes the more dubiously Teutonic Lang (any allusions here to the great filmmaker who made many extraordinary thrillers about power and the individual?). How far, in a society mythically based on the ideals of the West, of frontiers, of individuals seeking to destroy history and begin anew - how far can a modern citizen reinvent himself, remove the weight of a compromised past and begin anew, in a society which proclaims the self-made man, and yet has in force the most frightening bureaucratic panopticon in the world, where every tiny detail of one's life is forever classified to be dredged up at any moment to damn you.All of this in a contemporary Hollywood thriller would be cause for rejoicing enough, but possibly rather academic. One of Hollywood's strengths (and possible weaknesses) is its tendency to humanise grand, abstract ideas, reveal their effect on individuals. This can bland out the material, but in this case, the focus on the hero actually brings the film's realism (or plausibility) into question. At perhaps the crucial point of the action, Michael Faraday, thinking his son kidnapped, confronts the neighbour he suspects as a terrorist. The film had opened with an extraordinary jolt, with a bleeding child staggering in the middle of white suburbia, sound effects and visuals distorted like the beginning of Chabrol's TEN DAYS' WONDER. The same mood returns here, more exaggerated, as Faraday's view of the world becomes nightmarish, slowing down the action, seeing ordinary neighbours as diabolical grotesques - the introduction of Lang in this scene is pure dream, the whole mood is a bit like the waltz scene in VAMPYR.The slow-burning thriller elements reach a hysterical pitch from this point on, and when we see Faraday waking up the next morning, we ask if he has dreamt the preceding. Because the film, for me, works best as a portrait of mental breakdown, about a liberal, decent, white man who has been unable to protect his family, who sees his son slipping out of his affections, whose personality is alienated, distorted and fragmented by his inability to get over his wife's death, his indecision over who he is, his paternal power impotent, ceded to someone else.The nervy opening sequence suggested a horror movie, and we could see ARLINGTON ROAD as a classic tale of doppelgangers, of doubles - Lang is Faraday's double, the encapsulation of all he wants to be, a husband, a father, but also someone who can take action, express the dissent he feels but cannot voice. So the ending, rather than just a clever piece of plotting, becomes psychological and metaphysical, as the two sides of the same coin merge, as the doubles become one, and Faraday does become a bomber. As such - and the Fincheresque credits suggested as much - the film is more convincing than FIGHT CLUB, if not as cinematically inventive. With a film so fascinating in theory, you'd wonder, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, how it turned out so routine in practice.</fullReview>

Joan Cusack is perfect as a scary and disturbing housewife, married to a terrorist. Tim Robbins is also scary, but a little too weird to be be trying to appear as a normal suburbanite.

		<fullReview>Arlington Road is a film that truly believes in something and stands by it. It goes out of it's way to shake the audience out of their complacency, by having Farraday (Bridges) address certain issues in seminars and then watching him live through the horror that he has only read about.Rarely has a commercial American thriller been so intent on blaming its own villains for some of the injustices of terrorism. The convention (so imbedded that no-one but the occasional critic even questions it) that the biggest threat on American democracy and peace is from Middle Eastern terrorists is dispelled at once in Kruger's surprisingly powerful screenplay. The threat here is front the family next door. Mark Pellington's directorial debut cunningly balances this fear with the concept of fear itself; in a world of conspiracy theories and paranoia, might Farraday simply become a victim of his own obsession or does he truly have reason to suspect his new neighbour?After a horrific and intensely claustrophobic opening, the credits sequence launches an assault on the senses like nothing since Fincher's "Se7en" (1996, dir. David Fincher, scr. Andrew Kevin Walker). Whilst the early stages of the film are relaxed and somewhat subdued, the themes are established early and the tension quietly built up in to true panic.The closing chase does stretch credibility, but is justified by an extraordinarily sly twist which may be devastatingly cruel, but it is essential to the film's power. If it had opted for the ending which sees innocent man defeat deadly foe, it would have betrayed every principle it made in the first half. Instead it actually acts its theory and ensures that no-one forgets it in a hurry. I defy anyone, even on video, to walk away from Arlington Road without wondering whether they might also have been susceptible to the kind of lies and manipulation which it so brutally exposes.</fullReview>

Good plot, unique director's touches (by newcomer Mike Pellington - who's first major feature film this was) and credible suspense can only go so far. The pace is OK, but the story gets more predictable as it goes along, and the ending isn't as heart-stopping as it should be. Good performances (especially be Joan Cusack as Robbin's creepily perky wife) help, but in the end, you aren't left with any kind of awe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great setup and ending with less than real building blocks along the way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved the way this film started out and the way the two men were brought together. But for me, way too many questions were left unanswered. Technical points were missing all along the way. For a few, one, the son of the terrorist was supposedly injured playing with fireworks while they hinted later it was probably some or his dad's explosives, but no follow up police investigation took place. Two, Faraday's girlfriend was too "pat" or contrived on her resistance to Faraday's early suspicions. Three, then suddenly, when she coincidentally sees Lang in a parking garage exchanging items with an unknown woman, she switches 180 and begins to follow him (violating the very privacy she argued with Faraday over). I know that the filmakers wanted you to think that Lang planned the trap every step of the way encluding when to pull the girlfriend in, but it didn't work for me. People manipulation on this order seems like trying to push a chain up a hill. I think this story could have worked much better with a little more thought towards reality on some of the plot points. All in all, I was entertained and didn't catch on to the ending until moments before. Good Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should you watch this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. There are so many conflicting opinons on Arlington Rd. Is it right for you? It is if you enjoy a tightly plotted thriller with a shocking and deeply disturbing ending that leaves you gasping for breath and wondering "could this really happen!?!" It is NOT if you prefer your entertainment light and believe that every movie must have a happy ending. Just a hint: THIS ONE DOESN'T! The ending is traumatizing, horrifying, and BRILLIANT. ** Warning: mild spoiler ** When it was over, I felt both loathing and a grudging admiration for the "Fenimores". They are extremely psychotic, so lost in their "cause" that they can no longer see the evil in murdering hundreds of innocent people. One gets the impression that they honestly believe themselves to be virtuous, upstanding citizens who are doing the right thing. Hideous.I just wish that there were more people who valued some disturbing reality in their movies, as well as the feel-good fantasy. This movie should have done terrifically well at the box office, but most people just can't handle the ending. What a shame. I would like to have seen more movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this on DVD last week and was thoroughly blown away by this movie on all fronts (acting, directing, photography, and the great screenplay by Ehren Kruger - he was a 1996 Nicholls Fellowship finalist with this script).There's one misstep in the logic of the script in the concluding 15 minutes, but you'll probably overlook it as I did: I was so caught up in the tense story and atmosphere. Read Roger Ebert's review to find out what it is if you can't figure it out."Everyone is authorized to be here - EXCEPT YOOOOOUUUUU!" I'll never forget this line.

		<fullReview>Loved this film. There are very few films that leave you speechless as the end credits roll, but this is one of them. It does drag in places, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere for long periods, but once you see the complete picture you realise the methodical plot development is necessary. It starts with irrational paranoia, then layers evidence slowly on top, until you actually start wanting Jeff Bridges character to succeed. And best of all, you think he is doing ...I don't mind if films are too far fetched, I like stories that twist, and this one certainly does that. There aren't many films that make me go WOW when the twist is revealed... The Game, Angel Heart, House of Games, Sixth Sense , and I can now add Arlington Road to the list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is good movie. No more than that. A nice entertainment.The acting is really excellent, more specifically the Tim Robbins character, although Jeff Bridges &amp; Joan Cusack are great too. I have to say also that what were also amazing were the action sequences... very realistic in contrast with most of the modern action-thriller movies. The blood component is quite efficient here. Another thing to remark is the twisted ending it has... not a chance someone could guess it 5 minutes before it happens.But the movie has one important flaw. In my opinion, the movie gets too long... there is a lack of action in the first 45 minutes that makes them sort of tedious, the film could be 15 minutes shorter. The other thing I did not like is the Jeff Bridgess girlfriend character...As I said, overall is a good movie, no more than that.I rate this movie with a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ehren Kruger's first film sets him on the right ROAD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice houses, quiet streets, calm neighborhood, friendly neighbors. What more could you ask for? Nothing. If you have all that, you've got it made......that is, unless you are Michael Faraday. Michael is a teacher by day, paranoid father by night. Did I mention Michael taught an anti-terrorism class at George Washington University in D.C.? Ah, now everything's coming into place and you are beginning to realize where the paranoia comes from....kinda. One day on his way home from work, Michael sees a child on a road and stops to see what is wrong. The child is severely burned from a fireworks incident during March. In doing so, Michael saves the child's life. That gains the trust of neighbors Oliver and Cheryl Lang. Oliver and Cheryl are too good to be true. Nice house, they are extremely friendly, always smiling, waving, brings their children to Discovery groups, and their children are even well mannered. There's more to this family than meets the eye.....or is there? Michael seems to think so and is set on finding out. Paranoia suddenly becomes his middle name. He starts to act strange, talk strange, act obsessive, he's driving everyone who cares about him away from him. Michael starts looking up information on the Langs. And that's all I'll say about the plot. Casting director Ellen Chenoweth knows her stuff. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusak were chillingly believable as the "perfect" neighbors next door. Jeff Bridges, who is one of the many great actors in Hollywood (not saying Robbins isn't a great actor) gave another great performance as a man desperate to find the truth. There are a few errors in this film that are too unbelievable to be real but the rest of the movie makes up for it. I found it pretentious in ONLY the way that it thought EVERYONE would be at the EXACT place that they needed to be for the plan(s) to work, without them knowing it....and they were there. This is a freshman script from newcomer Ehren Kruger who has been brought in to co-write Scream 3. Arlington's script is fast, witty, sharp, suspenseful and sophisticated with an ending that will blow your mind. Even after the second to last plot twist was addressed, I didn't even get it until I saw it with my own eyes. I may live to regret this sentence, but Mr. Kruger may make Scream 3 worthwhile.</fullReview>

At times it is slow and drags.. but it is all essential to explaining who and what things are.Later in the movie you do get some action, but that is not what this movie is about.

		<fullReview>I didn't like Arlington Road the first time I saw it--when it was called the Parallax View and starred Warren Beatty. The lameness of the third act was only outdone by the dullness of the first act and the boring stuff in between.The acting was fine, but the story was totally implausible. Since when did terrorists develop the ability to read minds? Everytime a scare is needed one of the terrorists shows up out of the blue to give Jeff Bridges a good fright (even though there's no reason for them to be there).The "shocking" ending is only shocking in how idiotic it is. The movie does such an obvious job setting up Jeff Bridges' character as an anti-government type that I knew the ending by the second reel. The terrorists' plan is so silly it could only happen in films such as this one (and The Game and The Parallax View). At least The Game was entertaining and the Parallax View had a really good director to "sorta" save it.Arlington Road's competant performances have no chance of saving it. Rating 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

Faraday is befriended by the Langs and everything seems to be going along smoothly until Faraday begins to suspect that his new neighbors may not be what they seem to be.As Faraday begins to investigate Lang's background, the tension begins to build and his life is turned upside down. What he finds could mean an impending disaster.Jeff Bridges is excellent as Faraday displaying a wide range of emotions as the story unfolds. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are alternately charming and chilling as the mysterious neighbors.The last half hour of the film is not to be missed. The tension builds to an unexpected climax. The ending clears up many of the questions that arise during the course of the story. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a very disappointing ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road is one of those movies with a thoughtful setup but the flaws become all too apparent when you realize them. I managed to enjoy through most of the film but some flaws will easily strike you. Example, Faraday's plea to "raise the flag" when earlier in the film he's apparently bitter because in part due to the FBI "flag". And why does he continue teaching when he'll just always come so close to tears? No one would continue in a work like this if it only brings them pain. And then as Roger Ebert said, there's the redundant research via the old newspaper when Faraday's should have had all his info from the internet. Just so, the bad guy knows what he's up to.The good parts about this movie? Well, the acting is generally good, but pretty much what can be expected of Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins. On the technical side, theres the scene as one imdb user noted where the conversations manages to switch from one side to the other.I'm sure we are to root for Faraday, but the ending stinks. There's just nary even a small measure of victory for the good guys. Audiences hate this kind of tragic ending (although admittedly it was a surprising one). Two movies come to my mind after watching this: Seven and Fallen. In Seven, Brad Pitt didn't give a whit about the villain's moral standpoint. In Fallen, Denzel Washington at least did to Azazel what most others failed to do.The verdict: 2.5 of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay study in paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was entertaining enough, but left me feeling unsatisfied and shrugging my shoulders. The opening sequence is filmed in a very jarring, loud, over-heated way, like a heavy metal music video, but then the film calms down to a more normal style. Why this was done,and to what purpose, I can't tell you. What follows is a not very plausible study in modern urban paranoia preying on fears of right-wing terrorism and militia movements. As seems to be the case with many modern suspense films, what starts out as creepy and unsettling degenerates before the end into wild-eyed hysteria and incoherant unbelievablity. Jeff Bridges, who can be a fine actor, is required to become totally unhinged by the end of the film, a quality he doesn't perform well. Whenever he starts doing weird things with his voice (like in "The Mirror Has Two Faces" and "The Vanishing"), that strange strangled voice thing, you know he's not at his best. I didn't think he used to look much like his brother Beau, but as he ages he's looking more and more like him - its uncanny at moments in this film. Tim Robbins is defeated by his role and gives one of his worst performances, and, while its nice to see Joan Cusack in a non-comedic role she could have been great in, she's given almost nothing to do except stand around in the background. Brownie points for going all the way with the ending, but too many plot holes and logic gaps along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One That Will Be Overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I walked to my car from the theater after seeing this movie, I was very dismayed at it because it not only stepped out of the bounds of the typical Hollywood movie, it got a running start and leaped over them. Then on the drive home, I realized that I absolutely loved this movie for the exact same reason. It's hard to write a review of this movie because I really want to tell the ending, but I hate when people do that before I've seen a movie, so I won't. All I would like to say is that this is my number one movie for 1999, but it will probably be overlooked at Oscar time because it did not bring in the money that some of the other movies did. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm ashamed that I payed money to watch a bad remake of the 1974 film "the Parallax View." The original was directed by Alan J. Pakula and should be referenced to whenever anyone talks of "Arlington Road."The Arlington Road ending was a bit too unbelievable. Although, I realize that ignorant people like this type of ending, they should know that it has a higher potential, such as, "The Game" or "the Parallax View." In fact, the only good thing that I thought should be noticed is some of the sound work on the film. There's a scene in which Faraday (Bridges) and his girlfriend (Davis) are talking to the Langs (Robbins)(Cusack) . The director chose to use an effect that went from conversation to conversation using fades. It's really well done. It's too bad not everything else was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed the original release of this movie, but finally saw it on DVD. I was initially turned off by the rather lukewarm reviews, but what I saw was a terrific, intelligent thriller, based on current events that are almost too close to home. The director kept the tension nice and taut throughout the movie, building the suspense much like the ride up to the top of a roller coaster, and suddenly letting it go. Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges were inspired casting choices for the two major characters, and Joan Cusack is terrific as always. The movie's disturbing story was probably a turn-off to a lot of people looking for a couple of hours of mindless entertainment, but it's definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

Cusack was great as a facade of the perfect housewife and mother and, as everyone says about this movie, the ending is a bit of a surprise (especially because the baddies get away with it).

Everything seems to fall neatly into place, until the very end. Then, when your eyes are finally opened to the truth, you feel like someone just woke you up by throwing a bucket of acid in your face. Michael Faraday is a college professor teaching a course in Domestic Terrorism. After meeting his new neighbors, he begins to suspect them of nefarious doings. He continues his research into their background, and his suspicions solidify. Mr. Faraday begins a crusade to stop these suspected domestic terrorists from committing their next unspeakable crime. Mr. Faraday thinks he is right, Mr. Faraday thinks he is smart, Mr. Faraday thinks he is in control. Mr. Faraday is in for a horrible shock.And so are you if you watch this movie.

		<fullReview>From the first few minutes of this film, you know you aren't going to witness the usual government terrorist thriller. You aren't going to witness a hammy BLOWN AWAY-like heap of garbage. You know exactly what you are going to feel during the whole ride and how you are going to feel after it's over.And that's waaaaay before the paranoia starts. Directed by Mark Pellington, who has very unusual angles with his cameras (sometimes I felt I was hanging over characters), we are given an American suburban nightmare. A man (Jeff Bridges) who's family, and the remaining strands of his life, are in danger when he comes closer and closer to finding a terrorist in the neighborhood.It's not too surprising to figure out who that is, what is surprising, and confusing, is how he gets away with his plan. Tim Robbins is one of my favorite, underrated actors. I knew he could play a villain from Robert Altman pictures like THE PLAYER and SHORT CUTS, but I never knew I could be terrified of him! And even while you fear him or hate him, you always see his point behind his actions, although they are drastic, and not the answer.I liked Jeff Bridges, but Tim gave the better performance. What I also liked the use of supporting characters. Hope Davis could have been so wasted as the girlfriend, but she comes out as a key player as she deals with the frustration of Bridges looking back on his dead wife and watching him grow paranoid and go out of his mind. Also good is Robert Gossett as Bridges' friend and collegue in the FBI and Joan Cusack, who uses her unusually warm smile in a very icy way.The only problem I had was the lagging pace the film had. It never really had a good rhythm with some of the very suspenseful scenes. And nothing, except the end of course, matched the feeling I felt in the beginning.Still, Mark Pellington and cinematographer Bobby Bukowski gives us a bleached, corrosive world under a plastic suburban security in Ehren Kruger's frightening screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something unconvincing in this movie. It starts brilliantly and the suspense mounts on and on. But when the complete truth comes out ... Would it be a B-movie you will accept the description of this terrorism secret society that operates underground, (that is openly, just the regular family the next door), and the party of terrorists chatting and smiling reminds you of some Carpenter or Romero movies. But the movie pretends to be serious, so that at the end you expect a more persuasive explanation of the intricate final plan, which has something of the incredible. I would contest something even about the acting of Bridges and Hutton. Jeff Bridges, in particular, is overperforming his dramatic role, so that you do not have any surprise, because his grave appearance, hardly changing in any circumstance, makes you expect the worse, which regularly happens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would appear that this is one of those movies that you love or you hate. I loved it.At first, I confess, I was a bit of a reluctant viewer, put off by some negative reviews here, and as it started I was alarmed by the MTV'ish filming style, funny colours, loud soundtrack and wondered what I had got myself into, but I was totally absorbed from the first scene. It is loud, the camera work is unusual with lots of close ups and different angles - but it works magnificently.It is also the kind of movie that you have to watch and pay attention. I think it was very cleverly done. We are lulled into believing it is a rather ho-hum kind of movie, - regular teaching guy figures out a dastardly plot and saves the world - but ..... things are not as they seem. I don't think anyone sees what is really going on. And then to realise that the poor guy has been set up right from the word go - chilling.It was most effective to see the news reports after the event, because we in effect have lived the whole thing through Jeff Bridges' eyes and know what happened. It is horrifying to think that the press may be that easily manipulated, and that we the public believe everything we read without really thinking about it. The authorities are relieved to have a nice neat version of events, because it makes them look effective and they can stop worrying because they've found the bad guy, we don't have a clue what really goes on, and the worst thing is that the real evil is still out there.I can see why some people hated this movie, it cuts a little too close to the bone and bumps you out of your comfort zone.</fullReview>

The trailer led me to believe that this could possibly be an exceptional action movie like "Three Days of the Condor".Unfortunately the movie didn't scale those heights, but it still isn't a bad movie and I have to hand it to the producers for putting in an ending that isn't typical. I watched the movie up to the part where it was clear that the bad guys were going to go after his family for retribution. C'mon. How many dozens and dozens of times have we seen that obvious attempt to draw us in?I was disgusted that this movie was going the way of all the others, so when the phone rang I skipped the ending to talk with a buddy. My wife watched the movie to the end and encouraged me to pick up where I left off.I won't reveal the ending, but I found it unique and interesting . If you are a fan of the action genre, there is a good chance that you will like this movie better than I did. If you expect Tim Robbins to turn a good movie into an exceptional movie, you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

Jeff Bridges is also excellent as the unwilling participant in Tim Robbins games. What is really great about this film, is that the setting is so normal, like an ordinary suburban neighborhood, but behind the normality there is something very sinister. The film plays with this, draws it out and slowly unravels the plot, piecing together the puzzle. Its not difficult to guess the plot as such, but the ending will definitely leave you breathless.

		<shortDescription>Intellectually and cinematically irresponsible, despite some good performances..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most insidious crime Arlington Road commits is that it offers the impression it is on one side of the terrorism question while it endorses another. A film may argue that anti-terrorism might be the cause of terrorism, or at the very least, feed its fires; however, it is irresponsible to switch positions midstream without regard to what has been set up in its exposition or what follows in its climax.Arlington Road's writer, Ehren Kruger, and director, Mark Pellington, present the protagonist (Michael Faraday, played by Jeff Bridges), for whom we initially have great sympathy, in such a grating and irritating manner that we eventually hope for his undoing. Faraday teaches a college course in terrorism and yells his pain throughout the entire movie; but he is not merely a man trapped in the middle of the question. For all of his angst about the senseless death of his wife (an FBI agent killed in a quasi Ruby Ridge scenario), Faraday more or less represents the government position, viz., that society needs to be made safe from terrorism by a judicious application of anti-terrorism. And as the audience comes to reject the protagonist's noisesome barking and amateurish interventions, we also reject the government. We long for the success of the terrorists.I am not offended because terrorism is presented sympathetically by Tim Robbins and by much of the film's emotionally laden detail, but that it has no equally powerful reply. Faraday is too obsessed and exhausted to engage us on any level except fear, precisely what I had always felt to be the motivating factor for terrorism. Anti-terrorism, on the other hand, is motivated by power and control. These positions are reversed in Arlington Road.This duality might have engendered an interesting contest (I believe it was the intention), but the solution in this film is intellectually irresponsible for the above and other reasons, and not least because its final climax isn't remotely sustained by the action that precedes it. If you are going to present an argument, there has to be a rational, linear scenario to support it. In the context of an intellectual thriller (such as The Parallax View, which this film sort of resembles, as opposed to your typical Stallone or 007 vehicle), a bomb simply can't simply materialize where you least expect it unless it could plausibly have gotten there. The ironic and multi-layered fallout from the unexpected bomb, which is the point of Arlington Road's argument, is thereby undone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of this movie is rather slow but has elements that make you think and it doesn't really get going until just short of the first hour of the 1 hour 52 minutes (approx).The cinematography is well done with lots of dark scenes and great use of the 2.35:1 framing making you think there's someone just out of shot about to pounce which turns out to be the case a few times.You put yourself in Michael's (Jeff Bridges) position a couple of times wondering what you'd do but realize you couldn't do much. Bridges plays the parent about to crack up very well and drives a car very well, or his stunt driver does with some good chase scenes. Tim Robbins plays a solemn character well, similar to his Shawshank role but with a more human touch, if that's possible for his character.The plot is very simple to follow with no hidden agenda other than the whole point of the movie which you don't discover until the end when the whole thing fits into place.Without giving the plot away there's not much else I could say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danger ! This movie might change your consciousness of neighborhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first brilliant movie I 've seen this year. It is that kind of movie, you will not forget - especially the ending.First there was "Silence of the Lambs", than there came "Seven" and now there is "Arlington Road". I've not heard very much of this film before because it has not started in the USA yet, and there are not many critics, so I had no special expectation. And this was the right feeling to watch this film. First it takes time to become interesting, but after a while you are drowned into a thrillride, it's hard to describe. And at the end, I promise, you will be shocked. It's a totally non-Hollywood-like all time classic. Beware of your nerves !!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bleak, pessimistic little thriller of a film, which failed to be a blockbuster but wowed audiences no less. A top notch cast, a clever story and oodles of suspense help to make this a much underrated gem of a film, much like the previous year's BREAKDOWN, with Kurt Russell.The plot is a pure product of the '90s, following in the same government conspiracy steps as stuff like ENEMY OF THE STATE. Jeff Bridges, as the paranoid, wacko hero, bears more than a passing resemblance to the X-FILES' Fox Mulder, with both guys having their own conspiracy theories (and nobody believing them). The structure of the film is very good, with the first hour moving slowly and being the basic set-up, then the next half hour moving up a notch into a fast-moving race against the clock to find out the truth, until the last twenty minutes which turn into sheer adrenaline pumping horror.The cast are all great in this film, with the acting honours going to Tim Robbins (THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) who does a great portrayal of an apparently innocent man who turns out to be a terrorist and a murderer. Jeff Bridges is solid as the nutty, on the edge teacher whose theories grow more and more outlandish as time goes on, and we really feel for him by the time the credits roll. With able support from the two female leads helping to give the film a well-rounded feel in the acting stakes, as well as a realistic turn from the guy playing the FBI man, the acting really can't be faulted for this film.It's the direction, though, which makes everything excellent. The plot twists and turns and little, unnoticeable things turn out to have major consequences. Thankfully, for a change we aren't always one step ahead of the main character, we too (as an audience) are surprised and shocked by the events which occur. There is also a commendably hard edge to the film too, with many 'good' characters dying, it's not often we see a young boy being graphically gunned down in cold blood.There is little in the way of action until a top-notch car chase in the last twenty minutes, which is edge of the seat stuff, but then there doesn't need to be either. Disturbingly brilliant, this is a film which will make you think just who could be behind the door across the street. It left me feeling exhausted, disappointed and yet satisfied at the same time. The highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.The movie wasn't a neat fit and considering the subject matter, I didn't expect it to be.I expected unanswered questions. I didn't mind that either.The only other film I've seen Tim Robbins in was "Mystic River." I liked his performance in this as well.I don't think I've ever seen a film with Jeff Bridges, so I didn't know what to expect.I also enjoyed his performance. And the small role of Joan Cusack was effective.I think past history was the star of this film. If you're aware of two events that are being referenced throughout, it seems that the characters go along for the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ever reliable Jeff Bridges takes the lead as a grieving college professor, Michael Faraday, who suspects his creepy new neighbour (Tim Bobbins) of being a terrorist mastermind plotting in America - but is he just paranoid? Its Bridges sense of grieving t hat adds to this film by placing a possibly ruthless terrorist intent on murder against someone living with the consequences o f loss which Tim Bobbin's character will cause in others, loss and bereavement. The director could have pushed this further but when do you get all you want out of a film?This slick psychological thriller, with its chilling final twist maintains its atmosphere and paranoia right to the end and posed disturbing questions in the wake of the Oklahoma bombing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conspiracy Theorists Will LOVE "Arlington Road"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood hasn't made a literate white-knuckled conspiracy thriller like director's Mark Pellington's "Arlington Road" in many moons. The genre ran out of steam in the late 1970s. The late Alan J. Pakula came closest to capturing the essence of the conspiracy thriller with two memorable efforts "The Parallax View" (1974) and "All The President's Men" (1976). Oliver Stone revived the genre briefly with "JFK," but this star-studded marathon as good as it was lacked the visceral qualities of either Alfred Hitchcock's work or Pakula's pictures. Nothing about "JFK" surprised audiences. Stone, a filmmaker more controversial than any controversy he aroused, concerned himself more with uncovering the truth than captivating moviegoers. Indeed, David Miller's "Executive Action" (1973), a penny-thrifty thriller about the Kennedy assassination, entertains more than "JFK" on a fraction of its modest budget. Richard Donner's "Conspiracy Theory" (1997) and George P. Cosmatos' "Shadow Conspiracy" (1996) vanished almost as quickly as they showed up. Playwright David Mamet recaptured the ambiance of the conspiracy thriller with "The Spanish Prisoner", but the studio packed it off to the video rental shelves without much thought. Happily, after some doubts about whether it would open itself, "Arlington Road" made it to the big-screen. If he were alive, Alfred Hitchcock would probably applaud Mark Pellington for picking up where he left off."Arlington Road" appropriates many of Hitchcock's conventions. Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges of "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot") resembles the quintessential Hitchcock hero. He is an average Joe with a white-collar job. He doesn't sleep with a gun under his pillow, and he doesn't careen around in a souped-up sports car with fancy gadgets. He wears a necktie instead of a pistol. Actually, he teaches American history, and he is a widowed, single-father raising his nine-year old son, Grant Faraday (Spencer Clark Treat). Further, Hitchcock staged scenes of nail-gnawing suspense in the least dangerous settings. Remember the sun-lit cornfield in "North by Northwest?" Or the shower in "Psycho?" Or the church in "Vertigo?" Similarly, the action in "Arlington Road" takes place in areas usually considered crime free. Wide open public meeting areas, shopping malls, well-lit university classrooms, and the idyllic seclusion of the suburbs, replete with backyard barbecues and dinner parties with wholesome neighbors. The people that made "Arlington Road" rely on this deceptive faade of tranquility to distract audiences long enough before they hit them with the year's best paranoid thriller."Arlington Road" opens with chilling images of a juvenile, Brady Lang (Mason Gamble), shambling down the middle of a street in an upper-middle-class, Virginia suburb on a bright sunny day. He clutches the charred stump of his hands. Blood dribbles onto his sneakers. Driving home from George Washington University where he lectures about terrorism, Michael Faraday spot the injured youth and speeds him to the emergency room. Michael neither knows who Brady is nor where he lives. Later, at the hospital, Brady's grateful parents, Oliver (Tim Robbins of "Mystic River") and his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack of "Grosse Pointe Blank"), arrive and thank him. Initially, Michael is surprised to learn that the Langs live across the street from him. Oliver explains that Brady hurt himself while apparently fooling around with fireworks, but he dismisses the accident as nothing more than "a failed rocketry experiment." Gradually, a closely knit relationship develops between Michael and the Langs. At the same time, Brady and Grant become fast friends. "Our house is your house," Cheryl says with irony: "We're here for you, we really are." At a dinner party, Faraday introduces the Langs to Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis of "The Matador"), a former graduate student who is now his girlfriend and colleague. Cheryl compliments them; they make a cute couple. Oliver exhibits the work he does as a structural architect. Cheryl confines herself to the home as the happy housewife that never complains while she rears their two daughters and son. Apparently, the only difference between the Langs and TV's "Brady Bunch" is three children and a housekeeper.Meanwhile, "Reindeer Games" scenarist Ehren Kruger's award-winning script parcels out bits and pieces of exposition about Michael. Faraday's late wife (Laura Poe) worked for the FBI and died tragically in the line-of-duty when the Feds bungled a raid on the cabin of a suspected terrorist. "Leah died for her country," Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), Leah's old partner at the FBI, consoles Michael. "She didn't have to," Michael shakes his head in grief at her gravesite. Grant still suffers from the loss of his mom and bridles at the presence of Brooke, the new woman in Faraday's life. Michael himself has not totally recovered his Leah's death and pours his anxieties into his lectures about terrorism. As a history professor, Michael enjoys lecturing about domestic terrorism. He promotes conspiracy theories in the classroom and provides his students with hand-outs teeming with photos and news articles about anarchy. He refuses to believe that a single individual, no matter how resourceful, could carry out an act of terrorism on American soil without help."The Mothman Prophecies" director Mark Pellington acquits himself admirably as a cinematic stylist of the highest order. After a whirlwind opening, Pellington lets the dust settle and carefully lets the tension build. Although Michael and the Langs grow closer as friends, our hero ferrets out incriminating evidence about the Langs that surprises and then disturbs him. He alienates his own son and Brooke thinks that he has lost his mind. As it turns out, Oliver isn't the man that he claims to be and Michael has the college year books to prove his point. Lenser Bobby Bukowski and Pellington surround Faraday with darkness and isolate him in their pictorial compositions. Even Wit Carver has doubts about Michael's sanity and warns him that he is heading toward oblivion. Pellington frames Faraday in increasingly tighter close-ups to suggest the mental claustrophobia that his crusade is causing him. Altogether, conspiracy theorists will want to watch "Arlington Road" over and over, especially in light of 9/11.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rarity: Good Old Fashioned Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When College-Professor Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who teaches classes on domestic terrorism, rescues the young child of his new neighbor Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins), he becomes a little perturbed that he never even got to know the family that lives across the street. Suffering from the loss of his wife, who died on an FBI mission against suspected terrorists, and taking refuge in the love of his new girl-friend Brooke (Hope Davis) and young son Grant, Faraday starts taking more interest in the Lang family. Though appearing the perfect neighbors: kind, friendly, helpful, Faraday stumbles upon some strange things that he investigates, leading him to unravel the dangerous and disturbing secrets that lie hiding in this sleepy, All-American street...'Arlington Road', to say the least, has its roots firmly where all thrillers should: in paranoia. It plays off the universal phobia that there are dangerous horrors living right under our noses that we just can't see, and it does a fantastic job. As well as this, it is a suspenseful tale of trust, secrets, morals and what people will do to protect what they believe in. Admittedly, it is best to view it with absolutely no idea what it is about: some of the commercials have the flaw of compromising the film's mystique. But ultimately, this is a very effective thriller that works on more levels that screenplay writer Ehrun Kruger (The Ring) probably intended.First, the obviously qualities: it's a good, old-fashioned paranoid thriller with very fine acting performances, from both Bridges and Robbins. There is a definite element of slow reveal about the two main characters; they are not what they appear to be. IF you are lucky, there will be some confusion over who is bad and who is good, and a little bit of delving into what bad and good really are. Plus, the title gives it a wonderful atmosphere of darkness and secrecy in what appears to be peaceful suburbia.Besides the elements it has as just a thriller, the film is historically very interesting. Made after the Timothy McVeigh bombings, but before 9/11, it deals with terrorism as a domestic problem, which is radically different to how American society views it today. There is also some heavy subtext about the nature of the McVeigh bombings, which is a very brave thing to bring up, however subliminally. Faraday's classes delve quite deeply into what motivates terrorists, rather than condemning them for their actions. But for those not interested in all that jazz, this quiet little film will serve as superior thriller, well acted, well directed and well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intricate Plot, Pay Attention, It's Worth it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so intricate; I thought it was based on a John Le Carre espionage novel. However, it appears that Arlington Road was written directly as a movie rather than adapted from previous material. I have no idea whether a complex plot is more difficult to build as a novel versus a screenplay but as I recall how tightly elements fit together or set up other elements, I am just amazed. Ehren Kruger (WGA) must have tremendous mental dexterity (or copious notes!). This film is not fully digested at the time of viewing.In particular, as many other folks have mentioned, the ending was particularly upsetting. I found myself thinking, "NO! This isn't the way it's supposed to end!" Indeed, I was so troubled by the moral ambiguity of the ending that I played out alternate endings in my mind for several days; endings where the good guy comes out on top.Eventually, I got it. I realized that had Mr. Kruger given us the 'good guys always win' kind of ending, it would have diminished the quality and integrity of the story. I mean, for the story HE wrote, it actually ended the perfect way for THAT particular story. After all, Jeff Bridges was not blown up and did not really die. It was just a character; a make-believe character in a make-believe story. In the case of Arlington Road, the make-believe college professor HAD to end the way he did because his role in the story was over but the bad guys' roles were supposed to go on, yet another day.Like most people, that fact goes against the grain of my own sensibilities and moral compass but Arlington Road is NOT real life; it is art. From a strictly artistic point of view, the way Ehren Kruger (WGA) penned it is seamless (perfect).What I liked least about the film was the directing. Before Arlington Road, Mark Pellington's experience has been mostly music videos. U2's Achtung Baby, Pearl Jam and television. I think that this story is strong enough that it would be excellent for a remake with a good director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, that I heard a lot about this movie. People said that it had one of the best plot twists ever. Well, only proves the fact that may people haven't seen too many movies or only very bad ones (go see "witness of the prosecution" to see a real plot twist)...I have to admit, the first 30 minutes or so are okay. However, the lead by Bridges is a major letdown. Hey, I did not care for him for one second. Why? Because all about him hinted to the "twist". Come on guy. This character has the "secret" of the ending all written over him - in capital letters.If anyone has any doubt about how the movie will end after the lecture he gives to his students - sorry, it's just too plain obvious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out kinda slow, but after a while a suspense is starting to build up. This part of the movie is pretty good and well worth watching. The acting is good, especially by Jeff. The big problem is the ending, which isn't very good or realistic. Ok, I couldn't predict it (I dont think anyone can), but the terrorists' plan is just too unrealistic and improbable to be taken seriously. It seems like the writer first came up with a cool and unexpected ending and then made a sequence of improbable events just to make the ending happen. Too bad, the movie could have been much better. I completely agree with wappfalls5. Rating: 7 for the first 90 minutes, 3 for the last 20.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some plot twists do nothing but insult the intelligence of the viewer. For example, how many movies do you see where the police sets up a main character (without his consent) to almost get killed just to get the evidence to put away the bad guy. Meanwhile, before all is said and done, the good guy has nearly been killed several times and has survived with no help from the cop. (As if the cop knew that the bad guy would just miss the victim by inches with 6 bullets.) And viewers are supposed to believe that a cop would knowingly risk the life of an innocent victim just to get that one extra piece of evidence, and not tell him about it.But this movie goes far beyond that. And I am not saying that it is the only one that does so, but this one was just laughable. I am referring to the ending, so this will contain SPOILERS.So, Tim Robbins has set up this one huge terrorist act. Obviously, he knows he basically has one shot at it. So he would plan it VERY carefully, and have many back up plans, right? I mean, toward the end, while fighting with Jeff Bridges, he even asks Bridges, "Did you really think I would leave anything to chance?"But the ridiculous thing is, that is EXACTLY what he did! His bombing plot hinged on so many ridiculous things happening that just all happened to fall into place. For example...What if Jeff Bridges was able to convey to the FBI agent the plot via the cell phone? He might not have continued to drive there. What if, after losing sight of the delivery van carrying his son, Bridges never spotted the other van on the crowded street. Or, what if he had caught up to the first van and grabbed his son? Or, what if the FBI security did NOT allow Bridges car to get into the parking garage. (This is a HUGE assumption to make, especially when plotting such a major terrorist act.)Now, banking on ONE of these things working out the way Robbins' planned is ridiculous enough. But banking a huge plot on ALL of the above happening just as planned is completely unimaginable. Again, it is an insult to the viewers to try to make them think that just because that is the way it DOES happen, that it is reasonable for a criminal genius to plan it that way.It would be a little like a bomber setting up an elaborate plot to bomb Las Vegas, so he sets up a bomb that somehow will detonate when a certain roulette wheel hits on 21, 10, 00, 30, 35, 6 on consecutive spins. Could it happen? Sure. But someone is not going to have their plans hinge on that unlikely outcome. Like I said, Arlington Road is not the only movie to do this. But it stands out as particularly laughable because of Tim Robbins actually pointing out that the rest of the movie was carefully "planned" by him. So the movie basically pointed out its own shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Setup Wasted/Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road had my attention for about the first forty minutes, but then it became ridiculously unbelievable. The notion that dedicated anti-government terrorists would attempt to establish themselves as normal middle class folks in an upscale suburban neighborhood defies everything we know about such radicals in the real world. That they would(as the film implies)go through this elaborate charade in order to recruit the college professor husband of a deceased FBI agent (who was killed investigating another potential domestic terrorist)is ludicrously silly. Jeff Bridges is usually a reliable actor, but here his character is required to engage in such illogical behavior that no actor could make his actions convincing. I actually found his character so annoying that I was hitting the fast forward button with regularity in the films final 40 minutes. Tim Robbins is another fine actor, but here he required to play a character who goes from a master at disguising his true character to a cliched Hollywood notion of a right wing boogeyman, all in the blink of a couple scenes. I could go on, but I will probably never convince those who think this is a good movie that it is really a half-baked piece of tripe, with no relationship to the real world. Also wastes Hope Davis, one of my favorite young actresses, as Bridges' graduate student girlfriend (an all too true cliche), who goes from scoffing Bridges' paranoia to foolishly following the terrorists, again with no character motivation. This is a movie made by people with contempt for their audience. They pretend to deal with an important topic, only to exploit it for cheap action thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the unpredictability of terrorism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I worked in the World Trade Center and personally saw it crumble before my eyes on September 11, 2001 along with the wonderful faces who once worked there as well. In reading other comments for Arlington Road, I noticed many users stating that this movie may prove disturbing after the terrorist attacks. I agree. However, I disagree with those who challenge the ending of the film. Despite the ridiculous details which I shall leave unmentioned to preserve the content for those who have not seen it, the film projects a realistic view of terrorism: terrorism can strike anywhere and can assume any identity. In the past, Americans have identified our enemies in some form... whether it be the Nazis and Japanese of World War II, the Communists of the Cold War and Southeast Asian Conflicts, etc. In the past, America's greatest technology could detect the setting up of nuclear missiles in Cuba or the mobilization of troops in Iraq. As we approach the 21st century, our new enemies hide in the "shadows" by blending into every day, normal life. As hinted by the trailers and the film itself, Arlington Road sends the message that a terrorist can even be the neighbor down the street. How many individuals felt shell-shocked when they discovered that their neighbors were responsible for causing the worst terrorist attack in American history?! I recommend Arlington Road for those interested in suspense and not hell-bent on seeing a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressions about the film "Arlington Road"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI enjoyed this film very much, but it aroused in me a lot of doubts: what makes a "normal" person become a mercyless terrorist? How much can justice fail? The thing that scared me most was that the main character, who has fought with all his strength against an organization that looks like an army, fails, dies and, above all, is accused of the crime, and nobody even thinks that he was used by the terrorists. The main character has suspects about his neighbour, and even the latter tests him to see if he can embrace the cause of terrorism against the government. When the terrorist realizes that his "dear" neighbour will never support his cause, tries to keep him away from his plans and even kidnaps his son. In the end the terrorist has to kill his neighbour in the slaughter in Oklahoma City, using him as a carrier for the bomb. Another frightening reality that emerges from the film is that in America terrorists hide themselves among unsuspectable people: a father of three children, a scout instructor, a university student... In the end the terrorists in the film want to hit a government led by corrupted politicians, but when a faction uses violence, it always fails, and only the innocents pay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating: 9/10This movie grabbed me by the nuts within the first 5 minutes and didn't let go. I was instantly intrigued by Arlington Road's professionality and its love for its characters. It really likes to play with your mind and even in the first few minutes or so, Arlington Road's twists and turns give you the chillie willies. The movie explores the characters and their emotions before going into the thrills, and it worked like a charm. I wish all thrillers were like this, but Arlington Road is a rare kind, it's unique, brilliantly made and amazingly scripted. The mood and atmosphere of Arlington Road is creepy and misty and the way above-average techno horror soundtrack matches all the chilling sequences is neat. The performances are outstanding, with Jeff Bridges giving an excellent performance of a man whose paranoia is slowing killing him, while Tim Robbins is wonderfully evil and mysterious as the not-so-nice next door neighbour. Joan Cusack is a great supporting character but she should've had more to do with the evil side of things. The movie has one of the most chilling opening sequences of 1999 and the climax is brilliant and gut punching and it is one of the best in any movie of any year. The movie scared the nachos out of me and definitely made me think about my next door neighbours. The film's goals are certainly achieved and as far as I know, it is highly praised by critics and viewers. The script is written by Ehren Kruger who also wrote Scream 3. I loved that movie but not half as much as I love this one. Ehren has done a bang-up job on his script and he packs in plenty of depth, chills and tension. Add to that Mark Pellington's fabulous, focused and full-on direction, the extremely satisfying acting and you get perfection in almost all areas of filmmaking. A jolting psychological thriller, and one of the smartest dramas of 1999!</fullReview>

The messages were many, but clear:First, those of us who like to think of the world as a happy place and people as inherently good should realize just how much this plays into the hands of criminals.Second, when someone is being messed with on this level, we tend to see them as crazy.Third, there are groups out there which seek to undermine the US government. I noticed many allegories to the McVeigh case, almost as if the directors were trying to tell us that it was impossible for him to have acted alone. Note that the killers in movie went out of their way to make it seem like this.This is a must-see for all. I don't think I've ever seen a more compelling picture.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSI can understand the pleas from the empty-headed reviews that all want a typical Hollywood schlock machine syrupy happy ending. Good movies don't have always have happy endings-especially when a happy ending feels contrived and doesn't fit in the plot.The story of this movie is that the terrorists pick Faraday (J. Bridges) precisely because of who he is and the history between his character and the FBI- he has motive and opportunity. In other words, he is the ideal fall guy because no one will question that he did it and acted alone. if Oliver recruited someone else as the stooge ?someone without the dead FBI agent spouse, someone who just an ordinary teacher, rather than someone who devoted his career to studying terrorists, there would be many more question concerning the reason for that person's participation in the bombing of FBI HQ.By the way-who cares whether they had a backup plan? They invested significant effort in Faraday but if it fails, so what-they will find someone or something else to target. As far as their little slip-ups -- DUHH! Their whole modus operandi was to tempt Faraday into feeding his own paranoia and it worked-exactly as they planned. I agree that sometime things don't always work as planned, but sometimes they do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not good. Plain and simple. Beyond the basic implausibility, everything was hokey and contrived. Everything was pretty much inserted at random intervals to make the movie work. From bad dialogue - when Tim Robbins at the end shouts "It's too late!" to Jeff Bridges, who is running to stop the bomb (I thought I was going to fall off the couch) - to precision timing (hey neighbor, I am just going to come over your house while you are asleep and catch you with my yearbook).The only saving grace (besides the fact that the movie finally ended) was Joan Cusack. Her face conveyed so much without even saying a word - I was riveted by her, as I usually always am. My rating - 1 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Arlington Road" is probably the best film I have ever seen belonging to the "I feel quite paranoid today"-genre. "Arlington Road" is a good thriller with exceptional acting. I'm talking about Joan Cusack, Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins in the same film here! Three very talented actors and I count all of them among my favourites. The script is very well-written and it's not easy to see where the film is going to end and about that ending? I'm not going to say anything about it except that you will have a lot to think about after the movie's ended, and it's definitely a film worth watching. Sure, there are some clichs in the story, but nothing that is too difficult to overlook.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurd when it's not cliched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible-spoiler warning ... it depends on how closely you read what's below.)What is it with Tim Robbins? Does he think he's fooling anyone? In "Bob Roberts," his self-produced campaign-trail parody, he made it look as if, yes, he the sensitive statist-liberal knew all about supposed home-grown fascists. Now, with "Arlington Road," he pretends to know about where the blame lies for home-grown terrorism -- and the government has -none- of it, nosireebob.The first three-fourths of this mess relies on the Neighbors You Don't Know Enough About That Drive You Crazy stock plot. The final fourth is an Idiot Plot, pure and simple. I won't go into the first type of plot -- it's been trampled on to hilarious effect by Aykroyd and Belushi in "Neighbors," something far more enjoyable. But let's see if I can dissect the second type without providing outright spoilers.What kind of competent conspiracy relies on assuming that cars careening heedlessly through traffic -- especially the wrong way on a divided street -- will -never- be stopped by police? (In Washington, D.C., no less?) On having one of its principals beaten up, to provide an illusory personal victory and to fuel rage? On making sure that collateral murders make the six o'clock news, rather than hiding them in cement overshoes at the bottom of Chesapeake Bay? On having the conspiracy blurted out in many of its brutal details while partygoers are readily within earshot?I'd comment more on how children are manipulated and brutalized in the story line, to create no greater plot benefit than psychological terror, but it'd make for some outright spoilers. Besides, the very same excuses that Robbins's favorite politicos use for increasing the -real- threat of the State to our liberties all rely on "protecting the children," and this just doubles the obscenity involved.(Incidentally, and this is no spoiler, any conspiracy movie that relies on the Bad Guys using the "Liberty Delivery Service" ought to have its artistic license revoked for Overweight Metaphors.)Not the least of the cliches is the overwrought music, never allowing a quiet moment to show its dramatic impact, not when screeching counterpoint can be added.I was bored for 90 minutes, stunned by idiocy for 30. And this time, I knew I had to stay for the pro-government piety that would be found in the credits. I wasn't disappointed. The "Teaching Tolerance Project of the Southern Poverty Law Center" was thanked by the filmmakers. The SPLC considers almost any prominent figure who disagrees with the everywhere-State, as praised by "opponents of terrorism" in real life, to be the near equivalent of a domestic terrorist, or aiding and abetting them. So much for the independent perspective of art.As for Robbins, he should go back to being a sex object, as in "Bull Durham." That, at least, was endurable by those who possess artistic taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe some spoilers... This is a pretty stupid terrorism movie. If the terrorists were generally as clever, well funded, well connected and lucky as they are regarding their main bombing plot, they'd be running the country by now! No need to blow up the odd government building here and there. This movie is suspenseful in some aspects (so I give it a 2), but it's about as obvious as a kick in the groin despite an allegedly surprise ending. Interesting how everything just seems to work out the way the main terror guy wants it to, and he even allows himself to get beaten to a pulp by our history professor "hero/patsy" just to bring his plot to fruition. And having the terrorist gang party with their wives-- featuring K.C. and the Sunshine Band tapes blasting the neighborhood -- a few days before the BIG PLOT IS HATCHED??? (Oh, pu-leez) After further review, I'm not sure whether Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are actually terrorists or POD people exiled from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Obviously the director of this junk was trying to emulate Oliver "The Grand Conspiratorialist" Stone. He should check out the Parallax View and Winter Kills. Finally, let's ask this question of the movie-going public: Don't terrorist movies that feature neo-Nazis, Scandinavians and U.S. anti-government rightwingers as the terrorists seem a bit ridiculous after 9/11?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are bad and you just forget them and move on. Others are almost antagonistic in their awfulness; scene after inept scene seeming to taunt you as if to say "Yeah, we made a lousy movie. What are you gonna do about it, tough guy? Huh?" "Arlington Road" is just such a movie - offensively trying to pass off its limp, worn out storyline as some chillingly topical statement on the growing danger of domestic terrorism.You can be certain a screenplay is bad when it uses the device of having a character furtively uncovering damning evidence only to be startled in the act not once, not twice, not three times, but FOUR times - and within the span of 20 minutes no less! And how stupendously, mind-bendingly improbable is it that Bridges goes to his girlfriend and produces evidence that his neighbor a.) switched names to that of a dead man b.) tried to bomb a facility as a teenager and c.) is known to have a young son who was staggering down the middle of the road in broad daylight with his hand blown off - and she still doesn't see what he's getting at! Bridges even has newspaper clippings and everything!Generally in these kinds of movies, there's at least one salvagably good performance. That's not the case here. Bridges looks extremely frustrated with the obvious inadequacies of the material. Tim Robbins is dour and complacent, no doubt cruising on the irony (as a notorious liberal) of being cast as a right wing extremist. He isn't convincing for a second. As his chipper wife, Joan Cusack is given nothing interesting to do, and in fact is only on screen for maybe six or seven minutes. Hope Davis (as the dense girlfriend) and Gossett, as an FBI friend of Bridges' deceased Bureau wife, are not real characters; they exist only as obligatory skeptics, ostensibly saying to an increasingly frantic Bridges in every scene they're in "Get a grip, man. You're starting to creep me out and uh, that's not cool."I could go on. There's poor editing; a gratuitous, expendable flashback; cumbersome, obvious dialogue; insufficient motivation, gargantuan plot holes - what a mess. Near the end, the images are zooming at you at breakneck speed, and for an instant you might be fooled that you're actually experiencing suspense, but it will quickly pass. And the so-called "surprise ending" is really no surprise at all, certainly nothing to rival the shocker in "The Sixth Sense".Before I close, does anybody really believe that conspiracies can be so flawlessly orchestrated that a vast mosaic of personalities can be easily manipulated into bringing about a desired, precise result? I imagine that if conspiracies do exist there are glitches and loose ends, and unanticipated occurrences and complications. An authentic conspiracy is more than likely one where things don't go quite as planned, but creates such a cloud of confusion that when the smoke clears, nobody can say for certain who was responsible. It seems to me that is the best conspirators can hope for."Arlington Road" wants very much to be an "important" thriller that makes you think. Unfortunately when it's over, the only thing you're left thinking is how much you would've rather been watching the similarly themed and far superior "The Parallax View".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was predictable, cliched, and the conclusions that were jumped to made no sense with the given information. Going in, you know most of the plot from the movie trailers. The only things you don't know are the side stories that seem to be used as fillers. The acting is almost comical at times, though I don't think it's entirely the fault of the actors. This film also has a tendency of not bothering to explain things, like how come all of the characters keep running into each other everywhere. This was the only time I ever left the theatre before the movie ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak characters, weak script, weak performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening five minutes of the movie almost made it worth the price of admission. Had the movie sustained this level of intensity and suspense, it would have been a great film that "Hitchcock would have been proud of" as I have read in some reviews.The trouble begins after the opening credits where the script descends into a plot filled with cliches and riddled with holes. There are things that I liked about this movie - the heart-pounding opening sequence, the flashback scene that Faraday (Jeff Bridges) has about his wife, Joan Cusack's performance - the only believable acting in the film, the interesting lighting used in the film, and of course, the surprise ending that everyone is now hearing about. The rest of the movie however, consists of tired characters and weak performances.The story is about Michael Faraday, a college professor and single dad who obsessed with the mysterious and questionable background of his neighbors, Oliver and Cheryl Lang. Since he teaches a class on American terrorism, guess what? That's right! Oliver seems to be a terrorist. And that's just the first coincidence. Mentioning any more would give away plot. But the characters alone give me plenty to criticize.If it was necessary for Jeff Bridges to go over the top in this film, then he arrived there too early. Once he got to the point of overacting, there was no place for him to go. His character flies off the handle trying to get his girlfriend (Hope Davis) to believe him about his neighbor, and of course, she doesn't. Wouldn't it have added to the tension if Faraday had been a calm, rational person for most of the film? His unusual situation would have contrasted well to an "everyman" approach to his character, rather than the paranoid lunatic he portrays.Tim Robbins, one of my favorite actors, presents no mystery for his character. Again, if his character could have been a normal, intelligent person instead of a wacko, he would have been much more terrifying. Oliver Lang is a stark contrast to his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack). She was the only person that intrigued me.This would have been better as a made-for-cable movie. Then my expectations would have been so low that could not have been let down. Skip this one and watch The Usual Suspects or The Silence of the Lambs again. Better yet, The Man Who Knew Too Much or North by Northwest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WARNING: plot twist obliquely hinted at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not so much the fact that the villains can read minds. (Reflect on how bad Jeff Bridges is at hiding his thoughts, and you'll realise there's nothing mysterious about this.) It's the way that they can predict behaviour with a psychohistorical pin-point accuracy ... and not just behaviour, but everything else besides. The villains can predict what the traffic will be like, whether or not it will be raining when they want it not to be raining, and how quickly, to within a small fraction of a second, security guards and casual passers by will be able to react. Well, this is what happens when the writers want to have it both ways. They try to generate tension but underlining how contingent everything is - if only he'd arrived at the traffic light just an INSTANT earlier, they want us to think - but then they try to shock us by telling us that every tiny cough had been carefully planned.Had the film been less dull I wouldn't have minded so much. I spent most of my time trying to work out why I was so profoundly uninterested, for the film isn't bad in any obvious way. Well, perhaps one: the central character is just so unappealing. Who cares if he lives or dies? He's scarcely alive to begin with. (Added to this, he has to be the very worst lecturer I have ever seen, in fiction or in reality, and I have given this matter some thought.) He suspects his neighbours of being terrorists but since we don't find out until the end what dastardly deed, if any, these `terrorists' are plotting, we can't really involve ourselves in that side of the story, either.There are other things to send us to sleep. Pellington doesn't believe in cluttering the frame. No, that's an understatement. He believes in leaving the frame so clinically bare that it's like staring at a dentist's ceiling for two hours. The sound track consists largely of rumblings and thuds taking place at a frequency of about twenty Hertz, as of a contrabassoon clearing its throat. Whenever anything happens Pellington drops a steel girder onto our heads from a great height to make sure we noticed. ...Now that I come to think of it, the silly twist at the end is the least of our problems: if I'd been given a chance, I would probably have enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a college teacher who believes in the American way and all, but is still sort of distrustful of the government. He becomes convinced his neighbor Oliver Lang, played very well by Tim Robbins, is a terrorist. Lots of strange things happen as the movie builds to an ending that is very unexpected.Bridges is just super as always and i still don't know why he isn't considered one of the best actors out there. Interesting the name they gave him in this movie. Michael Faraday was one of the great scientists in history and i wouldn't expect them to use his name unless it had some hidden meaning to the movie. But i can't think of what that meaning could be.Anyway, I'm proud to be a paranoid and i love movies that tell us the world is not as it seems and that's the message here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rated "R" for Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road must be rated "R" for Ridiculous, because it's one of the most implausible and preposterous films I've seen this year. I was initially drawn to the film because of the lead actors, Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins, but I left feeling thoroughly disappointed at the way this fantastical tale was so crudely and clumsily constructed. Aside from the transparent screenplay and conspicuously poor direction, I was generally distracted by Jeff Bridges way-over-the-top depiction of a "terrorism professor" who conveniently happens to have a bonafide terrorist and his lovely robotic-like wife and children move in across the street.Mr. Bridges is capable of much better acting than his self-conscious performance in this banal schlock represents, but I suspect he got caught up in the trite melodrama of the story and couldn't resist gushing his lines at virtually every opportunity. His portrayal of the professor didn't remotely resemble a real human being and that is an essential prerequisite for the audience to identify with his character and truly care about what happens to him and his young son.Mr. Robbins performance, on the other hand, wasn't quite so histrionic, but his reaction when Bridges character uncovers his true identity is wholly unconvincing, and merely serves to epitomize a lackluster effort that doesn't begin to showcase his dynamic range as an actor.It seems unfortunate to bring together two gifted actors and then squander the possibility of having them truly connect and develop a compelling relationship, but I suspect it was virtually impossible to overcome such a weak screenplay by Ehren Kruger, and it is clear that the director, Mark Pellington, was incapable of pulling things together to create a textured and believable movie.I could go on ad nauseam to dissect this remarkably obtuse story and address each absurd plot point one by one, but suffice it to say that the only reason I can think of to enter a theater to spend time with this film, is to escape the heat of summer and take a nice nap.</fullReview>

I don't see the point in all the hassle he went through just to make Michael Faraday the scapegoat. He could have drugged him and placed him in the car if that was so important.

		<fullReview>As I write this, they are still burying the dead in Orlando, cite of the Pulse night club massacre by Omar Mateen, a jihadi. So don't expect me to be terribly kind to the folks who made this anti- militia, pro-government (sort of) suspenser.We've got a good number of crazy anti-government wingnuts out there, but this movie was rendered obsolete the moment the planes started hitting buildings, maybe before it was even made in 1999. What I found most irritating about Mark Pellington's Arlington Road was that fell into the same old trap that so many Hollywood projects do- -being unable to accept that the greater threat is from radicalized Islam, not nut-jobs up in the Idaho Panhandle, here in Montana, in fundamentalist Mormon communities, Oklahoma City, Waco, Texas. But, gracious, we don't want to offend anyone's sensibilities.As a thriller, AR is pretty darned good, building some real suspense, establishing a solid backstory of Jeff Bridges' wife and Tim Robbins' past. The movie even has Bridges questioning the competence of his late wife's superiors. Heavens! Saying something bad about the Federal Government? An actual attempt to be even- handed?And then Pellington loses control.We get Bridges visiting Robbins' home where a party is going on, and what he stumbles into is more Rosemary's Baby/witches' coven than a lawn party with KC and the Sunshine Band advising everyone to "get down tonight."Then we get the obligatory mad-dash car chase with the laws of physics and common sense being sacrificed for the good of the message.The message being: Those crazy right-wingers are everywhere!Yet, all in all, I'd say Arlington Road was a good investment of 117 minutes. That is, until I turn the tube back to TV, and there's Omar Mateen, ISIS' "Lion of the Caliphate," taking a smirking selfie some time ago. Makes the wingnuts out there in Deer Testicle, Wyoming seem pretty tame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting idea dumbed down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can admit it: Arlington Road is a movie that can build up suspense and have you on the edge of your seat. It's not simplistic or predictable, it's not a sweet story with an obligatory happy ending. It has everything to be a great thriller.But, like the Nolan brothers taught us in 2006, in a trick, it's not enough to just make something disappear, you have to bring it back, and the way you do it is what defines your skill as a magician. The same rules apply to the magic of cinema, that is, all the suspense that you have built has to unwind at the end, so that you finally see all the pieces of the puzzle turn into a whole picture. And that's exactly where Arlington Road cheats the audience big time.Feeling suspicious over something, trying to convince other people that there's fishy stuff going on and being driven insane by their disbelief, only to find yourself the culprit framed for exactly the thing you were trying to uncover. I guess some tropes just never get old. However, easy as it is to employ, it's also based on some low blow that you hope the audience will somehow get over for the sake of their own entertainment's integrity.Well, i don't feel like getting over being cheated this time. Because the only way Arlington Road could have pulled off its trick is by making its protagonist a complete idiot, who's literally going insane over the things that happen in his life and inside his head, while everyone close to him are completely blind and refusing to believe anything that goes beyond their sweet and dandy image of the world around them until it's simply too late. Lack of communication between people, a total absence of common sense and logical thinking, behavior driven not even by the emotions but by some primordial instincts instead - which all mysteriously leads our poor hero to the only place he was prescribed to arrive to, as if he was a bullet shot from a high-accuracy weapon to hit a bull's eye from miles away. I simply refuse to buy it.The point Arlington Road tries to drive home over and over again is that a rogue power can outtrick the system and hurt it, while the system itself would be denying its vulnerability and intentionally shutting off the inconvenient truth, going for a scapegoat instead. And maybe it's actually possible, but only if you are wickedly smart and leave nothing to chance indeed. However, the shine of Arlington Road's magic relies on your own will to play dumb and be fooled. And if you simply allow yourself to keep your eyes open and look where it really matters instead of where the trickster wants you to, you'll see that there is no real magic here, just some dusty mirrors and strings hanging from the ceiling. And, unfortunately, the guy pulling them simply couldn't do it artfully enough to make this contraption look natural.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In 'Arlington Road',American director Mark Pellington invites viewers to reflect upon the role played by neighbors in uncertain times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One often believes that good deeds done by a person are rewarded in some form or another. This belief becomes more strong when two people involved in an exchange of good deeds happen to be neighbors. This observation is the basis of 'Arlington Road', a thriller which has some nice moments of a strong beginning part, an average middle section and a weak ending. For a fast paced thriller, director Mark Pellington has extracted superb performances from all actors especially its lead stars Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins as neighbors who were beginning to become good friends until some sudden unexpected events impacted their friendship. 'Arlington Road' is also the perfect family film which gives viewers ample idea about the vulnerability of an ordinary man who is used as bait by people who claim to be friends. Apart from questioning the validity of friendship in a fast changing uncertain environment, this film also questions the reasons one might have behind trusting/mistrusting neighbors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, Absorbing &amp; Well-Acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This absorbing conspiracy thriller shows how one man's experiences, grief and academic preoccupations make him fearful, paranoid and emotionally unstable. It begins impressively with a really gripping opening sequence and then, after telling his story, leads to a shocking climax that vindicates his behaviour in the most tragic way possible. The expert pacing of the on-screen action contributes enormously to its tense atmosphere and Angelo Badalamenti's unsettling score complements the mood of the piece perfectly.Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), a history professor at George Washington University, is driving along a suburban street one day when he sees a 10-year-old boy staggering along in the middle of the road. When he catches up with him, it quickly becomes apparent that the boy is badly burned, bleeding and has a serious arm injury. Michael rushes him to the nearest hospital and after treatment the boy recovers well. His father and mother, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl (Joan Cusack) Lang, who live in the same neighbourhood as Michael are extremely grateful and following this incident they, Michael and his girlfriend Brooke (Hope Davis) become friends.Michael's going through a difficult time bringing up his 9-year-old son, being involved in a relatively new relationship and trying to come to terms with the death of his wife, an FBI Agent who'd been killed during an incompetently-handled raid on a location where a large quantity of guns and ammunition were reported to have been stockpiled. When he starts to doubt the veracity of some information that Oliver tells him about his background and realises that his neighbour (who's a structural engineer), lied to him about the nature of a project he's working on, Michael does some research which reveals that Oliver is using a false identity and in his youth, had been arrested for planting a bomb in a government building.Naturally disturbed by his findings, Michael is frustrated by the reactions of Brooke and Agent Whit Carver (Robert Gossett) who was his wife's former partner in the FBI. They both seem to think he's being paranoid and rationalise his findings in different ways. Michael's passionate about the course he teaches on domestic terrorism and often expresses his scepticism about official explanations for acts of terrorism which are typically claimed to be the work of an individual. The more convinced he becomes that his neighbours are involved in something suspicious, the more determined he becomes to thwart their plans and this puts his life and the lives of everyone close to him, in great danger."Arlington Road" is entertaining, thought-provoking and has some interesting plot twists. Its characters are well-drawn and its cast provides some strong performances. Jeff Bridges is very natural in his portrayal of an ordinary man who starts to unravel alarmingly and Tim Robbins is utterly convincing as he combines a faade of suburban respectability with Oliver's more sinister side. Joan Cusack is also brilliantly creepy and provides one of the movie's outstanding moments when, after overhearing a telephone call made by Brooke, makes the very benign word "shopping" sound incredibly chilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to this movie very excited after seeing "The Shawshank Redemption" because I was eager to see what Andy and Red were up too in Saywantenejo. However, you can imagine my surprise when I realized that Andy has now moved back to the U.S. to become a terrorist. Huh? And surprisingly Red was completely absent from the film. Did he die? Did Andy kill him after he decided to become a terrorist? This movie leaves the audience with so many unanswered questions and frankly doesn't make any sense. Why would the makers of Shawshank want Andy to go from being a hero to a villain? It just doesn't add up. The makers of Shawshank did a tremendous job with the first installment of the trilogy and for that they should be commended but to simply spew out this garbage and pass it off as a legitimate sequel is frankly embarrassing. I'm a 41 year old mom and tried watching this with my two young children and even they did not like the movie. Frankly, I think many of the scenes were downright inappropriate. Bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent slice of hitchcockiana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was somewhat baffled by wife and my best friend extolling the virtues of Tim Robbins as an actor, as I could barely remember who he was and, now I've seen him again, his face is fading rapidly from my memory. So Tim Robbins was OK though he wasn't called upon to do much in this film. Jeff Bridges was very good, so much so that I began to worry he is suffering from alcoholism or some other deadly disease. He reminded me of Wilfred Lawson who you were never quite sure would make it to the end of the next line before falling flat on his face. Assuming Bridges wasn't drunk or ill then, he gives a spiffing performance as the politics lecturer whose FBI wife was killed in a bungled operations and who discovers he is living next to a terrorist even though no-one will believe him. As a man on the edge of falling apart, dealing with past grief and the grief that is thrust upon him during the course of the film, he turns in a truly magnificent performance. I never knew he had it in him. Joan Cusack must also be mentioned for her excellent and chilling performance, much more chilling than Tim, remind me what he looks like again, Robbins. Whoever played Bridges young girlfriend was entirely forgettable so I hope for her sake that that is what the script intended.It is a good film with a twist I did not guess and entirely worth your money. Minor gripes were the unnecessarily loud and long opening scenes and one coincidence too far which happens in a parking lot. I couldn't read too much into this film in terms of political comment although many other critics have. I read it as a very competent piece of Hitchcockiana and as such it works brilliantly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrorism, is it a tired subject????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road is the story of a man, Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) who loses his FBI agent wife. Now, he lives with his son and his new girlfriend (Hope Davis), one of his students. One day, when he comes back at home, he finds a boy with blood on him and he will save his life. The boy's parents (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack) become friends with the Faradays. Their son will play with the other son. And all of them live on the Arlington Road. But Michael will start to suspect Oliver (Robbins) of being a terrorist. He will make researches and will learn several things about him. So, this is a story of paranoia and terrorism.Well, most of the time, terrorism is badly exploited in film. They are always big action films with a happy end and stupid unreal characters. Arlington Road surprised me a lot. Ehren Kruger made a wonderful script with an intense story and without clichs. Michael is a teacher, a job always represented by women, and his wife was a FBI agent, always men. This is very good and much more interesting because of its originality. The way the story is developed is extremely well. The end is fantastic. There is hope for anti-Hollywood people like me, there is finally a writer who does not apply to the stupid rules and he is great. When I learn that he was the one who wrote the final draft of Scream 3, I was stunned and so happy. It will not be clich and predictable. The last ones wasn't, but I agree about their choice so Scream 3 will not be like I Still Know? Also the characters are realistic and human. The movie is of course unpredictable, the ending especially. Well, this is the best movie I have ever seen about terrorism.The interpretation by Jeff Bridges is totally intense and powerful. He is great and realistic in the movie. It's the same thing for Hope Davis, Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins. They are perfect in their role. For the movie director, he gave a special style to the movie that I like a lot. I played with the light to give a more negative, cold atmosphere. The beginning, just before the credits, is wow. The boy walk in the middle of the street, and it is beautifully filmed. All the rest is good, except for one scene where it seemed to exaggerate, when Michael go to the Oliver house when he searches his kid.Well, the power of the film is in the story and everything. The violence is present of course but it is intense and extremely sad because of the absence of clichs. Most reviews I read on the site were not good because they didn't like the end. Well, I am not happy by the end, but it's reality, we do not choose who will die and who will not. The cinema is there to make the spectators escape from reality, but also to denounce things in it, and Arlington Road does it very well. People will just have to change their point of view on the cinema and they will see that the end of this movie is better than most of the end of other films that I won't tell you (I mean almost all the films of the summer).Finally, this movie is one of the best of the summer, it is more specifically the second best. I also believe that people will try to write more unconventional suspense and stories like Arlington Road. I think it is the next step to improve a lot American cinema, but again, this is my opinion.Don't miss this film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading reviews right here on this web site, especially the comments about the so-called awful or disturbing ending, I was a bit apprehensive about renting Arlington Road.Not only was the film great, the ending -- well, all we could say was, that it was perfect. In fact we guessed at it and nailed it. If this movie had the standard Hollywood action thriller good-guy wins after blowing up all the bad guys and half the city, we would say the whole thing sucked -- but it didn't and it doesn't.Also, we rented the DVD version which has an alternate ending, introduced with quite a bit of discussion by the film's director. Thank goodness they didn't go for it -- and no it is not a Hollywood ending, just a wrong ending. Enjoy this movie!</fullReview>

I left the cinema thanking god the Hollywood machine had finally rewarded its viewers with a movie which actually makes you think, and doesn't have the sickeningly saccharine ending normally tacked onto action films, where the star rides into the sunset to start a relationship with a female co-star.Great work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without two preposterous, but all too common, movie conventions this film goes nowhere. First, you have good guys (and girl) who are so stupid, so wildly lacking in judgment and so unable to think or act logically (or minimally conceal themselves while tailing someone) that they give new meaning to the concept of "moronic." Second, you have bad guys who are so omniscient, so resourceful and so powerful that they can murder, kidnap, bomb, penetrate the FBI's delivery service,and look evil,etc., at will, with absolutely no chance of being detected. Not only that, but they can also apparently materialize out of thin air wherever needed to advance the plot; and predict the future, and read Jeff Bridges' mind. (How else would they know that he wouldn't spill the beans, arm himself, kill Tim Robbins when he had the chance, credibly warn the FBI, drive like a maniac through miles and miles of city traffic without attracting police attention, keep going after the bus hit him, and gain entrance to the parking garage?)

		<fullReview>Until the ending, I'd pretty much written "Arlington Road" off as a forgettable piece of paranoiac tripe in the best "X-Files" tradition... How was I to know the ending would be THAT deceptive? Why couldn't I see that the moviemakers had been manipulating me for almost the entire two hours?I'm just at a loss to describe this miserable piece of trash. What the hell are people THINKING, calling it "Hitchcockian"? Twist endings are one thing. A good twist ending enhances the fun of a movie; a good twist ending recognizes the fine line between fooling your audience and suckering them. The moviemakers were obviously trying to make Social Commentary; what's disturbing is that there are so many people out there who actually BELIEVE that the kind of intricate, wide-ranging conspiracy suggested here is actually possible.If I sound like I'm rambling, it's because words fail me to describe how bad "Arlington Road" is. If you're expecting the subject of domestic terrorism to be treated seriously, as I was, forget it. If you want to see the subject glossed over with a laughable, contrived plot and truly awful acting, and if you like being suckered by a movie, then by all means rent it. I give this waste of celluloid a 1, only because there's nothing lower. Its release was delayed for something like a year... it's not hard to see why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an incredible movie. I was on the edge for the last half hour or maybe more. It's the kind of action movie that has a great plot, like Speed, and also makes you think about it a long time after the movies over. It stars Jeff Bridges as the paranoid Michael Faraday, whose wife was killed in a terrorist accident. He lives with his son and girlfriend and seems to be doing better. When he meets his new neighbors, the Langs, he sees them as anything but terrorists. He soon does some snooping and begins to suspect them. With everyone thinking he is just paranoid and upset about his wife, he has no one to help him prove that these people might be ploting something big. The performances are very well done and Joan Cusack is downright spooky with her crazy smile at the phone when she sees Hope Davis, Jeff's new girlfriend talking at the mall. My mouth was wide open the whole time. The reason: you just can't believe all this is happening. Of course, the ending will have you just shaken and you won't get it out of your mind until you you wake up the next few days after you watched it. It's so scarey but it's not meant to be Scream or something. It proves a good point though, always suspect the unsuspecting people. Arlington Road: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching Arlington Road on video, and in my opinion it was sensational. I was thinking it deserved a 7 or maybe a 8, but after the ending I changed my mind and gave it a 10. Now realizing that this is a great movie, I am quite disappointed that it did not do well in theaters. However, I can see exactly why. This film goes against everything that "Hollywood films" teach us. Midway through it breaks one of the most important rules, but this is nothing compared to the ending. The sad thing is most people would have probably preferred a stupid "Hollywood ending" instead of the jaw-dropping conclusion. Still, you cannot help but at least respect the group of people that were willing to make a film that would make so many people angry, and at the same time pose a frightening question that will stay under your skin for days: "Are we really safe?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Ending Of 1998 (OK...I saw it early)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate to see this film at an advance screening 9 months before it finally hit theaters (still had the Polygram titles on it). There were only three of us in the theater (it was private) and we all sat several rows away from each other. When the twist ending was revealed all three of us, independent of each other, jumped to our feet, applauded and cheered. The reason? I can't say without spoiling it.Bottom line: A lot of people reacted negatively to this film and I can not fault them. If you like your films to have that "formula" for success, don't watch this film. If you want to see a stark portrait of the Rockwellian Image gone horribly wrong, flock to this film. Embrace it. And I hope that you're shaking when you shut your VCR off.I was once I settled back into my seat and watched the credits.A quick note for DVD viewers: The "alternate ending" is NOT a different ending just an expansion on the existing ending. As with most deleted scenes in any movie, it's obvious why it was cut. The audio commentary is very good (Jeff Bridges admits that his watching it during the commentary is his first time seeing the final product).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually, I like films like these: paranoid thrillers with disturbing endings. The problem with this movie is that it had far too many coincidences and lapses in logic to make the suspense credible. The final half hour was very well done and the twist ending was clever, but everything leading up to that moment was highly implausible. Even my suspension of disbelief doesn't stretch this far. Jeff Bridges stars as a history professor who begins his neighbor is a mad bomber (Tim Robbins)who blew up the Federal building in St. Louis months earlier. The rest of the movie follows Bridges character to get at the truth.Arlington Road is very well-made, a slick thrill machine which the makers must have done on a rather limited budget.The performances are credible, especially Robbins, who cuts a menacing figure.But this film fails at the most important level: writing. The main and ultimately fatal problem with the script is that the villains of the piece, a highly organized and highly placed cabal of anti-government fanatics, are so effective in their schemes that you begin to suspect they are aliens with psychic powers. They have an amazing ability to know where everyone is at any given time and are somehow able to manipulate unsuspecting pawns to do their will. "Do you think we would leave anything to chance?" one of the villains asks Bridges towards the end. He ain't kidding, buster. These bad guys aren't human. They are nothing less than omniscient components of a giant plot machine cooked up by a 28 year old Hollywood writer. I'm sorry, but it's all too ridiculous,and I don't buy it.</fullReview>

It doesn't get a 10 because it's too American in the first part, having elements like a pseudo-insightful analysis of American people behavior towards terrorism today, or a boring daddy-son interaction (Grant talking with his father about Brooke and dead mommy) or Michael in prolonged sorrow about his wife which affects his relationship with Brooke etc. Some of it is needed for the plot, but it's definitely exaggerated to generate emotion (never works for me). I was told it was a good film before going to see it and I was frightened by this start. Thankfully, it evolved with great style and wit. About the three leads: Tim Robbins never let me down in any film I have seen him play and this is not an exception. Jeff Bridges does a very good job and I think in some parts where he overacted was obliged to do so by the kind of the character he played. Joan Cusack impressed me: Not a lot of lines, yet what a mysterious and evil character she creates!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceit....not the story from the movie but the movie itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deceit describes what I felt after seeing this movie, and not because this was what the movie was all about but because one is led to believe this is a good movie when it fact it is not. Now, dont get me wrong this movie has a lot of things on its favor, for one it has it has good actors (jeff bridges and Tim Robins are both good ones) good filming, but this things alone dont make a good movie, at least not on my book. the main fluke of this movie is the story, which more than likely is the be all end all in every movie, cmon guys, if it is not a good story it will more than likely wont be a good movie. For starters we have this professor (Jeff bridges) who is too smart to discover that his neighbors are secret terrorists already involved in previous well known terrorist attacks, but too dumb to do something intelligent and let justice deal with them. Then we have this terrorists for whom everything falls in place perfectly according to their plans, they are better than mind readers, they can anticipate ones every move...need I say more?Cyrus.</fullReview>

If the truth is really twisted like this by governments, then it is very scary... and if you think it isn't being twisted (a natural response perhaps) then you are left feeling that perhaps you are naive.What a great ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller deluxe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always had high praise for the acting prowess of Jeff Bridges. Arlington Road is an excellent, gripping thriller which probably captures Jeff's best performance in this genre of film. Somehow he's the ideal "paranoid" type actor and fits perfectly into these roles - remember Blown Away and Fearless ? The music to this film is also excellent, especially during the opening credits. The ending, however, as mentioned by other reviewers, is somewhat unexpected and quite disturbing. Tim Robbins delivers a credible performance as the crooked neighbor, but somehow I feel any decent actor could have equaled or bettered his effort. The same goes for Joan Cusack. Hope Davis, however, was excellent as the supportive but subdued girlfriend, despite her premature departure from the script.For me the absolute highlight of the movie was the facial expressions of a "paranoid" Jeff Bridges - captured to perfection by the camera.If you like this genre of cinema, take note of Arlington Road, it's a thriller deluxe.</fullReview>

From my point of view, it's probably the best movie of the year (sorry for star wars fans, I was one of them).

		<shortDescription>An action flick with psychological drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good and Hytchcok-type of film, Arlington Road follows the story of a simple teacher (Jeff Bridges) who recently lost his wife, a CIA agent killed during a mission. Obsessed by terrorists' factions since then, he is becoming a distant father to his son. When an apparently normal couple move to the house in front, the teacher's paranoia explodes, and he assumes that his neighbors are in fact terrorists threatening to make one last and tragic attack in the United States. Arlington Road starts with an impressive sequence, throwing the audience in this tense story by showing a young boy covered with blood, walking on the street aimless. The cast has good performances, mostly by Bridges and Cusack. The director has perfect timing's notion, and he develops the situations in such a way that they come up in one of the most dramatic and powerful endings already accomplished. The only bad aspect is that the first part is a little bit slow, although sometimes tense and intriguing. An interesting entertainment, a rare example of action flick with psychological drama.</fullReview>

Even when the end is approaching and you think you know - get ready for a surprise - which when you watch it the second time you realize is not surprising at all.Never a fan of Jeff Bridges, I am now. His performance as a confused political science professor is as real as it can get.Watch every little detail and don't make the mistake of falling into the typical Hollywood plot plan. You will probably laugh at yourself ten minutes after 'THE END'.See it. You'll never forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a good conspiracy movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These movies have to be written well before they can work and this one is written very well. Unlike Conspiracy Theory there are no gaping plot holes that do not make sense when you watch the film a second time. No giant ridiculous twists like in No Way Out (what he was a russian!!!!!) The movie instead chooses to be clever and smart instead of shocking and cheap. What you get in this film is first rate acting by two of the best in the business, Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges. These two actors face off with a lot of energy and skill. What you do not get is grade a cheese that most of the conspiracy yarns drip all over the plate. The film has personality it is not a manfucatured piece of garbage like Wild Wild West or Civil Action. Oh sure the ending is bad to clowns who live in la la land. American Movie audiences should have embraced this film and rejected Star Wars, but alas with no giant pre marketing campaign and no huge deal with Pepsi films like this go almost directly to video with viewers renting them at blockbuster and thinking "Why didn't this come out in the theater?" If you want more good movies to be made then see the good ones while they are out and let the garbage sit out to rot. Now I have gotten all worked up, but just see the movie it is well worth your time. If you liked the film Parallax View you should like this movie as well. If you hated Parallax View then skip this movie and don't bother watching any thing else that I suggest because you have no taste!</fullReview>

I went to see this film the day it was released in Australia, and I had extremely high hopes, and let me tell you - this film had me enthralled from the first frame. This film deals with a highly controversial subject matter, and twists it into a highly entertaining and thought-provoking film that will keep you talking throughout the week. I am tired of hearing comments that critisize Jeff Bridges for over-acting. I think it is the musical score that underscores his character. JB is right on the money with this one, similarly Tim Robbins and the talented Joan Cusack give chilling performances.I recommend this film to almost anyone - although I wouldn't to anyone with a short fuse! 8/10</fullReview>

I have seen movies in which Jeff Bridges fits his part, but this was not one of them. The plot was predictable, unoriginal, and sadly unsinister at times when it imagined itself to be. The only thing I remember from this movie at all is Jeff Bridges with a blank look on his face and his mouth hanging open as he runs in slow motion. Seriously, folks, let's demand something that smacks of originality a little more in the future. I'm really shocked that this movie has such a high ranking.

		<fullReview>Arlington Road begins with a young boy (Mason Gamble) staggering down a suburban road, dripping blood, badly injured. (Arlington Road of course!) Neighbour Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) finds him and tears into hospital with the lad, probably saving the boy's life. Now much of Arlington Road is completely implausible on reflection, especially given the surprise ending, but still the film is an effective thriller even if the plot is pretty course. These opening scenes are tense and the film maintains its intensity. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack play Oliver and Cheryl Lang, the parents of the boy and it's obvious from the start that this family is a bit queer. Oliver's hair is a redneck weird and creepy music and noises accompany just about every glance. Their children give the Addams family stare. And it just so happens that Michael Faraday lectures at the local University on terrorism and that his wife had been an FBI agent until she had been shot dead while raiding a suspected terrorist enclave. That's a pretty rich mix I think you must agree. But still Arlington Road pushes the appropriate switches pretty effectively. I was however reminded of the old TV series Sea Hunt which starred Jeff's dad Lloyd Bridges. I used to love watching Sea Hunt on my black and white television. Jeff Bridges spends much of his time in Arlington Road rushing about with his head up and mouth open, rather like a seal. I think there's been a good deal of salt water still swooshing in the Bridge's blood vessels since Dad went SCUBA all of those years ago. But the star of Arlington Road for me was Robert Gossett who played FBI agent Whit Carver. Talk about the set of a man's jaw! He's an actor worth following. But just how many African Americans are there running the FBI? If you believe the movies, just about all of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this could quite possibly be the best film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Does contain spoilers.The first thing I would like to say is, to all the people that criticize this movie for " just happens to have terrorist neighbours move in across from him" or " they could never possibly know where he was at all times", then first of all pay close attention to this review and secondly, like Angel Heart and The Sixth Sense, this is a film that needs and deserves a second viewing. More on that in a moment.Arlington Road is one of the best films that I have seen this year. It is very tense, very well thought out, and it has a point that it wants us to recognize. I have never heard of Mark Pellington before this film but I really think he will be a great director in Hollywood after this picture, whether it does well at the box office or not. What you can't deny is that this man can direct a film. I am actually inclined to say that this film was a personal story to him because he puts that much care into every last detail. I believe that he and the writer ( Kruger ) have major issues here and they convey a certain frustration and paranoia in the film that cannot be ignored.There are three parts of the film that must be mentioned. Because I don't think I have ever felt quite as emotionally drained as watching these particular scenes. The first is the opening. Here we have Jeff Bridges driving home and he sees a kid that has his hand covered in blood. But a lot of this is done through the kids eyes. He is wandering aimlessly down the street and the camera becomes his mind. It is blurry, hazy and confused. And that is a perfect note for how the kid and then Bridges must be feeling at that exact moment. Brilliant. The second is when Bridge's wife and the rest of her FBI team is on a small farm property. They are there to arrest a man under false pretenses that he has broken some laws. And what ensues is a battle between the FBI and some people that are exercising their right to own a gun and protect their property. Again, tension and heart wrenching emotion are what you are left with. Brilliant. The third has to be the very end. This is an ending that you just don't see coming. And when Bridges is in that underground parking and he finally realizes what is happening, we see it in his eyes. We figure it out when he figures it out, and then the final few images of the film had me horrified. And the theater that I was in became silent. If you haven't seen this film you can't possibly know exactly what it is that I am trying to say here, because words can't do justice to what this film makes you feel. They really can't.Arlington Road is one of the smartest films that I have ever seen. It has so much to say and it asks us to open our eyes and look at things a little more closely than what we have been doing. The director and writer have taken care of that. But to pull this off you had to have two actors that could convey the emotions so well that you felt that you knew them when you left the theater. And Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins are perfect. Robbins is quiet but deadly and he is purposely catatonic like in the film because that is what a terrorist living in suburbia America is going to be like. The smart and well organized ones aren't going to have Nazi flags hanging outside their door, they are going to be John and Sally Smith down the street. And there is one absolutely perfect line in here that is the epitome of terrorism and the disbelief that they could be so close to your home. Bridges girlfriend says to him, " Terrorists? Living across the street from us? Right! " And that is the beauty of it. Terrorists have to live next door to someone, it could be you and you would never know it. Jeff Bridges is also perfect because he is a manically obsessed guy in this film. He is so in tune with terrorism and he cares about his country so much that he does become a little strung out. That is not over acting, it is an honest portrayal of a man that knows too much and can not get anyone to believe him. That sounds a little like Hitchcock to me. I also have to mention Joan Cusack because she is absolutely terrifying here. She is a microcosm of American apple pie. She is sweet and lovely and always smiling, but she is just as sick and devoted to her cause as her husband is, and that makes her spooky. She is a great actress and she plays her part perfectly here.Arlington Road raises many issues and asks us to open our eyes just a little and question the conclusions that official boards come up with. After all, The Warren Report is now considered to be more of a comic strip than a credible piece of official documentation. So maybe we should all question other reports that say one man blew up whatever building he happens to blow up. This movie is brilliant, perfect and important and anyone who truly appreciates great film making should really check this out. I really think Mark Pellington should get an Oscar nomination for his efforts here. He is that good.**** One final note. To everyone who thinks that things in this movie were too coincidental for it to be happening (terrorists move across the street from a university professor that teaches US Terrorism, knowing where he was going to be at all times to become the bait that he was ) then just try to watch the film again. Bridges was followed all the time, that is why the girl in his class says the things that she does about him at the end, and Robbins and his network set him up from day one. That is discovered when in one of the last shots of the film you see Robbins burning pictures and disks and files on Michael Farraday. They did their homework and he became thier next unlucky patsy. That sort of criticism is unwarranted and a second viewing of the film should be witnessed, maybe you'll understand it a bit better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tightly-written, well-acted, technically topnotch suspense thriller keeps you enmeshed with the protagonist and involved with the progress of action right up to the end.And then, the team of 12 producers and one writer sandbag the hell out of you. Totally and absolutely, you are kicked in the groin, for reasons which are obscure but clearly not healthy, as the film dissolves in its last couple of minutes into a cinematic psychological atrocity. No ambiguity here, it's just a 'nyah-nyah, we fooled you' finale which succeeds only in invalidating the merits of all which has gone before by virtue of the absoluteness of its stark dystopian switchover. No release, not even the hint of a catharsis to be imagined via some offscreen event, to release the tension and reward you for investing in it all.Strictly entertaining for rightwing nuts, who'll revel in the outcome, and those who are too insensitive generally to appreciate the effect this sort of 'trick' ending has on normal people's digestion. Definitely NOT for people who have been victims of terrorism, actual or symbolic, directly or indirectly, unless you want your psychological wounds opened up afresh.I give it a big fat IMDb 1 because there is no big fat IMDb zero available; and I demand my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, the BEST thriller of the year.Usual Suspects, the Game, Ronin and Arlington Road all have one thing in common, they are movies that very few have seen, but they are the best of their genres. Usual Suspects was a marvelous mystery, the Game had you thinking til the very end, Ronin was cutting edge action and now we have been blessed with a thriller with brains... Arlington Road.Arlington Road is a movie which will have you talking for a month, with images that you probably won't be able to shake for quiet sometime. The plot is simple, Jeff Bridges finds out his neighbors aren't who they say they are and he embarks on a private investigation to find the truth.I must commend the writer(s), for such a terrific script, the characters are among the best created for the screen and the ending... OH MY GOD! Words can't express it.I don't care what anybody says... Mark P. deserves to be nominated for Best Director. From the opening scene where the young boy is walking bloody down the quiet street to the shootout between the FBI and the family in the woods to the jaw dropping ending, EVERYTHING was flawless, you took us on a rollercoster ride and never let up... even when I was walking home my heart was still racing.

		<shortDescription>Lost in the Shuffle This Summer, This is an Hitcockian Ace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those films about which the less said the better, Arlington Road is a suspense film with the unmistakable Hitchcock sensibility.The opening scene and title treatment are much more unsettling than that overhyped monster, the Blair Witch.This is Strangers On A Train for the Nineties, North By Northwest for the Numb Generation.Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins, as always, are delicious to watch, but Joan Cusack is at the creepy heart of this nightmare.Much was made in the original press coverage of this film of its "message" content, its political import. Balderdash. The messages of this film, just as in the very best of Alfred the Master, are these:a) Trust no one. No one. You are alone. b) Maybe you deserve this.Those who fail to enjoy this film will be those who did not enjoy Hitchcock: those who are cut off from the real world of the modern soul and live in a world of smooth complexions and endless consumption. Of nice suburban homes. And willful ignorance of the worst the world has to offer, and the fact that it lives within.PKL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The end of Arlington Road is one of the biggest twists in a movie that I've ever seen. It's so close to reality that it makes the viewer think about what really happens when a building is bombed that nobody ever discovers. After the movie was over, I thought about Jeff Bridges telling his class that the public needs one person to blame for a bombing, and how true that really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the near future, aspiring actors will be able to obtain training DVDs containing actual examples of the myriad thespian techniques. The section on "over-acting" will contain segments from Jeff Bridges' performance in Arlington Road which can be called "forceful" only if your definition is "shouts and screams incessantly". Painful. Just painful.The movie? If you watch it, then (re)watch "The Game". Kindred spirits, in that they string dozens of improbable coincidences together to achieve a surprise ending. Yes, the endings were each a surprise, but at what cost to intelligence and common sense? Perhaps IMBd should implement a new section for each entry: Improbable Coincidence Checklist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great idea, but a failed attempt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road is an exceptional picture -- on paper. A great theme (homegrown terrorism), exceptionally fine actors (Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins), suspense, thrills, some psychological suspense, and a great idea for an ending.But something went wrong along the way. In a movie like Austin Powers, we don't expect a plot to make sense. But in a picture such as this, I want some glue to hold the parts together. Here, coincidence after coincidence attempts to pull this plot together. Sure, movies have certain conventions. But I still want to walk home feeling that the action and the ending are at least credible. I think of this as a great failed attempt and can only wonder what Hitchcock might have done with this idea.</fullReview>

Movie picks up at the "imagine" sequence of the Jeff Bridges character and starts to get interesting. The movie goes along with Bridges looking for info on the background of Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins). Last 10 - 15 minutes is profound and may make you think whenever you watch the news!!! These last minutes make this movie passable, although there's quite a bit of hooey, coincidences, &amp; "unexplanations" to get to this point. I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

It's not to everyone's liking, but "paranoia" thrillers are rarely as good as this, let alone better. I found it great! Frantically and furiously filmed, basking in eerie music which often rises in tempo and intensity, using lots of weird lighting, it's truly mesmerizing at times. The acting is top notch and makes an unbelievable story believable. However, it's rather laborious in the middle and could have used some editing to improve the pace. Still, certainly one of the year's best movies. Probably better rental than theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the opening credits ever appear in Arlington Road, this movie has slapped you in the face and given you a stern warning: This movie may not be for you. It will be violent, and it will be senseless, and it will scare you, and if you can't handle this, you can get out now. For those of us who stayed, however, the movie was an incredible experience. For the first 90 minutes, it worked on developing characters. You grieved with the father, and you felt strongly for the poor girlfriend in competition with a ghost for her man's love. You also gain the paranoia of Jeff Bridges, but the direction is so amazing that for twenty, thirty minutes, you think Bridges has gone psycho. The filmmakers leave a million "outs" in this movie - at ANY point before the climax, they could step back and say, "Whoops! Bridges is a quack, and the neighbors are totally normal!" I believed that would happen, even though the previews revealed WAY too much - I won't bring it up in case someone hasn't seen them, but you should NEVER tell the shock ending of a film in the preview. By the time the climax hits, I had actually squeezed out a tear in utter terror. Forget the traditional slasher flicks - Arlington Road is the scariest movie I have ever seen. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thriller of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, the BEST thriller of the year.Usual Suspects, the Game, Ronin and Arlington Road all have one thing in common, they are movies that very few have seen, but they are the best of their genres. Usual Suspects was a marvelous mystery, the Game had you thinking til the very end, Ronin was cutting edge action and now we have been blessed with a thriller with brains... Arlington Road.Arlington Road is a movie which will have you talking for a month, with images that you probably won't be able to shake for quiet sometime. The plot is simple, Jeff Bridges finds out his neighbors aren't who they say they are and he embarks on a private investigation to find the truth.I must commend the writer(s), for such a terrific script, the characters are among the best created for the screen and the ending... OH MY GOD! Words can't express it.I don't care what anybody says... Mark P. deserves to be nominated for Best Director. From the opening scene where the young boy is walking bloody down the quiet street to the shootout between the FBI and the family in the woods to the jaw dropping ending, EVERYTHING was flawless, you took us on a rollercoster ride and never let up... even when I was walking home my heart was still racing. You sir have a new fan.Five stars and a 10 on the IMDB. I can't wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting thriler.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road is a film that grabs your attention from the first scene and holds it all the way until its brilliant ending. Jeff Bridges (Fearless, Wild Bill) stars as a professor on domestic terrorism whose own wife had died recently. He is living with his girlfriend and son. He meets his new neighbors, played by Tim Robbins (The Shawhshank Redemption, The Player) and Joan Cusack (In and Out, Grosse Pointe Blank). They have a son about the same age which makes them new friends. Soon however Bridges begins to suspect that Robbins isn't who he says he is. This leads Bridges on a quest to find out who he is. The film is a excellent thriller about domestic terrorism that brings up many questions at the same time it entertains you. Jeff Bridges gives a fine lead performance, occasionally over-acting but still bringing out the emotions well. Joan Cusack is very good as the wife of Tim Robbins who gives the film's best performance mixing charm and creepiness very well. Highly recommended film.</fullReview>

The story moves along extremely slow and the acting leaves something to be desired.Then when the action starts, it is so unbelievable it is funny. In one scene the main character's car gets slammed by a bus; in the next the car is only slightly dented. Then there are the crazy scenes where the main character drives his car up on to the sidewalk. Boy was I laughing at the pure stupidity of the chase scene! And, of course, it is not supposed to be funny.The ending is surprising and comes close to saving the movie. Overall, the film is only average; I give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road is a well written story... but a few points in the movie should have been changed.For one, the movie was excellent right up until we learn that Robbins character is for certain the terrorist. This should have never happened so soon, it should have been hidden until the end of the movie. What made the movie so good prior to this was Jeff Bridges paranoia. Once that was gone, the movie played itself out in obvious fashion, except for a twist at the end, which I won't give away but I thought it some what made up for the decline in the story.There were several ways they could have taken the story, and any number of them would have kept the audience twice as riveted until the end. Instead, the movie makes takes a weird turn when we learn the truth of Robbins character. Unknown/uncertainty makes a thriller. Once that is lost, so is the audience.All said, I would recommend this movie. The acting is good, and a few minor details aside, I found myself interested in the movie.Give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a good movie with excellent performances by Robbins and Cusack. Robbins' understated performance made his actions seem all the more chilling, especially when compared to Bridges' over the top performance which just got worse as the film went on. Ms. Cusack's part, too small compared to the talents she brings to the screen, was excellent as usual. Her famous smile took on an altogether sinister aspect in this film, something I've never seen her do before. The slow fade of her smile at the phone booth scene brought on a chill one would not expect from an actress mostly know for her comic roles. This is a welcome expansion of her roles. Perhaps now Hollywood will recognize her talents (as if two Academy award nominations weren't enough of a hint) and give her more diverse and bigger roles. I would recommend this movie, if only to see Robbins' smooth control of his character and Ms. Cusack's exceptional, though small, performance.</fullReview>

Sure, plot twists are great, and we all love 'em, but when those twists depend on such a complex scheme of coincidences and psychological manipulation, what we are left with is fluff. The sad thing is that it would have taken only a few adjustments to haul in one of the great suspense films of all time.I would still recommend the movie for those who enjoy good acting. Robbins and Cusack are especially subtle, and the creepiness of their characters sneaks up on you rather than hit you in the face in a single, revealing scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST MOVIE OF 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best film of 1999. Hands down.The film is well done. The acting is great. Especially Tim Robbins. The movie goes from normal to paranoia in seconds. Constantly. If there is any other film better then this to come out this year, it better be great. Because this is what this film is. And the twists and turns will leave you speechless at the end. Literally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very pleasantly surprised by the ending of this movie. It was not your standard Hollywood fair. I also think it is ironic that Tim Robbins should play the antagonist in this film, the very ending of which contradicts his character's point of view in a different film -- "The Player".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, well-acted thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Pellingon has directed a beautifully crafted thriller. "Arlington Road" refers to the street where widower Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) lives with his son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark). His neighbors are Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) and his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack) whose son Michael saves in the eerie first sequence of the film. This introduces the neighbors to each other and starts the relationship which will change all their lives. Jeff Bridges gives his usual top notch performance as the guy who no one believes. Both his girlfriend, Brook (Hope Davis) and his closest friend, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), scoff at his insinuations that Oliver is possibly a terrorist. The plot thickens and Tim Robbins will make your skin crawl as his past and current endeavors are gradually revealed. Joan Cusack is a revelation in an atypically serious role for her. Mike Pellington builds his story gradually toward an absolutely shattering final half hour. You will be talking about the ending long after the film is over. It couldn't have ended any other way. The film was originally scheduled to open several months ago, right after the Columbine High School disaster. Sony wisely decided to postpone the opening for a while. However, this film would probably have done better in the fall when more adult films are released and lead the way to the Oscar race at year's end. Go see it anyway and tell your friends.</fullReview>

The movie just gets better and better and more and more gripping. You really even start to care about the characters and hope nothing bad happens to them.. well at least not to Jeff Bridges or his son. Joan Cusak and Tim Robbins I could care less about. And that is how good the acting is in this movie, you really have strong opinions about the people. This is a great thriller about terrorism and paranoia, check it out for some real chills that will haunt you for weeks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with surprise message...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Arlington Road* is a great thrill-ride of a movie, and it contains a message that I don't believe was anticipated by movie goers. It is an intense, political drama, where most of the edge-of-your-seat action comes not from special effects or violence, but from dialogue and not knowing exactly who's on who's side. The storyline focuses on American terrorism. Jeff Bridges, who plays his character with definite authenticity, lost his FBI agent wife in a mission that goes bad. Still struggling with that, he also teaches an in-depth course on American Terrorism in a university. After a tragic incident, he gets around to meeting his neighbors, Tim Robbins and small family, and that's when things begin to get strange. Slowly, but surely, Bridges begins suspecting his neighbor, Robbins, is involved in some terrorist conspiracy. As this starts out, we are not for sure if Bridges is simply verging on a nervous breakdown and is obsessed with the vengence of his wife, or if there is some actuality to what he claims. As the movie progresses, are worst fears start to seep from an extreme case of paranoia into a very black reality. The intensity only increases from here, but I'm not going to ruin the movie for you. Needless to say, it has a great ending, not necessarily happy, but realistic. It can get somewhat confusing, however, if you don't pay close attention to what's going on and take the time to think about it. The final images of this movie are what proved to be the most haunting for me, even after the tragic climax. It shows a television screen displaying a news broadcast a people walking idley by, not even noticing. This is where the message of the movie is found. Paralleling exactly to what Bridges comments on earlier in the movie, we seem to be happy with whatever the media spoon-feeds us as reality, as long as it makes us feel safe. This is a great movie. If you get the chance, go see it. It'll make you stop and question a few things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joan Cusack!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is my firm belief that Joan Cusack is the most underrated actress in Hollywood right now. She has played many different characters in her career and all of them have some strange quirk that is just plain fun to watch her develop on screen. In her latest role in the extremely entertaining film, Arlington Road, she grabs a hold of you in her small time on the screen and throttles you with subtlety. You wonder is she just sickeningly sweet and stupid or is she extremely smart and in on the entire conspiracy. You never found out for sure, but you get the feeling that she knows everything. She's that damn creepy in this film. Her sweet exterior is just fake enough at times to make chills run up your spine as you try and figure out if she is for real or if she would just stab you in the gut with no conscience after thought. She's that good. (You HAVE to see her turn as a psycho nanny in Addams Family Values).Oh, the movie? It was good! Intelligently written with an ending that is not typically Hollywood AND it makes sense. The ending brings the whole movie into focus and you can actually look back and see all that was done to Jeff Bridges' character to make the ending a satisfying surprise. Both Bridges and Tim Robbins do well in this modern film noir directed with out-of-control abandon by Mark Pellington. Robbins' character is a bit flat and one dimensional at times since he lacks Cusack's flair for mental ticks, but he gets the point across, and Bridges seemed sometimes to be too caught up in the character's paranoia, but the story carries them through.The lead up to the ending is a bit hokey unfortunately as the "master plan" depends on Bridges staying within a set mind frame and any little deviation from that would spoil everything, but it's forgivable since the trip there was so, well, trippy. The film sinks its teeth into the paranoia that is today's society and starts thrashing. Great cinematography and mood lighting keep you feeling as helpless as Bridges and it's good to see Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet) back doing what he does best: off kilter music score to help set the mood for a creepy, yet entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an incredible performance by Jeff Bridges! I will be totally disappointed if he doesn't receive a nomination for Best Actor. I was also impressed with Tim Robbins. He was equally talented on the other end of the spectrum. It took a lot of discipline to downplay his character and allow Jeff to play to the superiority of the story. The whole story concept was chilling. Sad to say this story is probably a whole lot more accurate then people will really give it credit for. For those of us who understood what was really being said and done in this movie, it makes you take pause and really think and hopefully become more aware. KUDOS to the entire entity who put such a good movie together for those of us who choose our movies so discriminately for the sheer joy of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins star in this thriller. Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a now single father on the rebound after his wife is killed while working with an FBI anti-terrorist mission. Robbins plays Oliver Lang, a new neighbor in the small suburb outside of Washington D.C. when consequences bring them together, they become friends, but events lead Faraday to believe that Lang may be a terrorist himself. all of this leads through a twisting and attention holding plot, and ends up with a powerful, and meaningful ending. Both Robbins and Bridges' played excellently in this movie. the acting was superb by all that played. the writing and dialogue fell into place just as it should - the movie felt very true to life, and displayed an array of ideas we should all begin to consider. a definite 'must see' of this summer's blockbusters!</fullReview>

A very tense drama about right-wing terrorism, with some great acting from Bridges, Robbins, Cusack and (gorgeous) Hope Davis. It's not at all obvious, and is packed with precise thinking about social paranoia, scapegoating and the nightmare world of suburbia. Lot of very Hitchcockian tricks, and excellent cinematography.</fullReview>

It features terrific performances by Tim Robbins, and Jeff Bridges. The thing that surprised me the most, in a pleasant way, was the ending. Definately not your typical Hollywood ending.

		<fullReview>This movie had so much potential. I like both Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins but in this film, they were less than their best. Joan Cusack was OK at best. Her character came off as being a funny kind of serious. I laughed at far too many scenes which ruined the whole movie for me. Thrillers should be scary not humorous. The plot was rather weak in spots. I found that there were far too many loose ends and scenes that needed more explanation. I kept waiting for the first scene in the movie to have a purpose but other then giving the main characters a reason to meet, it didn't have a meaning and it could have. I didn't totally dislike the movie but I wouldn't recommend paying to see this film on the big screen. Wait for the video or wait until it shows up on television!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes it might be poor taste in view of the Oklahoma bombings and other terrorist activity, but this movie raises other questions. Do you know your friends and neighbors as well as you think you do? Perhaps next time you see something slightly suspicious happening on your street you might look further into it instead of just shutting off. On another level, the movie opened with an interesting scene of a strange young boy, and ended just as strangely (and very unexpectedly). Joan Cusack brought a whole new meaning to the word "shopping" and gave me a jump during the film... when you think you know what's going to happen, you're wrong. Realistic and frighteningly (is there such a word?) plausible. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down that simple "Road"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of a slick Hollywood thriller is a tricky thing. The film wants to give the audience the thrills they were promised, but yet the artists involved also want to give the audience something of substance. A carefully realized thought or topical plotline that can give the otherwise lightweight film so much dramatic weight. "Arlington Road" is the perfect example of this type of movie. A movie that tries to balance both thrills and thought on the same platter.Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a professor who teaches a course in terrorism at a local college. When he rescues a neighbor's child from death one afternoon, Michael begins to get to know the mysterious nearby residents(Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack), letting them into his life and into the life of his child and girlfriend (Hope Davis). When Michael begins to suspect the couple of possible militia involvement, he unknowingly sets off a chain reaction of events that will change his life forever.Director Mark Pellington is a veteran of music videos (Pearl Jam's "Jeremy") and one other feature, 1997's ultra thin "Going All The Way". His style is very specific: throw the camera around a bit, light the whole thing with a $1.99 flashlight - who cares if this artistic choice hinders the scene - and most importantly, get great actors to spew out incredibly bad lines of dialog but still are able to retain a certain amount of credibility. This is a very junky thriller with lots of potential but Pellington is not a very good director and "Arlington Road" is about half of a great film. While tension-filled, the film doesn't ever really take off the way most of us would love to see. The film remains too grounded in it's own pretentious delivery to ever breathe freely.Jeff Bridges is coming off playing the most career-defining role he has ever played, that of Jeff Lebowski in the Coen Brother's "The Big Lebowski"(but you can call him "The Dude"). It was a brilliant performance, cementing Bridges's reputation as the best of his breed. A real middle American actor with range to spare and talent to burn. "Arlington" asks Bridges to turn his trademark wild-eyed paranoia bit into a full scale performance. Nobody can play skepticism like Bridges. Nobody. It comes as no wonder to tell you that Jeff Bridges is the one thing that keeps you glued to the screen in "Arlington". All the twists and turns in the world cannot save a inherently bad film. Bridges makes you want to see what the outcome of this highly implausible thriller is going to be. At turns heartbreaking (in scenes involving Michael's recollection of his dead wife) and deeply disturbing (the discovery of the dying boy that opens the film), Bridges's performance is spot-on the entire film.The rest of the cast is less successful. I admire Tim Robbins more for his directing lately than his acting. The film doesn't give Robbins much more to do except look menacing. It's not one of his superior performances. Joan Cusack is also wasted in a role that is way beneath what she is capable of. What she does do with her small character leaves a mark, but so much more should have been accomplished with her. I blame Ehren Kruger's ungraceful script. The screenplay is full of twists, each one a little more theatrical than the last. I know that this is a movie with a movie plot, but Kruger occasionally drops tidbits of real interesting dialog and story with Michael's lectures to his terrorism class. These scenes are the best in the film. They give the character the depth needed for the climax of the film, and they truly give off the uneasy vibe of militias and terrorism that the rest of the film works overtime to achieve.The ending of "Arlington Road" is one that will be the one thing most talked about when this movie is discussed. It is very disturbing, very vivid, and entirely appropriate. It's also one I wish I could explain in great detail here, but I won't. This conclusion is something that Pellington and Kruger do perfectly. The rest of the film is never really inadequate, just missing something that obviously Pellington couldn't provide: a strict narrative and appropriate visual choices.----- 6</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road is that type of film that gives us delicious tension and lets us squirm in our seats, not really knowing what's going to happen next. It's the kind of film that Hitchcock made so well. Jeff Bridges gives us a tormented performance. Through a series of events, and his own natural paranoia, Bridges starts to suspect his neighbor of doing things that are highly suspicious. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack hide evil behind smiles and good deeds. The smile that Cusack gives is disarming, and very scary. Behind the good cheer, is knowledge of what her and Robbins truly are, and that's what makes films like this fun to watch. We are privy to information that the characters are not allowed to have. We know that Robbins is up to no good, and we want to see Bridges succeed in exposing these people for who they truly are. Can't say anymore because it will spoil the surprises this film has to offer. Just watch out for people who smile a little too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Arlington last night and came away quite pleasantly surprised. At first I thought this was one of those -wait for the video to come out kind of movies- but it is worth the big screen and bigger bucks to see. I have a couple questions for readers. Hope not to spoil anything for ones who have not seen the movie, but I don't think that will happen.1. Was Lang assigned to deliberately live in Faradays neighbourhood. Knowing what Faraday thought of the FBI in regards to his wifes senseless death and the death of the other innocents. Was Faraday being set up for the end of the movie right from the beginning. I say yes, my friend says no, that it was mere coincidence.2. Near the end, how did Faraday know that it was the Liberty truck that was suspect. Did I miss some clue that he had. I thought that part was a bit tenuous at the least. I hope I missed some crucial fact about this because most of the movie was very well thought out.On the whole, a great story (unfortunately too true from both perspectives of law and unlawful), some convincing acting. Well worth the moola.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many times does the same movie have to be made? The answer: as many as the public can stand. This movie did have some good and original ideas, but its presentation feels like every other suspense movie out there. Man finds hurt boy. Man saves neighbor's boy. Man discovers neighbor is a psychopath. My favorite quote for this movie is "Been there, done that, bought the shirt." This was almost the worst movie ever, but a couple of factors redeemed it from being extremely awful.Plot: Not redeeming. Same ol' story about neighborhood psychopaths. You will feel like they took the formula and put a new face on it. i.e. renaming "arsenic and old lace," "rat poison and doilies." The only good thing is the ending.Ending: RedeemingI loved this ending for being totally unusual and twisted. I hate Hollywood endings with a passion.Ideas: Redeeming. Very good ideas. A couple of segments made me think. About 10-20 minutes of the whole stinking movie is thoughtful and decent. Other than that, buy the cliffs notes. The whole changing name, and lecture parts were interesting, but the rest sucked.Beginning: Redeeming. Some of the best opening shots ever. Love the credits sequence. Only about 5 minutes though. However, analyzing the different methods used to create the credits sequence is very interesting. Also the shots before are technically cool also. The rest is boring.Script: Damning. Some of the cheeziest dialogue ever written. The guy does not know how to write a script. We were laughing out loud. My favorite line is the cheeziest line: "However, we're having a party. You're welcome to join if you like." The rest is awful. Watch the movie and see. Most is monosyllabic.Acting: Just as bad. Everything is over the top and melodramatic. This was also funny stuff. We laughed at emotional shots. There are also a couple of dramatic pauses that are just desperate and unnecessary. My friends are thinking of making a better version of this movie.Overall, this does not have much good in it. The people me and my friend went with liked it, but everybody else either left or griped by the end. Not a good experience. Skip it, and see something else. However, for the undeveloped, but good, ideas, the great ending, and the opening credit sequence, I am giving this stinking pile a 3.49. This will register as a three. When I told my friends this, and they said I was being generous. IMO, awful, unoriginal, and crap.---------------3.49</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made nail-biting thriller with unexpected plot twists all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a well directed and well written suspenseful thriller. It's the kind of film that's got you so spooked, you keep on thinking "is the door gonna explode when he opens it?" or "will the house explode if he picks up the phone?". I was very impressed with this film. In fact, it's one of the best films I've seen recently, out of Big Daddy, Wild Wild West *shivers uncomfortably*, and South Park. This is about an ex-FBI agent who becomes obsessed with the fact that his neighbour may be a terrorist. It is full of thrills, and plot twists that will make you want to sit through the whole thing....if it hurts so much that you that have to go to the bathroom. Strong character development, and an all-out good plot, I give Arlington Road 10 out of 10. I must say, you will NEVER see the climax coming. It'll blow you away totally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Expect Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This engrossing and extremely gripping movie is powerful with its messages. With every carefully choreographed aspect of the movie- mise-en-scene, lighting, framing, editing, et al- you are pulled in. How you end up feeling depends on what sympathies drawn by the movie were most evoked. I left stressed and shaken, and frankly, quite angry. This film helps show the true nature of the beast, not only terrorists but the minds with which every one else must deal-- their own. Humans do require a sense of security to get on with their lives, a sense of closure, and this movie yanks that away from the audience.Yes, I was angry, angry that the security was gone, angry that there is no justice. I almost walked out, and I guarantee you that has NEVER happened before. I like non-traditional endings. But isn't that the point anyway? To make the audience think and to evoke their emotions? This is the purpose for which acting, first on stage and now on celluloid, was designed. To evoke, elicit, entertain, illustrate. This is certainly what I am in it for...Some are thrilled by the un-Hollywood (classic American cinema) ending, bound by the web so carefully spun. Hopefully one thing that everyone takes away from this film, whether they are angry or just entertained, is the humanity of the entire situation. So many people look for black and white when most things in life are shades of grey. Take the time to think about these things when you watch it. And remember all the people, their lives as valuable as anyone's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As others have noted the film's beginning appears slow; if saving a young man's life in the first 5 minutes of the film is slow; it does appear to take its time to build background and character. This is done quite well. In a role of sleaze, in my opinon Tim Robbins is the best, one can dislike him and all he has to do is smile and clasp you on your back. Joan Cusack plays the obedient housewife, with a quietude and eeriness saved usually for horror films. Jeff Bridges, in a role he plays best,confused well meaning outsider. He, at times makes you want to slap him as in trying to wake him up from this almost self-imposed paranoia. Good film, 2 boxes of popcorn in first 30 minutes after that do not leave the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrific start, but very quickly loses steam until a whimper, not a bang, ends the movie. What is surprising is that the subject matter was so powerfully debated during the Oklahoma City bombing, one would think there would be a wealth of information to draw upon. But alas, the script is presented in such a simple-minded and elementary fashion that it insults both government terrorist enforcers and those who believe in government conspiracy theories. I believe the audience does not notice, perhaps because it is distracted by the excellent production values and terrific acting. But ultimately, the entire experience leaves me unfulfilled in what could have otherwise been a soul-searching revisit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road is a great thriller, one of the best I've seen since The Usual Suspects. It's theme is original and engaging, due to the similar incidents had occurred in Oklahoma City and in Atlanta. Unfortunately, I found the acting of Jeff Bridges to be someone pretentious at times, especially in dramatic scenes. Additionally, the truth about the situation was given away far too early in the film, making the last half right before the end basically useless and slow moving, as everyone is just waiting for the conclusion. Finally, much of the action becomes repetitive and tedious as Jeff Bridges untangles his neighbor's dark past. However, despite all these negative points, the ending was an unexpected and dramatic twist which was unexpected, rivaled only by The Usual Suspect's finale, to my knowledge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film goes into detail in trying to make you identify with Jeff Bridges character and is quite effective in making you understand his loss and the sorry state his life is in due to traumatic events of his recent past. The movie actively dwells on this for a reason- to put a human face on the horror this man has gone through and his hardships in trying to raise a son and carry on in the face of pain...Movies are to entertain- and for my money, this film lived up to its duty in spades.The script is wonderful (which makes me breathe a HUGE sigh of relief since Mr. Kruger is taking over for Kevin Williamson on the Scream 3 film), the acting was top-notch, and it made me personally walk away with an enriched understanding of how brutal and senseless terrorism is...ESPECIALLY in light of the surprise ending. At the end of the film I felt horrified- like I was slapped in the face with a brick...I think Mr. Kruger wanted me to feel this. And in a country where violence in the young is at such a all-time high, I can think of nothing more positive than for us all to walk away with a shudder at the unspeakable acts the terrorists performed in this film. So IT'S A GOOD THING. Just think on it- that's all I'm asking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a nice surprise. Many of the story's elements are all too real in contemporary society and despite a few plot contrivances, it builds steadily and skillfully to an absolutely nerve-shattering climax. Bridges is very good as the everyday man with a troubled past who's driven to uncover a plot that nobody else seems to want to believe, but Tim Robbins practically steals the show. Only Joan Cusack (who's better in comedies) comes off with a chirpy and transparently phony performance as Robbins' wife; her behavior and demeanor would be more at home in a remake of "The Stepford Wives."A mostly terrific suspense-packed thriller, well worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many of you are surprised, even shocked, when a film comes out that not only has two famous, yet incredibly talented actors *and* an intelligent, thoughtful plot to boot? I count myself as one of the few who aren't impressed by over-blown special effects and disgustingly perverse subject matter (need I mention '8mm'?). I was impressed, however, by this movie.From the beginning I was wide-eyed. The opening sequence was edited so masterfully that it had my heart beating erratically. I didn't expect it to better itself. However, watching the movie play out was a like watching two trains, each one starting on opposite ends of a track, and begin to creep slowly toward one another until they finally *HIT!* By the end, I was knocked out!The movie impacted me so much that my companion and I spent the next two hours discussing the films merits and how very close the plot-line must be to reality. It made us feel, as the Professor said, "unsafe."I *highly* recommend this movie not only to any avid conspiracy theorist, but to anyone who thinks that terrorist bombings only happen in foreign lands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been wanting to see this movie since i first saw a trailer back in January (kinda got a delayed release). It looked like an interesting paranoid thriller. That it was, but not nearly what I expected.It started out right away with something that would catch your attention. Then it stayed like that throughout the rest of the movie. There were a few slow parts, but they were made up for later.You guys should know the plot by now, so I won't waste time explaining it. I'll say that I thought really high of this movie up until the ending. The ending just left me coming out of the theater wondering "what the heck was that" The ending just ruined it. I stayed in a parking lot at 2 a.m. talking with co-workers (movie theater employees only screening) about what the heck just happened. That's why I gave it an 8 instead of a 6, it left me thinking. A rare thing for a movie to do.Overall I'm just going to say go see it. enjoy yourselves(?), and don't complain to others, because you should consider yourselves warned</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was worried about this film, based on how long the trailer had run in theatres (often a bad sign). I feared I might see a great premise turned into a bad movie, with everything you needed to know given away in the preview. What I got was a tightly-written, well-acted, white-knuckle thrill ride. Bridges and Robbins are superb. The story is top-notch. The ending is brilliant. This one leaves you poring over every detail long afterward. Minor complaints include a few leaps of logic, somebody going from point A to point F without hitting the letters in between. I found myself supplying the in-between, but would have liked it spelled out; to show that the script was truly tight, that the writers had covered their bases, that there were no holes in the plot. In most cases, a few extra seconds of screen time would have done it. And I wanted stronger actors playing the supporting characters. Bridges and Robbins are so strong, they tended to overpower some of the others. Those are nit-picky complaints that did not take away from an excellent movie. But they are enough to make my rating an 8 instead of a 9 or higher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road: Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is an expert on terrorism, trying to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his son. A chance encounter brings Faraday together with his neighbor of two months Oliver Lang (Timothy Robbins). Lang is the prototypical family guy: he has nice house, a beautiful wife, 2.5 kids, and a white picket fence, but something just doesn't seem to fit. A bit of detective work seems to confirm Michael's worst fears. Has Michael stumbled onto a conspiracy, or is he losing his mind?There is some very creative camera work in this film and Robbins' performance is excellent. Unfortunately, there is little else to recommend this movie: the pace is agonizingly slow, the blurred fictional references to the Oklahoma city bombing and Ruby Ridge are distracting, half of the film is spent giving close-ups of Bridges' face (I had flashbacks to the never ending slow motion sequences in "Blown Away"), and the "tension" is contrived and unbelievable.I was particularly disappointed with the transparent story line - there is little doubt regarding Lang or what he does and the big plot twist is not much of a surprise. Wait for the video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An irresponsible thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say "irresponsible" because the Oklahoma City bombing, despite the fact that it happened four years ago, is still fresh in our memories. Without giving away the "surprise" ending, I can say that this is the first thriller I've seen about terrorists that sympathizes, more or less, with the terrorists. Not a wise thing in this era of building bombings within our borders, the Unabomber, not to mention Littleton. I've read that the studio pushed back the release date of this movie because of the Colorado shootings, although the film mirrors the events in OK (there is a subplot involving a terrorist bombing in the midwest, but they change the city to St. Louis--how thoughtful!) The movie infuriated me. Normally I enjoy "twisted" endings (No Way Out being the most famous one in the last ten or 15 years). It takes an intriguing notion (what if YOUR friendly next door neighbor was the Unabomber?) and milks the suspense every so often. There are some eerie flashback sequences (Jeff Bridges' character's wife, an FBI Agent, was killed in the line of duty while trying to diffuse terrorist activity in West VA). But slowly, Bridges begins to overact (not a wise move for Bridges--he's better playing subdued characters), and the villains of the movie (played by Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack) become less threatening and more like clowns. Robbins begins to overact as well--maybe he thought the film was a black comedy that allowed for his odd antics. Like Bridges, he's a lot more effective when playing quiet, detached guys (Jacob's Ladder, Shawshank Redemption). He's also good at playing jerks (The Player, Short Cuts). But he's not so good when he goes over the top (remember Cadillac Man?) And this film makes the mistake of letting him go over the top, and he's laughable. And then there's that ending. This is one case where a more "conventional" ending would've been accepted. I usually love unconventional endings, like in John Sayles' recent "Limbo." But I feel, in the wake of the events in the news, the ending of this film will anger many. On the plus side, the cinematography was unusual (the opening shot is a grabber). Cusack is fine when she's not resorting to silly villain ways. And Hope Davis is wonderful in a small, throwaway role as Bridges' girlfriend. I normally don't attack movies for their morals (I loved Happiness), so maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for this film. I just got an uneasy feeling while watching this movie. I kept straining forward, waiting for Bridges to stop the terrorists. And everything fell over like a house of cards. I guess the movie affected me enough to get angry; maybe it's a success after all. But I don't think I'll be jumping in line to see it again.</fullReview>

After that Arlington Road becomes tensed and unpredictable. One bad point about this movie is that the story sometimes takes Hughes steps But if you like a good tensed movie go see this one. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing for a movie with Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So how can a movie with both Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges be not great? Well, Bridges' performance was just so-so and the storyline was just too predictable (apart from the ending of course). I loved Jeff Bridges in the Big Lebowski as well as in Peter Weir's Fearless, but the way he played Michael Farraday... a bit too dramatic in my opinion. OK, so his character was very one-dimensional. But the same can be said about Oliver Lang, but Tim Robbins should be nominated for an Oscar solely for his eyebrow performance (the way he delivered 'the look'!) The press have called Arlington Road a psychological thriller (at least here in Holland), but what was so psychological about it? Characterization was minimal, especcially for Oliver Lang. So what do we know about him? His motives are explained in a 2 minute scene, in about 3 lines. He lived on a farm, the government stole their water, and now he's p****d and has decided to bomb buildings for a living? That's it? Oh, and i do not like car chases and man to man fights in my Tim Robbins films. The brilliant ending saved it from being mediocre. People who like their thrillers psychological and their endings unHollywood should watch The Usual Suspects.</fullReview>

Michael is a history professor at the Washington University, recently widowed and living with his 9 year old son.His son becomes befriended with the Lang's son and also Michael and Oliver and his wife started to see each other often..so from there on Michael starts to see strange things that leads him into paranoia or not?...An unusual ending...maybe anti-Hollywood..and after you've seen the movie you still have an odd feeling about what happened..An intelligent thriller!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like I do with other movies, I saw this one with absolute no knowledge of the story - and I found it very disappointing. The story seemed very predictable, full of cliches and Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges did a lot of overacting. This was the first movie in a long time I even considered walking out (like one other person out of an audience of six did).However ... POSSIBLE SPOILER (don't read further if you want to see this movie!!)after the movie I found myself wondering "Can a last minute surprise ending turn an otherwise bad movie into a good movie?" Because I was surprised - oh boy! And in retrospect, all the bad things I have to say about this movie seem to be intentional, so that you are fooled into that twist.But why should I pay 12,- DM ($7) to be NOT entertained (or thrilled or moved or frightened) until the very end of a movie? IMO that shouldn't be the goal of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, from the trailer I saw, this film looked really, real good. An interesting idea, based on paranoia, with Tim Robbins as the spooky guy. I loved Tim Robbins after 'The Shawshank Redemption', and to have him suggested as the evil guy - what a hook.However, for the first hour of the film, I was getting increasingly worried - what I call the 'Kiss The Girls' fear, after my experience with that film; the trailer was really good, but the film was rather bland and uninspirational.The cinematography is great; the build up is slow, but it adds atmosphere; Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are simply wonderful as the neighbours - are they nuts, or just REALLY nice people?However, the film suffers from weak, tenuous plot holes. You know the type, where Mr. A is trying to do something without the knowledge of Mr. B, and *suddenly* (shock!) Mr. B appears behind him, despite the fact that no-one heard him arrive on the scene, and there is absolutely no way that he could have realised what was going on and figured out that he needed to be there. This happens about five times during the movie, and while I can suspend disbelief, there were so many fortuitous 'coincidences' that I began to feel cheated, and was itching to shout 'oh purleeeese!'Also, Jeff Bridges was not entirely convincing. I don't believe characters who shout hysterically and don't make any sense and alienate the people they are trying to get to understand them when it is absolutely imperative that they make sense, and that people understand them. Some overacting here.However, the film keeps you guessing until the very end, which makes the second hour very good entertainment... I was on the edge of my seat! The second hour certainly redeemed the film, it keeps on getting better until the very cool finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Rd is a film that has been made with a style and energy that is lacking in many studio productions. Pic opens with Daniel's finding a blood-soaked boy in the middle of the street. We follow as he tries to save the boy's life, the camera spinning wildly as Daniel's fear grows. The film builds slowly from this point (too slowly?), gradually building Daniel's paranoia and suspicions about a certain neighbour - Tim Robbins. All this slowly builds up until the big crackerjack finale*.Arlington Road does certainly pose many question, and provides its own answers, regarding urban terrorism. It is rather heavy handed on its approach to whether or not we are 'safe' in today's society, labouring on the point on too many occasions. Recommended nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road takes about 70 minutes to show us the perfect American suburb. With all its good and bad "neighbours". And all that time it gives you the feeling of what will happen in the rest of the film. It seems kind of predictable all the way through. Tim Robbins is so normal it's gotta be faked. So watch out. Maybe you predict some things wrong. In spite of the slow start I gave the film a rating of 7 for the simple reason that the ending is refreshingly not at all Hollywood. I won't tell more, because it would spoil your fun. Only this: Joan Cusack`s last line is a highlight of the whole movie: "Let's go somewhere safe." After the part she played in this movie... just a great line. And the morale: there are no safe places left on this planet...because "they" are everywhere and you might be one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not expect anything when I went to see this film at a press screening. Two hours later, it slowly dawned to me -- I had just seen the best thriller Hollywood has turned out since "The Silence of the Lambs". "Arlington Road" deals with the subject of home-made American terrorism. But it does more than that. It really is about the fragility of reality and the nightmares lurking just below the surface of normality. There are disturbing moments in this film that David Lynch or Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack play a couple who may or may not be something very different than the happy and harmless middle-class people they seem. Their neighbour Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) becomes suspicious and gathers information when things begin to get eerie. Michael thinks he can still get out, but he is caught in a spider's web. "Arlington Road", too, takes its time to build atmosphere and tension. Slowly, it grabs you by the throat and does not let go, building up to a devastating climax. If you think that the surprise ending of "Fallen" could not be surpassed, wait till you see this one. I could see this film again and again -- it's just so neatly crafted, so unusually dark, so effective. I cannot get it out of my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) finds a bloody kid walking in the middle of the road. He brings the nameless boy to the hospital. It turns out to be Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack)'s child Brady. The Langs moved in two months ago and it's the first time Michael had talked to them. He teaches a course in American Terrorism at George Washington University. His FBI agent wife was killed leaving him alone with their son. He's dating Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis). The Langs seems to be good people until he starts suspecting them of being terrorists.There is a fictional past St Louis bombing as part of the story which is a thinly veiled reference to the Oklahoma bombing. It hits a little too close to the mark. It needs more differentiation to move away from the feel of ripped-from-the-headlines. The movie starts off slowly with the suburbia. It picks up a little bit of speed with some paranoia and darkness underneath. Bridges and Robbins do a pretty good job selling it. However it gets bog down with a lot of conspiracy theory investigation. The conspiracy is too big and way too complicated. It's also very annoying to have a stupid FBI agent. It's an easy clich which adds nothing interesting. It would have been so much better to keep to the loner terrorist from everyday life. Doing the reverse is a fun exercise but not much more. The problem is that the filmmakers never ask why. It's a lot of convenient convoluted plot to do something that is questionable at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" The Enemy you fear is in the Heart Of all you Cherish "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Book 'Arlington Road ' written by Ehren Kruger is the basis for the movie. Directed by Mark Pellington it is he who provided the explosive conclusion to this incredible drama. Most Americans who know anything about their history are cognizant of 9-11 and it's aftermath. Aware it can happen anytime, anywhere to anyone, this movie is but one of many which personifies the fear of trusting Americans and what can happen if we become complacent with our freedoms. In this film, a college professor Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is teaching a course dealing with Fanitical or terrorist groups, while at the same time dealing with his own grief over his late wife's untimely death in the middle East. Coincidentally, new neighbors moves into his neighborhood. Suspecting nothing, Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) is a typical family man who with his wife set up their home next to the Faradays' and settle in. However, within days he creates much suspicion in Faradays' mind that he is not whom he seems. Mail whom Lang receives, is the first of many inconsistencies which Faraday finds odd and leads him to believe his neighbor is not whom he says. Suspecting Lang might be a criminal, Faraday tries to keep his son Grant (Spencer Treat Clark) from becoming too friendly with the new family. Additional suspicions began to accumulate to the point that it causes Faradays' new girlfriend to die in a mysterious car accident and this causes Michael to bring the matter to the F.B.I. However, Lang and his friends also fan Faradays' fears to fever pitch and this causes him to conclude that Lang has got to be a Terrorist out to destroy America in some way. This movie is slow to build and resembles a slow burning fuse on its' way to detonation and does so with the audience not far behind. A good dramatic thriller and one which owes much to the creative acting of Bridges and Robbins. Easilly recommended to the many fans of both these great men. I expected much more from Spencer Treat Clark, but he did his best playing a boy swept along with the fearful current. Superior acting on his part. ****</fullReview>

This is my 2nd favorite Jeff Bridges film with the 1st being The Big Lebowski.The film is about Micheal Farraday played by Jeff Bridges who teaches courses on Terrorism. One day Micheal stumbles upon a kid played by Dennis The Menace himself, Mason Gamble, Walking down the street with a burnt and bloody hand which was caused by a fireworks incident and meets the boys parents(The Kids name is Brady). Micheal Meets Oliver played by Tim Robbins and Cheryl Long played by Joan Cusack who are the boys parents. They have a dark, twisted and secret past and will go to any measures to keep people from finding out.This film is thrilling to the last minute. The performances are top notch, The story is played out great and I liked the twist ending which, I will admit got me a little teary eyed.Rated R For Violence Ad Some Language.1hr 57min/117min.5 uses of the F-word.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to understand why Arlington Road sat on the studio shelf for nearly a year. No, the film isn't awful; rather, it's an extremely edgy and ultimately bleak thriller that offers no clear-cut heroes or villains. In other words, Hollywood had no idea how to sell it. Director Mark Pellington's underrated directorial debut, Going All the Way, suffered the same fate, essentially because the filmmaker's presentation of suburban America often shifts dramatically within the same film. Characters are usually miserable and bordering on meltdown, no situation is straightforward, and things usually end badly. Arlington Road begins as an astute study of suburban paranoia. Michael Faraday (a face-pinched Jeff Bridges, who spends most of the film on the brink of tears) is a college professor who teaches American history courses on terrorism. He's been a conspiracy freak since his wife, an FBI agent, was killed during a botched raid that feels like a thinly fictionalized reference to the Waco tragedy. After saving the life of his next-door neighbor's child, he initially befriends the family (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), but soon believes the husband is a terrorist. The first half of the film mocks Faraday: he has no real evidence and is not the most stable of protagonists. Despite the fact that it was government paranoia that got his wife killed, Faraday repeats the same type of behavior. Pellington shifts gears in the second half, however, and for awhile, it seems that the film has simultaneously sunk into a cheap, high-octane brand of Hollywood entertainment and undermined its own point. Arlington Road, though, possesses a stunning ending that's a real gut punch, one that may leave you needing a second viewing to catch all of its smartly executed setup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging paranoid fantasy but fundamentally detached from reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road is based on a fundamentally absurd premise: a secret terrorist campaign.The first priority, arguably the central purpose of any terrorist campaign is publicity. Any terrorist, from the Una-Bomber loner to Al Qaida has ready access to the mass media. Today, we all do. The argument presented here, that solo-terrorists are a cover for the actions of secret conspiracies, of which the government wishes the public to know nothing or indeed itself knows nothing is fundamentally preposterous. There would be nothing to achieve by blowing up public buildings if nobody, even the government, knows that it is part of a campaign.Clearly, this absurd premise is inspired by the conspiracy theories surrounding the Oklahoma bombing. Those conspiracy theories have been soundly trounced by successive examinations in the past. More fundamentally, if Timothy Mc Veigh had been part of a conspiracy, for what reason would his organisation not claim "credit" for their "successful" operation? The movie is particularly interesting in crystallising aspects of the liberal Hollywood mentality prior to 9/11. In the liberal Hollywood view of the world, the most likely source of terrorist attack has to be American and has to be from a right-wing anti-government source. Although the terrorist group in the movie is not specifically described as right-wing, it's principle co-ordinating aspect is a youth group whose uniforms make them look for all the world like full-blown Nazis.Yet this movie was made at a time when the terrorist intentions of genuine foreign conspiracies, whose leading figures are now household names, were already well known and apparent to anyone who chose to open their eyes to the news. It was made at a time when Osama Bin Laden had already declared war on the U.S and his operatives had already launched one major bomb attack on the World Trade Centre. When Al Qaida affiliates had already set off bombs on the Paris Metro. Yet Hollywood, Tim Robbins, Jeff Bridges, et al, still preferred to imagine that there was a serious threat to U.S. citizens from unknown organisations with an un-announced agenda not actually known to exist! These things aside, the movie has strong points and weak points. The plot builds nicely to the point where the Bridges character and we the audience together realise at the penultimate moment what has happened. That is the movie's strongest feature. However, whilst Bridges acts believably a lot of the time ( as in the scene when he is first confronted and wrong-footed by the Robbins character ) he at other times vastly over-eggs the show of desperation. For example after extracting a clue from a reluctant bereaved man, suddenly and without a word of explanation running out of the room. Indeed, a lot of the time, he appears to be running about like the proverbial "headless chicken". Moreover, it is pushing credibility to ask us to believe that such a "ballsy" dogged pursuit of truth is coupled in this character with such a complete "lack of balls" at every critical moment. Rarely have I seen a movie in which the "hero" so lets all manner of s81t be kicked out of him without a murmur of complaint, let alone a fight. Utterly unbelievable is the scene when he finally gains the upper hand and then simply runs away from it, allowing his antagonist to get up and go back into action. Why? The most interesting aspect of the direction is the way in which shots of the espied conspirators evoke scenes from "Invasion of the body snatchers". Characterless faces, automated body language, exchanging mysterious packages, passing in and out of vehicles and buildings.However, overall, the entertainment value of the movie is undermined by awareness of its subliminal attempt to inoculate the viewer against a healthy realisation that Democracy's enemies are not primarily home-grown neo-NAZI's but as 9/11 demonstrated two years later, fascists of a different kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm not going to forget it for the rest of my life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that you're not going to forget a movie for the rest of your life doesn't necessarily mean that the movie is good; it could be something so awful you'll never be able to get out of your mind. Well, in this case it does mean the movie is good: I'm not going to forget "Arlington Road" for the rest of my life. This is a compliment for a movie I had wanted to watch for a lot of years before I watched it some days ago.Why didn't I watch it? I don't know. Do I regret it? Big time, because I didn't find the movie as innovating as it seemed to be a long time ago, and consequently I didn't find it very good; as I probably would have a long time ago. Is that I have seen so many movies of this type, you know? With a twist in the end and tension all the way through?Most of them weren't even good so I lost faith in the genre and its originality."Arlington Road" is a perfect example for a good film in the genre, which also combines various other elements and luckily develops its plot directly through the characters, when everything now is still making sense mostly through the actions. Ehren Kruger, a very talented writer whose credits include "The Ring" and "The Skeleton Key", failed to make way for its mind-blowing conclusion in the latter film a couple of years ago. But with "Arlington Road", many years before, everything in her screenplay fit fine, making the conclusion more than satisfying and still mind-blowing.The story about Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) a man still suffering because of his wife's death and teaching a terrorism university course because she was an agent, while he deals with his troubled son; "Arlington Road" begins with a breathtaking first scene full of film-making potential, where Michael saves a kid from bleeding to death; taking him to the ER without knowing his name. Soon he finds out from his parents, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl (Joan Cusack) that the kid is his neighbor from across the street. "They've been living here for weeks, I save the boy's life and I don't even know his name", Michael tells Brooke (Hope Davis) the day after.We admire Angelo Badalamenti's score and Bobby Bukowski's cinematography from the start. Director Mark Pellington, after having done music videos, went strong after the big screen?Succeeding, fortunately. Michel Gondry made the transaction from music videos to films beautifully and successfully; imposing his imaginative vision of the world in his movies. On the other hand, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (directors of "Little Miss Sunshine") amazed with the simplicity of their images after leaving the music video scene. Besides these two, not many directors are really successful in penetrating their ideas into film after music videos? Pellington did it right, and in the movie everything appears new, attractive and not excessive (in the use of the resources); therefore not tiring for the viewer. As Pellington worked, the whole piece worked out. Never tiring, the story becomes more unpredictable by the minute and the tension never stops. The best thing about this is that the actors end up disappearing in their characters. It is not a long film, but there's a point where everyone seems to have not enough energy left.I said Kevin Spacey and Samuel Jackson were a great acting duo in "The Negotiator". Here, Robbins and Bridges are not better; but their merit is. Without the action and the explosions of the police procedure, their work becomes something passively violent. In conversations barely with movement, their faces have to be enough to say what's written on the script. And everything is so mysterious that you never know who is going to appear and what they're going to do. The same to be said about the female leads; Hope Davis and Joan Cusack in two pitch-perfect jobs, Cusack being a surprise for the dramatic approach.I'm sure shooting was not a forgettable experience for anyone involved in it, or at least it looks like it?It's also unforgettable for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arlington Road-Fear Thy Neighbor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a problem to any perception about Politics and Governments.These problems almost always end up in some real fervor with an attempt real and otherwise being made to influence the outcome by elements of induced hysteria.This is as useful in selling a car as in selling a war and that is what this and most masquerades in the Motion Picture "Arlington Road" provide for.The requirement that the hysteria provides for is that there must be made an ability to be aware of the reality in which we live in.The picture can and does mingle terribly close with some real and perhaps outlines of current anti-government sentiment and that is why this film does seem to provide a story telling ability.The answer though is not in the ability to tell a story,the answer is in the ability to tell the difference between right and wrong.The truth or so it would seem is a constant thorn in the side of the motion picture industry.This film is no different than any other Motion Picture with less of a truthful telling ability than to suggest that this should be measured as to this films value if any value is in fact represented by this film.The film is not an answer and whatever so called answers it provides are not answers but scripted characterizations so to tell a story.The motion picture as such also leads but as it almost always does will not comply with an answer but with a different twist and turn,such is the very heart of the story telling ability.There is this to this ability that we are in fact not looking at the truthful story telling ability of a given motion picture but in a motion picture about? I'am not sure what this film is about.It certainly does little to suggest that there is any value here that is abiding in faith and even more so that there may very well be another idealogical premise to such as had by this attempt at story telling ability.There is so much left to look more carefully at,that there is an inability to justify the hysterical non-sense of its conclusions and though its conclusions are part of its story telling ability,it is here that the motion picture becomes a purveyor of grades of hysteria from amerture to potential contributor.Those that can and will be able to draw significant threads as to the difficulties with the motion picture as well with the idealogical underpinning of another authority are given some support from these quarters as there is present in its influence an attempt to usurp authority.The motion picture has an undue place in this hemisphere and as disconcerting as that may seem it is not the real problem it is only a symptom of a problem.How can we solve for an unknown? Reality is in fact the unknown and though it is an influence,the details as to the source is a constant though as yet an unknown.The agonizing problem of abuse,that is the having power over another is involved with this story telling ability and as well the role that importance has provided for has as yet not been looked at more closely.There is as well a look see attitude at some of the established institutions, providing for some at least a familiar concept as to importance but there in fact remains much left to ponder.It is even responsible for broaching topics that engage the illusion of an image and as well the conceit of a propagandist position.It is as well a curious note that with all that goes on in this motion picture there is little to no illusion or mention of a religious precept to our understanding of our place here in this world.Perhaps it may in fact be an answer that is not spoken and perhaps not.There is in fact a real attempt made to get your attention and to keep it focused on the illusion as this story unfolds.Indeed the illusion is made real by appearances that much of this world will recognise with though hard to believe results and conclusions had all the while.The aforementioned hysterical elements provide for the finishing touches with a word of caution don't take it seriously!</fullReview>

The storyline flows easily, with little confusion, if any, and all though I would not consider it a... 'twist' ending, it is quite a new idea for one. I loved this movie, the characters are well adaptable and easy to get into, so it has a naturally strong impact emotionally.

		<fullReview>This is clearly a somewhat forgettable film, because I just watched it and only gradually realised that I'd seen it before! However, given the nature of the film I don't think that's a huge criticism; this is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, not something which will change your life.I think some of the other reviews here are somewhat unfair. The plot may be similar to some other films, but in the end there are few plots which are truly original and this one is at least somewhat out of the ordinary. Also, while there are no doubt pieces that don't quite fit together I think this one does a better job than most - without including spoilers, if at the end you think things don't hang together you may want to think a bit more carefully. Also to me the actions of the main character (Jeff Bridges) seem plausible under the circumstances.Overall this is a well-made, well-acted action/thriller; anyone who enjoys such films is likely to enjoy this one. Be aware that there is a certain amount of violence, and the opening scene in particular is somewhat disturbing.</fullReview>

Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins both play their parts very well, albeit at a rather sluggish pace.The strength of the movie though is its ending, which totally blew me away, as I'm sure it did many others. In an age when most movies have nice clean-cut feel-good endings, it's refreshing to see one that is the total opposite of that. Even if it left you feeling disgusted, you have to give the filmmakers their due for such a gutsy move. I don't think it was a bad ending just for its sake, but it's trying to prove a point that stuff like that can happen and unfortunately we'd never know.</fullReview>

This movie makes you think that it could happened in the real world. A flawless movie. I give all the credit to the writer Ehren Kruger for the unthinkable ending. The ending is quite different than the other movies. You think you know what is going to happened but it does not. From the very beginning of the movie you want to know what is going on. You try to guess what is going to happen but you are wrong. When you are the middle of the movie, you do not want to stop to do some thing else. You just want to know what is next. If any one thinks it was not a good movie, I do not know what to say about them. May be they do not have a taste in movies. At the end of the day do we really know who our neighbor is?</fullReview>

Besides all the incredible acting, the twisted ending is what makes the movie a 10. This film is suspenseful to say the least.

		<fullReview>"Arlington Road" is a very well executed thriller. The story is about Michael Faraday (Bridges), a professor, who has lost his wife, an FBI agent, in a botched FBI operation. He is struggling to put his life together again, and lives with his 6-year-old son, while beginning a relationship with Brooke (Davis), an ex-student of his. After saving their son from an accident, he gets close with his new neighbors, Oliver Lang (Robbins), and Cheryl (Cusack). In the beginning everything goes smoothly: The Faraday and Lang kids become good friends, while the Faradays and Langs are having a good time together. However, Michael starts to suspect that Oliver has some weird characteristics, and he even seems to be a terrorist. Is that so?Mark Pellington's direction is great, as he keeps a fine balance between keeping the tension high and avoiding any unnecessary exaggerations. Jeff Bridges gives one of his best performances as confused and unfortunate Prof. Faraday, while Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are also very good as his enigmatic neighbors.The film has a solid, thought-provoking, and plausible plot, which keeps the tension high until the very end. Excellent. 9/10.</fullReview>

This gripping and riveting motion picture turns up to be quite realistic, in spite of its being shot a few years ahead of September eleventh. In order to be really plausible and believable, a movie must be lead by by persuasive cast performances and built around a solid story. Well, Mark Pellington's work, as far as I can see, matches all these requirements and shows three outstanding actors: John Cusack, Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges. The shocking finale leaves a strong scar on the audience brain as well as many tremendous mysteries and questions.

As I mentioned the film is a very dark film meaning that it is one hundred-ten percent serious and the nature of the film will terrify the viewer. The music by Angelo Badalamenti and tomandandy is very good. The direction by Mark Pellington is excellent! The ending is unbelievable!

		<fullReview>Arlington Road is a silly film. It tries to be intelligent, informed and political but its lofty ambitions add up to delusions of grandeur. It wears a dunce's hat and wants us to think it's a crown.Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is having trouble coming to terms with the loss of his wife, an FBI agent killed some years earlier in a botched raid. He's banging one of his graduate students but his heart's not in it. He teaches American history, specifically the history of American terrorism, and begins to suspect his neighbour is a terrorist. It's quite a coincidence. It's the first of many.Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack play Your Next Door Neighbours. They're blandly suburban, they have barbecues and dinner parties, their kids play Little League baseball. You can bet they own Tupperware. They're supposed to make us question what lies beneath the surface of the people with whom we share our streets. Every serial killer, every rapist, every burglar and insurance fraudster lives somewhere, lives next to someone. And there's something fishy about these people. Their kid blew up his hand playing with fireworks. Robbins says he's an architect working on a mall but has blueprints for an office building. And he calls himself Lang but has been getting letters addressed to a Mr Fenimore. Are these people really terrorists, or are Faraday's grief and expertise leading him to paranoid delusions?In most thrillers we'd be given some signs of ambiguity, clues that lead nowhere, red herrings that frustrate us. But this is a strangely one-sided film that leaves little doubt in our minds. After all, if Bridges were wrong what would be the finale? Him taking a basket of fruit over the road and saying `My mistake!'The film flirts with serious issues, plays with politics and extremism but seems uninterested in their depths. It needs to find a way of teaching us about terrorism and does so by literally teaching us about terrorism! We sit in on the rambling lectures given by Faraday, we're told facts here and there ? most of them invented ? but learn little. We're given statistics, profiles of terrorists, conspiracy theories that add up to precisely nothing. We're not told anything about the motivations of anti-government groups. We don't discuss their beliefs; we just condemn their actions. The film's interest in terrorism is superficial, just a hook on which to hang a limp thriller. It flirts with issues, certainly, but only because they'll take us to a car chase and a fight scene.Beyond its one-sided are-they/aren't-they/of-course-they-are plotting and its dunderheaded struggles with politics, the film lacks credibility because of its reliance on coincidence. It's a big enough coincidence having a terrorist living across the road from a professor of terrorism but worse is yet to come. Faraday searches through old newspapers to get background on his neighbour, while his neighbour sneaks up behind him in the background. Faraday's girlfriend parks her car and sees her neighbour in the same car park trading briefcases and vehicles with a stranger. She follows him, finds a payphone and calls Faraday to report what she's seen, turns around and is face to face with the neighbour's wife. These people get everywhere! They're not the Langs, they're Mr and Mrs Droopy!There is a twist towards the end of the film that goes some way to explaining the coincidences and contrivances that come before it, but it rubbishes everything that follows. You look at the film one way and it doesn't make much sense. You look at it another way and see just a different kind of nonsense. Somehow it pulls a great finale out of nowhere, one that makes you think better of the film until you remember that, actually, it wasn't out of nowhere ? it was from The Parallax View.It's a strange film. It's not awful, its cast is as good as you'd expect and the direction is fine. Had it shown more modesty it could have been a solid (if disposable) movie but it wants things that are beyond its reach and ends up looking... silly. It's just a silly film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Tim Robbins, excellent suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movies which introduce a new, fictional story to an already existing event in history. This story might be true, very close to the truth or far away from the truth, it's up to the movie goers to decide. One example is From Hell, and another is Arlington Road.Although we might be fed up with what the story discusses (terrorism), great acting, especially from Tim Robbins, excellent suspense and originality surely makes up for this. The film makes you think about the fact that everything might not be what it seems, just because you been told ambiguous conclusions based on simple facts. The movie has to make you think to some degree to make it really good. This contributes to the slight conspiring character of the film, which adds to it's originality. Leading up to one of the best endings in motion picture history, makes it truly one of best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing film that you must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you believe only to the official version of the facts in uncritical way , you could not see this film. If you think that the evil is not possible that could hide in the institutions of your country, you could not see this film. If you think that the evil is only in those countries that not even you know but that your president suggests you, you could not see this film. I'm talking about one of the best shocking thrillers: Arlington Road. Arlington Road takes you to live a nightmare by a perfect acting, by a pressing pace and by an unbelievable ending. The ending communicates you a sense of pain and injustice beyond normal comprehension. I loved this choice : films usually are like hypnotic sessions where at the end the illusionist snaps the fingers and the spectator gets out of the trance. Not this time. The sense of uneasiness and the sense of disorientation don't leave you. It forces you to consider if the targets of the war against the terrorism are correct, or if they are nothing else other than a facade who masks other affair. I have read in user comments that the ending is weak because it is too unrealistic. Do you seem realistic the terrorist cohabitation that we are living ??? A dozen of terrorists armed with knives and manuals of flight could strike the heart the USA, anthrax letter and explosive packages kill and hurt innocent people. A disturbing film that you must see. My Evaluation : 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MILD SPOILERS*** *SPOILERS AHEAD*I actually saw this movie for the first, and to date, only time about a year ago. It had already been out for three years and I had been meaning to see it for some time. When I finally got the chance, it turned out not to be what I expected. Being a fan of action flicks, I came into the movie expecting something along those line . This movie was a far cry from that expectation- the rather lurid opening scene should've clued me in to this right from the get-go. This movie is more of a supense/drama than anything else and let me tell you, by the time you reach the end of the movie, you will want to go out and rent a nice feel-good action flick, just so that you can forget this movie's rather disturbing, tragic conclusion.The plot of Arlington Road revolves around the rather paraniod professor Michael Faraday (an extremely convincing Jeff Bridges) who teaches a course in terrorism and FBI tactics. He has a somewhat emotional attachment to this subject, as his wife, an FBI agent, was killed by terrorists during an operation a couple of years earlier. Faraday lives in a suburban Washington, D.C. nieghborhood with his girlfriend and his son from said previous marriage. One day, he is driving home from work and he sees this kid with his body all bloodied up from something and quickly rushes to his aid. Faraday soon finds out that this kid is the son of the new couple that just moved in next door (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack). The two families soon become well acquainted with each other and develop a decent relationship. But Faraday soon starts to suspect that behind the seemingly friendly facade of his new neighbors lies a major terrorist plot. Soon, it is discovered that his suspicions were well founded.One really good thing about this movie was the acting. All of the performances were wll done, especially from Jeff Bridges. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack were pretty strong in their supporting roles but it was definitely Bridges' performance carried the movie. His performance was Oscar-worthy and why the Academy failed to get that through its thick skull, is honestly beyond me. I mean, he played Michael Faraday with so much conviction that I honesly felt so much for him and what he had to go through. This by itself made the ending of the movie that much more heartbreaking. However, at the same time, you can't help but think that Faraday kinda brought it upon himself. I mean, yeah, so he had this suspicion. Understandable, given his knowledge of terrorism. But don't you think he coulda shown a little more subtlety about it? I mean, he went into the guy's house for cryin' out loud. That was a major faux pas on his part. It still hurt to see what happened to him though.Probably the most disturbing thing about this movie was the fact that it so closely mirrored events that happened only a few years before it was released (ie-the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, which was even referenced in the movie a few times) and was a hint of equally tragic events to follow even sooner afterwards (ie-September 11, 2001). This was, and still is, a movie of the times in which we live and that is very, very sad.In conclusion, should you go out and rent this movie? That all depends. If you're looking for an entertaining action/thriller where the main character gets to play with cool weapons, blow stuff up, beat the bad guys and save the day, do not venture anywhere near this Road. I would recommend the likes of movies like the Die Hard series, or Reindeer Games (the latter of which was also written by Ehren Kruger and similarly reflects his penchant for suspense and plot twists without being so distrubring) However, if you're looking for an intense, though-provoking, searing drama with intelligent dialogue, a realistic (albeit unsettling) ending and top-notch performances to boot, Arlington Road is the place for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie albeit not one that I plan on seeing again anytime soon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS AHEAD*I actually saw this about a year ago. Back then I didn't realize that IMDB existed. of course if I had, my review of the movie would have differed a little bit from what is to follow. In retrospect, I went into this flick with entirely the wrong expectations and the wrong state of mind. By the time, I got around to seeing Arlington Road, it had already been out for three years. I was really excited to see it expecting it be more of an action flick with little to engage the mind. I was very wrong, as it turned out to be a very far cry from most action movies- the rather lurid opening scene should have clued me in to that fact right away. This movie is more of a suspense-drama and by the time you reach the movie's end- at least if our are like me- you'll probably want to seek out a mindless action flick in order to blot this one out of your mind. The plot of this story revolves around a rather paranoid professor named Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges in a role that shoulda gotten him at least an Oscar nomination if not a win) who teaches a course in terrorism and FBI tactics. He especially has an emotional attachment to the subject as his wife, an FBI agent, was killed during a bust a couple of years earlier. Faraday lives with his girlfriend and his son from the previous marriage in a suburb of Washington, D.C. where he at least thinks he lives a quiet, peaceful existence. One day he is driving home from work and he see this kid walking around with a very bloody arm (Mason Gamble, who has matured a bit since Dennis the Menace). He takes him to the hospital and soon finds out that the kid is the son of the Langs (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), the family that just moved in next door. The two families soon start to intermingle and get to know each other. But after some time, Faraday begins to suspect that the Langs may in fact be terrorists. He later finds out that his suspicions are very well justified. One thing about Arlington Road that helped it to keep its sense of credibility was the acting. All of the performances were top-notch. Bridges was especially superb and like I mentioned earlier, I hate the fact the Academy completely overlooked his performance. I mean, he stepped into Faraday's shoes and completely became him. The way he showed Faraday's paranoia and fear was done to perfection. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack were pretty good in their roles as well, but it was Bridges who really stole the show. I grew so attached to his character that it made the ending that much more disturbing and heartbreaking. At the same time though, I can't help but think that he almost played into hands of the terrorists. I mean, it seems as though he almost played so cheaply in to their hands. Okay, yeah, so he had his suspicions. Understandable given the circumstances and what he knew about terrorism. By why did he have to wear his suspicions so visibly on his sleeves? It grew apparent that the Langs knew that he was on to them. That, in my mind, was what really sealed his fate. I still hated watching it though. To add to this, what made it even more disturbing and realistic was that it so closely mirrored events that happened not to far before the movie was released (ie- the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, which was even referenced in the movie a few times)and it was also a hint of equally tragic and devastating events to come (ie- September 11, 2001). This movie was, and still is, a really sad reflection of what has transpired in recent times. In conclusion, would I personally recommend that you go out and rent it? That all depends. If you're looking for some mindless, entertaining action flick where the main character shots big guns, gets to play with cool gadgets, beat the bad guys and save the day, it would be in our best interests not to venture anywhere near this Road. I would suggest that you check out the Die Hard series or check out Reindeer Games (the latter of which was also written by Ehren Krueger and similarly reflects his penchant for plot twists and suspense, without disturbing as was the case with Arlington Road). However, if you want a searing, thought provoking, uncompromising drama that has intelligent dialogue, a very realistic (albeit unsettling), non-formulaic, anti-Hollywood ending and strong performances to boot, Arlington Road is the place for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwrought thriller marked with silly contrivances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: ** out of ****Arlington Road is a film I'm half/half on. On the one hand, director Mark Pellington delivers a few truly gripping and even unsettling setpieces, and the film is back by a capable lead performance. On the other hand, Ehren Kruger's script is packed with contrivances, plot holes, and Pellington's direction is occasionally silly and heavy-handed. It's a thriller that aims high, but falls short of the mark it set out to achieve.Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a college professor who suspects that his new neighbors, the Langs (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), aren't as peachy keen as they seem. On the surface, they appear impossibly nice so we as the viewers know there's something sinister lurking beneath. As Faraday pries further and further into Lang's past, he suspects his neighbors might actually be terrorists with plans to set a bomb off in a building.Pellington is an inconsistent filmmaker. With Arlington Road, he delivers the goods on two occasions. The first is a flashback to a shootout between the FBI and a family living in the woods. The other effective sequence (from purely a directorial point-of-view) is the climax, which is a lengthy nail-biter from start to finish. Kruger's script is somewhat engrossing, and Jeff Bridges is excellent (if not a little too sweaty) as Faraday, giving us a protagonist who's easy to stick behind.But unfortunately, Pellington is also a messy director, lacking completely in any sense of subtlety. He resorts to cheap shocks (i.e. that public phone scene, Faraday searching for clues in the Lang's house, Faraday being surprised by Lang just as he's uncovering clues about the man's past) to rattle the viewer, and even handles certain scenes in an amateurishly over-the-top fashion. Take, for instance, when Faraday arrives at the camp searching for his and has a talk with a couple of troop masters. Pellington actually films the scene with low angles and lighting that emphasizes the troop masters' hilariously nonchalant faces, and this is without mentioning their gratingly polite and idiotic responses to Faraday's questions.Robbins' and Cusack's performances are just silly. If Robbins had a mustache, you can bet he'd be twirling it in the privacy of his home, laughing evilly to himself over his dastardly plans. A scene where Faraday finds an old yearbook displays Lang's picture in three separate instances, with all three photographs boasting the same "evil" look on his face. I'm surprised this "discovery" wasn't accompanied with "dunt dunt dunt!" music. The climax is the whopper, and here I'll be giving a huge spoiler warning. In the film's final moments, Faraday is chasing after a white van which he believes has the bomb, and it's headed to the FBI building. But in a surprise twist, the bomb is actually in Faraday's car (planted, I can only assume, when Faraday and Lang had that small tussle). Now, think about this. From a logical point-of-view, nobody with a brain would attempt this plan, simply because so many things could have gone wrong (and it almost did, note that Faraday's car was hit by a bus, but could luckily still run). It's a mind-blowingly stupid ending that's good for shocks but devoid of intelligence. The movie closes with a montage that's meant to frighten us and provoke thought, but all that could cross my mind was what idiotic script Kruger would think up next. As it turns out, they'd be Scream 3 and Reindeer Games, both of which were more enjoyable than this film, if only because Kruger actually realized he was writing trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst ending I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but I just don't understand the posts claiming that the ending to this movie was so great, etc. There is a huge difference between UNEXPECTED and GREAT. The ending to Arlington Road may have been the former, but it definitely was not to latter. To be great, it has to make sense. Or at least be believable. Arlington Road was not. The reasons have already been posted several times so I won't get into it in any detail. Suffice it to say that there is absolutely no way Tim Robbins' character would have concocted that elaborate plan. It left WAY too many things open to chance (despite him humorously saying he would never do that) for it to ever work, let alone be planned in advance.The ending ruined an otherwise passable (but not great) movie. It wasn't even the best '90s movie in which Jeff Bridges tries to stop a mad bomber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. I loved it. The acting was wonderful and it was one of the best stories I have ever heard. I thought that all of the actors gave some of the best performances of their careers. Including Jeff Bridges, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, and Hope Davis. One of the reasons that this movie was so good to me and even scared me a lot was that it was so real. All of this stuff CAN happen and ACTUALLY does happen in our world. "Arlington Road" was also great because it was so different. It really stands out from most thrillers. It has an ending that varies from the classic Hero Always Wins. It is scary to see a movie where the bad guy can defeat the good guy. I think that this movie is an amazing thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You should rent it when you get the chance.</fullReview>

I might agree a little with the first part but I think any movie made by hollywood that makes you wonder about the ending should be respected. I actually find it kind of interesting that the movie is written by the same guy who did "reindneer games",a movie that is proably even more hated then this one, beceause it also takes a convential hollywood story line, makes you think it's gonna be bland throughout the whole thing but then plays with the audience. Both of the endings arn't completly realistic but they will be remebered and I think a movie that can do that deserves alot more attention then a movie that plays it safe like almost every rediculous and forgettable thing that has been being shown by Hollywood for ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually exciting, fairly intelligent piece of drama, flavoured with a nice dark tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Arlington Road' is about Michael Faraday's (Jeff Bridges) suspicions about his new neighbour Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins). It starts out with an unexplained injury suffered by Lang's son, but gets murkier as Faraday uncovers Lang's shady, and soon disturbing, history?Mark Pellington is the director on-board here. It was his visual style ? crisp, dark, moody ? that allowed me to enjoy `The Mothman Prophecies' awhile back. It's obvious he was developing his skills here. `Arlington Road' opens smashingly ? with a tense, vibrant, exciting few moments. There's a palpable sense of urgency, which will be revisited later on in the movie. Afterwards the pace calms considerably, but the tone has been set. Robbins and Bridges are good actors, and don't suffer from the annoying pretty-boy element of many of their Hollywood peers. Thus it's the force of their characters that come across here, and the vitality injected into them. While Robbins character is mostly played as a controlled man, it's undercut with a great sense of fire lurking underneath. Bridge's descent flows fairly well, and, while somewhat over done for dramatic event, still follows a more logical course of character development than most similar movies.The movie does not end quite as I expected, for which I was thankful. It's sad to realise that the movie would probably never have gotten the green light in today's global circumstance. This is a shame as the movie is able to deliver a cold chilling message, which is maximised by Pellington's no-compromising tone and Kruger's clinical script. Sure there's a certain element of one dimensionality about the antagonist of the piece, but it's acceptable because he is meant to be a cipher for terrorism. It's not all done well enough to be a classic but it will leave a small memory of distinct uneasiness, and perhaps paranoia, about you. And a movie that can make you think nowadays is one worth referring to. 6.2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating: 9/10When I got my first DVD player, I got this, my first DVD. For so many people, The Matrix was their first movie. The Matrix was my second. This movie is to me the best movie made on the subject of terrorism, documentary or otherwise. Even 09/11/2001 did not change my mind - it is still one of my favorites.Arlington Road was an attack on our contemporary vision of terrorism, that of all terrorists being either white, secluded anarchists or fundamentalist Muslims. It was made in 1999, when the memory of terrorism was Oklahoma City and the Unabomber, of which there are many obvious references. Instead of the typical portrayal of some foreigner or secluded freak coming from way outside and a local unlikely hero coming to the rescue, you have terrorists popping up in the least likely of places, American Suburbia.The suspense and paranoia of this movie are intense, and are coupled with great acting and a scarily realistic plot to great what is, probably only to me, a classic movie. As the movie goes on, the suspense of whether William Fenimore is really a terrorist or Michael Faraday's paranoia is getting the better of him keeps building while both answers remaining until near the end. You can't be sure it's one way or the other until the end, and frankly, I think if the movie had the other possibility it would've been just as good though different in meaning.I don't know why there are so many people that hate the ending. I thought it had one of the best endings of any movie I've ever seen, up there with Twelve Monkeys and the original Planet of the Apes. Why is an unconventional ending such a bad thing? After all, I didn't think Planet of the Apes was a very good movie, but that ending really set it out from the rest.The message of Arlington Road was to rethink the way we thought about terrorism. Arlington Road wants us to look beyond the shallow, obvious answer of who committed a terrorist act. It wants us to be careful in our search for potential terrorists not to persecute the innocent, even those that hate the government and set off every "red flag" possible. We must be diligent in our investigations into not jumping to conclusions. For this, Arlington Road needed the ending it had.</fullReview>

In "Parallax", Beatty's character investigates a sinister assassination plot, and ends up getting caught up in the shooting of a politician. This happens at the end of the movie, as does the death of Beatty's character at the hands of the assassins. Instead of revealing the conspiracy, he is deemed responsible for the murder in an investigation after his death. Fast forward to Arlington Road, where Jeff Bridges is held responsible for a bomb, after an attempted investigation that literally blew up in his face. A well-made, interesting movie, but the ending wasn't that original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is only one thing to say about the conspiracy thriller "Arlington Road" - it could have been so much better. Only a few years after Oklahoma City and with September 11th still to come, the film with its resonances of terrible events, has an awesome topicality. The plot with its surprise ending has something of the deviousness of "The Manchurian Candidate". As in "The Firm" we identify with the hero's feeling of entrapment when everyday surroundings and circumstances gradually begin to turn ugly. And yet the film, from its very opening sequence where the Jeff Bridges character discovers a badly injured boy wandering in the streets and rushes him to hospital, never really works. This is its problem; it starts frenetically and continues at fever pitch throughout. The director does not seem to understand the first thing about how to pace a thriller. The very best ones start quietly, albeit uneasily. "Psycho", "Don't Look Now" and "Les Diaboliques" are classic examples. For tension to work there needs to be that gradual increase to fever pitch ("Halloween") or the sudden stab of violence following moments of extraordinary calm ("Psycho"and "The Birds"). To batter the audience senseless from first to last is self-defeating. The director needs to go back to the drawingboard to study the best work of Hitchcock, Frankenheimer and Chabrol. Only then will he realize that what he has given us in "Arlington Road" should have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: great, intelligent thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar to "Memento", Arlington Road is a great thriller that requires a little thinking about deep thoughts -- something I personally love.Jeff Bridges, as usual, has an amazing performance, and without giving away the story, let me just say that the ending is sensational and the film has something to say."Arlington Road" is a psychological thriller more than anything, and while it is more of an action film than a horror film, be prepared to be mentally squeezed and freaked out for the entire film. This is similar to "Memento", "Breakdown", "Silence of the Lambs", and other Jeff Bridges classics, "Blown Away", and "Fearless".Who should see this film:-- Drama / arty types will enjoy this film. It is not beneath you.But don't see it if you're easily given nightmares oraren't in the mood for a wild ride of unrelenting mental stress-- Action lovers who won't mind the intellectual slant andwill find the psychological suspense an acceptable substitute for stuff blowing up constantly.-- Horror film lovers who don't require gore and knives to enjoyI'll give Arlington Road an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the rental.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on R1 DVDNice to see a movie that breaks a few conventions and can keep you interested while keeping its cards close to its chest. Though Arlington leaves some; some would say too many; questions unanswered the core of the plot is good and well executed.Bridges is convincing if a little wearisome as the increasingly dissociated parent and teacher. Robbins is his usual cool and ponderous self - Shawshank fans will spot several allusions to that great King movie. The kids are good and don't get in the way.7/10 well worth watching</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes a different turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing alot of good things about "Arlington Road", i finally viewed it. It is a very good thriller with a surprise ending. It is not really a surprise since Michael Faraday (played superbly by Jeff Bridges) literally asks for it. He teaches at Washington Unversity and covers terrorism. Then he suspects that his neighbors (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack) may be terrorists as he uncovers various pieces of a puzzle he longs to solve. He gets caught in the act too often though. Oliver and Cheryl Lang are on to him from the get go. Faraday's son hangs around with the Lang children all the time and maybe this gets him mad so he looks to find a reason that they could be bad people. He gets in over his head as does his girlfriend. When the truth is uncovered, things get intense. Michael's paranoia becomes real and his instincts are correct. Everything then blows up in his face and Lang and his friends walk away victorious. Tim Robbins does a great job as the bad guy who doesn't seem bad at first. Cusack is good as well. Bridges goes through hell in this movie and the ending is not happy. It is not really a disturbing ending since it could really happen. When you cross the line and look for trouble, then you are gonna get it. See this movie... the ending wil freak you out and some viewers may even see it coming. All in all, a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this DVD last night. To say the least, it had us on the edge of our seats! I would be quick to say that this movie would have to be considered Jeff Bridges career role, as his performance was nothing short of outstanding. As always, Tim Robbins was convincing and impressive. I strongly encourage renting or purchasing this DVD as it includes an alternate ending (although I prefer the original). If your up for a realistic look at terrorism in your own neighborhood, then get this movie...QUICK!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can a stellar ending save a lackluster movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMHO, most of those people who criticize the ending of Arlington Road either completely misunderstood the movie or have been so molded by Hollywood trash that they cannot handle anything that remotely steps out of line with their secure, simple view of the world.Having said that, I must admit that I am torn by Arlington Road. I thought the ending was brilliant. However, up to that point (that is, up to the last 5 minutes), I absolutely hated the movie! It was dull and not particularly well acted, and the plot was played out and implausible in typical Hollywood fashion.But then again, that is the beauty and genius of the movie. Up to the last 5 minutes, Arlington Road perfectly and innocently played the part of the typical, cliche-ridden, predictable Hollywood, bad-guy-vs-good-guy movie... so well that the impact of the ending was all that much stronger. It delicately set the audience up, and then knocked them over like hapless pins in a bowling alley. For bright-eyed, bushy-tailed folks who like their endings happy and good just as the heavens intended, the ending will seem criminal. For hardened cynics such as I, who have been lulled nearly to sleep by the end, the twist will appear interesting and redeeming.So all in all, I do recommend this movie. And yet, I'm not sure if I would want to sit through 2 hours again just to see the ending...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do these people (home-grown renegades) really exist, or is it a figment of director's imagination? 50 years from now, this will become more of a reality than it is today. 50% kids in America are being raised in some form of dysfunctional family or by a single parent. I say this as almost 48/100 of new born kids according to a careful estimate have unmarried parents. Movie is convincing although slow at the beginning. The FBI is shown as an agency that does not have a clue.(non-realistic) After 50 years however, it will a question of what to work on because of the widespread presence these wierdos. Nobody will be able to single out some agency. These people have vehicles, ammunition, explosives, manpower, training, radios (Interceptible?), homes, families, money and they cannot be singled out because of their hair color? How do you defeat that?The director successfully portrays a dismal future. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tense movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard about Mark Pellington before, but both Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges were two actors I liked a lot, so I decided to see this movie on the big screen. The first feeling when the opening credits started to roll, was "oh boy, another "Se7en" or "Fight Club" or something similar". But after only 5 minutes I felt that this movie was definitely something else, and started to become interested. Without giving away anything of the plot (especially the strong ending) I just want to comment on both leading roles (very strong) and the use of audio and visuals. I was very impressed with the way the movie sounded. No, there is no special soundtrack or catchy tunes, but the whole movie soundes so "fresh" and "crisp". If you like movies with a twist (not even so far fetched), good acting and a slow but steady advancement, then this movie is definitely for you. 8,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good twist, week everything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about a terrorist living next door.SpoilersIn principal I liked this film, as it tried to do something different which is so rare in Hollywood. Also as someone who is always concerned that so few people question there own government or stories they see on the news, it's good to see a film showing how easily people believe the simplest story and never dig any deeper.The problem with this film, is the same as ?The Game' or ?The Unusual Suspects' it's all very good coming up with some shock ending, but when the story preceding it makes no sense at all, it ruins the whole film.The Problems:The ridiculous way every time the main characters were uncovering anything they terrorists were right behind them.The Car journey was too co-incidental and how could you guarantee him being able to get into the FBI without having an accident.Why didn't he call the police at any time.Why did the scoutmasters let an unknown parent take someone else's child away (I think massive law suit and prison sentences would follow)The news report said Jeff Bridges character worked alone in the bombing, ummmm, the FBI, ok aren't the brightest, but how about where did he get the plastic explosives from and the knowledge to create the bomb. The device would have been clearly identified as being remotely detonated. Which all adds up to the fact there must have been a number of people involved. You can't just pop down the shop and buy some explosive, well I know it's America, but I would hope not. I would hope the FBI has slightly more security to stop a car being driven into the car park.I liked the ending, but, unfortunately, as usual the story doesn't back it up.</fullReview>

All of the breaks seem to go against the "good guy" in a way that really shattered the illusion of reality for me. From the moment things get going, the good guy never has a chance, and it leaves no doubt about the ending...I gave the movie a slightly higher rating than I otherwise would've because the movie tried some innovative ideas, but I felt the story could've been balanced a bit more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched the movie I was pulled in on the story but as it finished up I stopped feeling like I was inside of the story and was back as a critical viewer. The ending is so far from what I expected that I was let down. While a number of twists are necessary, this movie went so far around that I became lost as many turns had no link to reality. The fact that it lacks a happy ending may be there to force one to think, but for most it just leaves you unsatisfied. Aside from that the movie was very exciting despite some timing problems between the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>---SPOILER--- don't read if you haven't seen the movie.I was totally and completely not prepared for the ending of this movie. It made me sick to my stomach. The good guy dies, all his efforts are in vain and the bad guy is free to strike again? Ugh. I was really not expecting that. I usually don't watch these kinds of movies, I stick to the more "Patch Adams" and "Pay it Forward" type, but my family was watching it so I sat down and watched it too. What really gets me is that the bomber managed to put the bomb in the good guy's car and instead of saving everybody the good guy was the cause of the bomb going off.. Not fair. Yes, I know life's not fair, but we as moviegoers have come to expect that a movie will take you away from real life in that it will have a happy ending!! I want my happy ending... if you can't get it in real life and you can't get it from the movies, where can you get it? This movie was certainly, to say the least, *different.* For what that's worth. Definitely opened my eyes at any rate. Wouldn't recommend it though. I'm not usually one for suspense films anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many coincidences for me to enjoy it SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one of these people who hates any movie that does not have a standard, good-guy wins, bad guy dies movies. There are quite a few movies that I like that did not have happy endings (A Simple Plan, A Perfect World, Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, Gladiator). I just thought Arlington Road had to many coincidences. SPOILERS BELOW SPOILERS BELOW SPOILERS BELOW SPOILERS BELOW\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/For instance, they had several scenes where characters were caught in the act when they were trying to find out stuff about Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) and his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack). One even occurred when Faraday (Jeff Bridges) was snooping around Lang's study (weren't those kids creepy!) and then Cheryl came up behind him. Another even occurred when Faraday was finding dirt about Lang's past and Oliver just happened to be behind them at the same time Faraday was looking up information about Lang. Finally, when Brooke (Faraday's one-dimensional, ditzy, skeptical girlfriend) frantically calls Faraday when she sees Oliver Lang behaving strangely (changing cars in the parking garage, picking up a package, and the strange packages at that shipping warehouse). That was too much for me, because this movie was supposed to be an authentic story about terrorists. Also, I thought Whit Carver (Faraday's wife's former partner and Faraday's "friend") was just a stereotypical skeptical friend who wants to believe Faraday but instead believes him to be paranoid. I mean, how many times has THAT character been used in movies? Probably hundreds of times. In addition, I also thought that the chase scene left too much to chance, since any number of things would have foiled their plans (a car wreck, didn't see the right van, did not go to federal building, stopped by police). I also was wondering when the bomb was planted in Faraday's car. I suppose it was when Faraday and Lang were fighting. I know one person on here wrote that a remote detonator was used in case Faraday did not make it, but then I wondered: What were the terrorists going to do if it failed? There was not a back-up plan, and if it had failed they would be screwed. Of course, it had to work though and we were supposed to feel all scared, disturbed and paranoid and we were not supposed to question the logic of it. Lastly, I thought it was unnecessary for Faraday to have a dead wife who just happened to have been killed on a failed raid (a la Ruby Ridge). I also thought it was unnecessary to have Faraday be a terrorism professor, and if he was a regular teacher it would have been so much better, in my opinion. But if it was not for these details about his career and the death of his FBI agent wife, the news media portrayed in the movie would not have had someone to blame for the bombing. I would have liked it better if Faraday, who did have a possible revenge motive for the bombing, was not blamed for the bombing. I think the movie would have been better if the news media portrayed in the movie did not have such a believable scapegoat, and if they instead had no idea who could have done it. In conclusion, it was not the EVENTS of the ending that I objected to, but it was the way it occured that I objected to, and if it was more believable, the movie would have been so much better in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What great casting, and what a horrid ending!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments on this movie...first of all, what ingenious casting. Tim Robbins in the role he plays in this movie is completely opposite to everything he stands for, and for some reason that just amused me to no end. He pulled the role off perfectly, and gave off this aura of creepiness that was just unreal. He is such a talented actor. As his wife, Joan Cusack was also perfectly cast. She exhibits just the right amount of zaniness, like she could just react in some crazy way at any moment. Indeed, she provides one of the creepiest scenes in the movie, right after Brooke is at the phone booth. It startled the heck out of me, and I don't think many other actresses could have done it as well. Bridges was also perfectly cast. He always seems to me to be calm and controlled, and he was very good as his paranoia overtook him.By the way, did anyone else notice how ridiculous Michael and Brooke's "investigation" was?? Could they be more obvious? If they thought that Oliver and Cheryl were really the people they were, I would hope that they would be more careful and subtle about their "investigation."A few words about the ending--infuriating, disgusting, horrifying, and absolutely ingenious. How they did it was absolutely amazing writing, in my opinion. I doubt I will ever look at news reports of tragedies in the same way again.Overall, 5 out of 10. It was disturbing and well-acted, but certain scenes could have been written better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words fail to describe how bad this movie really is.In a bad movie, when it's supposed to be a thriller, the main character will always act stupidly, the people he turns to for help will act stupidly. On the other hand, his opponent, whether it be a barely functional yokel or a crazed madman, will be brilliant, and even have abilities that border on the telepathic. This has been the downfall of virtually all teen slasher movies.And so it goes with this movie.**SPOILERS AHEAD**Even when Jeff Bridges (a professor who's field is _domestic terrorism_) finds out that his next door neighbor, Tim Robbins (an architect who has drawings of various buildings all over his house, and who's son he rescued after the boy had been experimenting with "firework"), changed his name early on to cover up his conviction for bombing the department of agriculture as a 16-year old, what does he do? Does he go and tell the police? No. Does he go and tell his friend at the FBI? No. He tells his airhead wife, who is supposed to be a post-graduate student, and who goes: "Oh no, honey, you're just not able to get over the death of your wife, and I can't take it anymore", yadayada.However, when she spots some suspicious goings on next door, she follows the neighbor to a shopping mall, of all places, and gets caught. The problem is, it is very difficult to care much about people who get themselves into trouble, and by this time, you just don't care what happens to her.When she is found in her car, which crashed into a ravine, just like Tim Robbins described in chilling detail as having happened to his father, no lights go on with professor Jeff. In fact, he has now come to believe that his neighbors are truly innocent.The thing is, these militia people are supposed to be brilliant, whereas in real life for instance, Timothy McVeigh was caught because of his principled refusal to renew the license plates on his car. All the time, Tim Robbins is supposed to trust the fact that Jeff won't go to the police, or that they won't trust him, or later on, that having control over his son is enough to stop him from going to the FBI telling all. In fact, Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack always act as if they're in control, not like people who live their lives always one phone call away from being arrested. The ending is slightly daring, for a Hollywood movie, but that's it.There are simply too many toe curling moments in this movie for it to be an effective thriller.0 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie taken down a notch by implausible ending....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road is one of the best suspense films ever made. The atmosphere is tense, the plot compelling. Jeff Bridges does a fine job in the lead. Tim Robbins is dead on as always, creating a villain who's both sinister and sympathetic. And Joan Cusack's performance can only be described as downright chilling.So before I get to any spoilers, let me say that I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes suspense and an intelligent thriller.So what's not to like here?WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW--DO NOT CONTINUE UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS MOVIEHope Davis' character is annoyingly dense at times. She refuses to believe Robbins has something to hide when faced with the name change and the secret blueprints; she can't understand a father's concerns about a neighbor who attempted murder as a child and may be hiding something else as an adult. I suppose we can chalk up her state of denial to her insecurities about her relationship with Bridges, but even that rationale seems insufficient. Still, a minor point.Then there's the controversial ending. It's not so much that people don't like seeing the protagonist die in the end, as they don't like seeing him lose. To those people I say, deal with it: The good guys don't always win. And the fact that all Bridges' efforts were, in the end, for nothing? That he played right into their hands, and that these bad people will go right on doing the same to other innocent people? I love the idea here: A suspense fill that continues to disturb us even after it's over!The problem does not lie in the idea, but rather the execution. "You know me, Michael. Do you think I'd leave anything to chance?" (Or words to that effect from Robbins to Bridges). Unfortunately, we the audience know Robbins' character as well--and no, he wouldn't leave much to chance.And yet we are supposed to believe that he put the bomb in Bridges' car? The first thing he needs to happen is for Bridges, instead of simply calling the police, to decide to take that car where they need him to take it. Not taking too much of a chance here: they do have his son in the van where he thinks they have the bomb. Next they need him to get there. Is Robbins aware that a simple traffic accident (a likely prospect given the urgency of the situation and Bridges' frame of mind) ruins the whole plan and potentially exposes the whole operation?Finally, when Bridges gets there, he must get in. Taking a pretty big chance that he's going to pull that off...and that's supposing he still wants to get in when he gets there. But will he still want to get in? Bridges phoned ahead and put his contact on alert about the bomb. He even described the vehicle that would be carrying the bomb! How are we supposed to believe that they admit that vehicle anyway...because it has clearance? Preposterous! It's a bomb scare, for God's sake. When Bridges arrives, that van should be waiting outside the gates, surrounded by FBI agents and a bomb squad. There should be no reason for Bridges to enter.Still, I like the idea behind the ending. And overall, the movie still works. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Especially terrorism in America where after all, the cases aren't such dramas compared to countries such as Algeria or China!

As a consequence, I send this message to producers : Entertaining and clever American films are welcomed (almost) everywhere in the World. Please produce many other films such as Star Wars, Meet the Parents, The Game... and export them where ever you want. Even a film that first appears as typically American, but deals with univeral topics, such as Forrest Gump : have it everywhere in the World!

		<fullReview>The first time I watched Arlington Road, I thought it was just okay. The ending was great, totally caught me off guard. I didn't see it coming, but it didn't make up for the whole film. Then I watched it again.This is one of those films that really benefits from a second viewing. Jeff Bridges is always great in everything he's in, and he really brings depth to his character. I hate films where the main character sees something that no one else sees and he can't get anyone to believe him because they're almost all exactly the same; the typical ending that you can see from the first few frames. But this film is not like that. Bridges is believable and sympathetic and he makes this film a notch better than it might have been with someone else in that part.As I watched it a second time, I really realized how each scene feeds the next, like a good film should. Everyone was really good, especially Joan Cusack, who was almost playing a Stepford wife here, a perfect portrayal. This is one of those films you should definitely watch twice.</fullReview>

Also, the camera dwelling on the looks of anguish on Jeff Bridges' face (and the over-acting involved). The ease with which Bridges' son abandons him, also gripes. Lastly, the unrealistic car chase scenes near the finish. I'm sure that the book would read much better than this badly executed movie implies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of the best thrillers in years, Arlington Road grabs at the opening scene and whips the audience through a continuous montage of high speed action until the spectacular and morbidly satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arlington Road has the rare quality of being a thriller with no slow moments at all. Even the thorough character development does not take time away from the mind-blowing action that flows seamlessly from beginning to end. The opening scene, in which Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) comes upon a bleeding boy in the middle of Arlington Road and takes him to a nearby hospital is a brilliantly thought out piece of character development (in regards to the rest of that boy's family) that is not realized until a little bit later in the film, but once it is realized, it is incredible. Tim Robbins delivers one of the most satisfactory performances of his career as Oliver Lang, in a sharp but flawlessly executed turn from his recent efforts in such films as Nothing To Lose and the great Shawshank Redemption. When Lang moves into a new house, he becomes the neighbor of Michael Faraday (Bridges), and they strike up a good friendship, seeming to be perfect neighbors. However, Faraday begins to notice suspicious things in Lang's house, and soon suspects that he is a terrorist. As a professor of a terrorism course himself, Faraday is clearly very determined to get to the bottom of his suspicions, especially since he lost his wife in a botched FBI excursion.Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, as his wife, are so convincing as the lovable but questionable couple across the street that they almost attain spiv status. Although this film is recent, and noir is virtually extinct, it is almost like a film noir because of the likeable characteristics of the villains. There is also wonderful camera work that is worthy of being noted specifically. One scene that comes to mind is the scene in which Lang confronts Faraday in his backyard. The way that that scene was photographed makes such clever use of the angles and the surrounding setting that the camera work is able to tell a bit of the story by itself. This is something that is extremely useful in films, and modern films rarely take advantage of these possibilities. Arlington Road never lets up. You don't get a break throughout the entire film, and the jaw-dropping ending is comparable to the stunning and original endings of other films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. You're not going to walk away from this film feeling all warm and fuzzy inside, you may actually feel discomfort, but you won't feel CHEATED. That's important, because they could easily have slapped on a cute little Hollywood ending and thus lost the film in the endless cavern of run-of-the-mill thrillers, but instead they ended the film in an attention-getting and completely unpredictable way. Excellent show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second dodgy film Bridges has been involved in concerning bombing. He does make some odd choices sometimes and this is one of his worst performances, not least because the director probably thought that in order to make this fatuous plot work, his actors must chew the furniture in a risible display of hightened paranoia.Is Hollywood so bereft of morals that it is prepared to exploit two recent tragedies involving the FBI in order to make money? It is totally repugnant to use those real life events for a trite thriller which explores little about the mindset and political circumstances behind such terrorism. Because of the appalling body count of the Oklahoma bombing, the film makers probably thought it was vital and legitimate that the subject should reach the screen. If that was the case it is venal hypocrisy. Also, are we really expected to believe that the parents of the wounded boy at the beginning would really injure their own child in order to draw Bridges into an unlikely Mission Impossible style conspiracy?Costa Gravas' film 'Betrayed' was said to have been recommended to white racists by each other for it's allegedly sympathetic portrayal of a white bigot as a reasonable family man. This film is likely to find favour with 'The Turner Diaries' mob for it's flattering suggestion that militias have the intelligence to mount a split second timing manipulation of reality.Tasteless and repugnant, this film is a nasty piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bomb-conspiracy thriller pretends to be more than it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges has been in this position before. A tense thriller involving maniacs with agendas using bombs to further their cause. Coming on the heels of such tragedies as the Oklahoma City, World Trade Center, and Olympics bombings, this film deals with the issue of the paranoia that everyday people experience when they suspect their neighbor of illicit activities.Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a college professor who (conveniently) teaches a class on terrorism and how it's affected innocent people in recent years. Seems Michael's wife, an FBI agent, was killed during an FBI operation involving extremists. So you can understand if he's a little...emotional while teaching his class. The movie opens rather strikingly: As Michael pulls into his street, he sees a child staggering down the street. Turns out the kid's nearly blown his hand off playing with fireworks, and he's the kid of the new people across the street.Well, to cut to the chase, it's not long before Michael is suspicious of his new neighbors, specifically Oliver (Tim Robbins). He's been wary of people during the years since his wife's death, and there are a few things Oliver says that just don't seem right to Michael. He checks them out, and with each passing minute, we as an audience become more and more fearful for Michael and his young son. Are his fears justified?It's not that the acting is bad in this; it really isn't. In fact, it's a new kind of role for Robbins, who generally plays nice guy/hero types. (Maybe Susan Sarandon put him up to it.) And the actors play their roles with conviction, which is crucial in a movie like this, because the audience has to feel like it can relate to the characters on a somewhat personal level. Both leads pull that feat off neatly, but only on a small level, such as when they're dealing with their female counterparts or their children. But neither actor succeeds in completely pulling in the audience to see their story. We don't learn much about Oliver until the end - what we do learn is spotty and subjective, to say the least. I watched this movie and knew I was supposed to be rooting for Michael, but I honestly found some of his actions a little odd and a little deplorable. Sure, he may have been justified in being suspicious from the get-go, but was he justified in going to the lengths he did to find out information on his neighbors? I know the audience is supposed to start wondering about their own neighbors; what are they up to? Are they innocent? But I started to wonder about Michael's own actions - was his invasion of privacy justified? Wasn't he sinking almost as low as his neighbors (allegedly), albeit in a different way? Are we supposed to condone his behavior in the name of supposed justice?Admittedly, the ending isn't what I expected, but it's still unsatisfying. I'm not sure what the point of it was, either. And no, I'm not going to tell you what it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast wasted in amateurish sortie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been really good _ Hitchcock good, it has a great cast (except for jeff Bridges, who seems to be subbing for Michael Douglas or Mel Gibson &amp; acts very uncomfortable until the action gets going - much too late). It has a neat plot. But it blows the first hour plus on establishing a smarmy relationship between Jeff &amp; his too goody goody pretentious son, and overwhelming the audience with Bridges' motivation for revenge for his wife's killing which is a key plot gimmick. Once the action gets going, the scenes turn lamentably predictable (for anyone, that is, who watched 70s cop &amp; detective TV shows like Rockford Files or Police Story - why do these seem like such great classics when re-viewed now? - because of movies like this). Too bad. Another Hollywood exercise in useless recycling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good concept. Bad execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script is the real problem here. It's a great concept mired in poor execution. The story was written towards the "twist" ending, with little regard for believable characters or (most blatantly in the final twenty minutes) logic. Faraday's detective work is decent, but the script is melodramatic and pretentious throughout. Great plotting, but that's about it. The ending makes up for a lot of problems, but doesn't remedy the jumps of logic the audience is asked to ignore in the last twenty minutes.Combine the flawed script with some of the most inappropriate and annoying directing ever. Pellington is constantly trying to show off, utilizing every film school trick and moving his camera ever-which-way regardless of propriety. This guy obviously wants to be the next Michael Bay or Dominic Sena. What results looks like a B-grade straight-to-video action film. This is partly due to the awful music, which is so over-the-top to the point of being ridiculous. Angelo Badalamenti should stick to David Lynch films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been reading over the reviews for Arlington Road, and I am afraid I have to side with the more negative ones. Upside: Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins both delivered excellent performances. The plot was unique and well thought out; it could have been great. Downside: I had a major problem with the cinematography. Too many of the shots were over-exaggerated and nauseating. The panning was very rough and the zooming nightmarish. Also, I expected much more out of Jeff Bridges. The over-acting he was dishing out was near laughable. That wasn't just paranoia... That was paranoia/panic/indigestion/B-movie-queen all rolled into one. This is one of those "nothing better to do on a Wednesday night" sort of movies. And RENT it. That way you can stop halfway through and read a book or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I tell you; I've been waiting for this film since the first trailers made it look sooooo cool. But after seeing it, I say don't bother. The story was superb and the acting totally top notch by Robbins, Cusak, and Bridges. I expected excellent performances from them and that's what I got. I was expecting an excellent story and that's what I got; until the end. The movie had me on the edge of my seat most of the way through. But then the end happened and it LITERALLY ruined the whole thing. In spite of the excellent acting and wonderful plot (overall), the end just ruined it. For those of you who have seen this movie and like the end, I'm sorry but I just don't go to a movie for that kind of end. I realize that happens in real life sometimes but when you go to a movie you don't go for a real life ending like that unless you're going to see a movie that's based on a true story and that's just the way it really happened. Unless it's a true story you're going to see then generally you go to a movie to get away from real life have things happen they way you hope they would in real life. But the way they end this one just plain stunk. I realize it was realistic but if it had ended the conventional way it would have been just as realistic and MUCH better. It almost seemed as if the end was a joke making fun of the whole movie. Anyway, in spite of the great acting generally good plot it just wasn't enough to stand up to the rotten ending. For those of you who haven't seen this movie, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. The second film that I have walked out on in just one year. After 45 minutes of soapbox predictability: "terrorism is bad," "terrorists could be your next door neighbour" I walked out. I felt like I was watching a bad made-for-tv movie. I had not seen any trailers for this film, yet I still found the plot predictable. I understand there is a "surprise" ending, but I bet the film included all of the plot elements typical to this genre. Spare me. And the unbelievability of Faraday's character: come on. Do professors in the States really teach courses on terrorism in the lame way this guy does? ("Let's walk through the field where my wife, who just happens to be an FBI agent, got killed in a botched raid. That way I can 'learn ya something' and go through the grieving process.") I normally love Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack but they couldn't salvage this script enough to make me feel suspenseful or interested enough to stay to the bitter end. A solid 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road (1999) College history professor played by Jeff Bridges begins to suspect that his neighbors across the street may be terrorists. The idea of the movie is very good and the first hour is very suspenseful and interesting with Bridges doing research and finding some disturbing facts concerning the neighbors but by the end of the two hour film the whole thing seems to just cave in with a wild and unbelievable ending. Bridges does a nice job, as usual, and the neighbors are played by a weak Joan Cusack and a menacingly subdued Tim Robbins who earns acting honors here. Arlington Road could have been an excellent movie but instead winds up as a so-so thriller with alot of holes in it. Rated 2.5 of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Film that is not great but admirable in the fact that its not a typical Hollywood movie. This is a throwback to the challenging and daring great movies of the late 1960s to mid 1970s. Arlington Road(1999) is well done with its portrayals of the main characters. I only wish that Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins played two intellectual adversaries playing mind chess on equal footing against each other in the manner of Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty from Arthur Conan Doyle's The Final Problem.Jeff Bridges is good as Michael Faraday. Tim Robbins portrayal of terrorist Oliver Lang is very scary. Joan Cusack is cast against type as the strange Mrs. Lang. The ironic and depressing ending of Arlington Road(1999) is refreshing to see in a Hollywood film especially in the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations weren't high when I went to see "Arlington Road" tonight, and still I'm disappointed. For nearly two hours nothing really interesting happens. It never bored me, but I surely wasn't thrilled watching it. The script is lame. Jeff Bridges gives a surprisingly poor performance. Tim Robbins gives a poor performance (as usual). He's almost as bad as he was in "Nothing To Lose", another sucky movie by the way.We've all seen hundreds of movies like this one that are much better. So if you want to watch a good thriller, go see something else. Is there anything positive that I can say about this movie ? Well, I liked the photography by Bobby Bukowski. It's quite daring. I also liked the surprise ending. But in conclusion: Save your money and your time. Why ? Cuz you're worth it !</fullReview>

To get to this point of pseudo-plausibility, we are to believe that our hero-turned-scapegoat can freely careen through the streets of our nation's capital without attracting any attention from law enforcement, can be intercepted by the main antagonist and engaged in a fistfight just long enough so the bomb can be planted in his rental car, and can force his way to the lightly-guarded underground parking structure of FBI Central. Oh, and of course he ends up being the fall guy for the bombing -- nothing leads back to the actual perpetrators.Huh? Did they try this movie on a focus group?

		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges excels as Professor Faraday, a professor at George Washington University, who is teaching terrorism and history. His wife had been killed in a an incident similar to Ruby Ridge. He recounts this for his students and audience.Tim Robbins is a neighbor who is ostensibly working on real estate development. He is, he says, a structural engineer. His abstruse wife is well-portrayed by Joan Cusack. Robbins excels here as well, presenting a facade of family man, and reminding us later, of a menacing character similar to Orson Welles' Professor Kindler, in "The Stranger". (A film recounting Nazism, and its elusive presence).Hope Davis has a pivotal role, as Professor Faraday's sometime girlfriend, she notices Faraday becoming more paranoid, believing his neighbor (Robbins) may be less than forthcoming, and possibly, even a terrorist.What is interesting is the point of view examined, a man who considers himself intellectual, and capable of analyzing, and dissecting the reasons for terrorism. He does admit at one point that there are things we may never understand. This, even more incomprehensible and frightening than the actual acts of terror at times: the idea that it cannot be predicted or controlled.Overall very timely and insightful. Highly recommended. 9/10.</fullReview>

Also to me the actions of the main character (Jeff Bridges) seem plausible under the circumstances.Overall this is a well-made, well-acted action/thriller; anyone who enjoys such films is likely to enjoy this one.

		<shortDescription>Prescient Musings on Terrorism in America are Hampered by a Plodding Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges address homegrown terrorism and the fiber of manipulation as a pair of wary, suspicious suburban neighbors. Robbins is terrific as the shady new guy who keeps his emotions close to the vest, pairing a wicked, piercing gaze with an ambiguous, noncommittal temperament. Bridges, the viewer's perspective and proposed voice of reason, is much less fascinating; a vanilla conspiracy theorist with a short fuse, it's tough to find sympathy for his obsessive investigations of the new acquaintance, even when they start bearing some fruit. The film's musings on terrorism in a pre-9/11 America are interesting food for thought, particularly in that they seem to be challenging many of the knee-jerk reactions that eventually would take place. Ultimately, a bold, memorable finale somewhat redeems the plot, which is quite predictable up to that point.</fullReview>

However- I'm wondering if the blonde girl shown throughout the last half of the movie- the girl who is assisting the "terrorists" after Farraday's girlfriend "Brook" dies (or supposedly dies) is supposed to be his girlfriend "Brook". If that is supposed to be her then the director flubbed it. Either her message, her reaction when she sees Tim Robbins unloading or unloading "long metal boxes" (which looked to me to be quite square) were wrong and she was an accomplice or that was just a student that looked like her. Am I wrong? Was that supposed to be another blonde girl or was that supposed to be Brook (in the second half of the movie)?</fullReview>

Would that she would appear in more movies of this genre. Her wonderful warm mid-western salt of the earth goodness and her goofy smile makes the viewer want to live in her neighborhood! She makes a very understanding friend next door. I love her telephone manners, too! It's always polite to let someone finish their call before you interrupt them, right? There are blondes and then there's Joan! I know I am not alone in my appreciation of Ms. Cusack's talent--it just gives me goosebumps when I watch this movie. Wouldn't it be too much fun if she and Jenny McCarthy did a movie together...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrorism is a hot item, but this kind of movies is unrealistic and only feeds the paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me that, especially since the attacks on the WTC of 9/11, many Americans have become obsessed with terrorism. Paranoia has become the standard and that's exactly what you'll get to see in this movie.Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a widowed college professor and father of a 10 year old son, who teaches about the sub-culture of home terrorists and since his wife, an FBI agent, died during an anti-terrorist action, he has become more and more obsessed by the subject. One day he sees a young boy walking in the middle of the street. He doesn't know him, but he sees that the boy is badly wounded and rushes him to a hospital. Later he finds out it's the son of his new neighbors. He realizes that he doesn't really know his neighbors, but gets to know them during a barbecue party. He's happy that his son has found a new friend to play with and he too is happy with the friendly people next door. But than he starts to suspect that the man of the family isn't the man he claims to be. He starts to investigate his past and soon finds out that he once was involved in a terrorist action against a government building. So the family isn't who they claim to be, but who are they and what are they doing in Washington? He'll soon find out the truth and get more involved than he would like to...The acting and the way everything was filmed is OK, without being exceptional. The only thing that bothered me about this movie is the subject. This is the kind of movie that is very popular because of the word "Terrorism" that is in the tag line, but if you are honest, you know that it doesn't make all too much sense. It only feeds on many people's unrealistic paranoia and fear for terrorist attacks, no matter if it is from outside or inside the country. However, I'm not saying that the entire movie is unrealistic. The fact that many people don't know their neighbors anymore isn't new and can certainly be called realistic. It makes you think when you read the newspapers and see messages like "Old, lonely man found dead in his apartment after he died 3 months earlier." It's a fact that more and more people come home from work, eat something and then lie down in front of the TV, day after day without speaking or seeing anybody. But even when you don't know your neighbor all that well, you still don't immediately start to suspect that he might be a terrorist (at least I don't). I give this movie a 6/10. It isn't bad, but could have been much more realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arlington Road is a very enjoyable movie. There's action, intrigue and an intelligent message. It asks something of the viewer as the plot seems full of holes, but on closer inspection, it's actually fairly sound.At times the acting seems a little over the top. As one reviewer mentioned earlier, at times, characters are reminiscent of those in Rosemary's Baby in their sinister mannerisms. The main protagonist's deteriorating state of mind allows for this depiction -- as the world crumbles around him, things seem to get a little strange.Overall, I'd recommend this movie to those who like intelligent thrillers. There are better out there (Collateral, The Game, Identity, The Negotiator, Training Day etc) but this one is certainly worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit I'd seen some negative comments here about Arlington Rd, so I didn't expect much - but this was a brilliant film! It was subtle, clever and unpredictable. Tim Robbins was as usual, the stand out actor, and Jeff Bridges failed to ruin the film, as his wooden acting and over-emoting usually does... In fact, his tendency to chew scenery was quite appropriate in this case. Joan Cusack was splendidly creepy, as was Hope Davis as Brooke. Arlington Rd is unique in dealing with American domestic terrorism, which is refreshing, not a 'Reel Bad Arab' in sight! The ending which has been criticised, was I thought, good - and the alternate ending on the DVD would not have been quite as effective - and there's that word again, creepy. I gave it max point (and I'm very pleased with the last 3 we've seen!)</fullReview>

It portrays the truth, which is what we should be looking for. Overall and amazing piece of artwork. This coming from a teenager, I believe this movie portrays the sheer oblivious personality of the American People. The fact of us blaming one person for our problems, to make us feel safe, holds true with all of America's problems. Lessons like these should be widespread and national security should be taken into stronger consideration. I mean, this movie was made BEFORE 9/11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brave attempt to look at domestic terrorism in the U.S. with Bridges as a recently bereaved college professor and Robbins &amp; Cusack as his "too-good-to-be-true" neighbors.*** SPOILER WARNING ***I felt that the film was good attempt, with some parts very well done (for example the way that the relationship between Bridges and Robbins &amp; Cusack develops through Bridges' 9 year old boy) but there were some parts where I felt that they lost their way. The last twenty minutes or so of the film depended on a sequence of events that were too tenuous to be left to chance. Whilst Robbins was his usual self, bubbling with restrained passion, I wasn't convinced that he would be this terrorist mastermind due to the lack of any world-changing ideology. His motivation needed to be better articulated to make it convincing. Joan Cusack was very sinister which I enjoyed greatly.The ending was very tough and uncompromising for a Hollywood film. The ending alone is enough to make the film worth watching as it portrays a world beyond the "nick of time" rescues which are usually so common in Hollywood thrillers.I especially enjoyed Bridges' comments on terrorists: "why do they do it and what can we learn from them?"Definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

A film spoiled by it's hastily contrived ending.The preposterously unlikely sequence of events leading to the bad guys cunningly tranfering blame to the good guy completely ruins it. A serious theme degenerates to fantasy.This is one of those films (not unique) where a writer comes up with a good idea, works hard to develop it but lacks the talent and imagination to finish it.Wildly exaggerated anxiety may be fashionable in America but is not very endearing.</fullReview>

From the beginning Bridges well-meaning intelligent flawed character, a brighter and more wealthy than normal everyman, is in 'way over his head. The attractive girl friend is one of the few obvious spots in an otherwise excellent plot. She reminded me just a bit too much of the third sidekick who must, just must, be the sacrificial lamb of the piece. A constantly tense and convoluted movie with much to say about the nature of conspiracy, of terrorism, of the blindness of amateurs bungling around in matters that are simply beyond them. Well-intentioned people can cause great damage. In contrast to other commentators on "Arlington Road" I would suggest that the ending makes the movie.

		<fullReview>Well you have to love Tim Robbins as always. Together with an excellent Jeff Bridges you have all the ingredients for a great movie. And this is a great movie. Jeff as the history teacher starts to suspect his neighbor of being a possible terrorist, making him more and more paranoid. He finds small clues that point in that directions, but, can he stop a possible terrorist act from happening? Tim Robbins plays the role of the neighbor. He is as often extremely good in this role. The movie is a little mystic which helps to the entire experience. You are always sitting, wondering what is happening now. Is he a terrorist, is he not? And it all comes together beautifully in the end with the surprise ending. The only thing i didn't like about this movie is the plot where all these coincidences ends up with Jeff doing exactly what Tim Robbins want him to do. But all in all this is a wonderful movie.

A teacher, obsessed with terrorism since his FBI agent wife died in a terrorist attack, is teaching a course on, well, terrorism. He then decides that his new neighbours might be terrorists. Are they? Well, watch the film. The reason this film is so good, aside from the top-notch performances from some of Hollywood's finest character actors, is the ending, which is about a million miles above what I normally expect from these psycho movies.

		<shortDescription>When you watch this movie try to remember that truth is stranger then fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Arlington Road" is a very interesting movie both historically as well as cinematically. Made after the Oklahoma City bombing and before the 9/11 attacks on NYC and Washington D.C. you get a feeling watching the movie of how the world has changed for all of us since the Cold War ended back in 1991. Of all the movies about the USSR and to a lesser extent Communist China none of them had a Russian or Chinese leader, even in fiction, as ruthless and suicidal as the real persons who were behind and participated in those two attacks in real life.Michael Farady, Jeff Bridges, who one morning driving home sees a young boy badly hurt on the street and puts the boy in his car driving to the hospital where the doctors save the boy's life. It turns out that the boy's parents live across the street from Michael on Arlington Road. Michael being the good neighbor that he is goes out the way to be friendly with the boy's parents and they Oliver and Cheyrl Lang, Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, treat Michael like a member of the family, after all he saved their son's Bradley, Manson Gamble, life. Michael also has a young son of his own Grant, Spencer Clark, and is living on and off with his girlfriend Hope, Brooke Wolf, as well as teaches at a local university about contemporary American History. What fascinates Michael most are terrorists and what makes them tick and Michaels especially interested in the home grown type. It turns out that Michael's wife Leah, laura Poe, was an FBI agent who was killed in a Ruby Ridge like shoot-out with white separatists a few years back and that's was kindle his strange interest in them. Without going into any more details about the plot the movie starts to increase in it's level of paranoia as it moves to it's shocking nail biting final. Michael who in the beginning of the film was both cool and logical, as well as personable and friendly, is driven to the the verge of having a complete and total nervous and physical collapse. A lot of people who commented on "Arlington Road" said that the story is illogical and contrived and most of all the story is totally unbelievable and I would in some ways agree with them. I for one don't think that "Arlington Road" was any more contrived then many other movies that are said to be based on a true story, which "Arlington Road" wasn't, and you hardly hear that many people complain about them. "Arlington Road" is far more believable a story as fiction if you compared it to 9/11 or Oklahoma City which were sadly true. The scariest and most spine tingling scene in the movie, for me at least, had nothing to do with the scenes what most people who saw the film were shocked and terrified of. It had to do with what FBI agent Caver, Robert Gossett, said to Michael just before the movies heart-dropping and totally unexpected ending: "The Only One Unauthorized To Be Here Is YOU!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I do not remember any fine trick story film, and that includes "The Usual Suspects."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of the fact that I am not going to write a single word about the plot, my comments may contain a few of those so-called SPOILERS.Edgar Allan Poe said that stories should be written having their very last line in mind. This movie has been constructed on that premise. There is a problem, however, and it is not in that very last line, but in the process through which we get there: this movie is thought to belong to the trick-story genre, and it fails not because of the unforeseen ending, but of the 126 minutes that precede it. It is there that all of us, viewers -- but more especially the characters -- are supposed to think and act not the way we -- or they -- would; but the peculiar way the author wants us to. Being that the script is based in a novel, I should assume that Mr. Pellington bought the writer's previous mistake. Of course I understand a man who yields before temptation and especially when that man is an artist whose craft is to dazzle. The idea of the enormous ending should have seemed a great idea to all the people involved, it's a pity that nobody warned them that to prepare a susrprise has nothing to do with the delicate craft of suspense. This time, the temptation was too important to be let down. The trick story technique -- the surprise ending -- does really work, though generally when written and, more specifically, in short stories like Poe's, Saki's and in the extremely short O'Henry's. In point of fact, I do not remember any fine trick story film, and that includes "The Usual Suspects" and its also acclaimed "great" finale. When `Arlington Road' is finally over we realize that it has been constructed in order to arrive to a surprise ending, and we discover that those we thought were simple flaws in the script, were in reality forced situations necessary to make the ending fit. In this movie there are too many coincidences and too many arbitrary acts by characters that are made to act not the way they would, could or should, but the way the makers needed to prepare the surprise. I do not have a problem with characters being whimsical or clumsy. Look, for example, at John Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle", where "Doc" Riedenschneider loses all his money and his freedom because of a doomed enchainment of little mistakes, bad luck and, at the very last minute, because of his own lustful psychology. In Huston's movie things happen within the story's rules, not the director's or the writer's or even the producer's; the characters go to the encounter of their doomed fate not against what they are, but precisely because of what they are. In `Arlington Road,' the characters and the situation are coarsely directed to reach a `brilliant and surprising' ending. I'm not saying `that thing would never happen that way in real life.' I do not care about real life. But I do care about the character's lives and the given reality within the movie. I say that this merely surprising ending does not belong in this film, or that this often-sluggish film does not fit its own all-out finale.Finally, there was a clear intention of the author (or authors) to play Alfred Hitchcock's sedulous ape (especially The Man Who Knew too Much Hitchcok's). To endeavor to undertake such a task -- such seemingly impossible task, as no one has ever achieved it -- is not intrinsically a fault. To fail to do it properly, however, certainly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers maybe Let me say first that I expected AND wanted to like this movie. The first scene was very intense and it led me to believe that this was either going to be an odd Lynch-esque thriller or a frightening, fast-paced, dark thriller. The credits were the same. Then it starts and it's crappy bland drama about a guy who's wife died, and he has a kid, the kid doesn't like the new girlfriend, the new girlfriend is jealous that the guy still loves his ex-wife. Sound familiar? Yep, every other formulaic "thriller" ever made has the exact same plot. But I still gave it a chance. I figured it might surprise me somehow. But then it got even more formulaic, with the "neighbor is bad and no one believes me". Everything in it has been done a billion times before. I almost turned it off, but then they introduced the "name change after the guy died thing" and I figured maybe there would be some cool twist or something. Nope. Then, his girlfriend gets killed for pretty much no reason. Then, in one of the stupidest scenes I've ever seen, he finds out his phone is tapped by looking out his window and seeing a guy with a phone tapping directly into the phone line on his hands and knees listening in. Like he would never have noticed this before, and like anyone is that stupid to think that he wouldn't notice. And if the neighbor is supposed to be so smart, why would he have been so stupid as to leave all these clues so out in the open. Anyways, then it keeps going for way too long. Then the ending comes in, which is the only thing close to a surprise, but it's in the wrong movie. This isn't even really a thriller, it's a horrible sappy drama with a conspiracy sub-plot that has been done 9 billion times. They don't even try to do ANYTHING new with it, besides the ending. And I like a downbeat ending, I just don't want to sit through 2 hours of watery fluffy whiny crap to get to it. I'm really confused why this has such a high rating. If this had been a low budget indie flick, it would have been in the bottom 100, but since it is big budget, everyone kisses it's ass.2 out of 10 I give it the 2 points because I like Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, the opening was good, the party scene looked good, and the ending was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: PLOT SPOILERA paranoiac thriller is something that crops up regularly in the world of cinema and `Arlington Road' is yet another one to the list. The result is a mixed bag of positives and negatives which all cancel out, leaving you with a generally OK movie. There are some flaws which I'll come to, but first lets start with one of the good things, the acting. Good performances all across the board from accomplished actors and child stars alike. Jeff Bridges is a suitable lead and is convincing as the paranoid and (unfortunately) curious widower. Tim Robbins is also good as the suspicious and possible terrorist next-door neighbour. Joan Cusack is just plain creepy as the overly idyllic housewife from hell. Unfortunately, she doesn't show as much colour as she has in `In And Out' and her own sitcom `What About Joan'. Up and coming starlet Hope Davis is very good as the cynical girlfriend. Dennis the Menace himself; Mason Gamble and Gladiator's Spencer Treat Clark give generally good performances (giving their age). Sadly, the `neighbours are terrorists and no-one will believe me' plot wears thin after a while and there is so much repulsion in the film that it is too gritty for its own good. While the end scene does manage to prove a point that `you can't beat terrorism' the grim surface and realism will leave most people unsatisfied instead of impressed. Perhaps the overall effect would have been a tad better if there had been a glint of hope present, i.e., if someone had believed him (before s/he got murdered immediately afterwards). But the scriptwriters seem so desperate to mimic the harsh reality of terrorism that it is virtually impossible to enjoy. The `bad guys win' ending is probably all the film will be remembered for, which is a shame because there are some positives that lie beneath the surface. Deep, deep beneath the surface. 5/10.</fullReview>

Just because I don't like a film doesn't mean Ishould ruin it for you!Jeff Bridges, a terrorism expert and college professor, begins tosuspect something a little funny about new neighbors TimRobbins and Joan Cusack. As he begins investigating Robbins,he must convince those around him that none of this has to dowith his FBI wife's death in a shootout. Eventually, Bridgessuspects Robbins might be a terrorist, and tries to get his newgirlfriend and his wife's old boss to believe him. As his son is putin danger, the film winds down to a tense finale with a surpriseending.In this day and age, terrorism films may seem quaint anduncomfortable. I felt wrong watching this, but because of the script,which somehow won a Nicholl Fellowship from the AcademyAwards people.Bridges' character is an intense professor teaching a class onterrorism. In one impossible scene, Bridges takes his class on afield trip...to the place where his wife was killed! While the scene iswell acted, directed, and edited, this scene put me over the edge ofcredibility. The film is full of scenes like that.The script seems to have started with the very good twist ending,and then constructed backward until the story was there, and thisis the problem. Watch as Bridges calls up state vital statisticsbureaus and gets information right over the phone from namechange applications and death certificates. If you have ever doneany sort of genealogical research like I have, you would knowdeath certificates must be requested by mail and sent to you afteryou make a claim as to relationships and reasons behind thesearch. I wish it were as easy as calling someone up and gettinginformation. Bridges also seems to be making these calls at night,when these state offices would be closed.Bridges' distrust of the FBI because of his wife's death is notexplored adequately either, resulting in the viewer just wishing hewould tell his suspicions to someone else besides his girlfriend,who finds the absolute weakest reasons not to believe him.Pellington's direction is excellent, and he somehow manages tobuild suspense despite the script's shortcomings. AngeloBadalamenti's musical score is perfect. Jeff Bridges is good in avery difficult role that requires this much suspension of belief. Hekeeps the weaker scenes grounded, since his pain and suspicionis evident on his face. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are good,they are really good at playing people who may not be what theyseem, but sometimes their innocent act went too far."Arlington Road" is a well done film. It is an exciting, well actedfilm. It can raise questions about how much we really know aboutpeople around us, and how far we would go to protect others. It isalso not well written, sloppy, and a supreme disappointment. Donot be so taken with the ending as to ignore the messy hour and ahalf that came before. I will have to slightly not recommend this.This is rated (R) for physical violence, gun violence, some gore,some profanity, and adult situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler warning... This thriller grips like a vice and does not let go. As tension mounts you may find yourself wishing you'd never started watching, but it's too late now: you're in this for the duration. There are times when it seems somewhat less than subtle and maybe even a tad contrived, but it all makes sense in the end. Jeff Bridges' performance seems over-the-top but there is a very sensible explanation for it. Coincidences pile up all over the place until the final moments, when you realise... Holy SH*T they moved there deliberately. Yes, folks, the neighbours from hell are not the ones who have wild parties and play loud music and break your lawnmower, they are the ones who seem really good, really "nice" and kind and thoughtful and intelligent. The fact that they are insane terrorists should not put you off. DID they move there deliberately, to suck Bridges into their scheme? If so, it just makes the film even more disturbing and excellent. And how wonderful it is to see Joan Cusack as a baddie. Her chilling performance (especially the great scene where she turns up at the mall) almost steals the film from under the leads' noses. But not quite. Bridges is superb as the emotionally fraught hero, while Tim Robbins is somehow even better as his relaxed, calm, friendly nemesis. In fact, there's sterling work all round, from the production design, the lighting, the cinematography, the editing, the direction and above all the script. The dialogue is never stilted or unbelievable, the scenes with people in peril are authentically nerve-shredding and the film builds slowly but inexorably to its admirably twisted climax. It's a real shame that this didn't get a wider audience when first released but it's good that it had another chance on video/TV. It's a fine thriller that you won't forget in a hurry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FANTASTIC THRILLER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of thrillers that stands the test of time, with events of sept 11 2001 still in our minds, it's plot is not so unreal.It's based on a lot of films, The Parallax View to name one, which really is a better Thriller.These films are cool because the ending are downbeat and not the general hollywood fare.Hollywoord shies to downbeat endings (remember all the full about the film Brazil?) and any film that has one has got to be praised!Hence Arlington Road gets a 10/10 from me.Why?Because this kind of thing *is* really happening, we the public are hoodwinked into believing a completely different set of facts, and different people to blame. Yes, we are being set up.We have been set up.Arlington Road, looking beyond the story tells you exactly how to do it, watch it with that in mind and it's disturbing indeed.Not Convinced? Watch the film.Then e-mail me and tell me who killed J F Kennedy.....Are you so sure?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Arlington Road" is a solid, entertaining thriller, both scary and fun to watch. It's an interesting point, I think, that one can still find this sort of thing entertaining in our "post-September 11th" world - although for a short while we did not, or said we did not - and it might almost be perverse to describe it as "fun". But I'll plead guilty to the rap: "Arlington Road" was fun. And it was fun, I think, because, as with most thrillers, the plot-line is just improbable enough, with a few too many "what-ifs", to make it believable. (On the other hand, a small voice intones, how unrealistic would it have been, pre-September 11th, to take seriously a film that had commercial airliners crashing into the WTC complex and the Pentagon?)The plot of "Arlington Road" is well-known from many of the other comments on this site, so there's no need to go through it again. It's a good plot, though, with murder, conspiracy, and false identities. Add to that a desperate father's concern for his (apparently) endangered son, and the tension rises accordingly. The plot is well delivered through snappy direction and uniformly fine acting. I have never been a big fan of Jeff Bridges, but I liked him here. His over-the-top cinematic bent is well-matched to the material at hand. Joan Cusack is especially good. Her lines are not all that great, so she has to create her character, a monstrous psychopath, through the lifting of an eyebrow, a forced smile, a trite homily. She's brilliant. But, then, she always is.Tim Robbins is, I think, an under-appreciated actor, and he quietly steals the movie from Bridges. His portrayal of a man who has gone coldly and "rationally" insane - "It's war, Michael! Children die in wars!" - is near-perfection. Watching him here, I went back time and again to his previous performances, especially in "Bull Durham" and "The Shawshank Redemption", and marvelled at how well he submerged himself in the Oliver Lang/William Fenimore character. The final twenty minutes of "Arlington Road" are splendid. Slam-bang action and rising tension. If it falls a little flat - and for me it did - it's because the viewer is being asked to shelve a little too much of his/her disbelief. Too many things have to happen "just so" for the not-quite-startling climax to be brought off. On the whole, though, it works pretty well. My principal caveat on the film, and particularly the ending, is that it's been done before. As James Bushey pointed out earlier on this site, the film draws heavily, though not unfairly - was it Plato who said there are no original plot-lines? - on the 1974 Alan J. Pakula/Warren Beatty film, "The Parallax View". In "Parallax", a superior suspense/thriller, the theme is political assassination, deriving from the rash of high-level assassinations in the United States in the 1960's, and the subsequent high-level investigations that supported the "lone assassin" theory that too large a portion of the public refused to believe. In "Arlington Road", the theme is domestic terrorism, different enough that the obvious parallels between the two films don't overly intrude on our enjoyment. The two themes exert very different impacts on the viewer. The assassination of a senior political figure followed by a suspected "cover-up" inspires dread and fear, a sense that the government is neither honest nor in control. But the viewer has an "out", if you will, albeit a dubious one. If a senior politico is taken out, we know that another will appear to fill his or her shoes, however reprehensible the system is that appears to accommodate the crime. Most of us, I suggest, are inclined to "bury" that crime and get on with our day-to-day lives. It's almost as though we covertly accept that the highest political ambitions carry with them an inherent threat of violent death. But with terrorism, domestic or foreign, we're all in danger. Terrorists have political goals also, but with a crucial difference: they will strive to achieve those goals with a monstrous lack of discrimination - everyone's an acceptable target, you and me and the next-door neighbour, male or female, young or old. "Arlington Road" taps into this fear and it does it very well. I gave it a 7/10.And "The Parallax View"? I gave it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why hadn't I heard of this film?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked this film up by chance at the library when I saw that Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins were in it. My wife and I had recently seen the Shawshank Redemption with Robbins and liked him in that role. I always reserve my rating of an actor or actress until I've seen them in several movies. So, I grabbed this one off the shelf and we watched it a few nights later. WOW!! This was an excellent movie, but not one to watch right before you go to bed!! :-} It keeps you on the edge of your seat and I don't think I relaxed from the time it started (after the credits, that is). Not only are Jeff and Tim great, but Joan Cusack turns in a chilling, supporting role.I saw someone comment about the ending. Personally, I think the ending made it more realistic. And, until the end, you probably won't be able to figure out the plot, although that's not to say it is frustrating. You will be close, but the ending puts everything in a row.So, make the effort to see this one when you're in the mood for a thriller and you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of this movie has holes big enough to drive a courier truck through. The storyline is seriously flawed. Can't say more without discussing the ending....***********SPOILERS***********Even assuming what the screenplay apparently hints--that there is a grand conspiracy centered on Faraday--there is too much here that remains inexplicable. If Faraday was their target from the start, why did the Langs wait six months before meeting him? For that matter, they surely didn't injure their own son to that end? After his death, couldn't Faraday's students have given a better account of him--explained that he was appalled by all acts of terrorism? Or weren't they paying attention in the classroom???But the biggest flaw of all resides in the characterization of the Oliver Lang/William Fenimore character. This is a family man, with a wife and three kids, living in suburbia and evidently quite at home in that environment, who...is in reality a rage-choked terrorist? C'mon. A terrorist is light-years away from the leisurely lifestyle of upper-middle class America, with its barbeques and patio parties and summer camp for the kids. A terrorist is someone who feeds his rage on injustices and atrocities (whether real or imagined) of the recent past. A man like the Robbins character simply couldn't find the necessary rage within him to kill hundreds. It just doesn't work.The actual mechanics of the final bombing sequence are also way too intricate to be believable...but to my mind, it's this fundamental flaw in the Tim Robbins character that really sinks this ship. He could have been a psychotic, perhaps...but that's a different movie.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Arlington Road at a friends party on video. I was pretty new to the film business then - I have only got really into cinematics in the last year, 2001, but I doubt I'd be exaggerating in saying that Arlington Road was the turning point in this change in my life.It was the moving that really touched me. Every movie I had watched beforhand had had a happy ending, or at least a resolution. This movie may have a distinct ending, but you know a lot more caould happen (if the film was real - I had to keep reminding myself in was not). Jeff Bridges, Robert Gossett and Mason Gamble deserve honourable mentions in this film, although, I can't think of any one weak part.I doubt this film was as good in the cinema - I reckon it is probably more suspenseful at home, with a few friends. But pay attention - it is easy to miss something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to seeing this movie, I'd heard good things about it from my brother who'd seen it during it's cinema run, so when it was in the Christmas sale at HMV for ?10 I bought it. However, after seeing it I'm not entirely convinced it was worth the ?10 let alone the money to see it at a cinema. The main thing that bothered me was that Faraday's lecture course actually didn't seem like a lecture course. What point was he getting across? Being a student myself, I don't think that this had any kind of significance on the plot, other that poorly executed method of showing his grief.As to the ending, it was pretty obvious what was going to happen a long time before the end. All in all, a pretty poor film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stunning brilliant political crime/thriller that explores interesting questions about privacy,assumptions, truth and conspiracy theories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears that this film was aborted 3 times before it finally reached the celluloid screen possibly because of the volatile subject matter under consideration. Any veteran Hollywood director wouldn't touch this idea with a forty foot pole as it would be considered career suicide to do so. Fortunately,for us, Mark Pellington, a new director on the scene decided to buck all trends and gives us a 'no holds barred' exposition on militia.We are introduced to two middle American suburban families that are brought into contact with each other through an accident to one of their children.Tim Robbins plays Oliver Lang, a structural engineer who builds extentions to shopping malls. Mrs. Lang is played by Joan Cusack, the doting housewife who dutifully takes care of her charges and supports her husband's profession. The Langs have 3 children, 2 girls and one boy. On the opposite side of the street, we have the Faradays, Jeff Bridges is cast as Michael Faraday, a history professor at Georgetown University who lost his former wife(FBI agent) to a botched FBI raid on a gun collector's compound and now is living with Hope Davis who plays Brooke, his current girlfriend and with Grant, their young son, from Faraday's 1st marriage rounding out the players. Typical families that you would bump into in any suburban setting quietly going about their lives. Director Mark Pellington then adds some interesting ingredients, like the fact that Faraday teaches a course on Domestic Terrorism at his university and is pals with an FBI agent called Carver played by Robert Gossett. Carver led the botched raid on the 'Copper Creek' gun compound in which Faraday's wife died, agent Carver being one of the few FBI survivors of the original team. A piece of misdirected post, meant for Lang, lands in Faraday's mailbox, Lang's reaction to the misdirected mail causes Faraday to start probing Lang's past. On the surface this is an adapt crime/political thriller, but once you dig, like Faraday, beneath the surface, it isn't long until you come up with curious subplots and interesting social commentary. Anybody in America today can easily get private ,confidential information on anybody else in the country. It has become a hot button issue with the general public. When Lang gets to know about Faraday's 'investigation' of his past, he is naturally upset and confronts Faraday in his garden, kicking over his table in disgust. Lang states 'Think you know more about me, than I know about myself?'. 'What gives YOU the right to delve into my private life?" This is the ultimate searing question that anybody who has ever suffered someone else probing their past, will ask. Lang explains his past coherently and convincingly and suddenly we're then questioning Faraday's motives that appear to be based on his inability to come to terms with his former wife's death. This is further emphasised when Brooke(Hope Davis) again confronts Michael's continuing obsession with Lang's past. "You've invaded his privacy", "How did you expect him to react?" "Are they teaching the Bill of Rights this semester,or did that not make the program?"They have an argument and she leaves in frustration. Faraday appears to be trying to right a 'wrong' with another 'wrong' and as we know 2 wrongs don't make a 'right'.To cement this relentless probe further we step into the next level that the film operates on. In fact if we examine the various levels they can come down to 1) a visceral/ psychological level ,which most people will readily relate to and that gives them a film which is dark, brooding and chilling especially at its conclusion. 2) a rational/logical level . Here is where we are interested in some things that don't quite fit, that are triggered by the movie's ending, so we 'investigate' the film with more viewings and maybe reach the conclusion that it's flawed because essentially the plot has 'impossibilities' built into it. And 3) a subliminal/ inference level is reached if we reject the plot 'impossibilities' as flaws and see those same flaws as part of a set up purposely orchestrated by Pellington, then we can focus on what the director is trying to convey. Suddenly characters become metaphors/similies, the film becomes symbolic as a paradoxical portal into a richer, wider arena on the nature of paranoia, conspiracy theories and why they have such a hold on society, about the nature of assumptions and truth. Most people will connect on the 1st level and 2nd levels. Some people will connect with all three levels as they view the movie multiple times etc. etc. The 3rd level (subliminal/inference) to me, is where people can get truly paranoid about the movie. Bridges ,as Faraday ,teaches the domestic terrorism class to his students. He shows them a terrorist incident committed in St louis by a lone individual called 'Scobee'. He shows them slides of the aftermath and as the movie audience can clearly see the building in question is the Alfred Murrah FBI center in Oklahoma City, the one that got bombed by McVeigh and Nicholls in, I think, 1996. The details are changed for the film but the slides are not shown as any CGI fictitious location. Faraday rejects the huge FBI probe which reached its conclusion that 'Scobee' was acting alone.Faraday gives his reasons for the 'impossibility' of the FBI's conclusion. Now is this how the authorities work or is this how the mind of a conspiratory theorist operates? Pellington, the director, wants us to believe that Bridges, as Faraday, feels the FBI makes mistakes, most obviously, because they wrongly made assumptions at the 'Copper Creek' raid that cost him his wife's life. However, Pellington also wants us to THINK like any conspiracy theorist would, to see the logical connections that they can make and try to understand their motives and at the same time contemplate, at the end of the movie, the sheer incongruity of it all. The whole 'Copper Creek' incident smacks of an uncanny resemblance to the 'Ruby Ridge' raid that preceeded the Oklahoma bombing. Now throw in the various stories that were printed in the press about a Middle Eastern man with a broken English accent driving around in a Yellow Ryder truck the day of the Oklahoma bombing, the same type of truck that was used at the Murrah building to blow it up. Add to that Pellington's insertion of the 'Liberty' van near the end of the movie and the connection is made, where? in the movie viewer's mind or in reality. Pellington pushes the boundaries of his audience here and I would think that the relatives of the Oklahoma bombing would have a very uncomfortable time watching this movie as it appears to be stacked in that direction, or is it only that way in some people's minds?The movie asks questions such as can the ACTIONS of a conspiracy theorist be detrimental to any official investigation.The FBI are fatally misled by Faraday's unintentional final actions. It is not the Langs that we should be ONLY concerned about but the theory and ACTIONS that Faraday comes up with (think about it). Take another scene, Brooke seeing Lang in a parking garage. Firstly, she's already influenced by Faraday's assumptions about Lang, so she's suspicious and she ACTS on her suspicion, following Lang. Then she frantically leaves a message on Michael's answering machine, noting what she saw, long metal boxes. Immediately, the audience, being played along with the characters will conjur up all sorts of possibilities for what's inside those boxes, AK47's, rocket launchers perhaps, components of a bomb. But wait a minute, if Brooke hadn't have been influenced by Michael's growing paranoia, what would she have thought? That's Lang's behaviour was a little odd and she might have let it go at that and not acted on it? I could see this movie being vehemently argued about in film school, it has rich potential for various counterpoints. I love it when directors twist things around and get you to reappraise everything continiuously throughout a movie. Hitchcock did it all the time. Tim Robbins, as Lang gives a superlative performance, perfectly understating his role and being controlled, affable, even understanding of Faraday's weaknesses. It's only when Lang confronts Faraday in the back garden that we get a tiny hint of menace but it disappears quickly replaced by hurt and indignation. Joan Cusack as Mrs. Lang, oh my God, this woman is truly sinister, like a reject from an audition for the 'Stepford Wifes' she pops up now and again unexpectedly to frighten the living daylights out of us. Hope Davis has a great supporting role as the anguished girlfriend to Bridges, excellently played and a metaphor for ethical society's questioning of delving into someone else's private life to satisfy another's curiosity. Robert Gossett, as FBI agent Carver, is just right and at one point quizzes Bridges' If you have anything, you know , I need to know, you'd better tell me Michael, ....'cause I dont want another Copper Creek on my hands..and neither do you" ...."Micheal, give up that class,......it's getting inside your head.. ". As always Jeff Bridges picks up on unusual offbeat films and continues to display pain and anguish that only he can show like no other actor and by the end of the movie we are flabbergasted and shocked at the outcome. Pellington is definitely a dynamo director to watch out for, he can easily get inside your head and manipulate your thoughts. A number of directors come to mind, mostly notably, Hitchcock (Rear Window, Sabateur, Vertigo), Gilliam (12 Monkeys) and to a lesser extent, DePalma (Obsession, Dressed to Kill). It was the screenplay that I liked most of all, professionally written, thoroughly convincing, and look out for the key scene at the children's baseball cage. What's said there ,by whom, is so profoundly revealing, in hindsight, that you need to pay some attention to the dialogue, it's worth it. Considering there are only 6 main characters in the whole film, Pellington still manages to hold the audience's interest. I thought the whole idea might be boring at the start, but it measurably got better and better as Faraday's obsession took over. In large part this has to do with the character buildups, editing and exceptional camerawork, closeups, by Bukowski.The jittery camerawork, and intense facial closeups add to the creepy, uncomfortable feeling of this movie. If you have a good eye for faces then the film is even more spooky.There are no logical flaws in this film. It has been paintakingly set out in a particular way.This is truly a great classic movie in all respects. I do suspect that the subject matter is truly uncomfortable for most audiences to absorb and think about (hence the review backlash and nitpicking?). Pellington is audacious enough to try to get his audience thinking and contemplating about the elements in the movie and when you compare it to say Vertigo you have to remember that Hitchcock's film is definitely uncomfortable, creepy and generated strong criticism, in its day, for the ludicrious nature of its plot, but it became a cult classic just the same. A definite 10 out of 10 here. Get it, watch it, and be scared!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart thriller with a stupid ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite a smart little thriller with a dumb ending. "We have found the enemy and it is us" said Pogo, Walt Kelly's cartoon character. Well, we can be our own worst enemy, as the protagonist here finds out. The United States suffers from regular 'terrorist' episodes - the Oklahoma City bombing of federal offices, the Waco, Texas, incident (arguably a police riot), the World Trade Center bomb and various airline explosions are recent examples. Some were due to the activities of foreign groups seeking particular political ends. Others however were home-grown and seem almost a consequence, the script of this movie suggests, of the individualism on which the country was founded.The scenario here is that the enemy is all around us, but dramatic tension requires we are kept guessing until fairly late in the piece as to who the enemy actually is. When we do find out it's all a bit obvious. In the meantime, Jeff Bridges as Michael the academic terrorism expert whose worst nightmares come true, keeps up the pace, never walking when he can drive furiously, and giving a vivid portrait of a man on the edge. His initially nice neighbor Oliver who arouses his suspicions is coolly and convincingly played by Tim Robbins, who is able to project normality and menace at the same time.Maybe like "Thelma and Louise" the studio filmed alternate endings and went for the one the test audiences liked. If so, this test audience must have been a convention of paranoid conspiracy buffs. Still, it's a well-paced film, interestingly shot. Why do people in rich liberal democracies do it? Terrorism, that is, not make movies like this, which are done strictly for the money. There are some lame suggestions made eg the farm boy who bombs a government office because some bureaucrat took his father's water supply away. Surely there's more to it than individual grievance. It's interesting that Japan, a very different affluent society from the US, has struck a similar terrorism problem. For what it's worth, I think it's the challenge - society is attacked because it is there. Ideology is just an excuse. The real thrill is in the execution. Current technology allows the attackers to do more damage than they used to, just as mountaineers can do more dramatic things on the slopes. Terrorism is no more a conspiracy than mountaineering. As to why people resort to such anti-social forms of challenge - well, who knows - probably poor toilet training. Anyway, letting off bombs is a great way of increasing security budgets, Oh dear, now I'm getting paranoid.</fullReview>

Seems all you need do is stick in some well known actors and have some random "surprise" twist ending (whether or not it makes sense - and in this case it DOESN'T) and people think all their Christmases came at once. This was absolute rubbish from beginning to end. I was either completely bored (especially in the first hour which was basically a badly done family drama) or progressing to irritated then outright freakin' annoyed. By the time it finally limped to it's lame conclusion I was pleading for a bomb to go off or something and put an end to the whole horrific mess. Bridges was AWFUL! Truly bad. To say he over-acted is like saying the universe is big. He was melodramatic, mono-expressioned &amp; histrionic and - like the movie generally - he started off at hysteria level 10 and had nowhere else to go. The script was a snooze-fest &amp; the Direction was woeful. There was no build up or suspense, no subtlety or contrast. Just one overly long drawn out uninteresting story leading to a ridiculous conclusion that's not borne out by the events leading up to it no matter how much you try and bend them to fit. Robbins was wooden &amp; boring but at least I didn't want to punch him in the face just to make him stop yelling hysterically about everything and stop having to look at his tongue hanging out of his constantly open pie-hole like I did with Bridges.Don't believe the hype.AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First half of this movie is some of most boring and irrelevant nonsense I have ever seen. It has nothing at all to do with second half of the movie.Statistically it is so highly improbable that we might as well consider it impossible for chain of events to be manipulated to this extent. There is no coherent story here. This movie is bunch of boring, improbable, disjointed ideas pieces together by everything working exactly as planned.It all depends on controlling actions of complete lunatic who disregards privacy of other people and has severe case of paranoia, and somehow inexplicably he always does exactly what is expected.I do not know if message of this movie is that we should put our noses in other peoples business, invade peoples privacy and how everybody is potential terrorist, but if that is in fact the message, its just plain stupid."They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." &#x2015; Benjamin Franklin, Memoirs of the life &amp; writings of Benjamin FranklinIf you are my neighbour, I respect your right to privacy as you should respect mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Arlington Road' starts promisingly, with an off-kilter pre-credits sequence and a slowly building sense of paranoia as Jeff Bridges comes to suspect that neighbour Tim Robbins might not be who he says he is. Then about two-thirds of the way in it all starts to fall apart: characters bump into each other thanks to silly coincidences, events reach their climax thanks to even sillier coincidences, and when it was over I realised that almost nothing about the plot holds water; the film got worse the more I thought about it. It's a shame, because otherwise this is a stylish film with a riveting central performance from Bridges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael is a college professor. His son is trying to deal with his girlfriend. You see, his wife died a few years ago, in a tragically contrived flashback. One day, he spots a child walking down the street. Just before he can yell at the kid to get out of his way, he notices that he's bleeding(and, you know, if he'd have had a cell, he wouldn't have had to just walk, you know... I'm just saying, mom), and rushes him to the ER. While he's disappointed he doesn't get to see Clooney smile and nod, the big moment in this opening comes when he, prompted by a nurse, after tasting his lips very thoroughly, admits that he "doesn't know the boy's name!" Because do you really know your suburban neighbour(no, I mean, *really*? Are you sure they aren't trying to detonate government buildings?)? He meets the parents, who live next door. They develop a friendship. However, not long after, he begins to suspect them of being domestic terrorists(what, you've never done that?). One thing that permeates this is that it is a piece of Hollywood propaganda. It wants you *terrified*. Sure, they do admit that not everything that looks like it could be a case of it actually is, still, this point is eventually completely lost near the time the end credits roll by. Extremists with explosives is no small matter, but this blows it out of proportion(...pun not intended, I swear). The bad guys are ridiculously competent(and not characterized beyond being ruthless... can you say "superficiality"?) and everyone who could help Mike is more in his way than at his side. It is funny to see the wannabe spy stuff. You know, around the block, and done by, well, a friggin' teacher. Anyway, with that out of the way, this is produced quite skillfully. The acting, except for our lead's offspring(whose role I would personally "grant" a name change), is rather good. Those who need to be, are pretty creepy. For being directed by someone who came from music videos(hey, those can go either way... remember, I can say McG faster than you can say Brett Ratner), it's remarkably effective. It's tense and exciting, and builds nicely to its memorable climax(some refer to the very ending as a twist... I don't know, I suppose it qualifies, and it certainly is clever, and surprising). The pacing is relatively solid, it's not boring(mind you, I'm not sure it needed to be 110 minutes), if it is predictable and clichd(if you do not see most of what happens in this coming from almost right away, you must be new to this medium). It's filmed and edited well. The use of slow-motion is on the verge of being excessive, though it comes out on the right side. There is a bit of bloody, disturbing violence and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of thrillers. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges plays a professor at George Washington University in Washington, DC, living a peaceful, suburban existence with his girl friend and his son. He teaches a course in "Terrorism," which, in reality, would have to be called "Selected Social Problems" or something like that. His deceased wife was an FBI agent killed in a shoot out with some gun hoarders who turned out to be innocent of any crime. You see, it's all mixed up, but he's doing as well as he can.Next door, in this splendidly barren environment, lives Tim Robbins, an architect, and his wife, Joan Cusack. They're a nice couple. They're sympathetic to Bridges' issues but they don't butt into anyone else's affairs. They form a nice bond with Bridges' son, so Bridges begins to trade visits and barbecues with them.This all takes about half an hour and is quite nicely done. It is as boring as hell. Not the movie, but the life style depicted. I can't stand polite conversations over backyard barbecues or dinners at which the two women talk about raising children and the two men describe the work they do.Speaking of work, it seems to Bridges that perhaps Robbins has been fibbing just a little about the job he's doing. In the Robbins' kitchen, Bridges uncovers a blueprint on the table and Robbins covers it again, saying that it's the Reston Mall, something he's currently designing. Well, Bridges knows a blueprint of an office building when he sees one, and he has just seen one. Why would Robbins lie about something like that? One discordant note in the social symphony leads ineluctably to another. Robbins appears to be getting mail addressed to someone else. He dismisses the letters by saying the writer was confusing him with another man. But, let's not forget, Bridges is paranoid, so he begins looking into Robbins' real identity. It turns out to be a pretty crummy one but I won't give any details.This would have been a good movie for teens, had it been more shabbily done, less expensive, and dealt with WITCHES or SATANISTS or VAMPIRES next door. As I recall, there have been several popular movies along those lines. But then the action scenes at the climax would be missing, and the kids would have to settle for a blood feast instead of a tumultuous series of explosions and showers of debris. You can't have everything, you know.The movie was released in 1999, a good year for terrorism in America, though more was yet to come. There had been the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and, a bit later, Timothy McVeigh's destruction of the Murrah Building in OK City. Most of us are properly horrified by such acts, but not too much. Some of us seem to demand that the violence only be directed against the proper targets, as when a popular columnist joked, "My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times building." (Ann Coulter, New York Observer, 8/26/2002.) Robbins and his family are part of us. A bad part, but definitely lurking around somewhere, and maybe not even as far away as next door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good enough to justify the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to assume that you've already read the plot outline and get right to the point. "Arlington Road" keeps you glued to your seat as Faraday learns about Lang's history, and what he seems to be plotting. The tension mounts when Faraday's family comes under attack, but then it falls apart at the very end. At the end of the film you are supposed to believe that Faraday was being played like a puppet on a string for the entire movie, and that pretty much all of the events were carefully orchestrated by Lang. Frankly, this is totally unbelievable. Lang drops one or two hints that propel Faraday in a particular direction, but other than that the conspiracy depends entirely on Faraday to make a series of very specific decisions that he could have just as easily not made. Alternatively, there are a host of other characters that advance the plot that were not being affected or influenced by Lang at all. Instead of looking like a conspiracy, the whole thing looks like a coincidence.Lastly, the movie is simply not good enough to merit a tragic ending. A tragic ending can be really effective when the hero's death is sacrificial towards some greater good ("Braveheart"). Not the case here. "The Sixth Sense" and "Fallen" both had great tragic endings, but the heroes' deaths were both critical to the twists and the plots were both bullet-proof. My impression from "Arlington Road" is that the tragic ending is supposed to emphasize the "lesson" that I'm supposed to learn from the film; which would be another acceptable use of the tragic ending. But what lesson is that? Am I supposed to believe that there really is some vast right-wing conspiracy? Sorry, that's just not good enough for a tragic ending."Arlington Road" is a pretty good suspense-thriller, but I simply don't watch pretty good suspense-thrillers to see the hero die and evil triumph over good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is your neighbor a terrorist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Arlington Road" is one of the scariest thrillers you'll ever see. There are no monsters, no masked chainsaw killers, no man-eating aliens, no children crawling out of TV sets. Just two men: a college professor and his neighbor whom he thinks is a terrorist.Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a college professor who has devoted his career to studying terrorism. He is a widower; his wife was an FBI agent killed in the line of duty. One evening, he sees a boy staggering in the middle of the street with blood pouring from his arm. He rushes the kid to the hospital, and a few hours later meet the boy's parents, Cheryl and Oliver Lang (Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins).Michael becomes friends with the family across the street, but soon he begins to suspect something's not right. As he begins to dig into Oliver's mysterious past for information, his suspicions grow into paranoia. But just because he's paranoid doesn't mean that the Langs aren't terrorists.What is most frightening about "Arlington Road" is its sense of realism. The Langs truly believe they are at war with the Federal Government, and they believe that Michael should be as well. And if you think it can't happen, well, six years ago, I thought that no one could ever fly civilian aircraft into office towers.Rating note: "Arlington Road"'s R rating is appropriate, but it is just about the mildest R I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alas, it seems that all of the writers fled Hollywood. Rather than invent anything new, "writers" now rehash old ideas and old plots. The case in point: A comparison of Arlington Road, with Jeff Bridges and The Parallax View, with Warren Beatty.Although Bridges' performance outstrips the wooden caricature presented by Beatty, it fails to carry this version any farther. With minor modifications for location and to reference the -- then recent -- tragedy of the Federal Offices in Oklahoma City, this is a simple rehash of the 1974 movie.The viewer is left to wonder why, with such obvious points of reference, the script bothered to change names and places at all. Like the older version, this film succeeds in leaving the viewer with the feeling of emptiness... unfortunately, like it's predecessor.. the feeling of emptiness is accompanied by the thought "I wasted my time watching this?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand a single good review this movie received.It started strong with good acting when Jeff Bridges discovers the child on the road. The strength fades swiftly when Jeff Bridges discovers blueprints for a building which Tim Robbins explains is a mall he's building but isn't.The overacting and knee-jerk response to this is ridiculous.Then when he finds a shred of evidence and tries to explain to Brook, they both just talk over each other so that no one makes a point. This keeps happening throughout the entire movie. Ridiculous. Until of course she happens to see him in a parking lot, and the switching of cars with someone is somehow enough to make her believe everything now. Come on.And wow, the terrible over acting continues as Jeff Bridges finds each new piece of information. Every shred of information, no matter how relevant, seems to fill him with such abject terror. It's stupid.Next Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are showing up at insanely convenient times just to coincidentally catch Jeff Bridges in his investigations. (At the library? Really?) They just show up out of nowhere.And what was the point. To get Jeff Bridges to blow up the building himself? Really? Why. And what a stupid and unreliable plan that was. If things didn't pan out just so, it never would have happened. Now the point of terrorism is that someone has to claim responsibility in order to advance a cause. If you just pin it on a crockpot, you aren't advancing a cause.Last thing. Jeff Bridges is finally convinced it's all legit, and all it takes is a phone call from the FBI guy claiming he left a message, and now he's all gung ho about conspiracies again? And he happens to catch the phone guy tapping his line at that very second?God, this movie was terrible. It is 1000% unbelievable and I will never get those hours back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterous plot goes down and leaves mainly dissatisfaction and unanswerable questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will try to avoid major spoilers but it would be nearly impossible with such problem plot.Arlington Road is a movie that is very promising in its beginning but immensely goes downhill when the story unfolds. It is devoted to one of the biggest problems of modern society ? terrorism. And here is the main and insoluble problem of the movie ? the plot. The movie with such actual and troubled theme needs more than others movies a well-developed and plausible story but too many things go wrong in Arlington Road. Our main hero is widowed college professor Grant Faraday (played by Jeff Bridges), who has nine years old son and recently lost his wife, a FBI agent. The conception of her death during some anti-terrorist action and what is more the scene of ten years old kid shooting at strangers by the reason of guarding his home is ridiculously preposterous and disturbing as hell. For some coincidence (it is really impossible to count such coincidences in this story) our college professor teaches some indeterminate subject about terrorists and their way of thinking. One day after an accident with a little boy, he carries him into the hospital and than he finds out that he is a son of his new neighbor (played by Timm Robbins). He doesn't know anything about him but the boys become friends and this family is looking very friendly. But after noticing some strange things our hero begins to suspect that his neighbor is not the man he claims himself to be. His doubts become suspicions and grow more and more when trying to finds out who his neighbor is our professor finds out that years ago that man has been involved in a terrorist attack against a government building. After a series of hardly believable coincidences he will know truth and get involved in events he never expected to. But even all that I saw on screen before last fifteen minutes I can describe mostly as hardly believable, the preposterous ending ruined everything. Professor Faraday in a critical confrontation beat up our evil genius (Tim Robbins character) he leaves him and run but after that the person he just beat up and left gives a command to begin their plan. Climatic chase scene was ridiculous and the precise ending? I agreed with all people here who said that it was one of the most unexpected plot twists I have ever seen but in the same time it was certainly the most ridiculous and implausible (not to mention one of the most disturbing) movie ending I have ever seen. I think only people who want suspense at any price can accept such course of events. I finally we get an explanation that practically everything from the beginning to the end of the story was planned by mentioned evil genius. Give me a break, please. And I don't even mention all numerous stereotypes in the movie.Besides that the point of the movie is unclear to me and I can't imagine a movie with such theme without it. Beware your neighbor? As it was already noticed in other reviews this is trivial fed for paranoia. Our society always balances between total neglect of a problem and such paranoia and both extremes are equally dangerous. The other possible idea here is that terrorist attack can't be organized and performed by a single person. That doesn't work much better because the movie doesn't show any strong steady organization around Oliver Lange. All that we can see is several people, most of them are definitely mentally sick, united and most likely manipulated by a very cunning fanatical person.With such story the acting (which is definitely not bad) is practically wasted but there is no point to blame actors or director because I believe that no one could make anything decent working with such ridiculous and implausible script.My grade 3 out of 10 (mainly for decent acting). Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest "overlooked" films of the century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a widower professor with one tweenage son, Grant. The prof teaches a class on terrorism, especially homegrown cases, such as Ruby Ridge. At this time, Grant is struggling over the death of his mother and the fact that his father has a new girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis). One day, Michael comes across a boy stumbling down his street, badly hurt and bleeding. Not hesitating a moment, he loads the boy into his car and rushes him to the nearest hospital's emergency room. The boy survives. All at once, the boy's parents, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack) rush into the medical center and learn about the near calamity. It seems their son was "playing with fireworks" and accidentally injured himself. What is more startling is that the Langs are the Faradays new neighbors. The two families begin a relationship, with Oliver suggesting that Grant might benefit by joining a scouting group in the area. It works, Grant seems better. But, even though the Langs appear to be the "All-American Family", things begin to unsettle Michael. When Mike locks himself out of the house, he tries to use the Lang's telephone but the children, home alone, are most reluctant to let him in the house. There is a large map hiding something in Oliver's study, too, and Mr. Lang's job, as an engineer, may be a cover for something else, also, when Michael tries to get a hold of him at work. Little things start to add up, especially since Michael learns that Oliver was "in the area" of the deadly terrorist attack in St. Louis the year before. Could Mr. and Mrs. All America really be, gulp, terrorists? This is a great film which takes its themes straight from today's headlines (most notably, the Oklahoma City bombing) and asks the viewer to consider the hypotheticals. Would it be possible for you to have a terrorist neighbor, who appears to be an ordinary, upright citizen but who knows how to arrange acts of destruction without getting the blame? What a scary thought but, as this movie shows, it could happen. As the film's players, all of the actors here are magnificent. Bridges is terrific as the professor who thinks he knows something about terrorism but has some lessons to learn. Davis is intelligent and beautiful as his wary girlfriend and Robbins and Cusack are absolutely terrifying beyond belief as the smiling neighbors who have gigantic secrets to hide. The scenery around the nation's capital is fine, as are the costumes and production values. The script is tantalizingly wonderful and the direction has one's heart pounding away at any given moment, leading to a sensational conclusion. If you have never seen or heard of this movie, don't delay! Go up the road NOW and rent or borrow this gem. It is as exciting and relevant as a film can ever get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it's all been said and done here in the 'hated it' section of this laughable and amateur attempt at film-making, I couldn't help myself to write this short review. This basically because the movie stands at a solid though misguiding 7 and somehow seems to have received a couple of unfathomable, positive reviews.There are enough movies out there that are too preposterous to be anything great. But usually there are at least one or two redeeming feats that save those movies from being complete disasters. As you no doubt have guessed, Arlington Road does not have them.The main problems with this hokey and overwrought mishap are the beyond ridiculous storyline which scoffs the whole idea of suspension of disbelief, the cringeworthy and repetitive script and the dreadful, over the top acting by Bridges. But even other 'minor' flaws in the editing, lighting and shaky camera-work are not in any case less responsible for this movie turning out to be the most campy thriller with a decent cast I've seen in quite some time. Although, 'The Contract' does come to mind...But, as many have pointed out, the ending was by a nose the most insulting part of the whole ordeal. An ending not oh-well-It's-just-a-movie kind of stupid, not what-do-ya-mean-the-earth-isn't flat kinda buffoonic, but abysmally worse, you'd have to see it to believe it. But I really wish you didn't.I'm not going to denote all the flabbergastingly ridiculous plotpoints the writers somehow seemed to think are passable to a non-imbecilic audience. It would take days to do so and would require me to see it again and take notes scene by scene.Let me just say that if you thought that Basic Instinct II was better than Basic Instinct I or that you think that Madonna should be up for an Oscar, then this movie is for you. If you have any doubts considering said examples, then this movie is most definitely one to miss and you are hereby cleared to burn any copies you encounter at your local videostore or at a friends house.0/10!</fullReview>

I wanted to see it again mainly because it is fun to see where it is filmed, many places I am familiar with. In fact the final chase scene, supposedly in Washington D.C. and ending up in a FBI building is actually the underground parking area under One Shell Plaza in Houston, the same building I worked in for a number of years right before this was filmed. The movie is set in the areas surrounding D.C. but except for a few location shots was filmed in Houston and surrounding neighborhoods.Anyway, to the movie, a pretty interesting terrorist thriller. Jeff Bridges is professor Michael Faraday. Not many years earlier his wife, an FBI agent, had been killed in a botched raid. This heightened his interest in terrorist subjects in general. When he finds a young boy wandering down the middle of the street in his neighborhood, bleeding, he scoops him up and takes him to the hospital. That gets him to become friends with the boy's parents, neighbors he had not yet met.Those neighbors are Tim Robbins as Oliver Lang and his wife is Joan Cusack as Cheryl Lang. They seem nice enough but Michael's paranoia gets him suspicious of blueprints he finds in the Lang home, and he begins his own investigation into who these people really are.It isn't a great movie but a pretty entertaining one, Robbins and Bridges are good in their roles, as well as Cusack.SPOILERS: Michael soon finds that Oliver Lang was not his original name, but a name he took as a young adult after the childhood friend of that name was killed. Michael digs and finds that he had been convicted of crimes as a teenager and now suspected he was planning to blow up an FBI building in a terrorist plot. In the end when it appears that Michael might have thwarted the plot, he in fact became an unwitting part of it. The car he was driving actually had the bomb, and in the parking garage in the basement of the building exploded killing him and many others in the building.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Terrorists Next Door</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that the competent actors in this movie agreed to play in it. It is an awful example of 'the spies next door' genre, which Hitchcock pioneered more than half a century ago. In order to explain how bad it is I have to give a few spoilers. But it is so bad I have no fear that spoilers would ruin anybody's fun. This movie isn't fun on any level. A middle class husband Michael (Bridges) and wife who live in a neat upscale neighborhood are befriended by a seemingly normal family from across the street. But they're not any normal family, they are right-wing militia cultists who have planned a starring role for for the unsuspecting and mentally unbalanced Michael. He is going to be the fall guy when they blow up the FBI building in Washington D.C. They also intend to take his children and turn them into little anti-government cultists as well. This movie was made before 911 and the Oklahoma City bombing was still on people's minds. At the time it was possible to imagine that there were other anti-government fanatics out there who might want to do further damage for their cause. As is usual for the genre we're given a shadowy secret organization which appears to have unlimited resources and omniscience. The plot is fanciful and preposterous. Only if Michael plays his part perfectly per the terrorist's script can the plot succeed. Bridges plays Michael as an overwrought nincompoop who falls for every trick and bait the bad guys plan for him. He is, in other words, the perfect patsy. Raymond Chandler was once asked to write a script for "Strangers on a Train" and he observed later that writing "Strangers" was very hard because the plot was absurd you had to work very hard to make the audience believe it. Hitchcock could make his audiences believe in some pretty absurd things, in part because Hitchcock never lost his sense of humor. You always had the sense in his movies that all this intrigue and cloak and dagger was a great bit of fun, playing on the viewers paranoia, but not to be taken seriously. With Hitchcock the good guy always wins through luck and pluck and the paranoia is dispersed in the end. But in Arlington Road the paranoia is played as if it's real. When the bad guys win in the end you wonder if the filmmakers are taking it all too seriously. Did they really want people to believe that there are militia cults out there pretending to be average citizens so they can blow up buildings and indoctrinate their neighbor's children? Bridges plays Michael as a jerk with anger control issues so we don't care about him, he is not our hero against the forces of darkness but a shill who seems to get what he deserves when he's arrested for a crime he didn't commit. There are huge holes in the plot and the cult family is one-dimensional, almost as if they were alien robots. It is impossible to imagine real people behaving the way people behave in this disaster of a film. The movie may make some susceptible people feel paranoid of their neighbors, but in the category of entertainment it's a total flop. After 9/11 we realize that we have far more to fear from Muslim extremists than from home grown militias. The militias were a useful straw man when AR was made, but are unbelievable today. But even if the bad guys were halfway believable this is a very, very bad movie. Run away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly developed story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The high quality acting talent is worse than wasted in this attempt at a psychological thriller. The story has a turgid star, setting up a suspenseful story but the reasonably good action is not worth the viewer investment. The villains include a man who had a bad experience in his childhood, his wife and a team of terrorists who serve as little-seen auxiliary villains. The motivation never seems credibly developed for a team of outwardly rational terrorists who are highly competent and apparently well-financed who want to anonymously carry out bombing of federal facilities while setting up innocent victims to take the blame. The protagonist is a college professor whose FBI agent wife was killed in a shootout. The fact that the professor incorporates the event causing his wife's death in whatever course he is teaching is rather bizarre but that is not the element that makes the story absurd. The villain creates a series of events to achieve precise outcomes that could not be predictable. To highlight this point, consider the ending action sequence (here is the real spoiler). The protagonist gives chase to a van through heavy traffic to rescue his son and prevent the bomb presumed to be in the van from being used against a federal building. In fact, the van is a decoy and the bomb has been placed in the professor's trunk. The professor manages to drive at high speeds through heavy traffic without crashing. At some point he loses the decoy van but arrives just behind an identical real delivery van that goes into the FBI building parking area just ahead of the professor. FBI agents surround the professor's car and point guns at him but they refrain from firing as the professor crashes through barriers to drive to the area under the building where the bomb is remotely detonated, the culmination of weeks of ridiculously elaborate manipulation of the protagonist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can interpret my summary line in different ways I suppose and of course you can also be not as enticed to this movie as I was. Only thing you can't really fault this for is the acting in it. It's just superb, how Robbins and Bridges play of each other. It's more than a cat and mouse game. It's more like a chess game, where every move might force the other player to respond. Unless there is strategy to it of course. But even that might not work completely (or does it?).A very intriguing thriller that will really have you at the edge of your seat. There might be some inconsistencies if you put it under a microscope, but then again, you could do that with every movie. First watch should have you too occupied to really think about some of the things happening. The ending on the other hand, will either satisfy you (in a weird way) or leave empty ... Funny thing is: It can do both at the same time ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arlington Road is a dead end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, you don't know how much I wanted to love this movie! I'm nuts about paranoid thrillers and conspiracy theories, and the two lead actors are favourites of mine. Robbins I've liked since 'Jacob's Ladder' (now THERE'S a great movie about paranoia!), and Jeff Bridges for as long as I can remember, 'Thunderbolt And Lightfoot', say. But, as good as Bridges and Robbins are they are only as good as the script they have to work with, and in this case the script is a real turkey. At first I thought the obvious direction the movie was heading in was just a red herring, and the "twist" was going to lull you into a seen-it-all-before sense of smugness, then ka-pow! A real killer mind-blowing, thought-provoking climax that would leave you breathless, and panting for more. Well, that just didn't happen, and the movie wandered along its predictable way before crumbling into a heap of lame-brained, unbelievable coincidences and plot loopholes. Too bad, this one could have been a beauty!</fullReview>

Read: A.A.R.P., American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Greenpeace. The movie's 13 years old, but even then, the U.S. government was aware of Israeli spying operations and infiltration into high-level government defense and foreign policy positions. This movie should have been about that. Hollywood is still buying (and serving) the kool aid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insight into paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" Warning Spoiler Included " The first half of the film is good. Second half, in my opinion, goes down hill fairly quickly. Stylistically, it was somewhere between Hitchcock and Lynch ( ie. the boyscout scene ) In the beginning of the film, I felt like the subject matter was handled with some complexity which was refreshing, but quickly devolved to the "here we go again", typical, left-leaning Hollywood script-writer's nightmare of losing control to "extremists". ( which btw, turns out is anybody that doesn't belong to their world-view. ) But even from that perspective, I begrudgingly found it entertaining to a degree. Partially, because it gave me further insight into reverse stereotypes that all too often drive the Hollywood status quo when it comes to "creative story-telling" and predictably looks down it's nose at anyone else not so "enlightened" as they are. I think, in some ways, the paranoia expressed in the film is more frightening then the subject matter of the plot. It seemed like the enemy minions were portrayed almost as souless aliens. I almost thought I was watching "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" for a few moments. The film reflects the feeling that "they are among us now"..."we can't escape them". They are our very "neighbors"...and we thought we could flee to the West Coast or East Coast to escape them !...but nooooo...muhahahha...there is a Republican living NEXT DOOR TO YOU...nooooooooooooooooo...argh. The film is not devoid of merit from an artistic standpoint ( Kudos to the technical folks ), but I couldn't help but feeling like I'd seen it too many times before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Pellington's 'Arlington Road' is a terrific idea, that's doesn't turn into a terrific film. It has a gripping first hr, but a dull and dry second spoils the fun completely. 'Arlington Road' is a disappointment. Pellington could've easily come up with a much interesting end, let's not forget we become Jeff Bridges automatically. So in the climax when Bridges loses, we lose with him as well... we feel like losers. You just don't feel energetic after the film wraps up - as simple as that!If there's something that works in here from start to end, it's Jeff Bridges, who delivers a bravura performance. Tim Robbins does well in a negative role. Joan Cusack is wasted. Hope Davis is okay. Others lend average support.On the whole, This Thriller is more of a spoiler than an edge-of-the-seat fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the ads for "Arlington Road", I thought that it looked silly, that it would be the average is-my-friend-a-bad-guy story. But it turned out that the movie made some good points. While the whole aspect of Michael Faraday's (Jeff Bridges) suspicions about neighbor Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) may have been pretty routine, what caught my eye was what Michael taught his class - namely that he condemned the US government's tactics and asserted that they would one day pay for it - and how it plays into what happens at the end. You just never know whether or not one of your remarks from years ago might lead people to believe the wrong thing about you.But anyway, I recommend the movie. Granted, I would never suspect any of my neighbors of anything bad, but this movie might make you at least a little suspicious of people.Also starring Joan Cusack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller with an exceptional performance by the whole cast !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Arlington Road for the first time the year the DVD came out (1999, I was eleven years old) and I didn't like it at all. I wasn't able to comprehend the underlying message in the movie yet. On my second viewing last week, I was surprised at the gravity of my misjudgment. Arlington Road is a more than terrific film, with great acting and cinematography (yes, I know he's a music clip director but he did a good job even though the editing can be drawn into question) to support a solid paranoia story. The story itself isn't the most original one can imagine but there are some nice touches added to give the story some extra cachet. I think Arlington Road will appeal to a large group of skeptics who (understandebly) sigh at the sight of numerous 'Standard Hollywood Scenarios'. Arlington Road is in no way a standard Hollywood film and for that alone it deserves praise. The film lacked some depth in some elements of the story but other elements were very well dug out on screen.The most praise justifiably goes out to the fantastic acting performances: Jeff Bridges plays one of his best and most memorable roles ever and Tim Robbins is simply spectacular ( once again !!). His character reminded me of his 'Mystic River' character ( for which he won his long-overdue Oscar). The supporting cast does a good job as well, especially Hope Davis, who also shined in Proof and the more recent The Hoax.Although a lot of people will not like aspects of this movie( it's very grim) I would still rate it enjoyable for everyone. I doubt anyone will feel regret after having seen it. It's got some interesting messages and even if those go over your head the movie still entertains on other levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent Thriller with a Superb Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Near the beginning of the film, the protagonist, played brilliantly by Jeff Bridges, while teaching a class on terrorism, focuses on a bombing of a federal building in St Louis and someone accused of being the bomber. (Both are of course fictional, but no doubt inspired by the Oaklahoma City bombing of 1995). Bridges points out during his lecture that all terrorist atrocities of this nature need a scape-goat, whether they be innocent or guilty. He further asserts that sometimes the truth is sacrificed in order to provide the public with its sacrificial "villain" brought to justice in order that the illusion of comfort and stability be returned to the public. But Bridges hypothesizes that the "criminal" may be the wrong man and infers that he was brought to justice on false pretenses and from public pressure to find quickly the man responsible. It is easier to point the finger at one man and use slight discrepancies in character to fuel a caricatured image largely created by the media than to look at a larger more complex picture that might involve more individuals.This idea permeates the entire film of Arlington Road, and it even becomes the rhetoric of the ending in an unexpected way. Briefly, the story revolves around two dads, Bridges and Tim Robbins, whose lives intersect through a happenstance coincidence in which Bridges saves Robbins' son who was involved in a freak accident involving fireworks. The two become friends, and so do their sons. Even Bridge's girlfriend and Robbins' wife become close as well. As a kind of backdrop to the entire story, we learn that Bridges is a widower and his wife was an FBI agent killed in a mistaken raid on a reclusive family in the backwoods of Virginia. His girlfriend is one of his former students.As he becomes closer to the Robbins, Bridges notices that some of Robbins' information about his life and work do not add up. Robbins claims he is an architect working on a shopping mall, but notices that the blueprints represent an office building, not a multi-story office complex. He also appears to have lied about attending a particular college. Bridges digs deeper into the secrets of Robbins' past and becomes terrified by what he finds. Robbins begins seeming like an incarnation of the kinds of terrorists he studies and presents to his classes.The pacing of Robbins' investigation, and the entire film, is brilliant, with almost every scene entirely from Bridges' point of view. Simultaneously, Bridges' findings gradually unravel at a pace that fits with the character and situation. The acting is superb with a first-rate cast, with Robbins in particular perfectly suited as the emotionless yet banal-seeming neighbor who appears to be hiding something beneath his phony smile and diabolical eyes. Even Joan Cusack does a fine job as Robbins' wife where at first we believe she appears innocent.... The climax and the ending are unexpected but fit the rhetoric of the entire film as first proposed by the terrorism lecture. You'll have to see it from beginning to end to understand it.This is an uncommonly deep action movie with a lot of plot, character, theme and story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Occasionally the sudden appearance of a particular character was enough to make me jump. I would go further but I don't want to spoil it for you. This film makes the later Die Hard and Lethal Weapon movies appear tame.</fullReview>

The central characters are card board cut outs and behave like the characters in Thunderbirds. Jeff Bridges (a good actor...normally) gives us a way over the top lesson on how to be a highly anxious and concerned professor. Finding holes in the story is as easy as finding toxic waste when you go fishing. After 10 minutes you pretty well know how its going to turn out. Its always sad when the best I can say about a movie is....well at least they had a go. Perhaps they really did have a "target audience" in mind when they made this.

But this movie has quite a few loopholes, major ones being poor acting at times, not a very thrilling story, predictable scenes and a very unsatisfying ending. The only positive aspects of this movie would be: i.e if you are planning on watching it for free on a weekend night, it has quite a few jumpy scenes which really skipped a beat for me, the story builds up pretty slowly but gives you some clues and makes you doubt whether in fact your neighbour could be plotting something big. I would definitely recommend this movie if you are watching it for free on Direct TV on demand or comcast on demand etc. But not worth the penny!If I were to rate this movie, I would most likely give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Robbins manipulates Jeff Bridges into bombing the FBI's Washington headquarters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other reviews criticize the plot holes in "Arlington Road". They are on target. The story here is ludicrous. It's totally unrealistic. Jeff Bridges is manipulated from start to finish in impossible ways, all in an attempt to develop a sole nut terrorist cover for what is actually a conspiracy led by Tim Robbins.The movie is a modern day exploitation film. It exploits terrorism and, in particular, home-grown terrorism. It raises a fear of hidden anti-government conspiracies. The film overdoes it in all dimensions, at one point saying that there are millions of such terrorists waiting in the wings or ready to blow up government buildings. It wildly exaggerates the potential cleverness to manipulate of these imaginary armies of domestic terrorists. To treat this subject realistically requires a very different approach. The aim here is to make money.The film's positives are its professional story-telling and acting. They almost make us forget the plot holes. Some suspense is developed. The increasing frustration of Bridges is nicely done, but the relative quietude and blockage coming from his FBI friend is unrealistic. It's manipulated into the story to obtain the isolation of Bridges. The FBI's security measures are also unrealistic.There is one scene in the movie that's lifted from the movie "Seconds" with Rock Hudson and John Randolph. It's the party scene, where Jeff Bridges is becoming disoriented. In fact, "Arlington Road" itself reminds me of the deep conspiracy that Hudson and Randolph faced in that noir sci-fi film. Another one in this vein is "The Stepford Wives". However, "Arlington Road" fails to make its deep conspiracy believable while those films did.The last scene in the movie is a take on the painting "American Gothic" by Grant Wood. This is meant to imply that the hinterlands of America are peopled with what appear to be stalwart souls, salt of the earth farmers and suburbanites, but who are really anti-government terrorists waiting to spring bombs and make attacks. The reality of who Americans really are, what they know, and what they believe is far more complex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend and I are sitting here in the dark after having watched this odd little film and can't for the life of us figure out why it wasn't roundly panned when it was released.In a slow-moving, humorless movie, one can only cling to the hope that there will be some brilliant plot twist to make it all worthwhile. There was certainly a plot twist and it was certainly hard to predict, but that was because it made absolutely no sense at all.When a sequence of entirely improbable events unfold and are presented as the result of some evil genius's grand plan, you are going to have to provide way more clues than this film ever attempted to if it's going to be a satisfying experience for the audience. Explain how the genius could possibly have predicted the outcome.How does the main character connect his suspicious neighbor to a fictional terrorist bombing in St Louis years earlier? We reviewed every scene leading up to that proclamation and could not find it.How in God's name does he infer from the vaguest of statements the definite target of the terrorist's plans such that he arrives at that location at just the right time for a decoy to be in place? How did the bad guys predict any of the various actions taken by the main character, which were only coincidentally influenced by them? This film isn't Hitchcockian it's block-headian.To go out of our way to be even handed, we'll throw a short nod the film's way for making us wonder a bit about terrorist acts that have been blamed upon solo-acting psychopaths. It didn't do it gracefully or artfully, and certainly not entertainingly, but we'll give it a checkmark for containing a single vaguely original thought.The only evil plot you'll care about after the long wait for the end of this film, however, will be that which got this film made and emptied your wallet of the price of its rental.Two thumbs way down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This an remarkable movie especially when you consider it was released in 1999, two years before 9/11. It explores the paranoia surrounding terrorism.Jeff Bridges/Michael Faraday suspects Tim Robbins/Oliver Lang of being a terrorist. He wrestles with his conscience trying to decide just how far he should go it trying to unmask him. The issues are even sharper for him since he as a professor who teaches constitutional law.It is not a preachy film. The various points of view are presented forcefully and clearly. There are no clear white and black hats. It is thus an uncomfortable movie.The confrontation between Faraday and Lang is electric. Bridges runs over a gamut of emotions, mostly shown wordlessly. It is as riveting a scene as you will find in movies.It is also a movie that keeps you guessing, changing your mind over and over about what is really going on.</fullReview>

This is one of those scripts,where anything can and will happen to make a story,without bothering if any of it makes any sense at all.Of course,nothing in this movie makes any sense but i guess it doesn't matter,if all a movie wants to show is that terrorists are actually incredibly ingenious and inventive people. The entire movie is one of those movies where you keep saying ,"why does he do that?"again,and again and again.I usually say this a couple of times and if i have to say it again,the movie lost me.This movie lost me very early in the story and from then on,nothing really surprised me no matter how absurd,i watched till the end even though it was pretty boring from that point on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Standard Thriller Despite The Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a lot of critics rate ARLINGTON ROAD very highly but I don't think it really deserves to be so highly regarded . I will admit the ending is rather shocking but that's because I was expecting something far more conventional since the rest of the movie plays out like umpteen other filmsThe story is basically one of those " New neighbors move in and despite being a nice friendly couple there's something not quite right and the good guy tries to the solve their mysterious background " . Jeff Bridges has been playing these type of roles for 25 years and seems to be sleepwalking through the movie while well known Hollywood liberal Tim Robbins plays the bad guy . Unfortunately his character seems to be under written and his motives are vague . Mind you this might be because I'm British and I'm unaware of what makes white middle class middle America tick . According to one poll the most important issue for American voters in last week's US Presidential was " Morals " which beat both the economy and the war in Iraq as the most important issue ! There is an ambiguous aspect to the screenplay and that is " Is the good guy being manipulated or is it just poor scripting ? " Well some of the plot holes are very obvious like you can't check up on someone's life just by typing their name into a search engine ( Admit it - We've all typed our names in search engines dying to see what comes up ) and perhaps the coincidences are done on purpose like Jeff Bridge's character just happens to work in a FBI building but this hardly puts ARLINGTON ROAD into the same league as a mind blowing smart thriller like MEMENTO</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent money to see this movie when it first came out, as I thought it would be good. I am still, 7 years later, regretting that decision. I have gone out of my way to let my friends who have not seen it (which is all of them)know how terrible this movie was. I will admit, begrudgingly, that there were some nice shots in the film, but there was nothing else there for me. I know there may not be an actual spoiler in this post, but if one person disregards this movie, then my work here is done. For all it is worth, this is one of the biggest regrets in my movie watching life. I think about it almost all the time, and to add to that, I am now on my way to moving into an apartment on Arlington Rd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Faraway is a professor at Washington University. He teaches a course on US Terrorism. He lives with his girlfriend and nine year old Grant, who has recently befriended the kid of his neighbours Mr. and Mrs. Lang. The more time that Grant spends around the Lang household, so to does his father who becomes convinced that his neighbour is a terrorist, and starts doing a bit of spying, only to find that he could be putting himself and Grant in terrible danger. Other lives could be in danger as well. What is Michael gonna do?If you dislike having your intelligence insulted, don't see Arlington RoadThis motion picture cheats the viewer in several ways. First of all, it wastes two exceptional actors, Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins are reduced from characters to character types. For a movie goer, it gets tiring seeing the over used clich of the individual holding a grudge against society or some superior power based on family related loss, which happens here. This device serves merely as a character motive not a character enhancer. Maybe I've seen too many movies, but the general scenario of Arlington Road seems pretty familiar. It has all the clichs of the formula involving a guy with a hunch: his loved ones distrust him, as does the police, the clues are lame, and the answers are uncovered using absurd mean. This is the kind of contrived movie where you can visit an obscure website, type in one name, and discover someone else's deepest secrets. the climactic finale is presented in spectacular fashion, but by that point the viewer may be asleep. Arlington Road feels clumsily paced, overlong, and dull.Some of the more interesting details in the film are left unexplored. Tim Robbins character has two daughters who are only in one scene, but boy are they creepy. And then before you know it, they are out of the picture. Michael's lectures are the only portion of the screenplay that feels distinctive, or potentially enriching. but unfortunately due to preachiness and over writing, it is obvious that the filmmakers view this plot element as simply a means to explain that the character is angry. He takes the course too personally, and judging from the screen time spent in the lecture room, I'm not sure I'd want him as my professor.If the contrivance of the plot doesn't bother you, the lack of brains or suspense will. Arlington Road, is the kind of movie that if done well would have the viewer on the edge of his/her seat, but instead, has them slouched back, uninvolved. The last twenty minutes pick up the pace a bit, and then comes the twist ending which poses a conundrum. In some ways it feels clever, but at the same time it is arguably the most absurd part of the film. You come to realize that the vast bulk of Arlington Road's two hours of story material and characterization serves little purpose other than making the last two minutes seem clever.Arlington Road has an idea, but it does not have a brain or a body to match. The film could use a major rewrite, a stronger performance quality and a stronger sense of tension/threat (and on another matter the score should be changed because it's overdone). There's nothing of value in Arlington Road except a few noble points which end up getting cast aside so the focus can be put on the formulaic style of thriller film making. The result is mediocre at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can I Get Your Transcript?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know anyone could call a University and get the transcripts of a student. But that is what this movie started out with to let the Jeff Bridges character discover all is not right with his neighbor. Without that plot artifice the whole movie falls flat.I was not sure why Mike did not call the police when he could not get his son back from Oliver. All he did was run around crazed. I began to believe that he was hallucinating everything. How he got into the Federal building was stupid, with his friend telling everyone not to shoot. But an FBI man would not do that when even his friend is trying to drive into the building.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I will spoil this for you if you have not seen it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that this movie is not one of the best movies ever made, but it is one of my favorites. The acting is not so good at times and often seems over the top and like it is trying to hard to be convincing. But, I love the fact that the bad guy wins! As I was watching this movie back when I was 17, I realized that it was winding down and that Jeff Bridges had not become victorious yet over the villain Tim Robbins. I remembered reading how long it was and I wondered how they were going to explain a victory for Jeff Bridges after they fought near the alley and he drove away after his son. When he figured out that he was going to be the one to blow up the building, you saw in his face that he knew that he was going to take the blame, just like Scobe (In the movie anyway). He was the fall guy. As I get a little older I think that if I watched it again now for the first time, it would not have surprised me. But, back then the movie ended in the theater with many people yelling "What the hell".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious Poop-filled Prognostication?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrible movie on many levels. A conspiracy and terrorist obsessed professor ends up being used by terrorists to do their evil deeds. The acting is terrible (the terrorists come across more like space aliens from the Invasion of the Body Snatchers)...I guess the only way you can make white-bread Americans seem evil rather than using Iraqis or other nations. The script is full of plot holes (the guy runs the entire city of Washington in wild car maneuvers...including on the sidewalks... and is never approached by one police car) and on and on. That sort of "super driving" can be excused in a good movie, like Die Hard, but where you don't have that much interest in the driver or the plot, it just seems silly.The worst part is that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, as if it's an excuse for terrorists who are being used by other terrorists and are somehow not therefore responsible for their actions. "If you only knew you wouldn't blame him for blowing up that building..." kind of mentality that is just stupid and has an air of obscenity about it in light of 9/11.And that is the best, though unintended, part of the movie. The only real shock of the film (although the ending twist is somewhat shocking) is realizing that when they say the explosion of a famous government building in the movie is the worst in US history and you wonder how they could say that in light of 9/11...9/11 hadn't happened yet. So (as my reference to Prognosticating in the Summary/Title suggests) this might have been something of a warning two years before 9/11 that no one heeded.What would Oliver Stone say? Avoid this movie. It a...errrr...bomb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Danger Within !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What this movie wants to say is that there is a hidden terrorism inside the American society itself and no body pays attention to such a painful truth, moreover the one who tries to declare that he'll be the first victim ! As there is an environment that destroys its mind daily in the way to produce successfully so flat, docile and friable people who will be easily deceived by fake truths, too distracted to search for the real thing, with an anesthetized conscience as the perfect wronged and wrongful in the same time ! It's so rare to say such a thing in a Hollywood movie and at that time also (1999), but maybe that was one of the reasons which made this movie a bit drastic and melancholic compared to the big names of the stars, with the propaganda of it as another thriller, plus the situation of a beaten idealistic hero (really imagine Bruce Willis as the professor ! He would've killed them all !), not to mention how desperate the ending was also; when we followed that peaceable logical man being killed and framed too as bitter tragedy about the loss of the truth and the degeneration of the future (his son at the hands of the masked killers) ! But that's the idea. And that's one good way to present the message cleverly at that distressing point so the viewer can be so aware, more conscious, and very angry against the real criminals out there even if they were good looking, outwardly cogent and allegedly virtuous !Though, all of that was part of the reason why the movie was almost shocking and disappointing to some extent. Yet, there was a reason for the weakness of the whole thing. It's some exaggeration in the script and a certain other in the acting especially the performance of (Jeff Bridges) !. Actually that made all of (Arlington Road)'s events look like one long hallucination of a paranoiac man ! And believe me...if you tried to imagine that all what you've been watching is just a dream of a sick man who had been controlled by his own misgivings all along, then you'd be convinced of it indeed as some illusions of a troubled person who maybe has schizophrenia and he is the actual planner of the entire thing and we were watching everything during all the time from his invalid point of view ! (Yes, Bridges' performance was that deranged !).All in all this is an example for a movie which wants to be a thriller and to say an important opinion about such a dire contemporary case, but ALSO it's an example for the way to damage that good message in the same time !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arlington Road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I was paying attention straight away, and I was only watching because my Mum recommended it, but once I got into it I liked it. Basically widowed FBI agent Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) lost his wife in an anti-terrorist operation that went wrong, and he becomes obsessed by the bad guys involved. Then new neighbours, the Lang family, including husband/father Oliver (Tim Robbins), wife/mother Cheryl (Joan Cusack, John's sister) and their children who gives him new spirit, he even starts going out with Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis). However, they becomes suspicious when Michael can't see certain parts of the house, or some blueprints. After some investigation about Oliver, he is convinced he may be a terrorist, and that he changed his name. But Michael also has huge concern about his son Grant Faraday (Spencer Treat Clark) hanging out at a camp Oliver knows, and with Oliver's son, Brady (Dennis the Menace's Mason Gamble). Also starring Robert Gossett as FBI Agent Whit Carver, Auden Thornton as Hannah Lang and Mary Ashleigh Green as Daphne Lang. I personally was only interested in the investigation and chase sequences more than anything else, but it is still a good film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The first 2/3 of the movie was so slow I almost turned it off (I wish I had). Then, just when the movie starts to get suspenseful, it becomes very predictable.I found it quite easy to figure out what the bad guy had planned. Top that off with an easy to guess, horrible ending and you've got a huge waste of time.I was really looking forward to seeing this film because of the cast. I gave it two stars because the acting was quite good. Too bad the acting was wasted on such a bad movie.I thought the premise and cast was sound but the slow pace and predictability was just too much to overlook.</fullReview>
