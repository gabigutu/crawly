		<fullReview>I am not inclined to post my opinion on web pages. In fact, this is the first time that I feel compelled to let my words be heard on the web. However, having read from other users that "Yume" is "a waste of time" and "too personal" to be enjoyed, I was so disappointed that I felt the right time to speak up had come.I am the first one to agree that this is not a film for everyone. It is actually far from that. Alas, in this world where the vastest majority of people feel that the necessary and sufficient condition for a film to be good is to have as much special effects as possible, "Yume" sadly faces no other fate than to be overlooked by almost everybody.It is those few people that might consider watching this film that have the opportunity to appreciate its full greatness. There are still many hurdles on the way, though. For many Western people, including myself, the fact that "Yume" orbits around Japanese legends is a big obstacle to overcome, as we are not well acquainted with their meaning. I am convinced that Kurosawa's "Dreams" conceal much of their true objective to us who are not familiar enough with the Japanese culture.But my advice is: forget these problems. There are thousands of other details to enjoy. From just a cinematographic point of view, Kurosawa's mastery of colour is unrivaled, and a sound reason to watch this film, yet not the only one by far. The true value of "Yume", in my opinion, is the use of the parabolas presented disguised as dreams to teach us a way of life. The absurdity of war. The beauty of nature. The need to preserve our environment. In summary: a praise to life. And yet, Kurosawa being old himself when he filmed his "Dreams", looks at death and presents it as the last station of a wonderful journey. Carpe diem, yes, but not to the point of being scared. Life will follow its course as does the river at the end of the movie, with or without us being here to enjoy it. Just be thankful for the small things in life; they are the most important. Enjoy them while you can and you will leave this existence in peace with yourself."Yume" is one of these small, humble things, so humble that it can be overlooked by many. It would be a waste. Don't let this happen to you. You would miss a true masterpiece. You would miss Kurosawa's way of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. I saw this film for the first time in 1993 and it was placed forever in my mind as one of my greatest cinematic experiences. I agree with what another reviewer said about this film, that it is not for everyone. It is very artistic in that the cinematography carries a lot of the story and some may become bored with it. Hollywood has a way of brainwashing a lot of viewers into needing a lot of dialog or action. If that's what you're after, you wont find it here. You have to use your brain for this one. This movie is Japanese and what little dialog there is, is in subtitled for the American viewer. So you may need to do a little reading. This is not simply a movie; it is several short, amazing stories that stem from the mind of Akira Kurosawa (a genius in my book). One is like a beautiful fairytale and another is a nightmarish fable and still another is a terribly haunting ghost story, there are others but all are done very well. This film needs to be seen in the letterbox format as it was intended. The cinematography, as I said earlier, contributes so much that it should be viewed completely. I really don't know what else to say about this movie except that if you have an artistic streak and like to see how movies can become art I would highly recommend Yume (Dreams).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So I'm not the only one with weird dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going back to what made Akira Kurosawa a star, Dreams is a film driven by a completely original concept. Like Rashomon, this is something that had never been done before. To my knowledge, nobody since has had the skill or guts to make a movie that accurately captures the spirit of........ bizarre Dreams. These stories are filmed and written just like real dreams. They're full of strange events that most of the time make no sense, yet everyone in the story totally believes it to be normal. My favourite segments are "The Tunnel", as story where a former military commander encounters the ghosts of all the soldiers who died under his command. The Commander explaining why his soldiers died is hands down the best acting in the movie. My second favourite wold be "The Peach Orchard". This is about a young boy that finds a group of living dolls in the fields. The dolls are furious that the boy's family have destroyed all the peach tress in the Orchard. This segment was the most dreamlike. My third favourite would be "Mount Fuji In Red". In that there is a nuclear meltdown. Panic spreads and a few survivors contemplate whether or not to end their lives. In traditional Kurosawa fashion, this movie is visually breathtaking. Kurosawa films don't just look great, they look unique and interesting. The visuals in Dreams helps create the hypnotic dream-like state. In the "Crows" story, a man enters the world of a Van Gogh painting. Parts of the scenery here are natural landscapes, and parts are made to look like a painting. In "Blizzard" mountain climbers are on the verge of death. They're rescued by a snow spirit. The blinding snow and the sort of slow motion effect when you see the Snow Fairy makes this segment perhaps the most hypnotic images Kurosawa has ever produced. I wouldn't want anyone to get the idea that this is just a bunch of unconnected segments. Several characters appear in various segments, and some are meant to play back to back. I have to say that Dreams may not be for everyone. I'd recommend everyone alive check it out, though. Some may love it, some may not understand it. I'm on the side of this being one of the last brilliant works of the World's greatest Director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal film from Japan's greatest director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreams is not a movie for everybody. To some, it may be too artsy of a film for their tastes (what are you doing watching movies then?), others may be annoyed by some of the stories not having clear messages, or leaving questions unanswered. Well, that is because Dreams is a film that was born inside of Kurosawa, and lives inside of him, it's a very personal film that not everybody will appreciate.The movie consists of eight short stories. Most of which center around the issue of people's relationships with other elements that make up this world that we live in.The cinematography in Dreams is breathtaking, and is the reason why some people claim that it is a film that puts "Style" above "story". I think that nobody can truly completely understand this film but Kurosawa himself. It is a product of his mind, a film that we cannot fully comprehend since we are not him. But since film is a form of art and in its truest form, a reflection of one's own self, Dreams may have just been one of Kurosawa's personal favorites in his long, amazing career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully made and achieved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with dreams, not only in terms of content but also aesthetically. There are very few films that manage to embody personal, local and global concerns as Akira Kurosava has managed in this production. There are so many underlying topics that it is difficult to concentrate in just a few for the purpose of this review, but I believe it is fair to say that Dreams portrays our individual and collective dreams and nightmares, reflecting that sometimes what we dream of today is what will keep us awake tomorrow. A nice range of representations of concerns from the deepest and most personal childhood worries and fantasies to the more complex issues of mental illness, extreme ambition, destruction of our environment and death. In all I recommend this film to anyone who has the chance to see it, It is possible that Dreams may not appeal to a mainstream audience in terms of content because there is a lot of symbolism and critical engagement but the photography and sceneries are for sure something that should not go amiss for anyone. If you get the chance it is truly worth giving it your time, a fantastic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's insights on man's need to harmonize with nature, the costs of war and the bad fruits that nuclear power can bear. This is the first Kurosawa movie I have seen, but I can see how true it is that Kurosawa is a master of creating atmosphere in a film. Such as the dark, post-nuclear apocalyptic world of THE WEEPING DEMON. Or the very first episode when the little boy sees something he is not supposed to see in the forest.I found THE BLIZZARD rather strange, and you'll see a scary part when the mountainman is having his mirage of the beautiful woman who symbolizes the snowstorm. I'm not sure what the significance of the dog was in THE TUNNEL, but I guess it illustrates the fact that though he was the commander of Third Platoon , he felt like a coward because of his command, his men paid the price.... yet he is guilty of still being alive; he's afraid of the dog.It ends rather low key, but the last episode THE VILLAGE IN THE WATERMILLS is the most insightful and bold in expressing the movie's theme... of harmonizing with nature, and maybe harmonizing with ourselves.The procession displays the unity and the communal harmony that the villagers have. And it is the exact opposite of what is grieved about in MOUNT FUJI IN RED or THE WEEPING DEMON. The cinematography is just beautiful. The movie is beautiful and captivating. Akira Kurosawa's YUME is Grade A- 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot say enough about Akira Kurosawa's Dreams. It is visually stunning and creative. It is sumptuous to watch--it stretches the imagination. For people who delight in remembering their own dreams, it is a treasure. There is also a nice variety in the dreams, drawing on Asian and Western themes as well as historical and contemporary cultural commentary. My favorites involve the peach trees, Van Gogh and the waterwheels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An art film for thoughtful meditation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people dream but I wonder how many are rewarded with such beauty when their eyelids close and they drift into semi-consciousness. Kurosawa has collected some of his dreams and shares them with us. I don't ever remember seeing such vivid colours in my own dreams, but like Kurosawa's they are often fragmented and incomplete with a mystical quality involving spirits and the dead.I like the peach tree scene where true repentance makes things right. Not only the peach blossom but also the kimono of the characters tiered up the hillside are most pleasing to the eye. As also is the meeting with van Gogh when his paintings with mad whirls of colour are brought to life and form part of the landscape.Some dreams can be very frustrating when we are caught in a dangerous situation from which there is no ready means of escape. This is dramatically illustrated in the Mt. Fuji episode in which nuclear plants explode and a fog of coloured radio-active gases envelopes the characters. There is a strong message here about saving the environment. This message is also accented in the ogre scene and the peach tree scene and the water mill scene.Some viewers might find the going slow at times. For example, the mountain climbers struggling in knee-deep snow seem to move at the rate of a few steps each minute and being encouraged by their leader to keep going as they strive to reach their camp. A mystical event occurs and in the morning when the heavy fog clears, a surprise awaits them. This feeling of striving and getting nowhere is common in dreams, at least in mine.There is also mysticism involved in the tunnel scene where an ex-soldier meets the remainder of his platoon all of whom were killed in battle. The sound of their marching feet echoing through the empty tunnel is quite chilling.Apart from a few dramatic moments the film is somewhat subdued. It is an art film beautifully conceived and should be reserved for one of those quiet moments when we are in a meditative mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb follow-up to RAN.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Akira Kurosawa made RAN, possibly the greatest film adaptation of a Shakespeare play, (in this case, King Lear), one wondered how this powerhouse director is going to top himself. Five years later, in 1990, he made this film, DREAMS. He didn't try for bigger, he went for more heartfelt- more personal. The resulting film will stay with you like expertly written poetry, like a masterful gallery of the best paintings. DREAMS is made up of eight dreams that Kurosawa had during his life. Some are beautiful, some are frightening nightmares. They all connect seamlessly. Is it one of the few Kurosawa films with a happy ending. (IKIRU, RASHOMON and DERSU UZALA are the only other ones I can think of. A grand film by a master film artist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than Just a Dream By Cris Evert Berdin LatoA series of subconscious peregrinations is not new to the world of cinema. The list is endless when talking about movie plots occurring in dreams. Too often, viewers become so engrossed and thrilled only to find out in the end that &amp;#8220;it was all but a dream&amp;#8221;. Yet, Akira Kurosawa&amp;#8217;s Dreams (Yume) was more of diverting the normal-dream-occurrence-escapade into something worth analyzing and comprehending. It was more of the cinematography rather than the dialog, though there were a number of striking lines worth pondering. Cinematography speaks for the movie itself.Dreams have woven together the stories of people from different generations. The first two stories Sunshine through the Rain and the Peach Orchard focuses on the little boy (though the 2nd story is not a sequel of the first)&amp;#8212;directly telling viewers about childhood. Kurosawa interprets childhood as a period of uncertainty, where one is bound to obedience and is often overcome by innocence and free will.For those who are not open-minded, Sunshine through the Rain may seem like a showcase of lopsidedness (the mother actually putting more weight on beliefs rather than protecting her own child). The power that culture carries is almost always unstoppable.The obvious choreography of the foxes was both entertaining and interesting. Entertaining because they look like &amp;#8220;out of this world beings&amp;#8221; who can&amp;#8217;t do anything to straighten their lives. Amazing and interesting because such organization is peculiar for creatures like them. Peach Orchard on the other hand, tells us about child&amp;#8217;s innocence. How hard the boy explained to the imperial spirits that he tried to stop destruction. The story was also about metamorphosis&amp;#8212;how a simple and ordinary scenario can turn into something spectacular and extraordinary. Likewise, it tells us about man&amp;#8217;s destructive nature and how such abusive act brought so much suffering to the boy. Yes, childhood of uncertainty but this period is also the moment when values are shaped, stain-free, pure and untouched.For the first two stories, Kurosawa magnificently presented childhood, a stage where thoughts are initially shaped, learnings are taught bit by bit and values are molded.The next two (The Blizzard and the Tunnel) tackled Kurosawa&amp;#8217;s struggle with the self, when an individual seeks his individuality. But such searching happens tumultuously.When all else fails, one has the tendency to give up and let things be. And just when things get all the worse, you suddenly find the strength to survive. The Blizzard&amp;#8217;s atmosphere was good but I find the scene where the other mountain climbers got up after the storm absurd. Yet I commend the climber who never gave up to his frozen exhaustion. The most effective story was The Tunnel. Astonishingly, Kurosawa has shown that memories of the past could never be hidden even though it may appear to be forgotten. The Tunnel expresses feelings, memories in retrospect. One cannot be ostentatious&amp;#8212;pretending to know nothing or as if nothing happened. &amp;#8220;Time cannot ease the pain of old wounds, instead the scars it leaves continues to be seen and serves as a reminder of what has transcribed.&amp;#8221;But I was totally dumbfounded when the dead soldiers obeyed their superior. It was both heartwarming and nerve-breaking.A major shift happened on the fifth segment Crows. For the previous two movies, the atmosphere has been hazy, cold depicting emotional struggles. With Crows, it was finding one self in solitude, learning from experienced people. Virtually stimulating, Crows invites viewers to get to know Van Gogh&amp;#8217;s paintings, as the young Japanese artist likewise &amp;#8220;invaded&amp;#8221; the world of Van Gogh&amp;#8217;s paintings.As one travels through the sands of time, one also discovers his true self.As the film moves on, Kurosawa evidently led viewers to a more mature stage. After childhood (Sunshine through the Rain and Peach Orchard), adolescence towards the path of seeking our individuality, to a peaceful self-realization (Crows. Towards the end of the film, Kurosawa introduced man&amp;#8217;s role to society. That after finding one&amp;#8217;s self, an individual can now relate himself to the society.Mount Fiji in Red, the Weeping Demon, and the Village of Watermills were all environmentally inclined. It appears succinct that environment is important; yet if one takes more plodding work, one realizes that merely saying how important environment is is truly different from experiencing that importance. As a metascience fiction of visualization of the end of the world, it awakens feelings of guilt and fear.&amp;#8220;Flowers are crippled,&amp;#8221; is a very striking statement in The Weeping Demon. It tells viewers how environmental pollution can destroy everything. Among the eight films, I found the title of this segment ironical but appropriate. I&amp;#8217;ve never heard of a demon weeping since all I can reckon is a laughing and chuckling one.Village of the Watermills significantly features a Utopian place, a place where man blends harmoniously with the environment. Actors of Dreams portrayed roles well although for some segment I found certain dialogues inappropriate and some actors needed more practice. But as a whole Dreams was a movie which invites viewers to dig deeper, to fathom the real meaning of each dream, understanding them both with the mind and the heart. Dreams, a movie which allows viewers to think and analyze more. In the end, all the efforts were rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking and mesmerizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to categorize Kurosawa movies in any formal sort of way. Similarly to Kubrick Kurosawa is a visionary and a complete artist. No matter what he undertakes he is relentless in his pursuit of perfection and truth of the art of film making. Visually he is the master that everyone should be inspired by. As a story teller, he layers plot and characters in the depths of emotional revelations.Dreams is an experience in film making. More then a mere moment of film magic it is a work of art to aspire to.Enjoy the breadth and scope of a vision translated to vibrant imagery. Of all the great directors of our time Kurosawa has yet to be fully recognized by the majority of movie goers. Dreams is a great starting point in the study of the genius of Kurosawa. Do not lose patience and indulge in his captivating world. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I arranged to see this as I was visiting Italy. It deepens my experience from the great filmmakers to orchestrate the context so.Italians make a fuss over the simple pleasures. They eat like they speak, with their entire upper bodies as they caress the most direct abstractions. Their language is designed to be beautiful in itself in that easy alliterative tossing of vowels.But those simple abstractions crowd out the more sophisticated ones as one can see in (by Mediterranean standards) absurdly blunt religion, politics, even crime and sex.Each person must make a choice whether the simple pleasures are worth the cost of the deeper ones. It is a matter of design versus art.Kurosawa chose the more difficult path his entire life except for a brief interlude with the Soviets and here.Usually his films begin life as meditations on ineluctable insights, then get captured in detailed paintings. The resulting film images provide insight into the ideas, which is the thing that makes his films worth living with. `Ran' is complex and is a different film on each viewing, each one potentially lifealtering. Not so here. Sometimes film can be personal, but that is impossible when you must have many collaborators. In order to come to some common purpose; things need to START with the visual as sort of a lowest common denominator. That's why special effects film are rarely worth the viewing.Here, Kurosawa has scores of collaborators, so he needs to shape his film in the Italian way. That's why the fulcrum of the thing features our leading Italian-style filmmaker as an ersatz Van Gogh. (He incidentally misunderstands Van Gogh, by the way. Vincent was perhaps our most cerebral and literate painter. His absinthe addiction and porphyria gave us the first intelligent hallucinogenic art. But his intent was very conscious and deliberate, not the obsessive Italian locomotive of intuition depicted here.) But never mind, we get what he means.In this simple, lowest common denominator, Kurosawa falls back on solidly established tradition of Japanese ghost stories, particularly the films of (???) as a short cut. Only the first one and a half story and the last deliver what makes him special beyond the genre.Those segments are excuses for highly abstract pageants, self-referentially staged - with the watcher (nominally the filmmaker) built in. The last one is the one that sticks with you. It is amazing how often over the years I have consciously recalled that funeral procession.That last story is perfectly ironic. A 103-year old man preaches a simple life while surrounded by waterwheels that superficially appear nature-friendly. But instead of being the primitive devices he is working on, they are made of machined lumber with excessive use of bolts. It is as if we were all in a great modern machine that we have abstracted into something that comfortably feels like nature. I'm sure that is the way it was with this elaborate studio set.The mechanisms of those wheels is some combination of his generative imagination, Mother Nature and the gears of society.I can hear him saying `I'm not dead yet,` like his alter ego in `Madadayo,' but with a certain resignation of a valued life lived without the simple pleasures. Bless him for his life - who among us will credit such a funeral celebration?Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do think this is a flawed but often brilliant film. I have a simple suggestion for how to make the film more effective by slightly rearranged the story order. You may still disagree with the environmental politics of the film, but at least Kurosawa's case is more forcefully argued this way. I think this should be the order:1) Sunshine Through the Rain 2) The Peach Orchard 3) The Blizzard 4) The Tunnel 5) *Mount Fuji in Red (could also be deleted altogether) 6) The Weeping Demon 7) *Crows (move this episode down two notches) 8) Village of the Watermills Moving Mount Fuji and Weeping Demon ahead of Crows fulfills several things: a) Simple cinematic effectiveness: With The Tunnel the film gets gradually darker, more like nightmares than dreams. The Tunnel has an ominous ending with the barking dog. The stories that immediately following The Tunnel should explore the darker end of things rather than being followed by a lighter story like Crows, which is a mistake for dramatic reasons. b) This also makes the film's point clearer: The first two stories feature a young boy. As a child we have a much more innocent relationship to nature. A child might wish to penetrate nature's secrets, but does so innocently. The boy merely wanted to watch the fox wedding. He was caught looking, but meant no real harm. Even so, the boy is rejected by his mother and he is sent on a quest to seek forgiveness from the foxes. A recurring theme in this film is that interfering with nature can have serious consequences. The boy in The Peach Orchard is too young to do anything about the trees being cut down. He simply loves peaches and trees in bloom. At the end the boy realizes how terrible the consequences can be if Man acts against nature. The following four stories #3-#6 show a fully grown adult (presumably the boy grown up?). In the Blizzard, he is struggling against nature, which he sees as threatening and hostile to him, unlike the boy's less confrontational feelings towards it. An interesting thing in The Blizzard is the ambiguity of the Snow Spirit woman. Is she trying to help the mountain climber or kill him? It is left deliberately obscure. I interpret this to mean that the forces of nature, while very beautiful, can also be deadly. We should show nature the proper respect. Next in The Tunnel, the subject is the ultimate destructive act of Mankind, war. The man claims to have sympathy for his dead troops, which they meekly accept and go back to the grave. However, the company dog is not so easy to fool. It is an animal and does not accept the rationalizations that his men do for being sent to their deaths. The dog is depicted almost as a Hell Hound on the his trail. This is why Crows MUST NOT following The Tunnel. The Tunnel should have set up the next two stories featuring the fully grown adult. These take the idea of being at war with nature to the most hellish extreme. The dog in the Tunnel acts as an omen and a harbinger of doom which we seen in the nightmares of Mount Fuji and The Weeping Demon. The Weeping Demon is nothing less than a vision of hell on earth. Finally, the last two stories feature an older man (Van Gogh and the village elder respectively) who impart the wisdom of old age to a younger man. These men are totally in harmony with their natural surroundings. Crows plays better if it isn't sandwiched between The Tunnel and Mount Fuji and Weeping Demon. It comes across as irrelevant and lightweight in its present position in the film. FIX IT YOURSELF! Repositioning it makes it seem more effective, even if this doesn't fully address the films other weaknesses. The village elder in the final episode has the innocence of a second childhood, tempered with a whole lifetime of experience. This is why Crows and Village of the Windmills should be paired together as the last two stories. We have gone from youthful daydreams, to the nightmares of the adult world, into a second rebirth of innocence. The Village of the Windmills is not so much a real place but rather a kind of "Heaven on Earth", the mirror opposite of the Weeping Demon's hell on earth. The Village "has no name", just like in the U2 song "Where the Streets Have No Name", which of course refers to Heaven. I think is a clue that this village is not of this world but rather the next. It is a perhaps impossible dream of total harmony with nature that Mankind can aspire to, though it may be unachievable in this world. If you look at the meaning of Village of the Windmills in this way, the ending is incredibly melancholy, as is the music on the soundtrack. Perhaps the "dreams" referred to in this film aren't necessarily dreams Kurosawa had while he was sleeping, but his waking dreams and nightmares about Man's relationship with nature. Mount Fuji in Red is the least effective sequence precisely because it is too literal, coming across as even more preachy and didactic than the rest of the film. It feels like something out of a Godzilla movie or an Irwin Allen disaster picture. If we eliminate Mount Fuji, then one story about war follows another. The Tunnel is about World War II, and the Weeping Demon is about World War III. This makes that argument that warfare is Man's ultimate (and unnatural) way of making war against nature. This is why the company dog in The Tunnel behaves the way it does, because it sees the threat Mankind may ultimately pose to nature itself in a way the officer's dead soldiers cannot or will not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entirely Underrated. The Best Kurosawa Film I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been exploring the works of Akira Kurosawa for about 6 months now, and I have seen most of those films which are generally considered masterpieces of film. There wasn't one of his films that I felt surpassed classics like 2001, Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, or The Godfather. The one I had felt was the best was Ran, his adaptation of King Lear. But now I've found one that I believe is among the ranks of the classics of cinema.And oddly enough, Dreams is not considered a masterpiece. Maltin only gives it ***. I give it a square 10/10. I was skeptical at first. The first three pieces were nice, but I didn't find them extraordinary. The fourth one, "The Tunnel," began to interest me, and about half-way through that one, I realized that putting dreams to film made a lot more sense than I had originally thought. I began to examine them from a psychological point of view. I became obsessed with the first three, diving deeply into them for their meanings, coming up with pearls of wisdom. I think this film affected my unconscious mind more than most films. Only 2001, which works on every level, conscious, subconscious, and unconscious, simultaneously (and it is alone among films in that respect), is similar.I will not go into any of the plots. One should experience everything in this film with no preconceptions. Besides, no one should on this site; these comments ought to be only about why or why not the commenter liked the film he/she is commenting on. Just rent it, sit down, and let your mind absorb the beautiful images and the half-coherent thoughts expressed. When you fall asleep afterwards, you will certainly have the best dreams you've ever had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful dreams that man has been turned into nightmares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa was a good man. East-blooded, able to see beyond the surface, transcended the skin and sharpened senses to understand the greatness of our world. He saw, recognized and pulsed with the natural beauty that the world has to offer and felt, shared and respected the man who carries depth, dignity and love, with the rest of his fellows, and put his life in service of an art sacred and clean for him, with which recorded his feelings, hopes and fears. In 1990, Kurosawa had already created a cinematographic work which included 28 films, most of them of profound significance and an occasional small lakes such as have any other artist, therefore, not always the inspiration and / or conditions, they get found at its highest point. However, already had earned the Golden Lion and Silver Lion in Venice, had received the Oscar for best foreign film, and two Silver Bears at the Berlin Film Festival, also recognized his virtuosity.He had already overcome the worst existential crisis, and had won the recognition of large European and American producers who funded his latest projects.Thus, with the support of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, then came "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams," a film very visually beautiful, full of illusion and disillusion, innocent and sweet as if you tell your child more intimate, and hope to awaken the conscience of man of the century, which is about to completely ruin the permanence of the human being, this amazing home that we gave by bequest. Eight vindicate dreams and magic of nature, which speak of the forces that exist beyond the senses, that we warn against nuclear disaster, and remind us of the majesty and security that, in principle, we were given away. The result is a film with meaning and worthy of a tortured writer who, by dint of perseverance, kept alive the hope in man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The modern Beethovan of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This post contains lots of spoilers: my apologies to allI am a huge Kurosawa fan, possibly one of the biggest and love this movie above all else. It is a masterpiece. I call him "Beethovan" because when he made this film, he was blind as Beethovan was deaf. It is by far his most beautiful film ever made.It is a clear anti-nuclear war message. Aftere having viewed Hiroshima, it is another clear message just like the monument. After one sees "the Weeping Demon" and "Mt. Fuji in Red" in conjunction with Hiroshima/Nagasaki you will understand the hateful nature of nuclear weapons and such.Moving away from the political nature of the movie, the acting is spectacular. Each and every actor no matter how minuscule their role is perfected and looks like god himself carved it. Not a single detail is over looked and not a single movement goes unchecked.The color! Dear god, its gorgeous. Color was the Peach blossoms (or second one) will leave one breathless, just starring at such a scene of the dance makes me cry. It's beautiful the color and the filming of it. And crows is bred from his incredibly brilliant mind. Jumping into the pictures of Van Gogh. Absolute brilliance and beautiful.My apologies for the spoilers. There is so much more I could go on with, but I must stop. All in all, it is a must see for all wannabe directors and artists of any form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie after trying to find it for about 2-3 years. My friend and I were working on a short and he told me that it reminded him of one of the shorts in Dreams by Kurosawa. Now I was taken aback, Kurosawa being one of my favorite directors. When I sat down with a friend to watch the movie I had been obsessing about for three years, well excited isn't the word I would use to describe my state of mind.The celluloid moved and I watched in absolute enjoyment, I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. Every frame was a painting, so intentional, so fluid, and quite removed from the "lets use cgi for every other shot", attitude that is so present in film making today, thats not a bash to the industry, but you can make a great picture using cgi without over using it.The order of which the shorts were put together I believe was perfect. Starting with youthful folly and ending with hope, isn't that life's gambit? There are parts where it gets preachy but if this is your last picture wouldn't you want to get as much of yourself into it as possible?At the end of the picture, I felt overwhelmed with an urge to create, I said to my self"I want to be that good" as I want to be a filmmaker. Simply amazing, anyone who wants to make movies should watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is more in dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seems as if Kurosawa intended it to be his last. It has an air of testament, of final words. In a number of separate episodes, he takes us through scenes of increasing darkness, and lands in one of peace and light. Surely, he intended the obvious likeness to Dante's Divine Comedy.WARNING: SLIGHT SPOILERSThen, Kurosawa's Paradise is one of minimal splendor, a return to agricultural simplicity, man in harmony with nature. It's the same kind of ideal as expressed in the last verse of the Chinese book Tao The Ching. I have always suspected that ideal to be little more than a romantic illusion - a sweet dream, but boring to actually live in.The previous episodes are much more intense and fascinating, to the extent where one has to wonder if, perchance, Kurosawa would not have preferred to end up in one of them, rather than the last one - in spite of the torment they contain.Anyway, the film starts and ends with procession - the first a wedding, the last a funeral. In Kurosawa's Dreams, the former is threatening, and the latter joyous. I wonder why there is no birth. There are children, though, but they are in no way spared from the sorrows of the world. Sadly, that is true to life.Less realistic is the scarce presence of women. The most prominent female character is a sort of Snow Queen, trying to kill some men lost in the mountains. "The snow is warm, the ice is hot," she says to one of them, to make him sleep. True, indeed - but a harmful warmth, a deadly heat. Still, it cannot compare to the genocide heat produced by men, later on in the movie.These are dreams? If so, they are surprisingly barren. Not the likes of Dante's - or, I dare say, anyone else's. Dreams are complex things, and when studied closely, they open up like Pandora's box. Kurosawa's episodes are not dreams, in that sense, but mere silhouettes of them. For dreams to be revealed, they must be entered. Kurosawa seems to have kept them on a distance, taming them with his waking state.Perhaps he had found that his dreams could not compare to what he had accomplished in his many great movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love movies that make you think, and I tend not to like the typical Hollywood over-budgeted garbage that's spewed out year after year after year. I've heard this movie praised over and over again, and being a newcomer to Kurosawa's film making, I was looking forward to a strange adventure into this man's mind. Unfortunately, what I found was a segment or two that was great in concept, sometimes beautifully filmed, but overall, surprisingly pretentious and poorly executed.There are segments that seem to drag on forever without dialogue and others that spew what seems to be propaganda from the mouths of the actors. Personally, I don't mind films with slow pacing, and the segments that dragged, to me, were the more enjoyable than the ones full of propaganda. I'll clarify what I mean by "propaganda." It seems to me that the writing is far too overt. Yes, there are deep and important messages being told to us, but they're not subtle in the least. I felt like I was watching a couple of plays written at the high school level. Most of the characters stand still on screen while they talk, seemingly, directly to the audience about whatever moral or ethical dilemma the segment is addressing.Still, if you like odd movies and some experimental film making, you should at least give this a rent. Unfortunately, I bought it and am unsatisfied with my purchase, but had I rented it for a couple dollars I would not have felt cheated. It's something to watch once, but the dialogue is painfully unnatural at times and ruins some great concepts with poor writing. It's not a classic, but it's not a complete failure in every aspect either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kurasawa's DREAMSIs there a greater director ever? Few would argue that anyone besides maybe Kubrick comes close. Dreams is the Swan song of Japan's most amazing and artistic director in the most artistic film of his long life. Known for his Samurai films and occasional noir mystery dreams is a departure because it is not a story yet eight pieces of of cinematic expression. There are no Spoilers that could ruin this film because really it is like looking at a painting. I have read many comments where time after time people comment that this personal film was not meant to be understood by anyone but the director. Please, why would Kurasawa do that at the end of his life. I think Kurasawa had a lot to say at the end and the sad part is that it went over many people's heads. Well I believe many of the segments are open to interpretation but for anyone who knows that Kurasawa was a socialist, or that he didn't really dig how technology was taking the world. Well there lies your answer. Some of the segments use allegory express Kurasawa's feelings about the destruction of nature around him, the abuse of capitalism, His need for perfectionism and what he endured for it, the spoils of war and much more.The man was dying and he wanted the world to know just how he felt about it. Amazing film. Beautifully shot. Amazing to look at. I gave it 9 out of 10. It would have been perfect with out Martin S. as Van gogh. ******Spoilers****The scene in the wasteland with as the demons fighting over that last little pond of polluted water was such a viscous attack on capitalism I find it amusing that more people didn't understand it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing for me, but not a bad film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just for the record I love Akira Kurasawa and his movies, Seven Samurai and Ran being my favourites of his. Dreams was a film I didn't like very much at first but did admire it for how beautifully filmed it was. Watching it again, I do like it much more. Although it is one of my least favourite Kurasawas and still disappointing for me, it is not a bad film. A couple of the vignettes are rather self-indulgent and muddled in the messaging, some of the more political parts could be seen as somewhat naive and the pacing is uneven, perfect at times but drags too much in others. However, again like with all Kurasawa's work it looks absolutely gorgeous especially in the Crows vignette, full of beautifully composed cinematography and colourful imagery. Kurasawa's direction shows what a versatile director he was, often genteel and poignant here. The music compliments each vignette very well, the haunting tune of the concluding Village of the Watermills vignette fared the most effective. The environmentalism is appropriately heartfelt, and Martin Scorsese is excellent as Van Gogh. Overall, not one of Kurasawa's very best for me but after hearing not so good things about it I am glad I gave it a second chance as it is not for everyone, but I found it much better second time around. If anything Dreams is decent, it is just that it falls short of the greatness of the likes of Seven Samurai, Ran, Yojimbo, Ikiru and Hidden Fortress. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique and unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen it once, in the 1990s, but I still remember it with fascination. "Dreams" contains different short pieces containing a enactment of several real dreams that Kurosawa had. You have to remember that when watching it, as the film is full of surrealism and unconsciousness, but also of shocking inexplicable images, as most of our dreams are. The dreams have different tone and mood, but all of them are beautifully filmed and brought to life. However, some of them are very sad and shocking and not easy to understand.This is one of those films rarely created in the history of film making, in which a director bares his soul naked in front of the spectator to show those fears, oniric patterns and stories that populate his most inner world. Imagine how difficult is to remember a dream, and, even more difficult, to recreate it and make it understandable, visually, for a person who is not you, i. e. for people to whom the images are presented as a projection of your unconscious. That's precisely what Kurosawa does in this movie. It is an exercise of both psychoanalysis and an intimate way of communication of the self with the viewer.This is, perhaps, a movie too complex for the usual movie-goer, but an oniric masterpiece, rare and unique that will delight cinema lovers and Kurosawa's fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Close too perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dreams' is a highly personal journey through the inner landscape of Kurosawa's mind. But it is also an oneiric reflection on Japan itself. True to the nature of dreams the movie is comprised of vignettes, most of which unconnected, a collection of threads of imagery that are stand alone and gain a greater sense of diversity when seen as a whole. This variety is deep and eccentric, it goes from traditional lore in the wedding of the Fox spirits to frightful scenes of nuclear disaster as Mount Fuji becomes a red cone without forgetting a gorgeous incursion into Van Gogh's vision.While artistically bold and faultless in the crafting of a dreamy mood this is not an escapist movie of pure fantasy. For there is always space of nightmares in the world of dreams. Collective phantoms that are very close to the Japanese identity reappear in novel and unpredictable ways. The horrors of the war are represented in a dead platoon that does not know of its own demise; the ever present dread of a nuclear holocaust mingles with the national icon of Fujiyama and provides ground for philosophical considerations through the narrative vehicle of folk traditions; ecological concerns in a society that is increasingly more dependent on technology are soothed by a bucolic alternative of a simpler life.Through the medium of strong impressive images Kurosawa interprets himself and his country to the world with stunning results. The movie is the culminating achievement of a master for if there ever was a masterpiece 'Dreams' is one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the few Kurosawa films i've so far seen, Dreams is the first one in color. Concerning the images on screen this film is beautiful. Kurosawa could truly make his films look like paintings. In a time where idiot reviewers can call 'The A-Team' poetry in motion, this film and other masterpieces will forever be underrated. Funnily enough, of all the films I've seen, I would relate this to a slightly inferior 2001. The reason is the scant dialogue and brutally slow moving scenes. This is one of the reasons I am not the ultimate Space Odyssey fan, because you really have to be in the right interprative mood. This is also what Dreams suffers and thrives from, a snail's pace.There are pros and cons to each 'Dream' and I will mention each. When talking about slow pace, the one that suffers the most is 'The Blizzard'. This section, while entertaining, is the simplest of stories, and it drags on for too long. Although I'm contradicting myself,some Dreams are too talky- mostly 'the Tunnel', 'Village Of The Watermills',and 'the Weeping Demon' (in my opinion the weakest of the sections) in which half the dream seems to be comprised of a shot of a character talking in a very obvious way about some thematic statement. 'Sunshine Through The Rain' and 'The Peach Orchard' seem to end far too abruptly with most of the Dream being a Kabuki-esquire dance sequence. 'Mount Fuji in Red' is a scathing rant at all things Nuclear and in it's 2 scenes happens to have one of the films highlights and low points. Scene one of the Dream is a really scary Godzilla meets An Inconveniant Truith section that is ironic and unsettling. Part 2 is an overacted, preachy and talkative killer of momentum. Overall my second best.In my humble opinion, the best dream is 'Crows' because it combines the best use of cinematography and weaves it into the story, as well as blending silence with dialogue. This is the only Dream that isn't too preachy or too slow and is perhaps one of the most visceral things Kurosawa has done. The final sequence that has something to do with crows (no spoilers) took me completely by surprise and sent a chill down my spine. Capturing the surreal, enchanting and slightly unsettling feeling of Dreaming.I know I've taken a few hits at this film but thats only because it's not perfect. It's certainly not Kurosawa's best (in my Opinion that's Rashomon) but the truith is that it's cinematically ingenious. In a world where banal stupidity thrives (cough TRANSFORMERS cough)and gets a fair amount of undeserved praise, on Rotten Tomatoes this film currently gets a 53%! That makes me angry! Watch this movie and see what you think...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solace For One's Sensory Sanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Kurosawa made this collection of dreams that he claimed to have experienced, he had made films with tremendous influence on cinema for 45 years. He had earned the privilege to indulge himself a bit. Interpreted in totality, they adopt an abstractly natural composition and add up. More to the point, even interpreted on each's own merits they're exceedingly more stimulating.The first two dreams are seclusively Japanese but suggest Kurosawa's passionate concern for the environment. The images are invigorating: pastures of emerging flowers, and elegant processions and dances that, I must admit, seem too poised and rigid for a dream. The next two are in immediate distinction from the preceding flamboyance, creating the feeling of a story's turning point, just like a continuous feature film. They are dismal, austere contemplations of mortality and war. Mountaineers fight up a mountain during a blizzard, discouraged, eager to surrender. One at a time they submit to the snow. The leader persists, but he too yields. A mythological woman materializes enticing them to their demise. Though the ending of this is actually kind of funny, the next segment, possibly the very strongest, is heartrending:An army officer treks a deserted road at twilight, on his way home from war. He comes to a pitch black tunnel. A furious dog emerges from the darkness and snarls and barks at him with a surreal sound of deep viciousness. He proceeds frightened and comes out the other side, but then beholds one of the soldiers over whom he had charge following him out, his face a light blue, suggesting with traditional Japanese theatricality that he is dead. The soldier doesn't believe he's dead, but the officer assures him and the soldier returns into the darkness of the tunnel, the entire platoon emerging out of the tunnel, all dead. He tries to convince them, and squeezes out his deep-rooted guilty conscience about leading them all to die. They stand silent and display a heartbreaking demonstration of undying loyalty. What I find to be the most beautiful and perceptive touch in this dream is that we see a second appearance of the dog, from the opening of this dream. When we see that it is strapped with explosives and all, we understand that it was an anti-tank dog that died with the rest of the platoon. Kurosawa understands the animal element of nature, the betrayal suffered by the enduring devotion of a dog.Kurosawa then shifts back into elatedness with a luminous vignette where Martin Scorsese plays Van Gogh, who is without his ear and near his death. A student, presumably a grown Kurosawa, enters the vivid, effervescent and at times hectic world in the bounds of Van Gogh's artwork, where he meets the painter in a meadow. The student loses track of him and traverses through numerous paintings endeavoring to find him, scored to an infectious Chopin prelude. This is the most imaginary of the dreams, Van Gogh expressing some artistic outlook undoubtedly shared by Kurosawa, who steals us back to the shadows with inescapable nightmares of nuclear desolation. A nuclear plant melts down. Five people remain, realizing radiation will kill them. Next, a man finds wanders a foggy mountainous terrain and meets a mutated human with a horn who explains that there was a nuclear holocaust which eradicated nature and animals. These segments are more in character as essential Kurosawa and again in blunt disparity to the previous.Then, following the warnings of impending catastrophe that clue one into Kurosawa's familiarity with the hero of I Live In Fear, the final dream leaves a tone of serenity, parting with the dream, if you will, of peace of mind if we could but accept the undemanding natural simplicities of life. A man finds an undisturbed village and meets an old man who tells that the village has long abandoned the control of technology and have chosen spiritual health over convenience. It is an apt and gratifying finale to a meditative film of overwhelming visual loveliness and vision.Dreams certainly has a story structure, the transcendent magnificence that requires a look beyond its appearance is that these numerous segments are just what they are, fragmentary vignettes underscoring visual majesty and a mind's eye above traditional sequence.Dreams may well appear self-indulgent to several, and does have a tendency to crawl at some point in each of the happy dreams. Nevertheless, it's a solace to one's sensory sanity, not necessarily to be seen the same way as most films. The way some find old black and whites to be comforting, taking them with their eyes half closed into a dreamy bygone universe, Dreams was initially intended for such an experience, from a filmmaker who for 45 years had proved time and time again his understanding the quintessence of the nature and purpose of cinema, and who later learned to reject criticism and make the films that he knew in his heart had to be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I of the few who aspire to true optimism that begs the question that this film is for anybody and everybody? Absolutely, and anybody who has come away with something from this film can agree that they obviously believe the same thing. Don't apologize guys because this film deserve all your credit.Specific to the human experience is the nature of dreams. Something that can inspire us, beg questions of or for us to simply ignore. So futile are the attempts to analyze them fully, one can pull them apart and may be useful for the understanding of ones mind, it works, it does, but sometimes dreams just are. They obviously could be pulled apart and thats interesting, but when you experience a dream, you just react, analysis and embellishment doesn't happen till after.What's truly beautiful about this film is its truth to how a dream plays, it's truth to its ambiguous dialogue (as in a dream), the truth to the embellished coloring or discoloring (as in a dream), overall its truth to the mood and perpetual questioning that a dream always conveys. I can't fault it, I love it, It makes you realize your not alone. To see dreams played out in such perfect detail, The snarling dog with the red light, my goodness! The fade in the weeping demon exquisite, the joyous encounter in the peach orchard! I could go on...The fact remains I'm as cynical as the next man, I try not to be, I don't have to try with this, its perfection in its imperfection, Imperfection in its perfection. If your looking to watch this, forget any kind of precursor and look at it as yourself, it doesn't need analyzing, you'd be wasting you time, its another mans dreams.... but how familiar is it all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mawkish critic would point out that filmmakers have been sharing their dreams with us since the dawn of cinema. Still, if the notion of access to the dreams of legendary director Akira Kurosawa doesn't leave you salivating, dreams are something you're probably sorely lacking in yourself. Kurosawa's treatise to his subconscious is indubitably a curiosity - more personal, whimsical, and freeform than his average fare - but there's more lurking beneath the surface than the dazzling array of disconnected, surrealist vignettes first impression yields, making his work here a fascinating hidden gem to discover for Kurosawa aficionados and the uninitiated alike.Dreams is thoroughly Japanese, anchored heavily on the disjuncture between ancient mythology and modern sensibilities that colours much of Kurosawa's later work (the fact that it's reminiscent of the rhythm and beautiful inconclusiveness of author Haruki Murakami as well strikes me as hardly a coincidence). Still, Kurosawa's lavish colour palettes, already pushed to the limit in Ran, are in jaw-dropping full bloom here, conjuring up images - a forest kabuki performance of ominous fox-men; a peach blossom dance by spirits in gorgeous ceremonial garb - that are so staggeringly beautiful they almost defy belief. In the film's most memorable vignette, "Crows," Kurosawa's placeholder protagonist literally wanders into a 3D Vincent Van Gogh painting, rough brush strokes, sweeping textures and all (and complete with a delightfully gruff performance by Martin Scorsese as Van Gogh, in a stunning coup of artistic metatextuality). Kurosawa seamlessly blends practical sets, costumes, and makeup with the subtlest dash of CGI touch-ups by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic (a fitting pay-it-forward after Lucas took the inspiration for Star Wars from Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress). The effect is stunning - a hazy blurring between the real and fantasy, unforgettable and elusive, that perfectly captures the immateriality of a dream.Is there any structure to this gossamer array of gorgeous surreality? Debatable. Kurosawa's array of stories are too cheerfully disarming to play as pretentious, or their perennially enigmatic inconclusiveness to frustrate - dreams, after all, seldom make sense or wrap up neatly. There are rough themes that crop up throughout - environmentalism, anti-war, and the large and the conflation between killing humans and the environment - and greater connections can be forged by those fuelled with more biographical knowledge of Kurosawa's life. Still, Kurosawa is anything but dogmatic here. A couple of vignettes are more pointed with their social commentary, but usually seasoned with whiffs of cheeky humour to take the sting out - an apocalyptic nuclear meltdown in "Mt. Fuji in red" becomes a bombastically melodramatic 'Japanese-monster-movie-sans-monster;' while the grotesque, hellish purgatory of "The Weeping Demon" takes on an absurdist, Beckett-style satirical bent (three and two-horned demons feast on the lowly one-horned demons - even the afterlife has a pecking order of malevolence). Some of the vignettes are genuinely haunting - a mother reproachfully sending her son to his death after spying on a fox-spirit ceremony in "Sunshine in the Rain;" a hiker succumbing to the seductive oblivion of freezing to death in "The Blizzard;" and, most poignantly, in "The Tunnel," a wandering sergeant is badgered by an army of sickly spectres his tactical errors consigned to death. Still, in "Village of the Watermills," Kurosawa's dreams are granted an ending which, while not outright happy, is certainly the most uplifting form of bittersweet, with tension between traditional Japanese and Mardis Gras influences lending sombre themes a playful hope. Kurosawa's Dreams may not provide the answers viewers may lust for, but ultimately serve to answer larger questions viewers may not have even known they were asking, validating life even without explicitly articulated purpose. As artistic cinematic experiment, Kurosawa's Dreams may excel primarily aesthetically, but imagery so stunning makes it well worth its vague sense of unrequitedness. It's well worth going in with an open mind and welcome heart, and allowing yourself to be touched by the exquisite visions of a master at his most whimsical, but aesthetically unforgettable. Kurosawa's work here, while too slight to rank among his masterpieces, is still nothing short of (you guessed it) a dream come true. -8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's Most Underrated Film? - It screams for Criterion release!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, for me, is one of the most beautiful films ever made. Considered by many to be 2nd rate Kurosawa, that's something I just don't buy. So many of his techniques are on display, infinity shots, close-ups, telephoto manipulations, great storytelling (for the most part) and some of the best color cinematography I've yet to see. I love this film. If critics did not know who the director was, I believe it would be considered a classic but some artists are virtually always held to expectations that are foolish. I have seen almost all of Kurosawa's films and I've never seen one I didn't like. Some are masterpieces, some near masterpieces and even his weaker ones always interesting. I was surprised how much i liked The Quiet Duel and I Live in Fear perhaps because they are not written about constantly like Ran, Seven Samurai, Yojimbo or the wonderful Ikiru.If any of his films deserved a Criterion Blu-ray release, this is it and I think it is only one of perhaps 3 that Criterion has not done. Certainly the only reason must be to do with getting the rights and not that they think it isn't deserving. It is written that Kurosawa came to color late yet he was a painter, therefore his wonderful albeit overly colorful films. Overly colorful for realists but not artists who know how to employ it with genius. It's simple, beautiful, a true piece of film art by one of the greatest directors in film history.</fullReview>

Dreams is not a typical film thematically or stylistically, and the viewer should be prepared for a strange yet remarkable journey. Instead of following a linear plot line the film consists of eight independent short stories, each with different settings and characters. Each dream could function as a stand alone piece, but similar themes run through the works. These common themes tie the piece together and create a more cohesive and complete piece. In addition, the scenes are organized in a strategic way so that transitions are smooth. Moreover, your ability to comprehend the more eccentric scenes toward the end of the film is increased by being primed and comfortable with Kurosawa's surreal style. Each scene is set in a different time, place, and reality, and they all have a mystical quality. Each dream addresses an environmental theme in an imaginative way. For example, in the first dream, a young boy witnesses a fox's wedding without permission, and must face the consequences. In the second, another young boy speaks with the spirits of a peach orchard that his family cut down. In the next, four men attempt to summit a mountain during a deadly blizzard. The film then takes a turn that raises your hair on end when a commander walks through a tunnel and encounters one of his dead soldiers. In an even more surreal scene, a man seeks Vincent Van Gogh by literally diving into his paintings. In the sixth and seventh scene, Kurosawa imagines a nuclear energy disaster in Japan and what a post nuclear fallout world would look like. In the final dream a traveler stumbles upon a quaint town that lives in harmony with nature. Each of these vignettes present arguments about our society's relationship with nature, and they explore the dangerous consequences that might occur if we do not respect it. Dreams is intriguing and artistically masterful, but I still found it difficult to stay focused and involved during some of the slower moments. Kurosawa is certainly an incredibly talented director with demonstrated artistic mastery. Within the first few seconds of each scene, the audience is transported into Kurosawa's dream world. Whether it be in a blizzard or post nuclear apocalypse, Kurosawa is able to set the scene without backstory or dialogue. The acting and music is made more dramatic by typically desolate or sparse environment. They qualities work in union with each other to create a stylistically unique atmosphere. In most cases this union was effective, however, on multiple occasions the music was too heavy handed, overdramatic, and distracting. Similarly, on multiple occasions a dramatic beat lasted too long, and I found myself drifting away. During these moments of lapsing concentration the artistic film lover in me had to shake the rest of my mind awake. While the artist in me regarded these moments with self revulsion, it is important to note that there were moments in the film where I heard myself saying, "Okay, I get it. Now let's get on with it." By no means did these moments completely derail Kurosawa's film; however, it is important to note that this film is not fast paced or easy to process. It is easy to feel confused by his surreal style. In my experience this confusion distances the audience from the film that it was so captivated by just moments before. If you watch films solely for the purpose of being entertained and do not like to be puzzled or actively think about a film, this film is not for you. After watching this film the viewer certainly can tell that Kurosawa's vision is refined, purposeful, and Kurosawa accomplished what he set out to do. However, it may still remain unclear what exactly his goals were. If his goal was to open a door and invite the audience into his dreams, he accomplished that without question. Each dream had a strong setting, even though they were mystical and surreal. He effectively used these settings to evoke emotional responses and set a mesmerising scene. Certain moments dragged on too long and many of the scenes lacked closure. These features distanced the audience from the dream. In some of these moments my mind was racing with possible outcomes and questioning exactly what he was trying to say. I was searching for symbolism and picking out his arguments about humanity and nature. This reflection left me wondering if his intention was to distance the viewer afterall. Nevertheless, in the slower moments I also found myself drifting away from the dream, and into my own dreams; this was certainly not his intention. Nevertheless, this film is certainly a worthwhile experience.I implore you to watch Kurosawa's Dreams, but do not expect a comfortable and passive ride. Kurosawa takes you on a surreal journey into the depths of his imagination that is both striking and puzzling. The most notable and important feature of Kurosawa's Dreams is that the film explores humanity's relationship with nature. Some dreams explore this relationship more directly, while in others it is more indirect. Nevertheless, it is obvious that Kurosawa is deeply troubled by fears of what the future may bring if we continue on the path we are on, one that is unsustainable and certainly leading to environmental disaster. Despite these fears, this film does not lead the viewer into despair about the environmental crisis and the future of humanity. If you have what it takes, I urge you to watch the film and see for yourself the solution that Kurosawa presents for how we can live happily, sustainably, and ethically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the most surreal Kurosawa I've watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That might not make it bad, it's just this movie to me is best described as 8 short movies put together. I find out of all the directors considered the greats that don't have the household name that some Hollywood filmmakers have (although this maybe very different in Japan) Kurosawa is by far the easiest to get into considering how much influence he has had on Westerns and Summer Blockbusters of the 80's. This is laced with being surreal, I mean it's supposed to be dreams but it's shot and made in such a way that it really feels like a collection of dreams. My personal favourite of these shorts is The Tunnel where a soldier returning from War walks through a tunnel and not only does he walk out the other end but the ghosts of his dead comrades. If I was to name a least favourite it would be the Mount Fuji one, I feel what was done there was done so much better in The Weeping Demon, which is the next story. Either way the acting is very good and the cinematography is brilliant. As I said this can be best described as 8 shorts that all feel like dreams edited together to make a 2 hour movie so if that sounds like your thing or you're a fan of Kurosawa like I am then I'd say give this a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Finest of Kurosawa's Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A collection of tales based upon the actual dreams of director Akira Kurosawa.The film received mixed reviews, earning a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of only 55%. I think this is a shame. Although Kurosawa is better known for his samurai stories, this was one of the last stories he put on film and I would say it is among his best. The incredible use of color and costuming alone makes this worth seeing.The segment that will probably stand out most for Americans is the vignette with Vincent vanGogh, played by Martin Scorsese. This was an interesting bit of casting, but more interestingly was the way the story unfolds at this point, where nature is shown to be art, both figuratively and literally. It is a quite a beautiful short film in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Environmental Warning to Mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you ever wake up from a dream and think to yourself, "Whoa, that could be a movie". Perhaps this is exactly what the director of Dreams thought to himself. Dreams is a film directed by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa in 1990. This film is an extremely artistic and interesting portrayal of a compelling perspective of the relationship between human and the environment. Just like in actual dreams, things aren't necessarily always realistic. This approach works well for the film because it creates the illusion that you are stepping into Kurosawa's mind and dreams. It is an extremely organized film made up of eight short films. Each one is like an episode to represent a different dream of Kurosawa. On the surface, these dreams might seem senseless, bizarre, or even creepy. But on a deeper level, the dreams are elaborately portrayed to signify a message to the audience about the environment; a warning. Here is a little about why Dreams deserves four stars?First of all, the sound and color set a different mood in every episode. The mood is important to create the illusion of a dream?and anything can happen in dreams! There are limited amounts of dialogue in the film. This makes conversations between characters valuable because they offer important knowledge to be able to understand the message Kurosawa is making. The sound in the film makes up for the lack of words. Sound plays an extremely important role in each of the episodes. It emphasizes certain actions and dramatizes important moments in the film. The sounds are deep and are effective in creating suspense. The instruments most likely used might include traditional stringed instruments including the erhu, pipa, and guzheng, and the dizi flutes. Color is also very important and while some episodes are dark and cool, others are saturated and bright. The elements of color and sounds work hand in hand to create a suspenseful mood in each episode. There is always a sense of suspense and curiosity throughout the film?mainly because the main character of each episode plays a very particularly curious role. Since there is no main plot that follows throughout the entire film, the viewer does not know what to expect. As the viewers, we follow the main character in their curiosity. Truly, this film is unlike anything you have seen before. To give you an idea of what each of the dreams is like, I'll describe two of them. The film begins with the first dream titled, Sunshine Through the Rain. This episode sets the mood for the rest of the film. A little boy disobeys his mother's orders and witnessed something that humans are not supposed to see. As the boy travels through the forest, he finds foxes performing their traditional wedding ceremony. The little boy watches extremely carefully?it makes the viewer feel on edge. The sound and color effectively help create this suspense. As he hides behind a thick redwood tree, the foxes continue their ceremony believing that nobody is watching them. But the viewer holds their breath every time the foxes come to an immediate halt when they hear a noise and feel they're being watched; but the boy successfully hides behind the tree once again. The boy manages to hide only a handful of times during the foxes' wedding procession before he is suddenly caught. And as the saying goes, "curiosity killed the cat!" On a deeper level, this is saying is exactly what Kurosawa's message is.Here, Kurosawa is arguing that although knowledge is important for human survival, nature is something that we shouldn't be disrupting. The disruption of nature can result in tragic consequences for humans. In the episode, the boy represents mankind. Essentially, all the boy did is look at the foxes. But Kurosawa is also saying that human presence in nature is enough to change it. Animals do not act the same when humans are around. Furthermore, the boy's curiosity manifests the recent human effort to conquer the environment and manipulate everything it has to offer for self-interest and personal gain. My favorite episode is titled, "The Tunnel". It opens up with a Japanese army commander walking through a dark tunnel. The mood continues to be suspenseful as the man is surprised by a furious dog barking angrily at him. As the episode continues, the man is then surprised by another army man?but this man is a dead. His face is painted completely and I must say, very frighteningly. The dead army man struggles to admit that he has died in combat. After a symbolic conversation with the commander, he is convinced that he must leave the real world and continue into the afterlife along with an enormous group of army men who were stuck in the same place too. Both of these dreams manifest a warning to mankind. The relationship we have with the environment is one we need to care for with great patience and respect. But as depicted in various of the dreams, man only continues to take steps closer to their death as we find new ways to ignore nature's warning and manipulate it to our advantage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making small time jump (which will be covered in time) in the study of the films of Kurosawa, we fall into one of his already colored films. Indeed very motley, perhaps one of the first compilations of short films sampled together. Naturally the film has complete effect directed far into the future of humanity, revealed by the last dream that is presented to us.Through dreamy and innocent world of young children, wandering young man, all the way to the wise centenarian; through perpetual motion of life resembling river, the gaze of man encounters with the people around him. He remains defenseless and fragile - what his nature is in fact - but loving enough to think about others, nature and the future generations.Through the black and white mountains, enchanting forests, paintings of van Gogh (my most favorite painter), the village of mills, and to the horrors of past wars and accidents with nuclear energy, the most pressing environmental issues of post-modernity, dreams tell us the story of a man who may have billions of faces, who at some point may become presumptuous and start to live at the expense of others. The wise old man asks us - how smart scientists are when they can not understand the heart of nature? With their discoveries and creations they cloud the thinking of the people, which pollutes not only nature but also their hearts.So dreams have a strong message from the director, and are his call to humility and listening to the harmony of the universe, because it brings us peace, quietness, kindness and love. And the man does not need nothing else. A story told to us by the sensitive father of cinema.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paintings in motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his last five movies, Kurosawa used all of his abilities as a painter to carefully create and place shots (many of his paintings that were later turned into the scenes of his movies can be easily found online). Dreams is the best example of merging the two artistic mediums; the shots in this movie are very long and move very, very slow - almost like a painting. It sets the mood for an extremely serene film. The dreams he had in real life made their way onto the screen.The eight dreams are as follows:Sunshine Through the Rain: This short dream follows a young boy who witnesses the foxes' (kitsune) wedding procession on the day when both sunshine and rain occur. It ends abruptly, like real life dreams do, but with a gorgeous shot of a rainbow over a huge grassy field.The Peach Orchard: Most of the stories are environmentally themed, and so is this one. It also has themes of folklore, mythology and tradition. It's a very sweet and memorable dream, featuring the same boy as in the first segment.The Blizzard: This one is simply too boring for the most part. Again we have the theme of weather, this time it's the snowy blizzard representing tough times in life and how we must persevere to get through them. Mieko Harada's (most known as lady Kaede from Ran) performance as the Snow Fairy is good, but this story was more interesting in Kobayashi's Kwaidan.The Tunnel: The first segment of those dealing with anti-war messages. Like the segment that preceded it, The Tunnel is too slow for its own good, but manages to be creepy and memorable, and even suspenseful.Crows: Kurosawa's homage to Vincent van Gogh, who is played by Martin Scorsese of all people. This segment, same as the last three, feature a passersby character who's probably supposed to be Kurosawa himself. Crows is a dream with some gorgeous shots, most of which are replicas of actual van Gogh paintings.Mount Fuji in Red: The first of the two stories dealing with Kurosawa's nuclear paranoia. This one is most memorable for its beginning shot in threatening shades of red, and another abrupt ending.The Weeping Demon: This is the worst of the segments, for being too depressing, way too long, and way too visually uninteresting. The lack of colors doesn't mean that the segment shouldn't be shot in a better way.Village of the Watermills: This segment is a complete opposite of the previous one, both in the terms of atmosphere, story and quality. It is by far the best of the segments, showing Kurosawa's ultimate hopeful dream and ending with that wonderfully catchy funeral procession song by Shinichiro Ikebe, which is one of my favorite movie soundtracks. It's a beautiful story.Other dreams that didn't make the cut are one that involved people flying through the air, another that involved Buddhist priests protesting temple taxes, and the third, which focused on newscasters talking about a breakout of world peace.I wonder why this movie is not more famous, judging by its visual style. Each of the short stories has a remarkable final shot and they're all in contrast. Some of them are unsettling nightmares, others are pleasant and colorful little dreams, and some are so slow-paced that they really test your patience. It's a very slow but beautiful film, somewhat meditative. The final dream is by far the best one - it just makes me really happy. And yes, Funeral procession by Shinichiro Ikebe is the most lovely piece of music composed for a Kurosawa film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another achievement from Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa was perhaps the single greatest film director in more objective terms (i.e. in terms of influence over other directors plus some other factors) and this is his final film. Showing all his virtuosity in directing, Kurosawa made a film about dreams and is a film of dreamlike quality. It is not as avant-garde and "crazy" as Tarkosvky's Zerkalo or Norstein's Tale of Tales. Instead it shows dreams as narrative in a typical Kurosawa fashion: the rational way (Kurosawa's way) of narrating irrational (i.e. dream like) events. It is a very artistic film and shows Kurosawa's admiration of painting and his expert use of colors is a product of the fact that his artistic career began in painting before turning to film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Akira Kurosawa in a poetic moment of his career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to explain how "Dreams" really works. It is not a common film that we see every day - its unique nature and composition as well as how it is constructed may seem a little difficult for some to watch and understand. Dreams is the most different film Kurosawa has made in his whole career.The film is divided in eight episodes - all of them regarding to dreams that Kurosawa had in many moments of his life. The most interesting aspect of it is how the dreams are organized. It starts with two episodes regarding childhood, then regarding the fears of adult life (passing though the war and the nuclear nightmare) until finally we meet the old age - the last episode in which an old man tells his vision of the world to a young man. Akira Kurosawa showed true creativity and technique to make this superb film. The scenes are beautifully shot and Kurosawa has never made such an astounding photography before. It is a real world inside a man's dream.Probably his most poetic film after Ikiru(1952). Dreams may not be one of his greatest masterpieces, but it is sure worth watching and an example of Kurosawa's brilliant imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting and visually stunning personal film from an acclaimed master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Akira Kurosawa: Dreams" Written and Directed by: Akira Kurosawa Japan1990 * * * 1/2I haven't seen this film for many years. I saw it theatrically, during it's 1990 release and was impressed at the time.I've seen a number of other significant Kurosawa films and am aware of his stature and influence in cinema history. This is a visually brilliant, imaginative and interesting film, a collection of eight dreams of Kurosawa. I found the film to be beautiful and meditative.Critics were divided on this 28th and personal film, in the long and uneven career of acclaimed filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. All eight dreams are visually stunning and imaginatively created. The film as a whole, has been criticized by some critics as sentimental and preachy. The last three dreams concern the destruction of man and nature by human made nuclear radiation accidents and our over reliance on technology and convenience. Let's look at Kurosawa, when he made this film. This man is 80 year old and has made some very significant, well praised and influential films during his lifetime, such as "The Seven Samurai" and "Ran". "Dreams", was the next film, made by Kurosawa, five years after the highly acclaimed film "Ran". So it was obvious to make comparisons between the themes and styles of the two films. Kurosawa once tried to commit suicide, which, of course, is a classic tale of many of the great artists of human history, who sometimes bordered on insanity. When I first saw this film. I was impressed by it's visual beauty and imagination. Some of the tone of some of the dreams of the film, some critics found reason to disfavor. The Japanese are known for being a spiritual and nature orientated culture and religion (Shinto and Buddhist). "The Tunnel", "Fuji in Red", "The Weeping Demon" and "Watermill Village" are the final four dreams of the film and the ones which show signs of being preachy. The earlier dreams, showing youth, can be called sentimental. The concept of the film was misunderstood and under-appreciated by some serious film critics, including Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader, a film critic I have held in high esteem for some years. Two of the dreams are about a classic and recurring Japanese theme since the 1950's: the dangers of man made nuclear radiation accidents. I especially liked the peaceful, nature, spiritual ending of the film. Kurosawa made two more films after this and died in 1997.Overall, this visually brilliant and imaginative film, made by a legendary master influential filmmaker, does have some unfortunate weaknesses: The concept of portraying one's dreams, no matter how well visually realized, is a highly personal subject and makes for a slightly dull subject, for a two hour long feature film, critics included. It's a little sentimental and preachy, but in a manner, I didn't have a problem with. Great concepts, excellent technique and execution, by an acknowledged film making master, but a film entirely based on someone's dreams and from the perspective of an 80 year old filmmaker, is not really the best combination, in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical and meaningful dream sequences...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 2/14/2009, 7 out of 10(Dir-Akira Kurosawa): Magical and meaningful dream sequences encompass this movie(8 to be exact) from Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. The dreams appear to start coming from a child and then grow into dreams from an adult character that is probably the director himself. Sometimes the dreams appear to have no particular meaning while others have definite points about things like war and nuclear power. Although some were hard to understand for an American, they were all captivating and kept your attention. This was probably one of his most personal films where his character is primarily talked to by other characters in his dreams. He was able to get assistance from some people who have followed his career and admired his work like Martin Scorsese, who plays Vincent Van Gogh in one clip and the ILM(Industrial LIght &amp; Magic) group helmed by George Lucas -- who do the special effects. All in all, though, this is pure Kurosawa and encompasses his magical approach to movies from a Japanese perspective. It's always nice to see films from other countries' points of view and this is no exception and is portrayed beautifully, like a painting by a longtime filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not everyone will appreciate this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreams is essentially eight separate short films, which all narrate the primary subject: man and his relationship with his environment. It is a film not everybody will appreciate (especially in the West). The reason why not everyone will appreciate this film is that most people have become spoiled.We live in an incredibly fast-paced society (hustle and bustle if you will). We are the MTV generation that wants everything NOW - if you don't believe me, why do you think we have so many people claiming they have ADD; I wonder how many of those people have actually been diagnosed - In the East, however, where Dreams was born, it's not about the finished product, or if we have arrived yet; it's all about process and duration; it's about spanning time with a community or individual; acting as a fly on the wall and simply just observing. Dreams as seen through most western eyes, will seem slow; but it's really not (there's a lot going on). A lot of the dreams you'll see are rather fragmented and incomplete, creating a very mystical quality so that audiences can create their own interpretation as to what's being said.Sometimes the dreams will be frustrating and dangerous, other times the dreams will be optimistic and adventurous?but overall, I believe Kurosawa is using these dreams as a metaphor for particular emotions that we all experience. So rather than trying to analytically break down what each dream means, think to yourself, "What emotion am I feeling while watching these images on screen." And if you do that and are able to label that emotion and dwell in it temporarily, I think you'll have a rather pleasant experience with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artist's impressionistic view on major issues of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This set of short films are undeniably beautiful, meant, I am sure, to leave aesthetic impressions rather than to narrate: a boy's sense of treading on the forbidden and mystical; of the sadness and yearning in trying to rescue the lovely spirit of a single surviving, pink- blossomed sapling of a destroyed peach orchard; of survival from a sleeping death at the hands of an icy spirit in a mountain blizzard; of the haunted guilt of a commander of a decimated platoon; of the thrill of delving into the brilliant-hued world of Vincent Van Gogh; of the horror, despair, and guilt of humanity suffering catastrophe from its own technological hubris; of the hell that results from a nuclear holocaust; and the gentle delight of encountering a tranquil community living in harmony with nature. Kurosawa is a master at conveying these feelings. I must say, though, an artist's less than expert commentary on major issues like war and harmony with nature only appeal at an aesthetic level, but are unfortunately a bit dissatisfying and even a little irksome due to a shallow understanding of the issues. It is a rather common artist's theme to criticize technological hubris without offering better insights into how society can otherwise solve its complex problems of economics, social inequality, and governance at large scales. Kurosawa's last dream of the watermill village is a indeed a dream: a static little community in a congenial climate where the simple mechanical technology of the watermills (what are they used for?) is acceptable but not anything more complex than that. When the old man criticizes "scientists" for coming up with things that people don't need, this reveals Kurosawa's unfortunate ignorance about what science is, which is the study of nature, and that scientists are involved in inquiry and discovery, not in inventing things. It is a bit contradictory to talk about living in harmony with nature and then to criticize scientists. Scientists are constantly advancing our understanding of nature and the universe: what is the nature of particles versus gravity? how does carbon cycle through the Earth system? how do ecosystems sustain themselves? how did the planets originate? It is the engineers and businessmen (and politicians) who then try to take the discoveries of scientists to make applications that may or may not be for the good of humanity, like turning understanding of particle physics into nuclear bombs, rather than into understanding of the origins of the universe. Kurosawa's lack of distinction between scientists and engineers is a misconception held by a lot of people, even engineers, who sometimes think they are doing "science." So, let's clarify the distinction. Also, the old man's simplistic assessment of humans' minimal physical needs denies that there are also human intellectual needs that more advanced technologies often fulfill, like making films in color with good cameras and lenses and projecting them for full visual glory. These complaints aside, Kurosawa's dream films are master aesthetic impressions, but when artists seek to comment on scientific and political issues, it would be better if they focused on the personal and emotional, unless they can first gain enough expertise to address the technical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but not truly a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see dreams they often seem to be very logical. Everything that happens to you or the characters you follow seem to have some kind of a logic, but when you wake up the images that are left to linger in the back of your mind begin to turn rather obscure and the logic of the story begins to shatter as you try to tell what exactly was the tale you just saw. And that seems to be the basis for Akira Kurosawa's "Dreams".Dreams is a film compiled from several segments, that have seemingly no relation to each other. There's a story of a boy, who spies upon a wedding ceremony of the foxes, who get angry and demand retribution. In one tale we see apocalyptic vision of one future, in which people have mutated into trolls, whom scream out their pain. We also see a painter, who travels inside the works of Vincent Van Gogh and in the end we see a story, that ponders if we truly need the advancements of technology in order to be content with our lives.So basically what "Dreams" is all about is the dreams, fears, hopes and behaviour of humans. It warns us to not to rely on machinery that much. It tells us to dream, as dreams are powerful and it tells that hopes might come true, if you truly want them to.Dreams is not easy film to watch, as it is rather fragmented in narration, nor is it truly a masterpiece, but it is an interesting and cleverly told musing about the society we live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK , all together now....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is not particularly my type of film. i prefer entire stories to vignettes. that said i would comment that most of these 'dreams' would serve as a very strong presence in a larger film. in their own right they are compelling. what comes out strongly in these episodes is an aspect of Japanese culture that westerners are liable to cringe from, laugh at, or just not get at all. i am certainly in that category as i can look at Japanese culture, and as much as i love Japanese cinema, scoff at the ant-like antics. what kind of people are these, i ask? where is there independence? individuality? of course, this line of questioning misses the point that Japanese culture has a strong flavor of social cohesion that we in the west are taken aback by. my point here is that in some of these 'dreams' kurosawa captures this ritualistic social effort with telling beauty. it is impossible not to be quite taken with the fox's wedding procession, the platoon of the dead, and the funeral march. wonderful scenes whether we quite grasp their significance or not. if you like busby berkeley then you should see this film; it offers busby taken to a much higher level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considering the director's intent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In attempting to understand Dreams, one must focus on the similarities between each story to realize the deeper meaning of the film. I noticed that each dream contained the subject of death. I believe that Akira Kurosawa uses this theme of death to explore its meaning as well as its relation to the sustenance of life. The intent of this film is to address the role of death from a cultural standpoint, as well as to show a connection between the environment and spiritual elements associated with it. Kurosawa shows us in his nightmare sequences that by destroying the environment, we are putting the future of humankind at risk. Both the Mount Fuji and Demon segments serve as a warning to industrialism and the manufacturing of nuclear power. The Watermills dream provides a counterpoint by showing us an example of a society in complete harmony with nature. The thing that strikes me about Akira Kurosawa's directing style is his sense of pacing. He provides the viewer with enough time to focus on the detail of the picture he chooses to present. I think the most precious example of this appears in The Blizzard. The sequence is filmed at slightly slower camera speed which allows the viewer experience the agony of the mountain men in greater proportions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sensei was nearing the end of his career here but he still was great.8 short stories follow and everyman as he touches on all aspects of life.And some of these dreams were nightmares.In the Van Gogh bit, they did a great job of taking the Dutch, one-eared wonder's paintings and turning them into backgrounds. Martin Scorsese cameos as Van Gogh. Try to imagine Van Gogh as a New Yorker.The nuclear explosion dream was the nightmare. Seeing fleeing millions made it look like a Godzilla flick until you realize there's no escape from the fire. It said technology is now in too much control. The scared kids made it even more sad.The next dream was surviving the holocaust. Late Japanese comedian Chosuke Ikariya plays a mutant giving the warnings.I lived in Japan for years.

		<fullReview>(SPOILERS) After seeing this film I was in awe. To tell the truth this film gives me flashbacks of when I had a yumi as a little kid. It is funny, I had these dreams in a row like Akira Kurosawa. It reminded me of them. It was like watching life how it goes by and fades away.I was in a daze after watching this film especially after seeing where he dreams of himself as a kid walking towards the rainbow or the peach tree spirits where you see him watching their ritual to show him the peach trees that use to grow there until they were cut down.The message of the story has to be the damage we are inflicting on nature, how we destroy and make things worse, I think we should really think about our actions and not just do anything for the sake of it. If you care for the environment or even if you want to see the effects of needless destruction and how tormented we could be, watch this film.It still leaves me in awe.This to me is a great film. One of the greatest. I look forward to watching "Ran".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yume (Dreams): Why Kurosawa is considered a master director and story teller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A visual essay which spans the arc (alluded to by the rainbow symbolism?) of childhood's innocence and fears to adult cynicism and desperation, Yume nevertheless ends on a note of hope and optimism. Along the way, we are introduced to the cultural, artistic and technological influences of contemporary life. While it is difficult to choose any particular episode in this collection as a favourite, I would have to pick "Sunshine through the Rain" and "The Tunnel" as the 2 dreams that I consider to Tobe the most memorable - both in terms of content as well as intent. I also feel that these two dreams hold the central theme of the film together. In "Sunshine through the Rain" a young boy realizes that actions have consequences.The boy gives in to temptation by disobeying his mother. In the aftermath of this indiscretion, he is given an option - beg for forgiveness to avoid death. "The Tunnel" is an excellent study in guilt - the consequence of a man's actions. While the boy in "Sunshine" is given an opportunity to make amends for his actions, no such option is available, nor will ever be, for the survivor in "The Tunnel". He has to live, forever,with guilt knowing that he was responsible for the death of his platoon. His rationalization and justification of his actions may have been sufficient for the dead men but his own guilt - symbolized by the tank-dog - knows that he knew that he was sending the men to their death and that he will never be able to convince himself the way he was able to convince his men. He would never be able to undo the damage he had done. In essence, the thread that runs though the film is one of actions and consequences. "Windmill Village" ends the essay on an upbeat note that it is possible to aspire to a better life in spite of ourselves. "The Blizzard" reminds us to not give in or give up when all the odds are stacked against us. We can be strong and aspire to a better life if we want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a lot to say about this movie. It is a must see!!!!!! In the synopsis about this movie on IMDb they write "The Blizzard': a team of mountaineers are saved from a blizzard by spiritual intervention." However, in my viewing it was the mountaineers who were about to give up on finding their camp and fell asleep in the blizzard giving up on their trek. And the spiritual lady was death coming to take them. It was the leader of the mountaineers who went and woke them to tell them to try and make it a little more. They didn't give up. If they had the lady of death would have taken them. I need to watch it again to make sure but that is what i got out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eight short stories inspired by the dreams of Akira Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of using a feature-length plot as its format, Akrira Kurosawa's Dreams is divided into eight short stories inspired by the dreams of Akira Kurosawa (hence the title). The beautifully filmed sequences range from enchanting (the touching story of a boy and his family's peach trees) to eerie (a military officer's encounter with his dead soldiers) and just plain strange (a museum-goer roams around in Van Gogh paintings). Although most of the shorts are unrelated, the common themes are: the human costs of war, the dangers of nuclear energy, and other environmental issues. Some of the dialogue and themes might seem trite and artificial at times, but because the stories are based on dreams and aren't intended to be realistic, this didn't bother me at all. In summary I'd like to say that Akira Kurosawa's Dreams is a greater achievement in art than most Hollywood films could ever hope (or, uh, dream) to be. Film lovers and especially art lovers will thoroughly enjoy this distinctly Japanese film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>can you imagine a movie made from a million pictures ? this is Kurosawa's Dreams - a suite of small flicks, every each of them made with skill and a drop of genius. the pictures succeeds one after another and they are taking you into Kurosawa's mind, not to just watch, but to live the dreams together with him. the first ones will really catch you, but the last flicks seems to be appealing only for the real Kurosawa's fans, accustomed with his work. the walk thru van gogh's paintings I thing that is really the brilliant part. do you remember vincent ward's "what dreams may come"? i'm sure it was inspired from this movie, but both of them worth watching. On the other hand, if you saw already wim wenders's "hummel uber berlin", you should have the sensation that kurosawa is using also other sources of inspiration beside his own genius...that's why i'm giving only 9 out of 10...or maybe it is just my impression...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Responsible dreamer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurosawa was quite a dreamer. I think either Kurosawa saw these dreams while he was awake or I am such a big loser that I can't even dream properly. All I could dream in last 29 and half years are question papers, dropping ink pots, friends and foes. Although I did dream of Beatles and Ghalib but Beatles were too busy behind the backstage and Ghalib was just passing by. I just couldn't dream having a conversation with Van Gogh about his chopped ear and walking inside the frames of the paintings he painted in Arles, never dreamt of nuclear disasters and discussed how wrong are we to worship scientists who have given us nuclear science, never dreamt of a village which lives on 'Gandhian' philosophy and so people don't need electricity and live for more than a hundred years. Probably I didn't concentrate enough on the social problems like Kurosawa.Movie has 8 dreams/nightmares absolutely different from each other. Stories are short and interesting. I didn't find any of them pointless or boring. I liked something or the other and kept looking at the screen. My favorite is 'The Tunnel'. It's a very weird nightmare and the way it has been shot is more than just camera movements and color combinations. 'The blizzard' is a masterpiece for the special effect genre. 'The crow' is a little childish but it's a treat watching Scorsese as Gogh talking about his place in the society as painter. 'Mount Fiji in Red' and 'The Village of Watermills' is thought provoking and a little preachy. Actors have done excellent work in the 'The Weeping Demon'. 'Sunshine through the rain' and 'the peach orchard' is childish but interesting. It's a collector's film. Its like 'The Beatles/Live at BBC' you buy it only if you know who The Beatles are. I must say Kurosawa was quite a responsible dreamer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing visual movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it has dialogue, I would put this movie in the same category as the Qatsi series. Astoundingly beautiful scenes and imagery throughout the film, though there are some slow parts, leave a viewer with an invigorating feeling upon completion.The peach orchard scene is wonderful, and the fact that the boy brings back the orchard with his love and honesty is a very touching addition. The beautiful scene that is painted of the orchard makes one understand why the boy would miss it.The scene of the mountain-men is odd, but fits well into the film. The fact that their determination could only carry them so far seems to hint at the incomplete nature of human beings, and at something bigger. The snow comes to visit the mountain men's leader, like a messenger and a savior, making him realize that he did not have to give up, and releasing the men from the death grip of the endless storm.The tunnel scene was quite chilling, but also quite real. Although it can so very easily be a figment of the commander's imagination, and the shame he felt for being responsible for the loss of the third platoon, it is much more than that. A call from beyond the grave reaches out, and both parties are satisfied by the commander's honesty. The pain he must have felt for being left behind and not dying with his men must have been excruciating, and it manifested itself in the tunnel. Although they will never forget, the soldiers and the commander can rest easy once more.The final windmill scene is almost surreal. Heaven on earth seems to be what the wanderer has stumbled upon. A place where life is about living, and every part of life, including death, is important and celebrated. Although he is not a villager, the wanderer leaves a flower on the grave of his long dead and buried fellow traveler, somehow connecting him to the village and to the past. Although it is hard to believe that one would ever want to leave such a place behind, perhaps the wanderer can take his experience elsewhere and convey its simple message.This is an amazing movie, and if you have not seen it and just read the spoilers, don't worry. It will touch you in a way that is quite inexplicable. It is in fact a series of dreams, and after watching it you might feel as if they were your own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is divided into eight short films from Kurosawa's own dreams. Basically you don't really have to try to understand what is going on because no one can really understand what our dreams mean. However, this could have been the phsychology of Kurosawa's own state of mind. Even though it's not suppose to have any sort of meaning, there are still symbols that show some message in each of the films. A lot of the symbols have to do with ancient Japanese deity icons. The human puppets, the man eating devils, the fox, etc. I'm not Japanese so I can't really relate to what it all means, but I think the film would be more enjoyable if you have a background in these ancient mythologies. Some of the films in the end relates to the Hiroshima bombing where the volcano is exploding and the after effects of the A-Bomb. The last piece definitely sums everything up and tells us of Kurosawa's point of view on life. "we are part of nature". Aside from the message I agree with everyone else that this film has excellent cinematography and is definitely enjoyable visually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A testament to a genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***********Spoiler Warning*************Kurosawa's movies, despite the language and cultural barriers, managed to come through with stories that seemed to have an almost universal appeal, and often were reused in contemporary Hollywood movies. (The Hidden Fortress for Star Wars, The Seven Samurai for the Magnificent Seven, Last Man Standing, and a few others.)Dreams is not his last movie, but was his last major release. Instead of a conventional story we instead get a series of vignettes, small snapshots of stories. (I've never found out if they were really based on his own dreams or not, I'd like to think they are.) His effect this time is the mood and feeling the pieces evoke. The range is wide, with stories about destruction from nuclear energy/war mingling with peaceful sojourns through Van Gogh's paintings. The material is surprisingly light on special effects and actual violence, as most of his movies were, but raises an impressive imagery nonetheless. Kurosawa just simply knew how to make movies, as opposed to modern films that incorporate a dream element and overdose on the gimmicks. The most unsettling piece to me was a man wandering through a wasteland encountering mutants and monsters, and instead of running he talks to them, but in the end still encounters their darkness. There is a theme of back to nature and living in harmony that recurs throughout and comes to a head in the final segment about the people living on the river. If this piece is looked at not as a environmental or political statement but as still a part of a dreamworld then it makes sense. Kurosawa was bringing forth the desire many people have, of peace and happiness and moving on from the turmoil in our lives. In that regard it makes a fitting set piece to a wonderful career and one of the greatest directors that ever existed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Haunting as a Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I was a little bored by it in places, though I was impressed by its stunning beauty. But boy, does it ever grow on you! I've seen "Dreams" a number of times now, and I often think of it in between viewings. It haunts me like a dream, and like most dreams, parts of it are still a bit boring--which I take to be Kurosawa's point in including them. Also, parts of the movie can be confusing to those not familiar with Japanese traditions. The doll/peach tree sequence I found absolutely bizarre until I asked my Japanese secretary about it after loaning her the tape. "Doll Day" is a big day for Japanese girls, and the segment took on new significance for me when I learned that this was more than just a gorgeous flight of the imagination.Another thing about "Dreams" is the way different people respond to it. My wife also likes the film, but she is partial to segments that are not always among my favorites. For example, she absolutely loves the mountain climbers in the snowstorm, which I found boring the first couple of times I saw it. (Now, I think I'm beginning to get it, though.)The first and last sections of the movie are my favorites. If you don't like the fox wedding in the first scene, then don't bother with the rest of the movie. It takes my breath away every time I see it. And the water imagery coupled with the funeral procession in the final scene is simply beyond words.Akira Kurosawa's "Dreams" is one my favorite movies. (I dream of the day the DVD comes out!)</fullReview>

At least to me, they represent reflections on life and consciousness of progressive insight made by Kurosawa as he grew.After you watch this movie, you may get the feeling that you have been presented with a gift of great value: wisdom painfully gained over the years. Regardless of whether the wisdom is correct or not, we don't get such gifts every day. This movie is extremely valuable in this regard.I think this movie's wisdom reflects on our human qualities. Some of the dreams don't only make you think, they make you experience a wide range of very strong emotions. It is an overwhelmingly moving film.The presentation is perfect.

		<fullReview>As usual, Akira Kurosawa had made a movie into an art work, colorful and beautiful, just like a painting. Note that the colors was not only bright colors but gloomy colors as well. I will refer this movie as a painting, and the painter was Akira Kurosawa.We may not understand well about this movie, but after all it was a dream, which was well described in the title of the movie. Who can understand about dreams? Even his/her own dreams. Maybe Kurosawa have dreamed about fairies and spirits, which was a lot in the movie. Maybe Akira was trying to capture dreams and hopes and also dissappointment by those spirits. Hope as a child was entertained by the spirits of peach trees or dissappointment and regrets that was felt by an army commander seeing his dead platoon got back from the dead.So, Akira Kurosawa was just painting his dreams and we should just enjoy his painting without any questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was Kurasawa's final great film. Based, in part, on dreams he had had and in larger part, on his creative genius. Let me say this: as one who reads each and every comment, I was most impressed that everyone who commented here had something good to say. Sure, many people were not familiar with 'kitsune (fox)' shapeshifter myths in Japanese culture, some less aware of the seasonal doll dances, funeral practices, etc., but everyone got something to take home with them. I don't like all the sequences either but even the ones I disliked are good and the ones I like are superb. Disjointed? What's this film about? Too self-absorbed? Too "artsy?" Well, c'mon. What are dreams about? Dreams by their very nature are self-absorbed and disjointed. When the filters by which we structure reason and make sense out of our world are put off-line, our prefrontal cotex disconnects and the active visual regions and perceptual nodules kick-in. Dreams are dreamy. Why can't we accept this? There are no teenagers screaming because some gory dude in a ski mask is going to slice and dice them, no chase with people shooting at each other; just dreamy sequences based on themes most of us know. Delightful enough for me, reading the comments here, everyone found something to please them. Let the critics trying to fit these sequences of exquisite images and visually pleasing colors into some western box of plots and storylines go pick beans. I have seen nearly every one of Kurasawa's films, from Sanjiro to Yume and never been disappointed. Obviously, the others reviewing this film here share this view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film will one day be the cinematic equivilant of Beethovans Ninth Symphony. Both were autumnal works created by great masters late in there careers. Beethovans symphony was hardly well recieved by critics, who found the piece baffeling. Beethovan responded in saying that it was for "Future Generations". Indeed, it is now viewed as one of the greatest symphonic works of all time. "Dreams" was not well recieved when it was released. No one could deny that at 81, Kurasowa was still ambitiouse and imaginitive. Yet most critics found the work to be rambling and self indulgent. I for one think that this film is one of Kurasowas best films, and one of the best films ever made. And I know I'm not alone in this assessment. I know many people who've seen this film (including my father) who see the film for the masterpiece that it is. When I went to film school, I found many young Cineast's who share this viewpoint. Perhaps comparing it to Beethovan's Ninth may seem a bit percousiouse, but I do think in time this film will be recognized as a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another example of Kurosawa's ability to make cinema that is truly art. Although there is no plot or storyline which runs throughout, there is the essential theme of humanity and nature, which is illustrated in various fashions in each piece. Each "dream" can be viewed on its own merits, though the theme is best understood when viewed as a whole and in sequence. Although humans struggle with nature throughout each dream, the last piece offers a possibility of harmony within it, that we don't necessarily have to try so hard to tame it, destroy it, or even survive it.The elegance of the film is that it is left to the viewer to understand his message, as Kurosawa never tries to explain himself. And it is a stunningly beautiful film in its direction and cinematography. Kurosawa is extraordinarily patient (even for him) with pans and cuts, often letting the scene fully be absorbed before changing it.This might be a difficult film for people who like Hollywood blockbusters, but I would still recommend it to them just to demonstrate what can be done with the medium, and the dialogue is minimal, so people who don't like to "read" when watching foreign films might not be turned off by the language barrier.Highly recommended, even for those who would never seek out such work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kurosawa's film, DREAMS, though extremely personal seems to draw on distinctly human emotions to create a fantastic world where the characters surpass all reality and live as symbols for greater meaning and truths about human nature. It's structure is amazing. Even if you find a particular segment of the movie too artsy, each piece is fairly short and the viewer can get lost in the visual images rather than consider the entire piece a waste.I think if you give this film a shot, no matter what your film viewing background may be, you will come to see the mastery of symbolism and the amazing cinematography that Kurosawa is known for world-wide.It is a feast for the eyes and a cup of water for the mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only all of us could transcribe and portray dreams as skillfully as Kurosawa did. Perhaps this would lead to more interesting films than typical Hollywood formulae provide for.Although this film may be somewhat difficult for most Westerners, it is well worth seeing, just for the sake of observing another cultural perspective. It bears careful watching, even repeatedly.It'd be a good idea to see it on the big screen, rather than a video rental, because of the lushness of detail and rather monumental scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there are so many things i love about this movie. One of them is the simplicity of each story. I still do not understand all of them, but each leaves me with different thoughts and ideas. Each story is quite different from the others, except for the central character, who appears in many stories in a sort of an observer. what is the connection between each seemingly independent story? and why does the main character feel like he is in third person?

		<shortDescription>"...Forget asteroids, Armageddon will happen as Kurosawa envisioned it."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one film chock full of unforgettable scenes. From the very first story, "Sunshine Through the Rain," Kurosawa's technique is quite visible. The whole film is letterboxed, which is especially necessary in "The Tunnel," when one shot shows an army commander and a private at opposite ends of the screen.It's hard to comment on this movie without commenting on all eight dreams. (It's even harder to do this in sequence.) "Sunshine Through the Rain" offered a glimpse into Japanese myth, and the images included were very stunning: the wedding procession through the forest, the little boy in the field of flowers, etc. This was one of my favorites in the film, the other being "Mount Fuji in Red." Forget asteroids and Bruce Willis, Armageddon will happen like Kurosawa envisioned it: atomic reactors exploding, an entire mountain lighting up like a Christmas tree, and thousands of people running for their lives. That's an apocalyptic vision for ya."The Peach Orchard" is a tearjerker, I'll warn you right now. When the boy (apparently the same actor as in "Sunshine Through the Rain") watches the orchard sprout around him, I was sniffling into a kleenex!"The Tunnel" is another of my favorites, just because of the fact that the commander gets all the signs he needs not to enter that tunnel (it's the Japanese equivalent of Cerberus, for cryin' out loud!), and yet in he goes anyway, only to reach the other side and find... Well, I'll let you see for yourself."The Weeping Demon" was interesting not only for its own mythology, but for the backgrounds shown. (Giant dandelions? Hmm... I wonder if the creators of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Secret of the Ooze" were more cultured than they appeared to be!) All of these stories had their own distinct style, but Kurosawa's imagination was the common thread uniting them all. A must see for Kurosawa fans and Japanese mythology enthusiasts alike. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fresh Movie Experience: "DREAMS" is a Music-like Movie, depicting Fear arising from Violating the Forbidden, Guilt, Admiration of Beauty, and the Union of Death and Happiness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"DREAMS"(Yume) is a special film to me. When I saw this film for the first time, it seemed to me rather strange. When I saw it for the second time, I was fascinated by its fantasies and beauty. And when I saw it for the third time, I was choked with tears.I know "DREAMS" is apt to be misunderstood mainly because Kurosawa has concentrated his efforts in faithfully reproducing his treasured dreams, not in creating a story from the dreams. The film consists of eight vignettes. Some of the vignettes contain elements* of Japanese folktales or myths. But because they appear in the vignettes without explanation, the viewer may be puzzled at first. This shows that "DREAMS" is a reproduction of dreams, unlike ordinary feature films. Kurosawa seemingly makes no attempt to tell a story or to narrate a message, rather, his purpose is to reproduce his dreams. Because Kurosawa has given priority to telling his own dreams, any apparent message we find in "DREAMS" should be considered as something projected onto his dreams as a reflection of his experiences, rather than as a direct message.Paradoxical as it may sound, faithfully reproducing dreams can allow us to come closer to TRUTH than more orthodox approaches. I suppose Kurosawa made "DREAMS" with such an intent. And what he has succeeded in producing through this approach seems to be depiction of fear arising from violating the forbidden, guilt, admiration of beauty, and the union of death and happiness.Because Kurosawa has taken such an approach, those who expect an immediate message from this film may at first be disappointed. To such people I would say, "Forget messages. Instead, enjoy the vicarious excitement and wonder of Kurosawa's dreams." I myself have been fascinated by "DREAMS" without seeking messages.For instance, I was greatly moved at the very end of "DREAMS" - the last scene of "Village of the Watermills." What moved me was not simply what the centenarian said, but that everything was integrated - the old man's personality, his existence and the existence of the village as embodiments of an ideal life, the idea of a happy funeral, the idyllic air of the village, the beautiful flow of the river, the movement of the water mills, the sound of the water, the sweet music evocative of personal memories.... Also the image of the flowing river reminded me of a thirteenth-century Japanese writer's words, which Kurosawa must also have had in mind when he filmed the scene: "The flow of the river is ceaseless and its water is never the same. The bubbles that float in the pools, now vanishing, now forming, are not of long duration: so in the world are man and his dwellings."(From Chomei Kamo-no's "Hojoki," translated by Donald Keene) The integration of all these elements overpowered me."DREAMS" is a music-like film. It looks much like a suite consisting of eight contrasting movements rather than a movie. Sensuous elements are given equal place to narration or logic. The film expresses truth projected through Kurosawa's experiences with visuals and sounds which ravish the eyes and ears."DREAMS" is not an "active" film. Each vignette opens with the same subhead in Japanese, "I saw a dream like this." It sounds as if Kurosawa were speaking to us, "Hi, dears. I had a fantastic dream. Do you want to hear about it?" How can we fault such an innocent proposal? Just as it is nonsense to criticize others' dreams, so too is it irrelevant to criticize "DREAMS." It may be true that "DREAMS" appeals primarily to those whose feelings or thoughts resonate with Kurosawa's. But so what? We can still enjoy his fantasies each in our own way unless we persist in common beliefs about the way movies should be.Well, then. Let's "listen to" the suite, not being argumentative, but just relaxing and clearing our minds, with some drinks if we like.[*note] The following are the elements in "DREAMS" seemingly derived from Japanese folktales or myths. Foxes in "SUNSHINE THROUGH THE RAIN": Foxes have spiritual powers and are capable of bewitching people by turning themselves into humans. Dolls in "THE PEACH ORCHARD": March 3 is the day of Peach Festival for girls, on which girls display a set of "hina" dolls on a tiered stand at home. The dolls are believed to save a girl when she meets a crisis by sacrificing themselves. A woman in "THE BLIZZARD...": A pale, cold, female apparition in white, called "the woman of the snow," appears on snowy nights, and often takes a man's life. A demon in "THE WEEPING DEMON": A horned demon called "oni" has an ambivalent nature; he has a benevolent face as well as a demonic one. Mount Fuji in "MOUNT FUJI IN RED": This dormant volcano has been the object of religious worship as a place where spirits and a god live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trip through Kurosawa's life and times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreams is a great, colorful masterpiece, worth watching and understanding. The first thing, most essential basic notion you must have is that Dreams is precisely about that: DREAMS.Dreams do not have any specific meaning, order, logic or message in most cases, although many of us wished they had. We sleep one third of our lives and something goes on all the time in a certain region of our brain while we do. Needless to say, the influence of the social environment, the religion, moral customs and mores of the times and the place in which we live do leak into those "trash registers" of the brain and produce an "orderly disorder" when our brain processes and "projects" the dreams on our unconscious, sleeping eyes.Having said this, I cannot really understand how many inspired or pretentiously savvy critics dared to write negative comments on this movie because of lack of sufficient message, psychological or social meaning. That showed a total lack of understanding of what the Director wanted. The strength of Dreams is in the force of its Plastic Beauty; in the representation of the unconscious desires and anxieties that, without any specific logic or order at all, come out of Kurosawa's mind. He remembers these as the most remarkable dreams he was able to recall throughout all the stages of his life.Kurosawa's purpose is to give these "Dreams" the full color and beauty of Art, bringing them out of the shadows and into Life. He does this in a way such that he shows his total control and mastery of the camera as a way of communicating this illogical neurosis, this desensitized sensibility that is contained in a dream. It is only casual that sometimes a logical message can be concluded out of one of the episodes: some kind of warning or political concern. But this is purely coincidental: We must not forget that dreams are concocted out of the daily experience of the conscious mind, which is responsible for accumulating these anxieties that are later concocted into dreams.Summarily, this is an out-of-the-ordinary movie. I would certainly consider one of the great Masterpieces of the seventh Art, and give a postume kudos to the (sadly) late Director for his skillful work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreams as Warnings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a bit of an ordeal. One is led through a series of stories that have the qualities of dreams. That is, they teach lessons, thy fly off into surrealism, the characters often can't be controlled. There is a sense of "if I wake up, this will not be true. There are several environmental warnings. Death is nearly always on the borders. This is a wonderful film because each story captivates and pulls the viewer along. There are magnificent colors, fearful images, foxes who have come to kill little boys who do wrong, one of the most incredible funeral processions imaginable. There are things coming out of the fog, appearing on the sides of mountains, coming through tunnels. I am, like most people, nurtured on Kurosawa's samurai films, based on classical themes. This is a collection of wonderful tales, each of which we can interpret ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Rendition of Dreams as they are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are eight dream sequences in the DVD. They are totally independent and do not have anything to do with each other, so each one is like a 'short story' yet they stand on their own as complete films and each one is told with the pertinent imagery, language and pace that is typical of dreaming. This is so well done that we feel at times we are either dreaming the movie or seeing a projection of someone's dreams as they happen. I do not know of any better rendition of the dream state in film, this is an extraordinary accomplishment and one of Kurosawa's greatest achievements.Yet we should also be aware that the subject of dreams is much more relevant and important within the Japanese cultural context than in ours. From an earlier date, one of their greatest literary novels is titled "As I crossed a Bridge of Dreams" (11th Century) and through the centuries to modern times it is a recurrent theme, that in the 20th century was best expressed by Yukio Mishima's main character in the tetralogy "Sea of Fertility" ,Kiyoaki Matsugae, who keeps a dream diary, which actually predicts the developments of events in the novel.Here is the List of Dreams in the film:1-A Peach Orchard 2-Mount Fuji in Red 3-The Tunnel 4-The Weeping Demon 5-The Blizzard 6-Crows 7-Sunshine through the Rain 8-The Village in the Watermills I Have not listed them in order, The first is Sunshine through the Rain, a beautiful fairy tale seeing through the eyes of a child, which is the same theme of the second, with another tale, yet both are totally different. Each one of these tales is a separate dream, and like all dreams they have their own rules that only make sense there. The cinematography is masterful even by Kurosawa standards, for all the dreams, but particularly spectacular in these first two in showing simultaneously the nature of Japan, and the traditional deities of Shinto, Japan's ancient pagan religion that preceded Buddhism and Zen, and is still part of the country's cultural core.. Crows is about a gallery visitor that actually climbs inside a Van Gogh painting and pursues Van Gogh through the fields. Martin Scorcesse plays Van Gogh beautifully, this was like a fantasy trip. The Blizzard is about a snowstorm in the mountains involving a climbing team, and is more like a short hallucination that one of the mountain climbers has for a moment, before he wakes and continues climbing.Mount Fuji in Red is the horrifying nightmare of several atomic plants that explode around the volcano, with fearsome yet beautiful impact. It is Kurasawa's commentary on atomic energy, which along with the 'genius' of Einstein has aged very badly in Contemporary culture. It is worth noting that he belongs, along with Marx and Freud, to a group of scientist philosophers from the 19th Century that really believed in progress, and the three have largely failed in 'changing the world' and have become instead clearly pass. In the age of ozone layer pollution, irreversible atomic waste, Capitalist Russia/China and Prozac, all these once grand hopes and dreams of progress have faded or evaporated altogether. The Weeping Demon is another dream that dwells in the post atomic, post modern world which has become a nightmare, and here Kurosawa goes back to the very beginning of film history to scenery reminiscent of Giuseppe De Liguoro's "L'Inferno ", a 1910 film setting for Dante's Inferno that was extremely influential in establishing the iconography, and landscapes of the hellish universe, which looks very much like the world of the Weeping Demon. The tunnel is a war story that will be particularly touching to the military minded. It is Kurosawa's commentary on war in which a captain remembers his lost platoon, and they come back from the dead, first one man, then all of them in formation to be dismissed by him one last time. The Village in the Watermills is the closing dream. It is also a tale of nature and traditional values in contrast to the modern world, deeply philosophical and beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Dreams' is not a typical Hollywood movie. Some have even said that it is too artistic. Isn't cinematography all about that? For those that want to see fights or car races, I would strongly recommend not to watch this one.The first two sequences( Sunshine through the Rain and The Peach Orchard) with A. Kurosawa as a little boy. These are related to values, traditions, myths taken from the Japanese culture. They explore themes like the freedom of taking decisions, the difference between the purity of a child and the responsibility of a grown up. The two sequences are visually pleasing.The Crows(my favorite) segment shows a young artist completely moved by the paintings of Van Gogh. This segment is about perception, evaluation, interpretation, becoming one with art.In The Crying Demon the characters seem to have been taken from Dante's Inferno. The sequence presents the disastrous effects of war. From a visual point of view, dark colors were used in order to sketch the negative attitude. The movie couldn't have had a more beautiful ending. Village of the Watermills brings back the innocent attitude from the beginning. The sequence presents the communion with nature and it celebrates the cycle of life. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece and suavity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DREAMS is the product of age, wisdom, experience, cordiality, sympathy. Hence the tangible suavity of the fancy, hence the true and inner freedom, the balance and brio that regulate the movie's shape.In Kurosawa's long career runs a stream of surrealism, of dreamy, surreal, visionary and disconcerting insight. As the director never indulged in empty, formal exercises, the surrealist side was always subordinated to defined aims, being all the more effective for this.He explored the poetry of the feverish vision. And he had an instinct for the special excitement of far?reaching borderline experiences, diligently outlined. I discern much sincerity in the creations of this cosmopolitan director.A genuine surrealism can be discovered in his movie about his dreams. Here the pace is other than in his high?voltage dramas already alluded to. Here's a place of quietness and reflection and simplicity and frugality. An ingenuity regained. There are much wisdom and spirituality in this original movie. DREAMS is perhaps one of Kurosawa's most exciting and accomplished outings.So my task is probably to recommend this highly enjoyable, exquisite, lyrical, elegiac and relaxed movie shot towards the end of Kurosawa's career.</fullReview>

If I had the power, I wouldn't have changed anything.I really appreciate its abstract nature, which is also very concrete.

		<shortDescription>An insightful and visually stunning film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, The Hidden Fortress, Ikiru, and Ran, I decided it was time to head deep within the mind of Kurosawa and experience his "Dreams" firsthand. What I got was a first class ticket to the imagination of a talented film maker.Dreams is supposed to be based off of the actual dreams of Kurosawa. The film is divided into 8 segments (Short films). Every story runs for around 15-20 minutes. Kurosawa let's us venture through the forests of Japan, the bitterness of the mountains, the color of paintings, the hustle of the city, and calm villages. This film isn't for everyone. A few sequences run rather long. Even ones that have good reason to do so seem rather drawn out. But with the completetion of each dream we feel furfilled and thirsty for information. Each story or dream leaves you with many questions and concerns. These dreams are left for you to interpret and enjoy. I did notice that there seems to be an overall theme of nature throughout all of the films.The cinematography for this film is wonderful. The angles and photography leaves you breathes. Good acting along with flawless direction brings these tales to life. The best feature of this film is the visuals. Images from this movie were burnt in my mind for days after watching it. It's definitely one of the best of Kurosawas latest films.In the end, you'll find yourself asking questions about your own dreams. An excellent film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dreams and Death" would be a more accurate title--it's a moody, mystical montage that strays never far from past or impending doom. Though not quite Kurosawa's best, "Dreams" falters only with an anti-nuclear melt-down/erupting-Mt.Fuji yarn that soon bores and confuses, enough said. (Hit the fast-forward!) The rest is stylish magic that will not soon leave your mind:A young boy must seek forgiveness, or suicide, after witnessing a wedding of foxes; another is forgiven his family's cutting of an orchard by the trees themselves, and granted a farewell vision. An aspiring artist meets the doomed Van Gogh himself in the master's own landscapes come stunningly to life. A captain, waylaid on his way home by the spirits of his wiped-out company, must issue the final order--but how do you send the snarling shade of a once-faithful bomb-dog to its rest? Another ghost lovingly seduces an exhausted mountaineer into the deadly embrace of a blizzard. . . and a lone hiker finds an almost-utopian mill village that knows no fear or sorrow for life's ultimate reward. (Witness here, if nothing else in "Dreams," one of the most extraordinary musical funeral processions ever put to film.)Superb cinematography throughout (excepting some unsteady long-shots in the orchard sequence, unexplainable and inexcusable). A grand addition to any film collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very uneven piece of cinematographic work by this alleged master of the trade, one that goes from the putrid to the sublime. The sublime being the parts mentioned in this title and the putrid, almost all what comes after--and I'm saying alleged because this is the first Kurosawa movie I see. The first, foremost, criticism that can be made of the film is that's not dreamy enough. Nowhere here you get the feeling you are being introduced to a surreal, dream-like, world. For instance, Bu?uel's Charm of the Bourgeoisie has been criticized for many things, but one thing you can say about him is that he got his dreams right in it?at least those that are ostensibly shown as so, like the one of the military officer. Kurosawa's dreams here are instead far too real, far too belonging to our own physical world. Most of its scenes are clear, well shot, and set in locations and contexts we have no problem situating somewhere in our awaken state of consciousness. Also, all characters in these dreams speak in a logical, articulate way; their dialogs are never out of the ordinary, even when they are silly, and the same may be said of the mood, the atmosphere. If they hadn't told me that this was about dreams I would have never guessed it myself.The other thing about Dreams is that it is far too preachy, sometimes it looks--and sounds?-rather like a WWF TV special. This is especially true when some badly crafted character in it rants and raves about "the stupidity of humans" and curses our "fool scientists". Such a routine becomes so annoying at the end that for once I couldn't agree more with that Hollywood producer who famously said one day that if you want to send a message, call Western or something. I'm not against ethical, ecological, political or religious messages conveyed in movies but I think they should a least come disguised in good story telling and good acting--all that by believable and well defined characters--and both things are sorely missing in Dreams. Most of the time people here are overacting and even going over the top, as it was the case with that nuclear scientist who jumps into the sea and that one--horn mutant. Bad, bad acting. (Anyway, the same kind of message have been sent to us dozens of times in the last decades and in far better films such a POTA, Omega Man, to name just two. Nothing would have been lost to the world, had this movie never been made.)There are only two episodes worth viewing here?unless you are a hardcore Kurosawa fan. The first, and by far the best, is that of the officer meeting his ghost platoon, a perfect example of what great cinema is all about. It is also the only one I may consider dreamy enough, crowded with symbols and portraying within it the release of long held, repressed emotions. And the only one to which all of us may relate to, as it deals with something as universal as unmitigated human pain and suffering. Private Noguchi is by far the most touching, believable character in this film and the only one for which I felt any sympathy-?a Malcolm Crowe of sorts, a soldier who reports to his commander officer for duty, only to be told he is dead. No happy ending here, as it was the case for Crowe. The last image of him, hesitantly walking back to the tunnel, defeated and demoralized after knowing the truth, and after expressing his wish of visiting his parents in some near village, is the most haunting of the whole movie. Even more so when, despite his sorrow, he gets enough fortitude to military salute his commander officer. If that's the real Kurosawa, I'd gladly take more of it. The second best dream is that of The Crows. Worthy mostly for the cinematography, the breathtaking landscapes, the paintings. I don't know how good Van Gogh Scorsese makes, I couldn't get most of what he says anyway, but I guess the main objective there was to show how good he physically portrays the painter, as in most of his scenes the camera is all over his mug, taking close-ups of it from every possible angle. If you are not a Kurosawa fan, forget about the rest. The two initial dreams are rather simplistic--and I don't buy the excuse that they are those of a child--and the fox parade utterly annoying. But the worst bits come after the nuclear holocaust which includes one of the worst possible scenes in whole Movie History--that of the mutants cavorting around the contaminated water holes. And that of the Village of the people living a happy life without any modern commodity. BTW, if this people don't need electricity, if they don't use it, I guess they have never seen a Kurosawa movie. Just guessing. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a minor effort from an aging master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's year 1990 feature is the work of a master director, but by no means is it a masterpiece, perhaps reflecting (even in its awkward title) something of his self-conscious position as the world's greatest living filmmaker at the time. Taking a sometimes critical look at the ways in which humankind abuses the natural world, Kurosawa presents eight separate dreams, visions, and ghostly parables, progressing from childhood innocence through adult disillusion to an old age return to Eden. The smaller scale gives each episode a fragile intimacy perfectly suited to the man vs. nature theme, but because of its episodic structure there's a certain lack of momentum to the entire film (to say the least), and like any secondhand dream many of these lose something in the telling. The first two and the final, idyllic dreamscape work best, and there's a playful moment when a younger Kurosawa steps into a Van Gogh canvas to meet the artist himself, played by (of all people) director Martin Scorsese. But while the imagery throughout is never less than magnificent, the Earthbound philosophizing in many of the other segments weighs the film down (at least in translation) with too much too much heavy-handed sentiment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with Anthology films is that some stories are bound to be better than other ones. It seemed like Kurisowa just had a few scenes in his head that he knew he would never live long enough to film and decided to combine them all. One part of the film where a character is walking through a series of Vincent Van Goh paintings is visually stunning and amazing, as is a scene about a young boy talking to the spirits of dead peach trees, but the rest is oversimplistic technology bad, war bad, atomic energy bad, human progress stupid, lets all live in huts rhetoric that just got pretty tired pretty fast. Though I obvious dislike the later portions on ideological grounds, the film making is compelling though a bit muted at times, a tendency in even the best Japanese works, as common as American films and their overdramatization. Nonetheless this is a film with it's fair share of beautiful moments, and has a fitting place at the end of Kurisowa's distinguished career, a good film for buffs, or those who enjoy visual spectacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not one of the best of the 'sensai's' films, but it has many moments that are really magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreams is not a really easy film to review, as it is an episodic bundle of various dreams from throughout Akira Kurosawa's life. So watching it is like going from one to another without a fully connecting thread. Thus, each one is like a perfectly contained short film where the director's awesome gifts of his painter's eye is put to the main test. Even when a 'dream' isn't totally working or memorable, or if there's just something not really engaging enough with it (even within the 'logic' of a dream), it's never tiring to look at. At this point in Kurosawa's career, following the towering masterwork Ran, here his mood is more reflective, dark, occasionally brooding, happy, and hopeful in equal measures.In fact, this might be at the least a superlative example of Kurosawa's knack for color. For a man who worked more than 2/3 of his career on black and white films, Dreams displays such a particular, distinctive look and measured quality for each segment it's never less than breathtaking. The opening segment Sun through the Rain, for example, which isn't necessarily one of my favorites segments in the film (it almost looks like something, with the fox wedding, that would be more appropriate in a Miyazaki anime film), the shots with the child walking through the flowers is about as sumptuous as color film can make it. My favorite segments are the Blizzard, which hearkens back to the intense, silent-film-like power of Dersu Uzala (this time with a great blue tint), as men try and break through a blizzard as one of them is visited by some kind of angel; if this was the only dream it would be perfect. I also enjoyed- even if it has been criticized more often than not- the Crows segment where a man goes through Van Gogh paintings and even meets the man played with a tight, amusing turn of words and facial expressions by Scorsese. It's a little silly, but it reminds me of a dream I might have had.Sometimes, if there is anything that didn't really catch me as much, is that the subject matter almost becomes a little less than dreamlike and more didactic in nature. The last segment, for example, which does feature a pretty sweet funeral sequence, is mostly just an old man (a 103 year old man at that) going on about nature becoming destroyed. Indeed, some of these segments that punctuate the 'bad dreams' become the real hit or miss parts of Dreams. For example, the segment where radiation threatens to squash a group of people is not used to the better abilities of Industrial Light &amp; Magic (who did the special/visual effects in the film) where the seamless quality comes a little lost in the brief, totally bleak nature of the segment. And the dead soldiers segment, Tunnel, is only really interesting for its look of the soldiers and the dark areas. The pacing, which is fairly laconic, is not at all the weakest part of the film. If sometimes it doesn't quite connect, it's not a problem, as Kurosawa's eye for the environments never truly wanes. It's self-indulgent, true, as it is not really speaking to the powerful storytelling talents his samurai films or dramas have. But it's unique nature overall makes up for anything lost on me. In the end, I was quite pleased that I saw Dreams, as it does go to show how much a master filmmaker can be creative even when not really 'awake', as it were, and it probably might provide more to look for or take in on repeat viewings.

		<shortDescription>All film students should watch this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, Akira Kurosawa is one of the most influential auteurs in film history but yet most haven't even seen one of his films. To truly appreciate his work his early films should be looked at and how they affected the north American film industry. This film however really shows his genius as it was his first film in colour, and you would never have known it. In his black and white films Kurosawa uses light and shadow deftly and subtly creating mood and emotion. These techniques are not easily transferable to a colour format but Kurosawa obviously has no trouble creating some of the most visually appealing film work I have ever seen. This film is definitely not for those looking for an interesting plot as they are simply just 7 of his dreams committed to film but they still create a flow and a string of ideas that are interesting and palatable. This is quite a feat, considering the vast difference between each dream, but this is only the beginning. These are very obviously personal thoughts and ideas brought forward from Kurosawa's consciousness and to make them accessible to others is a testament to his writing style. These points also fail to mention that he uses sound in a most jarring and exciting way. You are instantly drawn into a scene from the most simple of sounds, i.e. a dog barking or the clink of climbing equipment on ice. Modern day action directors should take a page out of his book and use less and not more sound. All I can say is that it is very disappointing that more people don't recognize Akira Kurosawa as one of the greatest filmmakers ever, putting him on a par with people like Kubrick and Spielberg. Obviously his films are based in a foreign culture to us but they are still readily accessible. As one friend of mine who makes films said, "I can't watch that film anymore because I just get too jealous of what he was able to do that I almost cry."</fullReview>

From the beginning dream of the small child given the task of killing himself for committing an offense of watching a secret meeting of a mysterious group called the Foxes, to the captain who meets with the meandering and haunted ghosts of soldiers he had carried out a sentence to murder, and even the science fictional look on the outcome of Mount Fuji erupting in Japan... the tales are well dreamed and Akira Kurosowa has well depicted his dreams in this beautiful and exquisite film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to this page on IMDb after watching the Oscars last night and wondering why Scorcese was passed over again. Reading his filmography, I saw one of my favorite films listed.I haven't seen "Dreams" since it came out almost 15 years ago. I think I watched it then because I remembered as a child my parents making the hour-long trip into Berkeley to see Kurasawa's films. The images from this movie have never left me. I have used the images in this film to bring myself up from despair, found myself having an incredibly similar visions in my own dreams to scenes in the movie, and felt inspired in my own work, recalling that this movie was made and did find an audience.Clearly it's not a film for everyone. I think it takes a level of maturity that is a small minority in the American audience. For though who do connect with it, even with only parts of it, it is a memorable jewel, and like real jewels, rare, precious and enjoyed most by a discerning viewer. It is one of the films that has made my life richer. Richer in the same sense as having a day in front of an original work by VanGogh or watching Eve Ensler herself doing "The Vagina Monologues." There is nothing like it and we should be grateful for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I see this film I am more inspired than the last by Kurosawa's art. His representation of the internal narrative of dreaming is so personal it sometimes feels voyeuristic, and so ambitious that his success is awe inspiring. In some places the dreaming comes off more convincingly than others, but perhaps I feel this way because I have not had some of the types of dreams he has had. In many of the sequences I feel like I can relate to his representation of dreaming. On the voyeurist side it is interesting to see what the dreams are that have followed Kurosawa through his life. I could not compile so many as he did. I've only had two dreams really stay with me since having them and they were both from my childhood. Great study, great subject, great work of art.

		<fullReview>Dreams, by Akira Kurosawa, could be one of the best foreign films I have ever seen... perhaps my favorite film ever. And for good reason.Each of the eight dreams are breath-takingly beautiful to watch. The dreams are all presented very clearly and without any MTV style cuts. This movie goes more along the lines of epic, grand, photography: extreme long shots, long sequences, etc. The cinematography in this film is a masterpiece, and brings new meaning to the 'canvas' of an artist: Kurosawa has made a beautiful, astonishing, scary, and charming canvas all at the same time. If you're a cinematography buff, this film is a must see. In fact, I'd be surpised if you were and hadn't seen it. The photography I could go off on forever, because it is pretty well perfect... flawless... As wonderful a painting as any of Vincent Van Goh's. Kurosawa must have died a happy man after finishing this masterpiece.This movie is not for everyone, for some might find some scenes slow and too meticulous. This film is original and not very typical: it's basically like we've been thrown into these dreams, and there's no blahsee American 'film-rules' to this dimension. Somehow, it works. I can't understand it! It's a masterpiece! Beyond description... I must stop now, for my words can not supplement it's glory.P.S.From what I saw of Baraka, another good movie for you photography and cinemetography buffs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kurosawa is my favorite director, but based on what I had heard about this film, I expected it to be a piece of silly, self-indulgent tripe.Well, it is self-indulgent--given its nature, it could hardly help being that. And it is sometimes silly--but dreams are sometimes silly. And Kurosawa's views are sometimes ignorant, hysterical, and even childish--but would the dreams of a well-informed and sensible person have been more interesting? The trick with DREAMS is to understand that it is the least conventional of Kurosawa's films. One should not watch DREAMS like a movie, waiting to see "what happens next," but experience it like a painting, reveling in what is on the screen.That's not to say that DREAMS is a great film; in fact, of the 16 Kurosawa films I've seen, it is my least favorite (update: I've now seen 22, and RHAPSODY IN AUGUST is my least favorite; DREAMS is my second least favorite). The music, which was never Kurosawa's strong suit (remember the "Bolero" knockoff in RASHOMON?) is probably the worst I've heard in any Kurosawa film. And Martin Scorsese as Vincent van Gogh is possibly the worst piece of miscasting since Evel Knievel played himself (unless the point of that dream is the horror of finding out that Van Gogh is an Noo-Yawk-accented Italian-American who can't act very well).But for all that, it's still a good movie...and it's a Kurosawa movie, even if it's not the best of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning but heavy handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreams, one of the last films of acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, is a visually stunning but often heavy handed collection of eight episodes loosely woven around the theme of man's disrespect for the environment and his warlike nature. The tales are mostly highly structured and linear, having little in common with actual dreams which are often confusing, disjointed, illogical, and highly symbolic. The first two dreams are the most successful because they teach by implication not by speeches.In the first segment, "Sunshine Through the Rain", the protagonist is a little boy, only identified as "I" (Akira Terao). The boy sees a wedding of foxes dressed in kabuki-like outfits in the forest, an event forbidden for a human to observe. On returning home, his mother bars the door and gives the boy a knife to kill himself or otherwise ask the foxes to forgive his transgressions. The boy walks in the woods looking for the fox's lair and discovers a beautiful rainbow in a big orchard. Filmed with bright colors, Kurosawa seems to be saying that man must understand his limitations when it comes to nature or suffer long term consequences.The second episode called "The Peach Orchard" laments man's destruction of the natural world. An older boy is distraught when spirits blame him somewhat illogically for the destruction of trees in a peach orchard. They discover, however, that the boy is also sad about the loss of the trees and they perform a ritual dance that allows him one last vision of the peach trees in all their natural wonder. This episode may reference the Japanese belief that guilt and shame are passed from generation to generation."The Blizzard" is a slow-paced but haunting segment that deals with a group of four mountain climbers who are near death after becoming lost in a blizzard. Covered in snow and running out of the desire to continue, they encounter a mysterious snow spirit known in Japanese myth as a "yuki-onna" (no, not Yoko Ono) who, despite I's struggle to escape her grasp, helps the men to locate their destination. Other segments include "The Tunnel", a strong anti-war tale about a returning soldier who, in the mouth of a tunnel, encounters the ghosts of a dead platoon he led into battle. The episode makes its point but goes on too long until its message becomes preachy. "Crows" is a gorgeously surreal segment in which an artist visits a museum and enters Van Gogh's paintings, even encountering Van Gogh himself, played by Martin Scorsese.Though their message is a good one, the final three segments, "Mount Fuji in Red", "The Weeping Demon" and "Village of the Watermills" are among the weakest. "Mount Fuji in Red" deals with the aftermath of World War III as people are driven to a beach near an erupting Mount Fuji to escape the radiation. In "The Weeping Demon" the world experiences transformation after the war and radiation has created a species of demons that roam the earth and threaten the few remaining humans. In the last dream, "I" finds himself in an idyllic village where men live simply and in harmony with the earth. The images have a strong impact but the conversation soon becomes tedious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too personal to be really enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film consists entirely of dreams that the director has had. They are laid out back to back with no narrative or links. This is an interesting project but no more than that. If you watch this it is possible to make out themes in his dreams - of fear of what mankind is doing to itself and the world and of a return to a natural way of life. There are also some of the dreams where you can get the feeling of incidents that happened in Kurosawa's life and his feelings of guilt that he carries. Visually this is interesting - in fact the whole film rests on what we see from the director's mind. The dialogue is pretty sparse but we rely on it to give us clues as to what is going on. Dreams come dreams go - Martin Scorsese walks across fields as Vincent Van Goth - who knows what's going on for the most part.Dreams are personal things. They are a unconscious reflection of what's going on in our heads and our lives. When we have them we can work out their meanings when we apply them roughly to our lives. But I don't know Kurosawa's life so I can't relate these to any experiences he may have had - unfortunately this renders the majority of these dreams into pretty pictures and nothing more.This is an interesting project to watch once as a view into the mind of the director. But it is ultimately meaningless as it is so personal. Scorsese and Spielberg's involvement may give it a bigger audience but this only means a bigger audience will be disappointed. No offence intended but if you are deeply impacted by this film then can I suggest that you focus on your own dreams - try to have them, remember them, write them down, think about them. This is an interesting film but it is only one man's dreams given substance - we can all do better ourselves when we sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kurosawa is one of the truly great filmmakers that ever lived! He has made films, that, to me, are among some of the greatest films ever made, such as "Rashomon", "Ran","Yojimbo", and "Seven Samuri". But, my thoughts on this film, are indeed mixed. As the film first began I kept thinking to myself, what exactly is this movie about? For those of you who don't know, this film is a collection of dreams supposedly the director (Kurosawa) actually had, and all of them (there are 8 ) were made into one film. The dreams vary so much that I honestly didn't know what I was watching. The very first dream in this film is about a young boy who happens to watch a foxes wedding ( if this sounds odd to you, don't blame me lol ) and, since the foxes don't like that, the little boy must now kill himself or go and ask for forgiveness. Another story is about a commander who actually runs into a group of soliders who were killed in battle! Now, what exactly do these two dreams have to do with each other? That's a very good question lol. There are two other dreams that come to mind that also confuse me, I won't mention them because I don't want to ruin it for others. But, the movie seems so disjointed. I didn't understand it's being. I couldn't see it's purpose. That is untill the fifth dream. If your willing to sit through the first four dreams, you'll start to notice a pattern take place in the dreams. It's ONLY then that the movie comes together. The movie is about the beauty of nature. How mankind is slowing but surely destroying nature. We see beautiful photography, great acting, and first rate directing. It's for these reasons I suggest that ONLY Kurosawa fans watch this movie. If you've never seen a foreign film, don't start with this one. If you've never seen a Kurosawa film and want to watch one, again, don't start here! Try watching "Rashomon". This film is just for those who have seen a lot of his films already. *** out of ****</fullReview>

However, I have to agree with the naysayers here - this movie is not only slowly paced but often amateurishly staged and acted. The messages are obvious and shallow and the much vaunted visuals seem oddly dated and low budget. Even the conceit of couching segments as drawing from Kurosawa's dreams is ineffective in light of their surprisingly literal dramatization - where is the surreal, subconscious dream logic of, say, David Lynch's "Lost Highway"? Instead, many of the segments are "surreal" in the artificial manner of an episode of The Twilight Zone. Underwhelming.</fullReview>

This is not to say it is a bad movie or it is poorly made--it's just very strange in spots and is a random collection of Akira Kurasawa's dreams stuck on the big screen. Some are not all that interesting and others are more nightmarish and captivating (such as his apocalyptic dream). It is a definite must for people like me who want to see every film he made, but for the casual viewer, it will probably just make your head hurt or make you dismiss his films in general---which would be a great shame, as he is, perhaps, my favorite director of all. Try to look at this an an experimental art film that he chose to do because, given his years and many great accomplishments, he had a right to try something different. Also, if you give it a try, several of the dreams are quite well-done and will impress (such as the Vincent Van Gogh segment starring, of all people, Martin Scorsese!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually love seeing foreign movies, (that is the way Americans rank the movies,as you can see how they divide the movies in websites like netflix or blockbuster).Personally i respect AKIRA KOROSAWA, and almost i have seen all his movies. Dreams has some nice parts , i love THE VILLAGE IN THE WATERMILLS,as it shows the beauty of life and beauty of death a peaceful death ,or the part that shows the dead soldiers.I believe Kurosawa had a passion for life and humanity, he must have believed we should love nature,as the first episode, showing the puppets and the cutten trees. He must have believed in humanity and mankind, as he shows the demons , seeing the demons i remember the head of corporates in America , or may be any where in world ,who are trying the suck the blood of nations . But saying that i also should admit the movie is very slow in parts and there is no need for that, i know living in west even i was born and raised in Iran has made me fast pace , but the pace specially in mountain hikers is very slow.But again Kurosawa is from Japanese nature and we should remember he must be affected with zen Buddhism, and zen actually is based on very slow rhythm, slow like zen tea ceremony or zen meditation. Again i believe Kurosawa some times goes too much to theatrical presentations than a movie.The movements of demons is too much theatrical . Any way movie is worth one time watch but it is not a masterpiece in film-making, it may be a master piece in thoughts, in the world that all Hollywood directors are putting every junk to make money and money is blinding the humans , looking at a movie full of humane and respect for humanity and mankind,makes us feel deep respect for this film director</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful but not absorbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to acknowledge that Dreams is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen. It also contains several very haunting visual images, including the woman in "The Blizzard" and the soldiers in "The Tunnel."That having been said, the pace of the movie is awfully ponderous for my tastes. Shots that need last just a few seconds go on, literally, for minutes. While this does give the viewer a chance to drink in the imagery, I think it tends to undercut the theme of the movie. I remember my own dreams as fleeting glimpses of another world. But these "Dreams" seem like never-ending clinical stares. For me, the movie would have been just as effective if it was an hour shorter.Next, it was irritating that several of the dreams, such as the first one, started to tell stories and then abruptly stopped. I felt teased. Either tell a story or don't.The movie is further weakened by the fact that the worst segments come near the end. The political theme that these attempt to develop is not particularly original. And the explicit message is not particularly characteristic of the mystery and enigma I associate with dreams.Before you dismiss me as uncultured, I do like many experimental and art-house flicks. I just feel that this one has little to recommend it other than the visual style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, tired, overrated, sloooooow and streeeetched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 dull stories shot very obviously on a set, overacted like most Asian movies, either too explicit about the message("the tunnel" - the monologue of the platoon leader is one of the most stretched hollow of point I've seen,- yes, it's about war, and yes, he's killed his platoon,-Yes, Yes, Yes, we get it, and what's with the dog?, "the weeping demon" , "the blizzard" - the one that bored me the most with the sloooow pace, and especially "mount Fuji in red"- quite alright, but nevertheless too explicit in condemning war) or too fuzzy, like the one with the kid and the trees. Extremely old fashioned yawner, in content but mostly in style, extremely slow and boring, totally lacking subtlety, childish, it will appeal I believe mostly to older people, or who enjoy the theater and probably pretentious -the more a movie drags, the more interesting it will be to say I've enjoyed it- kind of movie-goers. The one upside I consider the extremely short, but savorous appearance of Martin Scorsese as Vincent Van Gogh, and the landscapes in that episode(Van Gogh's paintings), and no wonder, because they are not Kurosawa's merit at all. But this one is also childish in displaying a, judging by his not so bright facial expression, what appears to be a slow witted tourist traveling thru paintings to find Van Gogh!?!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa directs this overrated drama whose pretentiousness is almost unmatched (perhaps only "Irreversible" trumps it). The vast majority of this film relentlessly wastes the viewer's time and patience by showing characters walking around aimlessly. One cannot possibly imagine a greater waste of running time than watching a generic character trotting ever so slowly for minutes on end while encountering absolutely nothing of importance or interest. Of course, if one wants recognition and prestigious awards from the art house crowd (as well as a high rating on IMDb), this is the formula for success.Here's a summary of each dream.Dream 1 ? a kid encounters a group of people who act like animals; the kid walks, the animal people walk ? very very slowly.Dream 2 ? a kid encounters a group of people who act like flowers; the kid walks, the flower people dance ? very very slowly.Dream 3 ? a group of guys walk around in a snowstorm ? very very slowly.Dream 4 ? some guy walks down a tunnel ? very very slowly, then tries to explain death to a group of really stupid dead people.Dream 5 ? some guy has a completely meaningless conversation with Van Gogh, then briskly walks around inside various paintings.Dream 6 ? nuclear reactors explode, people die, and the chapter ends with an absolute moron trying to defend himself against radioactivity by waving his coat in the air.Dream 7 ? some guy walks around aimlessly in the fog, then meets a bunch of nutty mutant dudes who contribute a "mourning" ceremony that is perhaps the cheesiest, most poorly acted scene in motion picture history.Dream 8 ? a watermill scene with some decent conversations about nature and science.Every dream repeats the same formula: add 14 minutes of useless filler to 30 seconds of actual content. This is the exact opposite of high-quality film-making. It's sanctimonious, pretentious, self-righteous trash.The unpopular view is that Akira Kurosawa is an overrated director who was never really liked in his home country in the first place, and that it took a group of pretentious, art-house snobs from America to artificially inflate his "greatness" to the rest of the world. After seeing 30 of his films, I'm beginning to agree with this sentiment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic Abortion of Epic Proportion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreams is a painful movie in many ways. Kurosawa is an old man, and in Dreams, he fumbles about awkwardly, straining ham-fisted metaphors and be-laboring the audience with overt didacticism. It's almost unfathomable how people can bring themselves to fellate such unmitigated garbage, especially when the scope of Kurosawa's filmography contains such a wealth of unquestionably greater films. The glut of positive reviews is a shame. Only people with an shallow, uniformed filmic experience could find this movie to be satisfactory. It's a embarrassing point in Kurosawa's career, and with any luck it will be forgotten and all existing copies will be buried somewhere in the Nevada desert.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip `Dreams,' it's a nightmare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Akira Kurosawa's Dreams' (Yume) was a disappointment. It might be more appropriately titled `Kurosawa Rambling's.' `Dreams' is supposed to be a cinematic presentation of eight dreams that Akira Kurosawa experienced during life. Not in order, they are: 1) A young boy being punished for watching a mystical marriage of foxes in the forest. 2) A young boy confronting dolls come to life to chastise the boy and his family for cutting down a peach orchard. 3) A man travels through the paintings of Vincent van Gogh. 4) Four men lost in a blizzard. 5) An army officer meeting the haunted bodies of the men he led into battle. 6) A man, his family, and a power company executive facing nuclear holocaust. 7) A man confronted by multi-horned mutants and giant dandelions after a nuclear holocaust. 8) A young man meets an old man next to idyllic brook and listens to joys of the simple life and evils of mankind.The `dreams' are presented in a quasi-chronological order: child, young men, family men, and finally meeting an old man going to a funeral. All are presented with colors and sounds that are exciting and fanciful. But none of them look like dreams! I, personally, have never had or read about a dream that was sequential. Every one of these dreams has a beginning, middle and end. I, personally, have never had or read about a dream in which every scene is contextually consistent. Every Kurosawa dream has no missing or extraneous frames. Not one of Kurosawa's dreams had anything to do with sex. I do not believe a lifetime of dreams could possibly be so neutral towards man's raison d'ete. And finally, I wonder how a man who used 20th Century technology to bring his vision of some really great stories to movie viewers all over the world can summarily dismiss the achievements of man? Does anyone believe that living in a dung-burning society where people make water-wheels and go to funerals could possibly be a dream? Skip `Dreams,' it's a nightmare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just couldn't be more boring, stupid thoughts with stupid lines. I could't help wondering that had Mr.Kurosawa learned little science or engineering. Full of all kinds of self-boosting, so shame to waste my time.</fullReview>
