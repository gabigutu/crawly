		<shortDescription>HE is HER victim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic feature of Danny DeVito's (far too few) works as a director is that they are utterly evil. Cruel. Wicked. Merciless to their characters and merciless to the viewer. Although this is often combined with slight exaggeration, it is exactly what I love about them.After seeing The War of the Roses the second time after having grown a little older, I still feel that particular satisfaction. But this time, there are a few more things I think about, a few more questions I ask myself. For instance: who is the bad guy in the film? Who is `to blame'? And although it's clear that the Roses both have extremely unmoveable and stubborn characters, which partly leads to the catastrophe, I came to the conclusion that Barbara is the driving force of the whole divorce story. She announces her wish to divorce upon grounds that are not quite convincing. Maybe people who do not like Michael Douglas can sympathize with her but her reasons are not fair. She invariably follows her instinct without paying any respect to other people. Kathleen Turner portrays her most believably in this insufferable phase.Oliver Rose, on the other hand, is one of those people who are proud of doing everything in a perfectly correct manner. He is therefore very sensitive and easily confronted if one doesn't acknowledge his correct behavior. He then becomes completely helpless and unable to react properly. That makes him an ideal `victim' to Barbara's striking egoism.I'm mentioning this only because it is a new aspect I found during second viewing, and I am sure it was also DeVito's intention to develop characters like this, so for him, the turbulent divorce story is not just a parable on how stupid people are in general. He of course reserved the best role in the film for himself ? he is the wise man who tells the parable and who emerges victorious in the end.The War of the Roses with its merciless cruelness remains one of my favourite comedies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not your typical Hollywood yukfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Danny Devito and the writers are to be credited for following this story's dark premise straight to its grim conclusion, and not opting for a cop-out 'happy ending'. Maybe that accounts for the movie's relatively low user rating. Whatever. Turner and Douglas are superb here. I saw Douglas on the Carson show after the movie came out, relating how, after a day's shoot, he and Turner would get together to remind each other that they were still friends. Seeing the movie shows why they had to do this. Note how the movie begins in the openness and light of Nantucket in summer and gets progressively darker, ending in the claustrophobic closeness of the nailed-up house. A classic black comedy for grownups. Don't watch this one with your spouse unless you are on really good terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works on so many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DeVito is a hit-and-miss director. He's turned out some very good films and some very bad ones. Sometimes his satire just falls short ("Death to Smoochy," for example); however, "War of the Roses" is his strongest directorial effort to date.It's got everything - a clever script, great interaction between its two stars, exciting thrills, funny gags (without ever resorting to unnecessary crudity), and to top it all off, the direction is very effective - DeVito is heavily influenced by Hitchcock and that is very clear in the final sequence, which is reminiscent of "Vertigo" and "Rear Window." Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the Rose couple - two once-happily-married people who are now, after many years together, bitter and at the end of their frustration. Deciding upon a divorce, they begin to split apart; however, negotiations regarding belongings begin to go awry as Oliver Rose (Douglas) demands more from his wife, claiming it's his money that purchased their enormous house and all objects inside.DeVito turns in a performance as the narrator, and Oliver's lawyer, who tells us at the start we are about to watch a sad tale about divorce. By the time the film has ended we've seen events spiral totally out of control - beginning with absolute believability and ending in absolute absurdity.That's the crucial part of all this. Black comedy relies on whether the dramatic arc of the content - the leap from reality to lunacy - can be believable. Many times in DeVito's film, it isn't. "Smoochy," for example, was clever satire at first, and fairly reminiscent of real-life people and events; then it turned into an over-the-top revenge rampage."War of the Roses" is more careful, and the arc is subtler. It's believable because the characters are given such room to grow and their conflict blossoms throughout the picture.I'd classify "War of the Roses" as one of the funniest, cleverest and most underrated black comedies of the 1980s - it's one of my personal favorite movies and never fails to crack me up. A cult film? Maybe; but I think many more people would enjoy it if they gave it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this on telly again after a long time, and, having quickly browsed through user comments, I realise pretty much everything has been said about this film - in some cases to nauseating detail too - including all sorts of social and psychological analysis of the "battle of the sexes", etc etc....what people forget is that this is essentially a story about how love turns into blinding hate and that everything else that goes on is completely incidental, including the characters' backgrounds, sexes, social status, the milieu they live in, or the current sign of the times. From that point of view this is primarily a study of characters (and a fascinating one too) rather than anything else.Turner and Douglas wrap up a brilliant script and a sparkling dialogue with what seems to be considerable ease and an impressive attention to detail, no doubt guided along by De Vito, whose direction is firm and playful at the same time, and in many instances even inspiring - he gets the mood just right, the tone constantly on an uncomfortable edge between a mordantly funny comedy and an ugly human conflict. In fact, the whole length of the film film ticks exceptionally well - slowed here and there, possibly, by the lack of strength of secondary characters - Sagerbrecht is a bit uneasy in this, at least to my liking, and the kids are completely bypassed -the scenes involving them are perhaps the weakest. The ending moral finger-wagging given by De Vito's character is also a bit heavy handed - but then this is Hollywood after all. It could have easily been much worse, we could have been fed a happy ending, god forbid. Instead, De Vito calls his own sweet wife and says he's coming home. Well, I can live with that, although some European director would have just left Oliver and Barbara laying there smashed under the chandelier and that would have been it. But I shouldn't complain....Overall very funny and enjoyable. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when love goes the route of attempted murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a movie is funny when you're by yourself and laughing out loud. This is a hilarious saga of a divorcing couple, both of whom refuse to leave their house. "The gloves are off," Michael Douglas announces to wife Kathleen Turner, although for the viewer, they had been off for some time. Both stop at nothing to drive the other out.It's a strange film in a way because it starts out as a love story and slowly builds, as little signs that all is not well in paradise begin to emerge. Once the ugliness starts, there's no stopping it, and the film rapidly becomes a very black comedy.Turner and Douglas receive able support from a very funny Danny Devito, who also directed, and the wonderful Marianne Sagebrecht, who provides a gentle presence amidst the chaos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marital Blitz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Give Danny DeVito the right story and he clicks. He does it here.What do a tornado, a hurricane, and an ex-wife have in common? They all get the house. Except when the husband's lawyer manages to dig up some rule that allows the husband to stay in the house as long as he and his wife lead separate lives.The husband is Douglas, the wife is Turner, and the lawyer and mediator is DeVito. There's also a housekeeper and two not especially lovable children (thank heavens for small favors) but they're probably less important than the husband's dog and the wife's cat.So how do two rich yuppies lead separate lives in their mansion? Simple. First they ignore and curse each other while passing on the stairs. "Filthy slut," mutters Douglas. "Bastard," murmurs Turner. Finally Douglas proudly shows DeVito a plan that he has worked out with Turner. It is a blueprint of the house, divided into red, green, and yellow sections. Douglas explains that the red sections belong to him, the green sections are hers, and the yellow rooms are neutral. "I had a little trouble with the kitchen," he says, "but we worked out alternative hours." DeVito is aghast."This seems -- RATIONAL to you?" Douglas: "I'm gonna win this." DeVito: "Oliver, nobody WINS anything here. There are only degrees of losing." And Douglas leans forward conspiratorially, grins insanely, and whispers: "I got MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE."It's Douglas's best performance, I think. He's not a simple outraged bourgeois, as in "Fatal Attraction" or "Basic Flaw" or whatever it was. And his character has more dimensions than his Gordon Gekko, and almost as good a name. The couple eat at opposite ends of a long empty table, like Charles Foster Kane and Emily. Douglas is waiting for an important phone call and is a bit anxious. He pays no attention to his wife sitting motionless and silently, staring at him. He stabs at the food on his plate and slices it viciously. And watch the half-demonic expressions that play across his face as he attacks and eats his food. The scene is an almost perfect embodiment of black comedy because, in context, it is outrageously funny -- but it could have been yanked straight out of a horror movie without changing a thing.It's a fine script and DeVito does well by it. I guess it gets a little tiresome by the time they're chasing one another around the darkened half-ruined mansion, nailing boards over windows and unloosening nuts, and throwing plates. And when in the midst of their hatred, Turner serves the pleasantly surprised Douglas her superlative pate and then claims it was made of Benny's liver, I could have done without the quick shot of the living Benny in the bushes outside. But those are relatively small acnestes bracketed in a very funny movie.There is a crazy logic to the story too. The couple begin by loving one another but are then separated by, well, THINGS. Douglas works very hard to make enough money so that his wife can find and furnish a perfect home for him. A little tritely, Turner discovers that she has grown not only to dislike the distracted Douglas but to hate him, so she wants her independence. Initially, the little frictions are minor. With a table full of dinner guests that Douglas is trying to impress, he asks Turner to explain how they happened to acquire the Baccarat wine glasses they're using. Nervously, she begins with a trip to Paris but so many dependent clauses intrude themselves that her narrative begins to resemble a 19th-century German sentence. So Douglas cuts her off: "To make a long story short.....", and wraps it up in two declaratives. (I can't emphasize too strongly how deftly DeVito handles this scene. Absolutely none of the irritation is spelled out except by the actors and the camera and editing, and yet we are left with a full understanding of the little disaster that's just taken place and the empty anger that follows.) The gathering enmity shows up in tiny ways. "I just wanted to push you," Douglas says to his wife's back, trying to explain some rudeness. "After all, everybody needs a little PUSH once in a while." (He picks up her cat and flings it aside.) And after his big dinner with his superiors, the couple are in bed and Douglas worries a little. "I hope they didn't notice what a jerk I was." Turner: "They never seem to." Douglas is so smug that the barb sails completely over his head. It's like Neal Simon, if Simon had become delicate. The humor, if that's what it is, grows more physical and in some ways less funny. Douglas, drunk, urinates on some fish while Turner is giving HER big dinner for potential customers. In turn, while the assembled guests watch open-mouthed from the doorway, she revs up her two-million horsepower SUV with the big knobby tires and the 20 mm cannon on top and noisily smashes into his tiny classic Morgan convertible. Then she backs up and drives completely over it with Douglas inside. Douglas emerges shakily from the compressed car and says, sounding perfectly reasonable, "Look, I don't want to create a scene. I mean, I live in this neighborhood too."See this movie if you have a chance. I would recommend it even if it weren't so good, simply on the basis of the last scene between the Roses. They have fallen 30 feet on a chandelier and lie dying next to one another. With his last bit of energy, Douglas manages to move his hand lovingly on her shoulder. And just before she dies, without being able to look at what she's doing, Turner reaches slowly out, puts her hand over his, and flips it away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good movie, one that holds up well after repeated viewings. Even if you're familiar with the story, DeVito's methodical and precise direction makes it thoroughly absorbing all over again. This movie has the directorial perfection of a good Alfred Hitchcock thriller, but it's not either a thriller or a comedy; it's a unique mix of elements from several genres, that does contain some laughs and sardonic humor, but also has serious undertones, mostly thanks to Michael Douglas' three-dimensional character and surprisingly sensitive performance. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shrewd insight into the end of a relationship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The War of the Roses offers the best analysis of the emotions behind the end of a relationship when one partner irreversibly falls out of love with another, who remains terminally hopeful that their love can be rekindled. Danny Devito manages to accomplish this while simultaneously putting together a very entertaining and funny black comedy.Kathleen Turner does a tremendous job depicting a frustrated homemaker who has gradually and irreversibly grown to loathe her husband, played by Michael Douglas. Douglas in turn cleverly plays the oafish and smug breadwinner desperately seeking to preserve the marriage, though never quite admitting it to the audience or himself.Overall, the War of the Roses remains a classic movie generally under-appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tragic Quest To Materialize Ontological Value Into Objects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The darkest of all comedies that carries its darkness all the way to the ending, no wimping out at the last minute. You may hate it, many people do, of course it is mother's milk to all single people. Whenever I thought of going further in my dating life, decades ago, I watched this movie. My favorite line,"Lately, when I watch you eat, when your asleep or when I look at you, I just want to smash your face in." Young people, the movie seems stupid to you because today the minute anyone is unhappy: divorce. It wasn't like that back here. Also, the core of the movie is anti greed. These two are in love with the stupid house, those retarded figurines and home furnishings. Watch when the trouble starts, when she finishes decorating her giant playhouse. DeVito's narration echoes this,"What do you do when you are all finished?" Answer: You fight for sole possession. Also, she was too distracted from what an annoying nitwit Oliver was when she was busy making the perfect temple of consumption with all the objects placed just right. See, it will not seem dumb to you if you get the point that a better director would have made more clear to you. The movie is about these two idiots in love with material objects.He works to provide money so she can build this art museum for them. Well, after she finishes something horrible happens: she discovers what an annoying idiot he is and how they could not be more different. Never lose sight that the War revolves over ownership of the home. Oliver must have Turner because she is part of the total home package. When Barbara discovers, after finishing the decorating, what an imbecile Oliver is, she wants the house A La Carte without Oliver, who can blame her? The humor is well done but it is black as pitch. I love the map Oliver shows Gavin with the red, yellow and blue areas: how pathetic? Yes, if you don't get what is going on here it will be an ugly bore to you. Admittedly, it has not aged well. This is an anti greed movie about two people who started their project to build a dream house and discovered, after it was done, that they detest each other. Oliver only wants her to stay because he looks upon her as just another possession in his house. The rancor keeps escalating until murder is being attempted; they both die together. I love the last scene where she knocks his dying hand off of hers. I admired Turner, you want to see a strong female character? Watch Barbara Rose, don't mess with her! Watch her drive her monster truck over his tiny sports car. You want to watch this because this was the Yuppie 1980's Culture in the United States. Rich people dedicated to doing just what this couple is modeled doing: creating an art museum for a home. The never ending quest for the perfect urban professional lifestyle. Sadly, one cannot exteriorize ontological value into material objects then suck it back up, like a vampire, into your personality. They love the objects not each other. Yes, it is dated and far from its Zeitgeist now. Try to see it as it has always been; a scathing satire on the shallow, vapid, greedy Yuppies of the 1980's. It also works as a lesson that all wealth is internal; you cannot draw existential value from material objects that you possess only as long as your heart keeps beating. Still A Good Movie. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a 'War'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the wickedly clever title to the smashing finale, WAR OF THE ROSES is probably the best dark comedy ever committed to film, Tim Burton and other works by Danny DeVito notwithstanding. A middle-aged couple with marital woes (Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner) fight over possession of their mansion-like home, and I do mean fight. DeVito takes his time building up to the actual fight, and the first half gives us the troubled couple inching along toward self-destruction. The second half -- well, if there's an adult HOME ALONE, this is definitely it. Priceless family heirlooms get smashed, the attic is booby-trapped and a loosened chandelier to rival that from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA becomes the focus of the Roses' final confrontation. It is mentioned early on that Mrs. Rose is a former gymnast, which comes in handy in later scenes where she might have otherwise been a goner. Throughout the movie, Mr. Rose claims to still love his wife, but he sure has some odd ways of showing it, including peeing on a fish dinner she whips up for some very pricey clients. Douglas as always is a wonder. He slips into the skin of this haughty, misguided individual and wears it well. He has given a handful of great performances, in WONDER BOYS, THE American PRESIDENT, FALLING DOWN and THE GAME, but this may be his best. Like Brad Pitt's bumbling Mr. Smith in MR. AND MRS. SMITH, Mr. Rose never quite gets it. It is a highly nuanced performance. Turner looks great and her Mrs. Rose never wavers from her goal, which is to divorce the increasingly unbearable Mr. Smith. You will either love or hate these always believable characters. DeVito as Mr. Smith's lawyer softens the cruel ending by adding a corny physical "gag" as well as a closing moment involving a phone conversation between lawyer and wife. No harm done. No one who has ever seen the chandelier scene is likely to forget it. Douglas and Turner, who with DeVito had done two previous films together, are at the top of their form here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy about contempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A middle-aged affluent couple hit marital problems and start fighting over the ownership of their mansion. This leads to increasing levels of antagonism and borderline sociopathic behaviour.The War of the Roses is very 80's, very loud and kind of fun. If you want a subtle study of marital breakdown then seek it somewhere else because this most certainly is not it. Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the warring couple. We follow their story from their first meeting, through the happy early days to the outright marital war that constitutes the end of their relationship. Douglas and Turner are basically let loose on this film to chew the scenery and go cartoonishly over-the-top. And for the most part it's a great deal of fun seeing them do this, as both are very capable actors who can play mildly deranged very convincingly. I felt, however, that the film lost a bit of steam in its final section. As the pair went increasingly berserk in their antics, the film lost me a bit. Having said that, it is a funny film at times and it's quite a bit of fun watching both principal actors going hell for leather. It's probably a film that people going through a divorce can relate to best. It most probably will give them a few ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move over George and Martha - Barbara and Oliver have arrived.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a married couple, Oliver and Barbara Rose, who discover that their marriage has been based on lies: for Barbara, that she never loved her husband, and for Oliver, that his wife loves him. For twenty years or so the situation in the Rose household is in a state of equilibrium. As a result, both protagonists can live their lives in a state of blissful denial - Barbara the dutiful wife and mother and Oliver the patriarchal bread winner and head of household. Things seem to going well for them and their marriage. Then one day things suddenly and abruptly change. During a dinner for Oliver's business partners at the Rose's home, a dinner, of course, prepared by Barbara, Oliver inadvertently humiliates Barbara which sets off a chain reaction of events that lead to tragic consequences, tragic because both of them are essentially good persons who don't deserve what's going to happen to them. Now feeling resentment, Barbara now gets in touch with her deeper feeling of inadequacy as a human being, the cause of which she attributes not to herself but to her overbearing husband, and as result she now hates him - and tells him that, straight to his face in the most unambiguous terms, including punching him hard on the face. Although slugged by his wife, Oliver still doesn't fully know what's hitting him. He does know that Barbara is upset but can't make heads or tails of it or take her seriously because, after all, she's his wife and, of course, she loves him. Soon it is impossible for the two of them to continue living together without denigrating each other. In an effort to eject Oliver from her life she starts her own business, which Oliver takes as a personal affront and a direct challenge to his role as the breadwinner, while Oliver, now angry and still perplexed, retaliates by belittling and humiliating Barbara in front of her customers. Tensions escalate after Barbara tells Oliver that she wants a divorce and is willing to waive alimony but wants to keep the house,and demands that he leave, based on the claim that the house was her's because she was the one who had done all the work to fix it up. Going against his lawyer's advice, the same lawyer (played by Danny DeVito in one of the great performances of his career) who had first advised Oliver that he had a legal right to stay in the house, advice which the lawyer later deeply regrets having given as it inflamed the situation and hurt his client, Oliver refuses to move out of the house and soon both are plotting on ways to force the other to leave. The fighting immediately turns violent with Barbara trying to run over Oliver with her ATV and repeatedly throwing heavy objects at Oliver's head and Oliver staggering around the house threatening to hit her with a large crow bar. Barbara is driven by her utter hatred for Oliver and Oliver by the hope that if he prevails then Barbara will come back to him. Both are now totally miserable. The movie ends on a tragic note, as both die,enemies to the bitter end. Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas play the protagonists. Mr. Douglas' performance is outstanding but this is Kathleen Turner's movie. Her performance has to rank as one of the greatest in cinema history.This movie is also an indictment of the legal profession as both Barbara and Oliver retain lawyers who, if anything, incite their clients thereby making matters worse. The lawyers are directly complicit in the disastrous events that ensue as both Barbara and Oliver believe that they have the law on their side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real battle of the sexes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Divorce is an ugly business. Just ask any married couple who've gone through it. It breaks up families. Its hell on the kids. But I think the worst part of divorce proceedings is that the whole act only reveals the ugly side of human nature. And Danny DeVito's The War of the Roses seems to understand that. Which is why its such a brilliant examination of marital bliss gone to hell. Its also an hilarious and merciless black comedy that spits and claws to the bitter end without ever holding back.The couple in this film are Oliver and Barbara Rose (Michael Douglas &amp; Kathleen Turner). The story of their marriage and eventual split is told to us through their lawyer, Gavin D'Amato (DeVito). He is consulting with one of his clients about the pitfalls of ill-advised marriages. And the Roses are a perfect example.They first met at an auction. They were both bidding for the same item. And it turned into a fierce competition. Barbara won out, but it sparked the flames of desire, and before you knew it, the two fell madly in love. They eventually got married, bought a nice home, had two lovely children, a cat and a dog. And they lived happily ever...Hold it right there! That's not the story being told here. If it were, Danny DeVito would never have agreed to direct. Oh sure, things started off well. As they always do. But over time, the cracks started to appear, and before long there was trouble in paradise.Tiny details blossom into big problems. Oliver became a successful partner at his law-firm. But Barbara was stuck in the role of the dutiful housewife. Something that caused no end of frustration. Oliver is quite content with the way things are, and when Barbara tries to assert her independence, he's indifferent to her needs. Tiny things start out as minor irritations that become vehement hatred. Like Oliver's fake laugh at dinner parties. And Barbara embellishing details while telling a story. And when it looks like Oliver might die, Barbara is surprised to find she didn't care in the slightest. And one suspects, vice versa. That's the last straw. And so begins divorce proceedings.Its at this stage in the film where things really pick up steam. Oliver and Barbara refuse to leave their magnificent, opulent mansion. And it sets the stage for what will become a battlefield between the Roses. A fight that rotates between spite, barbs and eventually attempted murder.The War of the Roses is my favourite of all of Danny DeVito's black comedies. Because his direction here is so excellent and controlled. In some of his films, he has a tendency to overplay his hand to the point that what starts out pleasingly spiteful turns into unnecessarily farcical. Death to Smoochy was a particularly guilty offender.But that's not the case here. DeVito's direction is assured, and gradual. He allows things to build slowly and surely and he never deviates from that. The material is quite attuned to his sensibilities too, and he's served by two excellent performances from Michael Douglas and (especially) Kathleen Turner.DeVito made the canny choice of reuniting with his Romancing the Stone co-stars, because he understands their abilities, and he knew how well they would compliment each other. TWOTR is a complete polar opposite of RTS. Where that film had them as two different people who fall in love, this film has them as two people who start out in love and drift further and further apart.Douglas and Turner get right into their roles with pure, undiluted relish. They bring the same energy and enthusiasm that fired up a lot of Romancing the Stone, and watching their rivalries explode into violence provides us with a source of great entertainment.The part of an inattentive husband is something that Michael Douglas could play in his sleep. But he doesn't. He recognises the potential in the screenplay, and he plays straight to the hilt. He knows he's got great chemistry with Kathleen Turner, and the sparks that fly from the two are truly superb.Turner has an equal amount of fun. Playing the role with a real arch sensibility, she positively sizzles. Barbara increasingly comes to dominate the picture. The mansion is her domain. And she knows it. Turner doesn't fly into the OTT theatrics that scuppered her later film, Serial Mom. Her performance here is more subtle and grounded in reality. And the film is all the better for it.Mention should also be made of Danny DeVito's wonderful humour. He's not afraid to plumb the real depths of people going through a messy divorce. Physical violence is one thing. But DeVito goes even further than that. At the height of black humour, Oliver ruins a swish dinner party for Barbara's posh friends by peeing on the main course. And she returns the courtesy by turning his beloved dog into pate on a cracker.But TWOTR is more than just bitchy oneupmanship. It is a cautionary tale. Otherwise we wouldn't have DeVito pulling double-duty as the lawyer telling us the cold hard facts behind the bitchiness. And its this element that allows the film to transcend its origins to become a surprisingly powerful fable in its closing scenes. Like most divorces, there is no happy ending, and this one ends on a real downer. Kudos to Danny DeVito for having the courage to keep things harsh and fatalistic, instead of resorting to anodyne clichés at the end.The War of the Roses is fun, witty, gutsy and most of all true to life. And its an astounding rarity among black comedies. This one actually has something to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny DeVito's "War of the Roses" is a sharp and wickedly funny satire that looks deeply into married life and oh, yes that dreadful word - "divorce" is included, too.Michael Douglas ("Traffic", "Wonder Boys"), Kathleen Turner ("The Virgin Suicides"), and director DeVito himself star here in the tale where the peaceful lives of a married couple, Oliver and Barbara Rose (Douglas and Turner) has begun to get nasty and downright brutal. Why is this happening you might ask? Simple. The war begins when in their divorce proceedings, Oliver and Barbara desperately want to get the house in their settlement. Unforturnately, they "both" get the house and try to avoid coming into contact (verbal or physical) with each other, which makes the situation worse.DeVito, who is the film's onscreen narrator and plays Gavin, a close friend of Oliver's, tries to be careful here in how to handle the ongoing spat that Rose gets into. He has made an intelligent movie here in letting the film take a very fine line between love and hate. Also, there a few hilarious scenes where Douglas adds a special flavor to a pot of cooking fish that Turner was going to serve a small group of guests and how the house becomes a warzone that's rigged with some unexpected surprises. Plus, the DeVito character defines the legal battle as "a love story".The performances are great and the photography by Stephen H. Burum ("The Untouchables") is stylish and marvellous. This film was adapted from the novel written by Warren Adler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Late night television in the modern era is the final resting place of former Hollywood hits. It also has the advantage in this more conservative America of being unedited. So I couldn't miss a chance to view again this classic , commercial free.The War of the Roses (1989) is also the sunset of the great paring of Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas who together made some of the more memorable movies of the 1980's.This is the life and times of Oliver and Barbara Rose. A married couple with grown children who are getting a divorce. We are invited as voyeurs to witness this collapse by a family friend , Attorney Gavin D'Amato (Danny DeVito). Anyone who has gone through separation and marriage in their lives can relate to the storyline.The Script is the life of the party , and is greatly enhanced by Douglas and Turner's long tenure of on screen works. Their team effort pays off in bringing a more chilling reality to what other wise could have been a disaster of a film. Credit goes to Danny DeVito for his direction but with this unique acting team and a script of this beauty(written by Michael Leeson), it was probably a movie you could not wreck even if you intentionally tried.The flow of the film is magical as more and more psychological and socially dysfunctional scenarios stack upon one another to make one train wreck of a marriage. Support from actors such as Sean Astin and the like can feel marginal but it is most certainly only a perception owed to the lead actors over the top performance. The Film is as amusing as it is thought provoking in the area of personal relationships.Four Stars(of 5).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The War of the Roses (1989) is so mean-spirited and dark that at times it's easy to forget it's a comedy. There are moments where it even feels heartbreaking. Much like The Great Gatsby, this is about the failure of the American Dream, how a happy couple is torn apart by the corruption of wealth and materialism.Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner have great chemistry as the quarreling couple. Danny DeVito is in top form behind and before the camera.The War of the Roses is an underrated gem and one which will likely reward repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gem of a movie oddly never got enough praise. It's a stroke of genius right there, and the whole thing is simply flawless. The screenplay is extremely clever and for once there are no compromises in this script. One can only admire the movie's commitment to the truth. It has a certain sincerity that I find absolutely refreshing, so those who call it "cynical" miss the point entirely. Marriage and its dissolution are dissected with a stunning finesse of psychological observation; it's all very funny, insightful, touching, ruthless, relentless. Three major stars in their prime (Douglas, Turner, De Vito)play their roles to perfection and deliver the best performance of their careers. One of the best films ever made (don't watch it on a first date though!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My fee is $450 an hour, and when a man who makes $450 wants to tell you something for free, you should listen." So says Gavin D'Amato, played by Danny DeVito, a high priced lawyer who kicks off "War of the Roses" by offering a cautionary tale to a man considering divorce. This cautionary tale, of course, is the film we're about to watch. As he is also the director of "War of the Roses", DeVito functions as both the narrator inside and outside of the film.D'Amato's tale is about acquisitions, possessions and the power of money, so the lawyer's early mentioning of cash is significant. In offering his advice for free, however, D'Amato sets himself up as being morally apart from the world he is about to describe. He is a voice of reason, or so he would like us to think.D'Amato's tale? Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas play The Roses, a wealthy couple who first meet at an auction (this meeting place is fitting; the duo battle over objects from the onset). With marriage then comes riches, happiness, big houses, and many garish possessions, the film painting a now familiar Utopian image of late 1980s Reganism. When the passion of romance fades, however, the couple instigate a bitter, violent divorce. From here on, the film becomes a dark comedy, a demented version of "Citizen Kane", each self-obsessed partner blaming the other for their psychoses, and each becoming maddeningly preoccupied with acquisitions, possessions, inventories, objects and artifacts, to the complete exclusion of everything else. As the marriage crumbles, the couple become so obsessed with surfaces (the film takes place at "Christmas", man's festive ode to consumerism) that they conduct a literal, and quite violent, war in their own opulent mansion. Set in Washington DC (military-looking helicopters constantly fly over apocalyptic, DC skylines), the militaristic tone of the movie has obvious, larger ramifications. The capital of the United States is capital. Nothing else matters. Cue much violence and possessiveness, culminating, fittingly, in DeVito directing a biopic of trade unionist Jimmy Hoffa three years later.It's a very good film, handsomely directed by DeVito, whose love for Hitchcock is apparent throughout. Douglas and Turner also do well, chewing scenery left, right and centre. Both have always been drawn to dark roles. Here they satirise their romantic unions in the "Romancing the Stone" movies, in which their both starred, and also a number of their previous films, in which Douglas is typically a yuppie careerist, a greedy scoundrel, a man who's consumed by dangerous women and exhibits drives toward power and success through money, while Turner is typically a femme-fatalle or marginalised woman driven to further exclusion. In "War of the Roses" the duo both play toward these now familiar roles, whilst also laying bare the crassness behind them. The shock of the movie is not that the Rose's rosy marriage fails, or even that the couple are willing to kill to keep their possessions, but ultimately that their marriage was always itself all about acquisition.The film then ends with a dying Douglas putting his hand on a dying Turner. We perceive this as an act of affection, but she clearly views it as an act of possession. Her dying act is to push him away, her body passing unclaimed.7.9/10 ? Good but too long. For a more intellectual take on this material, see Olivier Assayas' "Summer Hours". Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love and Hate are fruits from the same tree ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema provided countless examples of unforgettable love stories: Tony and Anita, Rick and Ilsa, Oliver and Jenny; which indirectly begged for a film that would finally pay tribute to the opposite feeling, the so-underrated hatred. And on that level, Danny De Vito, the director, did one hell of a job. In "Throw Momma from the Train", De Vito had already established his capability to mix between dark humor and Oedipian issues, in "The War of the Roses", the comedic aspect on which relies the greatness of the film, fails to hide its intelligent sociological commentary on marriage, and whatever can build it or make the most solidly built one literally collapse."The War of the Roses": the title is ironically very poetic as if it deliberately conveyed the ambiguity between love, flame and passion (roses) and probably the most violent, absurd yet representative constituent of humanity: the exercise of war. Indeed, and it's one of the strengths of the script, the hatred between Oliver (Michael Douglas) and Barbara Rose (Kathleen Turner) is never detached from the passion that made the love story possible, and this is essential to understand why the level of violence graduated in such a spectacular and disturbing way. On the surface, the story of the Roses is told from a divorce lawyer trying to convince a client that divorcing can be costly on many unsuspected levels. Fittingly, Danny De Vito uses a very solemn and almost stereotypical voice to introduce the couple; whose story starts as a fairy tale: Oliver and Barbara meet in an auction, and spend a romantic rainy evening followed by their most intense sex ever. Barbara decides that night that either it would be the most romantic night of her life, or she'd be the slut of all-time, Oliver can't picture himself with another woman ? the romance begins.Everything in the picture looks so perfect, to comfort that fairy tale aspect, but there's something cleverly hiding behind the scenes, something that becomes more and more obvious as time goes by. Barbara is romantic and passionate, Oliver is caring and pragmatic, it seems so benign in the beginning but progressively, these aspects of their personalities trace two opposite roads that would shortcut any possibility of a durable relationship. Barbara is the typical housewife caring, furnishing and decorating the house she discovered herself, until it became the perfect home for the perfect happy family, while Oliver worked on the 'funding' department, and hard enough to get the money to achieve his personal success, correctly earning what his wife would spend for the family's sake. Somewhere in between, despite all the decent and good intentions, the passion is slowly fading, making more visible whatever separates Oliver and Barbara; from their visions of life to details as significant as the animal pets they chose for company? and little by little, we witness the erosion of a perfect model of stability.Interestingly, the movie's apparent neutrality doesn't deprive it from an intelligent dose of objectivity depending on the gender's perspective. The point is not to admit that Oliver loved Barbara and she was the one who started hating him, or that he was a selfish jerk and she was a collateral damage of his ambition, I think what the film achieves to accomplish is to make us root for the opposite gender, or at least try to understand what went wrong from the other side. I watched the film with my girlfriend expecting her to root for Barbara while she was on Oliver's side, as a reaction, I tried to understand Barbara and the diagnosis I came with is that she sacrificed an exhilarating feeling of freedom to build a family, and while she never doubted her husband's true love, she felt like he was loving his idea of the couple, more than the couple itself. Oliver loved an entity emptied from its passionate core and Barbara couldn't endure a loveless life. The performances of both Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are the perfect spice for a story that could have been insipid otherwise. Douglas is brilliant as a tender but laughably self-centered jerk while Turner pushes a certain level of sexy deliberate evilness as the counterpart of twenty years of eternal docility.The performances, the set-up, efficiently works to create an unforgettable third act, when the war can start, and if the movie doesn't avoid some predictable or over-the-top situations, it remains faithful to its own premise by showing how far a couple can go during a divorce. At one point it get so chaotic that we might find it unrealistic? but that's only if we consider it as a movie about divorce, when it's more about love and hate. Neither of them want to give up the house, not because it would be economically unacceptable, but for a simple matter of territoriality. And when money stops to be the main motive, when it's for such principles, when there's no way to reason each of the two protagonists, when basically both of them have nothing to lose, then the effects can become devastating. And the film is so dark and perverse, than it doesn't leave us with much optimism about the fate of Oliver and Barbara Rose.Love and hate are fruits from the same tree ? and I guess one can't intensely hate a person if he hasn't experienced a totally opposite feeling. Passion is the driver of the most inspiring emotions but it also works as a double-edged sword when its effect is injected in our most negative thoughts. We hate someone we loved for having fooled us, and make us waste our lives, and life is too precious to be wasted. Hatred is driven by an attachment to our lives' ideals, and when these ideals are ruined, yesterday's beloved become today's enemy... and enemy is the right word for we're talking of a war, "The War of the Roses", Danny DeVito's black comedy gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie many, many times, and enjoy it just as much as the first viewing. That's why I have to give it a ten. The first time I saw this film I must have been a teenage girl about 14 years old. I remember thinking Mrs. Rose was a complete selfish bitch. Why did she hate her husband who provided her this wonderful house, furnished with beautiful things, was a good father to their children and made enough money so she didn't have to work, or ever have money problems? But like I said before, I was a girl, never been in a relationship or had a boyfriend. I never noticed the fact that he was a smug, nonchalant, inattentive husband....and a bottom feeding lawyer to boot...LOL! Looking at it now, I see how she grew to loath him, having now had a better understanding of the dynamics of a relationship.It's like Devto said in the movie and maybe not verbatim, "I am a believer in evolution. We came from mud and at our core is still mud". Which explains why people can do the things they do. How people can plot to kill their spouses for profit and property. I no longer wonder how things between two people can start of blissful and end up bastardized.........Just give it time.Could it be Devito was right when he says "Maybe it's not natural to stay married to one person the rest of your life. My parents did it...63 years....a few of them good". LOL.One thing I have learned about relationships "There is no winning, just degrees of loosing". And from personal experience, I've learned to get out early and cut my losses.War of the Roses is a must see movie....highly recommended for date night! LOL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie where Danny DeVito is the good guy. Hard to believe. This movie is basically about passive-aggressive relationships. Mrs. Rose (Turner) gives it her all to make her household livable. Mr. Rose (Douglas) is a mild mannered man, but one who only cares about career/financial success. The Roses' are snobs of the worst order, thinking only about their possessions. They represent the 80s. However, Mrs. Rose is the most unhappy. She is stuck in the house. Her husband doesn't seem to care or appreciate anything she does. He only cares about his career goals in his law firm. It is hard to completely blame Mr. Rose. The law firm demands everything from him. He always has to be fit and at their beck and command. Mrs. Rose's depression at her state finally reaches a boiling point when her two children leave for college. That's when the war begins. Mr. Rose hires his buddy (Devito) to be his lawyer. Devito regrets it, realizing that he has to be the go-between two crazy people. Neither of the Roses' sees the silliness and pettiness over fighting over a simple house. The house, however, represents their egos, and their entire self-worth. In the end, they both die, but not before understanding that they really did love each other all along. The sadness is that this didn't stop them for fighting over material gain. I guess the message is that the Roses' represent the values of the 80s, money and power over love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny DeVito redefines the "Black Comedy"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny DeVito took the Black Comedy to its most intense level of blackness with the 1989 comedy THE WAR OF THE ROSES, which reunited ROMANCING THE STONE stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, as the Roses, an affluent California couple who have a gorgeous home and family, tons of money and expensive things, and anything else a family could ask for but somewhere along the way, Oliver and Barbara Rose become disenchanted with each other and decide to divorce, but neither refuses to give up the house, which ignites a war between these two married combatants which has tragic circumstances. De Vito has brought us a disturbing but never uninteresting comedy, full of funny and perverse situations, not to mention some of the most interesting camera-work I have seen in a comedy in quite awhile. Yes, the depths that this couple sink to are a little hard to swallow, but the film requires you to put your brain on check and let dramatic license have its freedom and if you can do this, there are rewards to be had here. Douglas and Turner work very hard at their roles and De Vito is equally effective on screen as the lawyer caught between the Roses. There are a lot of funny moments in this film but there are moments of bleakness and sadness that stay with you long after the credits roll. Though it's not an easy watch, THE WAR OF THE ROSES is worth seeing for its jaundiced view of marriage and divorce as seen through the demented eyes of Danny De Vito.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film, Black Comedy At Its' Blackest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film not long after its' release (I was 20 or so at the time) and was blown away - and watching this several times since, I think it's a great film - no classic, but definitely one of the weirder commercial successes of recent decades, and - as a Hollywood film - something that would not get made by a major studio today, due to it's savage trouncing upon just about all that is sacred and/or 'politically correct.' Overall the film offers the story of the disintegrating marriage between two ferociously upwardly-mobile WASPs, as perceptions of disrespect and emotional neglect ultimately lead to an explosion of rage within the collapsing marriage. This is played as the blackest of black comedy (another comment mentioned HAPPINESS, and I would also make comparisons with IN THE COMPANY OF MEN or THE ICE STORM), resulting in some of the meanest comedy to ever grace the big screen.This would all be pointless or abusive were it not for the fact that the film does have something to say - albeit nothing very original - satirizing the social mores of 1980s America (aggressive status-consciousness, greed &amp; workaholism, a fixation upon upward mobility and stylishness above all else) with a savage glee that is nearly exhausting in its' ruthlessness. This noted - I should state that the magnitude of meanness on display here isn't justifiable, though the degree Kathleen Turner's character (Barbara) is taken for granted early on in the movie is shown in fine detail, providing something of a context for the rampaging anger she surrenders to during the film's latter half. Michael Douglas' character (on the other hand) is more of a cookie-cutter, upper-middle-class workaholic white guy, presented with considerably less depth (though it's a potential flaw, his aloofness may also amplify the social satire at the background of the story).Like any number of other insightful, though discomforting social comedies of recent decades (M*A*S*H, BLAZING SADDLES), this would not be made if it were pitched today. Which is a shame; this is a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad acting? Not Funny? Tripe? No Point? Douglas a nice guy in it? I think not! Anyone who wrote negative comments here simply do not get the acerbic cynicism and outright brilliance of this satirical war between the sexes. If anyone finds themselves taking sides while watching it they seriously should get introspective before embarking on any kind of relationship with a member of the opposite sex. This is the ultimate marital discussion film and people who find themselves headed toward divorce court should sit down and watch it together. It shows that dysfunction is not the result of one person over another but both people shared equally. It's an honest commentary on self centered people embellished into a wickedly funny and delightfully over- the-top nasty comedy. And funny it is.Danny De Vito's second directorial effort tops his first, Throw Mama From the Train, as a love letter to classic movies. His Hitchcockian/Spielbergian/Wellesian visuals exhibit a love for old fashioned film-making and his performance as Gavin is one of his better character turns. Douglas is perfect as the stuck on himself yuppie lawyer who is never far from hostility and Turner too is great as his not as educated wife who can't take his petty deigning toward her anymore and wants out. Turner is the slightly more sympathetic of the two characters even though she has many stubborn and spiteful flaws herself which only make the situation worse. Compromise is the moral of this story and here we have two people who cannot, will not, admit they are wrong no matter what disastrous end it befalls them.The greatest movie of its kind. An anti love story done with fleckless attention to detail. When you have that severe falling out with your significant other, or are witness to it happening to people close to you, you will understand why this movie is so spot on perfect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember how ground breaking and controversial the film was at the time of it's release. America was just coming to grips then, with what we now seem to celebrate, the ever rising divorce rate. Hard to imagine now, but the film really did get people talking about divorce more openly and without so much embarrassment as before. Divorce was much more of a taboo back in 89' and had a lot more shame connected to it, even though it was happening all around you. The film's release also seemed to coincide with a toughening of the nations stance on domestic violence issues, you began to hear the "new" phrase "Domestic Violence" bantered about more frequently after the film. I'm just glad that they made the film when they did because today they would have had to end the movie with the first blow, the cops would have been on scene faster than a Ho-Bo running with a sweet potato pie and everybody would have gone to jail. Just sayin. I thoroughly enjoyed the film then, and now. It's worth watching just to see Kathleen drive that truck, alone.

		<fullReview>War of the Roses is a story of a once loving couple who fall out of love, into irritation then dislike and finally into obsessive hatred. In real life a pretty commonplace story. There are good ways couples might handle this situation. There are bad, very bad, ways couples might handle it. War of the Roses is the story of a couple who chose to handle it in a very very bad way. The movie is greatly entertaining, often comic and sometimes hilarious. But the purpose is I think ultimately educational and very very serious. When a marriage goes bad your best friend can turn into your very worst enemy - they know your vulnerabilities; they have a fund of grudges; they are your competitor claiming those things you most value; they, more than anyone, know how to hurt you. And not only do they know where you live - they live there too..... War of the Roses is remorseless, pulls no punches and is an awful warning to those who think that they can tough such a situation out. Without the humour and entertainment it would have been simply preachy. Perfect performances from the two leads. It should have received a Humane Society award.</fullReview>

Both of them are rising hell, taking a increasingly dark and dangerous path, it seems to be no redemption for this nasty twosome.Directed by Danny DeVito (Throw Mamma from the Train, Death to Smoochy, Duplex) made a clever, somber comedy with an edge. Douglas &amp; Turner are fabulous in this mean-spirited movie. DeVito has a supporting role as Douglas' calculating guidance lawyer. This was one of the biggest hits of 1989. This film has excellent cinematography by Stephen H. Burum (Casualties of War, Raising Cain, The Untouchables). This film is Over the Top and always amusing. DeVito grand (odd) style from the camera point of view is one of the film best asset. This clever comedy is a matter of personal taste, it's a well done film. Written by Michael Lesson (I.Q., The Tuxedo, What Planet are you From). Based on a novel by Warren Alder (Random Hearts). (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How NOT To Get A Divorce!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner star as Oliver and Barbara Rose. The movie relates a story being told by attorney Gavin D'Amato (Danny DeVito) to a client in an effort to convince the client not to get a divorce.Oliver Rose had been a law partner of D'Amato's, whose long hours and commitment to his career above all else led to a breakdown in the Rose's once loving marriage. And what a breakdown! This is black comedy at its finest, as these two battle over possession of the family home, and each escalates the war as they try to drive each other out.Let this be a lesson to anyone who chooses divorce: do it in a civilized way!9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not summarize this brilliant Danny DeVito Film except to say that it was a funny, savage, and often sinister look at one dissolving marriage and the insanity of two people holding on to the wrong things for the wrong reasons.Douglas and Turner start out so perfectly. The audience can't help but fall for them as they themselves fall in love. Turner's selflessness and constant good intentions make her character's later bitterness understandable. Douglas' ambition towards the goal of outwardly perfect and upwardly mobile blind him to the growing chasms in his marriage. Yet you can't help but feel for him. He seems to love his wife, despite his inability to accept her for who she truly is. This is truly a cautionary tale about both marriage and divorce.I wish that Danny DeVito would produce this kind of quality work on a yearly basis. The state of American cinema would be much better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Comedy in Reverse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The War of the Roses" is a film told using that old literary device of the "framework technique". Gavin D'Amato, a divorce lawyer, is discussing case with a client. Realising that relationships between the man and his estranged wife have become very bitter, Gavin decides to tell him a cautionary tale based on the true story of his former partner Oliver Rose. The film then flashes back to Oliver's courtship of, and marriage to, his wife Barbara. Oliver is highly successful in his professional career and is promoted to a partner in his law firm. He, Barbara and their two children appear to be living the American dream in a luxurious house.Their marriage, however, is not faring so well, and Barbara shocks Oliver when she asks him for a divorce. Although he believes that the marriage can still be saved, he reluctantly agrees, but things start to get worse when the couple fall out over the financial arrangements, especially ownership of the house. Neither seems willing to give way on this point, and they begin to wage an ever-deepening war against one another, seeking to destroy first each other's most cherished possessions and then each other's reputations.The film stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner who had earlier acted together in "Romancing the Stone" and its sequel, "The Jewel of the Nile". In one respect Turner might have seemed miscast. The script implies that Oliver and Barbara are around the same age, whereas in reality Turner is ten years younger than Douglas and at 35 was really too young for the part. Barbara, after all, is supposed to have been married for around twenty years and to be the mother of two children in their late teens. This is, however, one piece of apparent miscasting which turned out to be absolutely right. Turner plays Barbara as a force of nature, a sort of deranged fury eaten up with hatred for her husband and absolutely determined to have what she sees as her rights, no matter what the cost. There is no rational reason for her dislike of Oliver; when he asks her why she wants a divorce all can reply is that she has a desire to "smash his face in". At the same time she is sexy enough to make us understand why, for all her spiteful antics, her husband still, in an odd way, is still in love with her- and nobody could do deranged but sexy like Turner as she was to prove in another, later black comedy, "Serial Mom" in which she plays another suburban housewife turned avenging fury. Douglas's Oliver is subtly different. Although he can be just as spiteful as Barbara, we get the sense that he is more sinned against than sinning, a man who has worked hard to provide as good a life as possible for his family only to have his love thrown back in his face by an ungrateful wife. Barbara announces her intention to divorce him when he has just come out of hospital, which seemed particularly cruel. Some of his tricks, such as his insistence in remaining in the house after the couple have split up, seem to be motivated partly by a desire for revenge but also partly by a desire to stay close to the person who has been at the centre of his life for so long. My one complaint would be that he seems too old in the early scenes when he is supposed to be a young student. DeVito is also good as Gavin, desperately caught in the middle of a battle between two people he considers friends. Although it has an ostensibly improving moral about the need for tolerance and mutual understanding in marriage and personal relationships, "The War of the Roses" is essentially a black comedy. It can be seen as a romantic comedy in reverse. Many rom-coms are based around the "Pride and Prejudice" story of how a couple start off by disliking one another and end up by falling in love; this film simply reverses the process. A comedy on this theme could have become very nasty and mean-spirited, but in the hands of Danny DeVito, who directed the film as well as playing Gavin, and of its two stars, it somehow manages to avoid this fate. It is one of the funniest unromantic comedies of the eighties. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He was arrogant, she was vindictive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and in the end they cook and eat each other, not the dog. That is the long and short of this film and would have made a good epitaph for both of them. Five years earlier, in 1984, Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner had teamed up for the wonderful "Romancing the Stone". As for the sequel...we won't go there. Now they have aged a few years and are playing Oliver and Barbara Rose, a couple on the cusp of middle age. The film starts out with Danny DeVito's character, Gavin, an expensive DC divorce lawyer, describing to a client how he should be generous to the point of pain to the wife he is about to divorce. He tells him how the story of Oliver and Barbara Rose changed him from being a cutthroat attorney to what he is today.So the story starts out with their meeting as young people. You know, even from the beginning, the warning signs are usually there, and in Oliver's case, anybody who introduces himself as a genius who is going to be rich and famous someday is probably not going to care too much about his spouse's opinion, and you'd be right.Time passes. Oliver does become the wealthy attorney and the Roses buy the big house in the city. Barbara spends all of her time collecting antiques and keeping up the house. Once her two children get big enough to not really need her anymore, she decides to go into catering - she has become an excellent cook, plus she has cultivated many influential friends through the years in Washington. To celebrate the launching of her new career she buys a monster truck. Oliver belittles her efforts and asks how many hundreds of meals will she have to cater to pay for that truck? You can tell that this is the last of many straws. But it's not until Oliver thinks he has had a heart attack and Barbara feels relief rather than grief upon the news that she realizes the marriage is over.She tells him she wants a divorce. He refuses to believe she would ditch such a wonderful guy as himself. He gets Gavin to act as his attorney and finds out about an old law that allows people to stay in the house while the divorce is being processed. They snipe at each other in a hundred different ways that I'll let you watch and see for yourself.Ultimately, Barbara tells Oliver an untruth, one so horrifying that for the first time Oliver becomes violent. Oliver barricades them both inside the house and they spend the night in actual combat. I'm not so sure he wants to kill her so much as he wants to capture her, because ultimately he wants to keep her. But Barbara's actions leave no doubt she is trying to kill him, because ultimately she wants to be rid of him. In the end they die in the most ironic way possible. With their dying breath he clutches her hand in his, she shoves it away.Basically this is an exaggeration in action but not attitude of your typical divorce story involving any two people who spent decades together and were truly in love once. You can't do what these two people did to each other and not have been madly in love at one time. As they say, the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.Let me say something about the book this film was based upon - Danny DeVito REALLY wanted Barbara to cook that dog. However, people convinced him that Barbara would have lost all sympathy if she had intentionally killed an innocent dog and fed him to her husband as pate. She would have come across as mean not insane. I know that his advisors were correct.One thing not shown, maybe just to keep the audience curious, was - who did Gavin marry? We hear him talking lovingly to his wife at the end of the film, saying he'll be home soon. Remember, Gavin was a player and one that only liked the leggiest of blondes prior to the death of the Roses. I'll tell you who that was - it was Susan, the Roses' live in housekeeper who was going to college part time, was very sweet and intelligent, but seemed to be nearing 40 and was not physically attractive in the conventional sense at all. I think the film left that part a mystery just so you could fill in the blanks for yourself, plus it gives you something extra to talk about after the film.I highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There is no compromise"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembered this movie fondly, but as more of an outrageous comedy. Re-viewing it, I see that it bristles with some of the harshest truths about reality.Oliver (Michael Douglas) and Barbara (Kathleen Turner) meet under the most idyllic of circumstances, catching each other's attention amidst a blustery Nor'easter on atmospheric Nantucket Island. Displaying their competitive souls while outbidding each other at an auction, Oliver sees that the athletic Turner won't give in. Rather than take that as a red flag, it fires his libido."Either this is the most romantic night of my life, or I'm the biggest slut in the world!" Barbara exults in bed.As it turns out, their passionate tryst with a view of the ocean is the beginning of a slide toward devastation.I was amazed to discover that, upon returning to this fine film, I had totally forgotten the presence of Danny DeVito, who plays Gavin, Oliver's best friend and eventual divorce attorney. DeVito is pitch-perfect as a person who is the exact opposite of his beleaguered best bud -- a wisecracking character who learns from his experience and uses his discoveries to try for a better future."In your own life, by his point, you think you know what's gonna be," he tells Oliver, whom he is accompanying home from the hospital after Oliver's heart attack. "You don't know! It's always just when you think you've got it figured out. Bingo! Something comes along and knocks you right on your ass."DeVito's advice -- "Don't underestimate her as an adversary" -- falls on deaf ears.On their first night together, Barbara tells Oliver something that is incredibly sexually validating. Despite his eventual unhappiness with her, and her efforts to actually KILL him, Oliver never really hears past this intimation. This movie expertly demonstrates the devastating effects of denial.All of the acting in this film is superb, and it was a pleasure to recognize the amazing Marianne Sagebrecht, who had shone in 1987's "Baghdad Café." In addition, great wit is displayed in the bit-by-bit revelation of the Roses' showcase home. (Now I think I get how film editing can be an art!)Another reviewer on this site says this film has gotten better with time. I entirely agree!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still to date the best and blackest of black comedies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught The War of the Roses in theaters back in '89 when it released and if my memory serves me correct it was over the Christmas period as I distinctively remember festive cheer everywhere in the mall. I was rather surprised when I exited the theater that The War of the Roses should be bundled into a Christmas release schedule when the reality was that the film was rather ruthless and relentless in its depiction of a marriage going sour and turning into two-way bloodbath of a divorce.Having done Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile together most audiences saw Douglas, Turner and DeVito on the poster and possibly subconsciously related it back to that level of comedy. I know I did after viewing the trailer before release. Even though the revenge aspect of the divorce was pretty clear from the trailer it still made things look light and flimsy even though it dealt with a serious issue - perfect Christmas fodder in fact. A comedy about the pratfalls of divorce over Christmas. It could only have one of those happy holiday endings Hollywood is so well known for. Oh how wrong, how very wrong, we we're to assume that! I remember a lot people hating this film. Most people saw it as an all out assault on the institution of marriage with many complaining it was just "too dark for enjoyment". Friends of the family that were going through a tough divorce themselves each walked out respectively, although not together of course, saying the film was too much to handle given the current point they were at in their lives. In fact I remember leaving the theater thinking I'd slipped into some parallel universe and by the looks of the faces on most of the audience, they seemed to have felt that too.The War of the Roses is a tale about a love being ship-wrecked and destroyed on the shores of bitter contempt. Sure it starts out like any love story would - two young strangers meeting in a destined place discovering a passion for one another that is raw and physical - a love at first sight if you will. It doesn't take very long for those pillars to fall leaving a void that is slowly filled with kids, a bigger house and the more trinkets to fill into that bigger house than you could fit into an antique roadshow sale. No longer able to window dress the void, which has now developed into a chasm, Barbara Rose announces that she wants a divorce. Oliver Rose doesn't take her seriously, which only hardens her contempt for him. She says she wants the house - having picked it out herself and slowly filled it with the things that have made it a home. He argues that he paid for the house and everything in it. It's not long before Barbara and Oliver start sinking to new levels of depravity against one another in pursuit of the valuables that defined them during their marriage as the battle lines are drawn.The War of the Roses constantly borders on veering off the edge of comedy and into full out horror. I love black comedies but quite frankly they don't come more darker, nastier and meaner than The War of the Roses. It's a testament to DeVito's brilliant direction here that he is able to pull back at just the right moments so that the film retains its comedic edge - albeit a very bizarre comedic edge that is peppered with spousal brutality unlike anything we have ever seen. Both Douglas and DeVito are in fine form but it's Turner's brilliant turn as Barbara Rose that steals the show. She goes from a loving and caring wife and mother to a cold, aloof almost assassin like vixen by the films end. She is absolutely outstanding in the role.If I do have a slight complaint about the film, it's that it tends to want to puts its leads into " good guy" , "bad guy" camps and somehow DeVito misogynistacly places his female character, Barbara Rose, firmly in the "bad guy" camp. I think this was an ill judgment on his part as he potentially alienates all his female viewers. And as we know in the messy arena of divorce, particularly the nasty ones, there really are no good or bad guys.I caught this on the TV the other night and it reminded me why it's such a much loved classic in my film library. Its lost none of its brutal comedic edge and its willingness to punch, batter and bruise its protagonists till the very bitter end is still alarming and discomforting in the way only a black comedy can alarm and discomfort whilst still trying to make you smile.</fullReview>

This takes place in Washington, D.C. where we meet attorney, Gavin D'Amato (DeVito) who tells the story of ill-fated, married couple, Oliver (Douglas) and Barbara (Turner) Rose to a new client (Castellaneta). He begins with when they first meet to their troubled 18-year marriage ending in a tragic battle over their house. Oliver was a Lawyer, Barbara owned her own catering company and they had 2 children. Douglas, Turner &amp; DeVito are terrific in this and David Newman's score is great as usual. I recommend this great comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War of the Roses - The End Of The 80's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah,"The War Of The Roses",a biting,darkly comic look at what happens when two people forget about why they're together in the first place. Having forgotten about when they met,fell in love,shared their thoughts &amp; dreams with each other and made those great plans for a life together. (Kind of quoting Danny DeVito at the end of the film).Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were superb in the transformation of the young lovers that turn into everything they never thought they could become. Danny DeVito is great as the friend and go between.The only problem I had with the movie was....the ending.Now,don't get me wrong here ladies and gentlemen,I really did like this movie. That is,at least,until it's big downer of an ending. I could not believe that in the end these two people are snuffed out. True they go from young,idealistic,romantic couple to completely dull white collar sell outs with all the material possessions that come with it. Douglas was scary and menacing and Turner as well but to kill them off at the end really killed "my" enjoyment of the overall movie.I'm not saying have the typical Hollywood storybook-happy ending but at the very least,just give them broken limbs and give,at the very least,\ a possibility these two can mend their fences enough,to at least go through the divorce without so much malice. Too obvious by that point that reconciliation is out of the question,despite trying to save each other before the big fall.I will say this about that ending,it's almost the perfect metaphor for what happened when the 1980's themselves came to a much similar end. The money grubbing,corporate world,materialistic decade of all flash and no feeling was over. Appropriately enough,it was the last movie I saw in 1989. How appropriate.You may disagree but four stars off for the downer,6 for the rest. (END)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We can be happy ? just not together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an odd sense of appealing disdain that overcomes you watching this movie. The storyline itself is really quite simple and the screenplay nothing special but the direction, by actor Danny DeVito, is excellent as is the entire production led by James L. Brooks. Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas are perfect as the uber-successful couple ? Oliver and Barbara Rose ? at the pinnacle of Eighties success. He's the hotshot lawyer with political ambitions and she's a sought-after caterer (of course). Together they share a proto McMansion complete with giant walk-in closets, terrazzo floors, and live-in European housekeeper. But it is the house that becomes their undoing.Bored and stereotypically hormonal, Barbara wants a divorce but Oliver won't give it to her easily because each wants the house. Their kids, grown and living away, resent both of them and only housekeeper Susan (Marianne Sagebrecht) really cares what happens to either of them. Little by little they descend hilariously into madness and ultimately neither of them win their prize.Turner and Douglas pick up where they left off in "The Jewel and the Nile" and more precisely in "Romancing the Stone" and have an electric chemistry between them that makes even the most mundane line of dialogue funny if not witty. The viewer can't help but feel for both Roses yet find them equally repelling as they sink to their depths in the outrageous domestic warfare.With plenty of surprises "War of the Roses" proves the old adage that nothing is sacred in love and war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie by Danny Devito. In the beginning the Roses (played by Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner) were a lovable and peaceful couple. Till they let their differences get the best of them. Their resentment grew for one another after an ugly and nasty dispute over who keeps the house. Danny Devito played the manipulated lawyer who tried to encourage Douglas that the women will somehow come out on top. This movie sends some good messages about couples trying to get a divorce and the struggle that goes along with them. As for Douglas and Turner,they went to extremes of having their way. Even if it means they have to kill each other for it. This movie is surely an example of going all out for something they want. But this couple got of hand and instead of coming down to some agreement,they tried to make life harder for one another.</fullReview>

You see the charming way the Roses meet and the life afterwards, all the way to their unique til death did they part. I am in a happy committed relationship, but I can still appreciate the universal truth of this movie, living with someone is hard! That it is almost impossible to get a divorce without looking stupid at one point or another, and that usually the source of the pettiness is the sad fact one spouse still loves someone that has grown sick of them. Women and men can both find something to appreciate in this film,and unless you are going through a tough divorce(in particular there is a scene where the One Being Left asks the Leaver Why they are leaving and the Leaver tells them in painful detail, funny for me, might not be if I was ever left!), this movie never fails to make me laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie about a week ago and thought it was quite interesting. "The War of the Roses" is a very fitting title for this movie since it tells about the unbelievable quarrel between Oliver and Barbara Rose (played by outstanding actors like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner). This story is just incredible and unexpected. It was thoroughly entertaining and different from other love stories, which are just pathetic. It's completely true that it's not about falling in love with somebody else forever. It was more than that! The story is well told and acted. I liked the way Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner carried out their roles. They were amazing!I like it because it shows what's a failed marriage like. I couldn't believe when they were fighting everywhere inside the house. SPOILERS They just got to wreck their house and kill themselves. That was the outcome of this failed marriage. It was sad to see it. What will happen to their children? Barbara knew what she was getting into before marrying Oliver, so it didn't make sense that she hated him after a while. She chose her fate, therefore I consider it was all her fault for having hated him without any convincing reasons.As for Oliver I think he was a person who just loved Barbara too much without realizing that she didn't love him any more. He just wants to get the house and destroy everything I thought this movie was made only a few years ago, but I was utterly impressed after seeing that it was made in 1988. It doesn't look that old. I mean it's not that old, but it just didn't seem like it was made in 1988. Overall, It was an entertaining movie. I really had a good time seeing this movie; nevertheless the ending was very disappointing. At least it leaves everybody a message about failed marriages. "Don't ever marry somebody if you're not going to bear that person in the future". 7/10</fullReview>

There are lots of great lines in the brilliant and witty dialogue and there aren't any compromises in the script, not even in the bitter end. But what shines the most are the performances by Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas as the Roses.

		<shortDescription>The War of the Roses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years after Throw Momma from the Train, the director and star brought out this almost as good as black comedy. Gavin D'Amato (director and star Danny DeVito) begins to tell a client (for no charge) a story about a couple who started well, but ended in tragedy when divorce became the issue (obviously the client has a similar situation). Anyway, the film mostly consists of flashbacks as this story is told. Basically, Oliver Rose (Golden Globe nominated Michael Douglas) and wife Barbara (Golden Globe nominated Kathleen Turner) were a happily married couple for many years, then Barbara starts to wonder what life would be like without Oliver, and likes the sound of it. So one night they argue their differences and really express their eventual hate for each other, and agree to divorce. But Oliver is not giving up without a fight to get the house, and according to statement in a law book, he is allowed to live in the house until the divorce is finalised and they have agreed who claims it. They are prepared to go pretty far to ensure one dies, and the many scenes that follow are basically attempts and near-misses trying to get each other blown up, hit, crushed or falling, and in the end, they both die falling from the chandelier. Also starring Marianne Sägebrecht as Susan, Peter Donat as Jason Larrabee, Sean Astin (the son) as Josh at 17, Heather Fairfield as Carolyn (the daughter) at 17, G.D. Spradlin as Harry Thurmont, Trenton Teigen as Josh at 10, Bethany McKinney as Carolyn at 10 and Dan Castellaneta as Man in Chair. As I said I think it almost as good as Throw Momma, but it definitely can't be better, I'd probably need to see it again to understand it all, but there are some good gags with the couple trying to kill each other. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeVito's Intriguing Black Comedy Mockery of Marriage and Divorce (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny DeVito directs this black comedy about a pretty messy divorce. He plays the divorce lawyer who is humurously cautioning his new client about what he is about to embark upon by telling him the story of the Roses, divorcees played by Kathleen Turner ("Barbara") and Michael Douglas ("Oliver").The Roses seem to have a pretty miserable marriage. Typical material about rich people, they never even seemed like they wanted to get married in the first place, especially Barabara. But they did, and they built a home and a family. But, things just seem to be unbearable between the two, and Barbara wants a divorce. Oliver finds a loophole in the property laws that allows the couple to live in the same house during the divorce. Barbara is adamant on getting the house, but that is something Oliver will fight her on (more so than custody of the kids), although at times, it seems like he is only doing whatever he can to get her to call off the whole thing and pretend to be in love with him again.Being in the same house leads to a lot of comic disasters with both Barbara and Oliver trying to get on each others nerves so much that Oliver will agree to leave and, hopefully, give up the house as well. For example, during Barbara's dinner party, Oliver stumbles in drunk, insults the guest and urinates in the soup. Barbara meanwhile crushes Oliver's restored classic car with her monster truck. The finale appears to be a fight to the death over this house. The story operates on typical material and stereotypes of rich couples, those driven by material possessions and lack of emotional connection between one another. The Rose's kids in fact (Heather Fairfield and Sean Astin), appear to be more of an accessory to their wealth rather than a product of love. There is nothing admirable about the Rose's, but you do get eerily drawn in to their confrontation which sometimes draws laughter, but mostly just awe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes You Wonder About Your Own Parents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Devito is one of the rare treats that Hollywood have and not many people take notice. In 2002 he released the unremarkable Black Comedy Death to Smoochy starring Robin Williams and Edward Norton and if you mention it to people they will probably reply with `what's that'. That's how quite extinct he has become of the last few years but I will always remember he fantastic film The War of the Roses. I picked it up in car boot sale and showed it to my Fiancée that night and she was asking me what it was all about. I honestly didn't know how to put it without giving to much away so I just said it was a dark comedy about love which it is. Oliver and Barbara are a bittersweet couple who fell in love the moment they clapped eyes on one another at a bidding house. From there the rest is history. They fall in love, have kids and begin they time as a family and hard working citizens but there is one thing missing from there family to be completely set and that's a family house. They come upon one where the owner has just passed away and they move in with their children immediately. 18 years later after slaving away to make it the perfect family home and Barbara has time to rest and the kids are on their way to college but what she doesn't realise is that now she has finished all the work on the house and the kids are moving away from home to college she has nothing else to do and feels stumped to what to do next in her life. Oliver is obsessed with his job and makes it perfectly clear that the job comes first. He and Barbara Share good times but they constantly have to better themselves which has a strain on their marriage and before we know it a battle like no other in the history books is about to start between husband and wife bringing this tale to be one of the most original dark comedies to come out of Hollywood for a long time.Michael Douglas is hilarious as Oliver and is a comic genius in parts just by the expression's he pulls on his face. Kathleen Turner plays the doting but strange minded Barbara excellently and Danny Devito is there to fill in the gaps as Oliver's lawyer. The chemistry is more believable as ever between Douglas and Turner and Devito's direction adds the spice to make this a great film about the hidden depths of marriage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie, Michael Douglas plays his usual nice-guy role. Kathleen Turner, however, plays a woman of pure evil. Turner is great in this role. However, Douglas isn't as evil. You start to feel sorry for Douglas. Maybe that's how the director wanted it, but it completely messed up the movie. Instead of making this movie a fight of evil vs. evil, it becomes a fight of good vs. evil. The movie becomes a normal run-of-the-mill movie, and then the only real surprise about this movie is the ending. And nothing is too funny about this movie; it's just disturbing. The funniest thing in the movie is Devito, which is saying a lot. This is just my opinion. Since many other people seemed to like it, you can judge on your own whether or not to see it.</fullReview>

This movie takes its premise and carries it out to its logical conclusion, something that takes guts in modern Hollywood. Sometimes you wince at the meanness of the characters, but when people hate each other... They say you never really know another person until you divorce them. Excellent work by the principals, Turner and Douglas. The films weakness is its framing device with DeVito, but that isn't bad, it's just not as good as the rest. Good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marriage never works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an amalgam of romance, comedy, thriller and a dash of weepie cos, through it all, he still loves her. Boy meets girl and they get married, then, very slowly over the years tensions mount for Barbara (Kathleen Turner) until one evening she announces to Oliver, "every time I look at you I feel I could smash your face in." Oliver, played by Michael Douglas, has no idea this is coming and he looks so stunned you have to feel for him. From there on their relationship descends into outright hatred. They set about hurting each other in ever more destructive ways. Because of the sadness of the situation, for me the film is never really funny but the thriller aspect is never really menacing either. The story keeps you wondering who's going to get the house they are fighting over, if it's worth having after what they've done to it. The end is unusual and not what we expect.Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny Devito, are Superb in acting performance. There is some dark humor, but there is much more sadness and heart-wrenching moments that touch the heart of the viewer, especially someone who has been divorced or is in the process of filing for divorce. Surly one of the most remarkable 'mainstream' films given that it is billed as a comedy, and elicits such audience involvement. If you do take sides, which is almost impossible not to... be prepared to have those allegiances tested regularly, and abandoned ultimately.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

This is a black comedy about a couple, from the moment they meet, through the little stuff that make them start hate each other and up to a complete war that grows worse and worse.This movie is much darker than I remembered, but it's still very funny - and while it obviously fabricates and exaggerates certain situations, it actually shows how awful a divorce process can be, how two people who loved each other come to hate each other and how the process makes them hurt each other as much as possible. It may be fiction, but it's not very far from real life (in fact, there are WORSE divorce situations in real life).Beautiful cinematography by the great Stephen H.

		<shortDescription>Dark comedy that is more dark than comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gavin D'Amato (Danny DeVito) is an expert divorce attorney as he recounts the case that drove him to restart smoking. Oliver Rose (Michael Douglas) met Barbara (Kathleen Turner) as they battle over an antique Japanese carving in the rainy last day of the season in Nantucket. They get together that day. They get married. They have a couple of kids. He becomes a successful lawyer. She gets her dream house. However they slowly drift apart. Little irritants creep into their relationship. He works too much. She gets tired of her empty life. She's angry at him and he doesn't know why. Their fairy tale marriage deteriorates into an acrimonious divorce. Through a loophole, he forces his way back into the house.This is a dark comedy walking a fine line. I'm not sure if it doesn't stray over the line. It is so dark at times that it becomes uncomfortably unfunny. Then it snaps back with big laughs once in awhile. Danny DeVito is pushing hard visually to create something interesting and dark. The second half of the movie is where the couple starts on a course of tit for tat. It hits some dark comedic tones. The two angry combatants are so serious that it's hard to laugh at them. It is really better to see this as a dark cautionary tale rather than a funny comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A nice and partly funny movie, marriage and children, divorce and nasty settlement, a story who opens the way for marriage crisis of dimensions. Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas has played against each other before - like in "Romancing the stone" and the sequel "Jewel of the Nile", and it's hardly a coniciderence they came together for the third time, the couple made very chemistry on the big screen, everything seemed to fit them both.The most funny thing related to this movie, is that Danny De Vito - here with a great performance, also is the man in the director's chair, also had good parts in those movie I mention, and as far as I know, is a good friend of Douglas privately.Is it something we can learn from this plot? I chosen to let the question stand wide open, but it's not unimaginable that such bitterness and desperation in our real life have I read, and seen countless example of several divorces - but of course, here we got presented a drama like a black comedy, for that sake of the entertainment.Maybe most of the movie's situations stroke better those who already had been through their divorces or two, and I'm not sure I will recommend this movie to anybody, it could end up with bad estrangement for the theme - a partly entertaining story of a marriage on the wrong track, but a pretty good movie to watch.</fullReview>

You never truly understand why they keep fighting for the house (when you've the money, you can start again from scratch; why bother that much for that stupid house ?). But OK, the basic assumption seems maybe a bit far-fetched, but this is a movie after all. You've to start somewhere.Worse is that the characters of Douglas and Turner aren't well developed. War of the Roses in principal exists out of a succession of dirty tricks they do to each other but which don't touch you because you don't believe in the characters and their motives. And what a pity this is, because this movie touches a subject that is really important. The battle of the sexes, with the husband who works hard to give his family a (very) decent life, thinking he is doing well but by not giving enough attention to his wife looses her. Suppose you'll redo this film with a credible development of story. What a movie that would be ! A missed opportunity.The title sequence is very elegant (Saul Bass). The movie that sprang to my mind when seeing this was Spielberg's Catch me if you can. After you've seen the title sequence you've also had the best part of the movie ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marriage is just that:Two becoming One!! One can't war, only two can!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may be kinda funny but it conveys deep truths about the probabilities and tendencies of annihilating each other in marriage. Once one has not reached the stage of allowing one's desires and tastes to be shaped by the other partner (and vice versa), there'll always be a further episode to the war of the roses. Once an issue begins, the movie teaches that it has to be discussed thoroughly, understood by both parties and resolved as soon as possible before it assumes unpleasant dimensions. The ripple effects of an atmosphere devoid of compromise and forgiveness are unavoidable:no intimacy, lack of trust, apathy and insensitivity to each other's feelings, family breakdown and ultimate destruction. The labors over the years are all wasted. A movie every married couple should watch at one point or another in their marriage life, probably at the beginning of their marriage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War of the Sexes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some spoilers.... This film is good, although it drags for the first half. The film uses its satirical nature to talk about some important issues in society. In the late 80's, when The War of the Roses was produced, the rate of divorce had risen exponentially. This film brought to light the issue of divorce and showed, however comical and absurd, what divorce can do to a family and how it can destroy one's life. In one scene in the film, Kathleen Turner is talking to a potential maid for hire. Here, she points out some of the issues that this movie is attempting to deal with: the plight of a stay-at-home mother and the working husband. She's also dealing with the label that society puts on her as a stay at home mother, while although she should be happy for what she's done - she feels that she has wasted her life. This film is speaking to the women's movement as well as to the divorce issue. The house is a façade of happiness that they live behind. Underneath, steam and hatred are boiling to the point of explosion. Proving, yet another point, that money can't buy happiness. The film also addresses the issue of the battle of the sexes, and its point is simple: there are no winners. The film uses the conflict of divorce to enhance its themes: marriage is sacred, divorce should not be taken lightly, money can't buy happiness, and ignorance is not bliss. By both delving themselves into their work, Barbara with the house and Oliver with his practice, they both forget about each other. They've both ignored their relationship and now they're going to pay. Their stubborn nature shows the audience what can happen when a marriage goes bad. Perhaps, `A civilized divorce is a contradiction in terms'.</fullReview>

As their relationship sours, they both prove to be less and less sympathetic to the audience. If it was possible to like either of the characters towards the middle and end of the movie, it would be a tragedy, but since the viewer is so delighted to see them getting what they deserve, it's outrageously funny.This movie shows them going from being deeply, sweetly and somewhat nauseatingly in love to being viciously, vindictively, and desperately in hate with eachother. As they strip off the layers of their relationship, they remove their own humanity, leaving them almost cartoon versions of everything that can possibly be wrong in a relationship.It's a delightful break from all the tender love stories.</fullReview>

What it is is a very good example of a modern tragedy, a genre which is often neglected to the detriment of the viewer.The film takes the form of a story told by a divorce lawyer (de Vito) about some people he used to know (Douglas and Turner), whose experience of the process of divorce was so bad that the film ends with de Vito telling his client to go off and try to be reconciled to his wife, and if that is impossible to pay whatever it takes to make the divorce as quick as possible.Very well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And this will leave you with the odor of napalm, not fresh-cut roses. Possible Spoilers:Douglas and Turner are great in their roles as the Roses, happily married art collectors whose marriage slowly derails. Douglas is a successful lawyer, and his wife Turner, playing a bright, intelligent character, is a housewife for 17 years, slowly becoming bored and unhappy in the role. She sells a pound of liver pate to neighbors, who ask her to make more, and she finds enthusiasm again. Her husband derides her idea for a budding enterprise, and reveals himself to be a stuffy, self-satisfied bore. Eventually, Turner wants out of this suffocating marriage and asks for a divorce. She also wants half the house. Douglas is horrified. He wants the whole house all to himself. After all, he paid for it. Just because she took care of it for 17 years doesn't mean she's entitled to anything. Douglas proceeds to become more and more noxious as the movie continues; the movie's title is War of the Roses, but it's not a war: Turner simply reacts in self-defense every time Douglas does something hostile, and outraged at her refusing to give in, he proceeds to become more destructive, infantile and vicious. It plays more like a long documentary on spousal abuse where you already know the sad ending; the wife will get butchered, and the husband will serve the standard three years in prison. The movie does not go that far, but almost. The "comic" scenes are very well-played, but are *not* funny; they are painful and uncomfortable. If any movie portrays what mysogynistic pigs men can be, this does. It never shows Douglas hitting his wife, (to the best of my memory) because then we would lose all empathy with him. Douglas proceeds to ruin Turner's plans to expand her business by ruining a party for potential clients. By the end of the movie, they both tragically die. But it is hard to forget that it is from Douglas' actions, not both of them, and this makes this movie hard to stomach. Danny Devito, who directed the movie, gives himself far too many closeups (shot from low-angle) that actually become an annoyance. The movie did not leave me, my partner, or anyone else who saw it with a good feeling; aggravated irritation was the only way to describe it. Some critics say it is *good* to have a movie that irritates. However, I find these critics to be usually irritating people themselves. The movie is well-directed and well-acted, but goes way past the line of comedy to sadism, viciousness and abuse. Watch Romancing the Stone again, or Jewel of the Nile. You will have a much better time than this movie.Four out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I watched it on St. Valentine's Day, much to my personal shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot to like in War of the Roses. The visual feast of the Roses' home, the horrific divorce battles, the philosophising of Danny de Vito and of course the plentiful supply of not-so-subtle literary themes: the glorious rise and tragic fall of classical theater, with Michael Douglas as the tragic hero.On a moral level, this could be read as anti-divorce, anti-American/anti-WASP, or an indictment of the petty and endemic greed overtaking the U.S.A. in the 1980's. Personally, I see it as all of these. While de Vito's character believes the divorce was the ultimate cause of the Roses' downfall, and de Vito himself likely believes this, it is also true that the seeds of their destruction were planted a long time ago. They were a wily, romantic couple more obsessed with their fairy-tale appearances than anything else. It is clear that even their children were but ornaments and fixtures in their house.Therefore, although one can certainly blame Turner's character for initiating the divorce in what was a "perfect" marriage, it was a fragile one nonetheless, clearly a union of two people so shallow as not to have a chance once pretty appearances had begun to fade. Clearly, Barbara had a good reason for wanting a divorce: she and Oliver both lived for and loved after pretty things and Oliver's manners were less pretty than she would have liked.All the same, Oliver and Barbara Rose are also victims of their time and place. The fruits of their labor truly came into harvest in the 1980's, a time when corporate consolidation, personal greed, and obsession with "Material Girls" was fully in vogue in my country. (Contrary to what may be thought, however, the real excesses appeared in the 1990's.) Moreover, they were clearly New England WASPs, close to and even educated in the pompous pseudo-aristocratic strongholds of the Ivy League, and whatever austere and dry Puritan, Old English noble sensibilities the Plymouth colony may once have possessed had long since withered into pretentious silliness. The War of the Roses captures that perfectly. It is not a coincidence that the moral compasses of the story, Susan the housekeeper and attorney Gavin d'Amato, are respectively Bavarian and Italo-American (the latter being the least assimilated of old-stock white Christian ethnics in the United States).All the same, this silliness might have been more enjoyable and more subtly ironic had it not been battered by generally boring cinematography and the horrible performance of Michael Douglas as Oliver. A bit more of old-style Hollywood class and reserve in manner would have augmented the pretension of the Roses and perhaps made the collapse of Oliver's desirability just a bit more believable, if not "sympathetic." It is a "fun" movie but falls short of "great." Overall I recommend it if you've got time on your hands.10 Aug. 2009 update: This movie has become the story of my life (or rather the lives of some people I know...) and therefore I have upped my vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY, VERY Dark Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching THE WAR OF THE ROSES when it first came out in the fall of 1989. I was a senior in college at the time. A few years later, when I was buying movies on video tape, I bought this movie and have viewed it from time to time since then. What strikes me is that not only is this movie an extremely dark comedy (in some ways almost a Horror movie) but one that has a lot of subtle things that are bubbling below the surface. Before getting into detail about that, I want to give a synopsis of the story. THE WAR OF THE ROSES stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as a Yuppie couple named Oliver and Barbara Rose. At first, they seem to be very happy. Oliver is a lawyer and Barbara is a housewife. They raise a son and a daughter and live in a very big house that Barabara has spent years decorating. However, she decides one day she wants out of the marriage. Oliver does not believe it and from this point on, things get from bad to worse. Danny De Vito, who plays Gavin, Oliver's best friend and lawyer, tries to talk sense into him but Oliver won't listen to his advice. From this point until the end of the movie, each spouse is constantly figuring out how to outsmart the other. A big part of their problem is that both of them are very stubborn and refuse to sell the house.When I first watched THE WAR OF THE ROSES, I basically looked at it from the viewpoint that things fell apart when Barbara announced that she wanted a divorce. However, after viewing THE WAR OF THE ROSES a couple of times, I began to notice that there was a lot of tension between the two main characters throughout the movie. A good example is when Oliver and Barbara are still living in their apartment, they invite some of Oliver's co-workers over for dinner. Barbara starts telling the story of how she acquired some glassware on a trip she and Oliver took in Paris. Oliver feels she is rambling on so he cuts her off by saying, "To make a long story short..." and he finishes the story for her. She is obviously annoyed by it and when Oliver comments that everybody had a good time at the party, she says "To make a long story short, No!" Not only that but she is put off by what she calls his "phony laugh." Here are some other examples of the tension between the couple leading up to time of the breakup: When Barbara decides to go into business for herself by catering, she wants Oliver to look at her contract. He berates her by calling it a "little contract" and uses it to swipe a fly. Around that same time, Oliver receives a phone call from a client named Larabee. Barbara resents the fact that he is obsessed by this client so while he is on the phone, she turns on all the appliances in the house in an attempt to show how she feels. Another example involves Barbara and Oliver having dinner one night. Not much is said but the camera angles and the body language show it all. A major scene that shows the tension between Barbara and Oliver, I think, is when Oliver is having what he thinks is a heart attack in the middle of a business lunch. Despite Barbara's acting like she is concerned, she refuses to go to the hospital to see him. Naturally, Oliver is upset and resentful of this. Again, as I said, all of this was before the "divorce" occurred and this is to show that what may have seemed like minor annoyances at one point grew into fights between the two. After the two break up, neither of them want to budge and it causes friction for everyone involved. By that, I mean their kids, Gavin and the housekeeper. Because the Roses were unwilling to compromise, they destroyed practically everything they ever had. I would say that the moral of the story is for a couple who is about to be divorced, to try to work things out so the spouses can get through the divorce as painless as possible. This is the point that Danny De Vito's character essentially tells his client in the movie. It is worth noting that in addition to acting in THE WAR OF THE ROSES, Danny De Vito directed it as well. As was true with THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN, Danny De Vito specializes in directing very dark-comedy. I heard once that Michael Douglas commented that when making this movie, he and Kathleen Turner had to remind each other that they were still friends. Having watched this movie, I can understand why! Anyway, I recommend THE WAR OF THE ROSES to those viewers who love black comedy as this fits that description to a "T."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Just a Cautionary Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has been written about the psychology and morality of Oliver and Barbara Rose (Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner). Doesn't anybody get it? Even in the context of the movie itself, they're not real people - they're fictional characters! They are the principals in a cautionary tale that Gavin (Danny DeVito) is MAKING UP to convince the man in the chair (Dan Castellaneta) to try to save his marriage or, failing that, be generous in his divorce.The proof of this is obvious. We see Oliver and Barbara's last minutes together in real time. We see them die on screen. They are alone at the time; and even though Gavin and Susan (Marianne Sagebrecht)are outside struggling with a ladder to rescue them, all they end up with are two cold corpses on the marble floor. There is no way for anyone to know what transpired between Oliver and Barbara since a whole day earlier at the very least.This is why Oliver is both the jerk who wrecks the marriage and the main sympathetic victim of its destruction. He is the stand-in for the man in the chair, the guy who did all the wrong things Gavin is telling the man in the chair not to do and who suffered the consequences. This is also why, in the middle of the movie, Oliver's motive shifts from keeping the house to keeping Barbara herself, so that he can more explicitly suffer the many cruel ways she finds to reject him.This is also why Barbara makes the rather sudden transition from resentful housewife to avenging fury. We can't call it implausible, because we've had so little opportunity to get to know her as a person (just as Oliver has failed to do). And this is not to fault Turner's performance in any way. (As she smashes the Staffordshire figurines, Oliver protests, "But you love them as much as I do!" "More!" she shrieks, as she smashes another). She is the embodiment of the horrors awaiting the man in the chair if he doesn't do everything he can to make things up to his wife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film again after ten years, to try and see the point at which the relationship between the Roses started to go into freefall.The plot is much more subtle than I first thought. There are a lot of psychological things happening, - especially to Turner's character. She gradually releases her pent up emotions, from initial subversion, into a crescendo of hate. Maybe this explains why some women prefer their husbands when they're actually under the patio rather than when building it.I also loved the irony of seeing Dan Castellaneta (now famous for his voice) in a totally silent part!!! Maybe DeVito was advising him to patch things up with Marge?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS! Oh the fine line between love and enmity! Though sinisterly jocular this black comedy tells an all to common story of the depravity and animus that can devolve from what once was affection. It shows how the modicums of annoyance can insidiously sink into the interstices that separate spouses and militate into raging gaps of rancor. This is a film that you may chuckle at as you watch it with your significant other, but you will detect a bit of nervousness in your laughter. The battle of the sexes is presented here with internecine overkill. The Roses don't just grow tired of one another; they get downright vicious. The age-old dilemma underlies their inimical challenge of wills: The male's confusion over whether working hard to provide and get ahead (and thus becoming preoccupied and perpetually unavailable) achieves his responsibility as a man or if providing more affection to his partner but producing less materially is the answer; and the females conflict over self-fulfillment versus supporting a man who supplies her well financially but is distant. To illustrate just how men and women can watch this movie from a totally different perspective, one must only watch the end where Oliver uses his last bit of life to touch his wife, and Barbara uses it to push his hand away. I thought it was mean-spirited (though clever) and my wife thought it was great. Yikes!!! (By the way the script, direction and acting are exceptional).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy With the Wrong Tone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romance turns sour in this somewhat odd motion picture from Danny DeVito. Flashbacks show a loving relationship between husband Michael Douglas and wife Kathleen Turner turn into a snake's pit. A crazed divorce goes from being down right nasty and then gets even worse. DeVito is the family attorney who gets to see the couple destroy themselves slowly but surely. An odd tone sinks "The War of the Roses". A really sad separation of a once happy family is dealt with in a sometimes comical way that feels forced. At times you laugh through clenched teeth as it is realized that tragedy is being viewed. A film that probably tries to do a little too much. Another could-have-been-production that just never does accomplish its lofty goals. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the other comments from other viewers I just wanted to comment on how obvious it is to determine their sex. It's so funny (and sad) how the genders can really watch this movie and be affected so disparately. An obvious male states that Micheal Douglas plays such a "nice guy" and how Kathleen Turner is so evil. Wow you better watch again cowboy--you missed some serious nuances (actually they are not even that subtle--remember how he ignores all her ambitions, swats a fly with her important contract ("little contract" is what he calls it) and basically belittles her dreams--basically the guy is full of himself, even his letter written while on his supposed death bed is about him and not her, watch again you'll see what I mean). And the writer who went on the diatribe about Douglas' character's actions being tantamont to abuse revels her gender. She is compeltely oblivious to the invidious nature of Mrs. Rose. Wow this flick is deeper than I thought!</fullReview>

This is not a dark comedy, it's just a dark disturbing look at divorce. If you want to see a dark comedy directed by Danny DeVito, one that is actually good, see Death to Smoochy.

		<fullReview>I do not criticize the film for having been made ; indeed the subject matter is most original therefore the Director must be commended on an artistic level for having produced it. But really, cinema is here to make us dream and fell good. With this film you CANNOT feel good, there is so much hate and evil that it is frankly disgusting. I am sure that situations such as the one depicted in the film actually do exist in real life - that is enough, and painful as it is, without having to see them re-enacted during a film. I see people describing this as a black comedy but regrettably find nothing comic about the work at all. I do enjoy true black comedy about death, cripples et alia but here there is not an iota of anything vaguely comic. Though tribute must be paid to the main actors for their magnificent performances. However the film has left me with a negative prejudice about Kathleen Turner, who, to me at least, inspired more hatred than Michael Douglas. Indeed the film has the dangerous singularity of inspiring hatred and is far from resembling anything comic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply disturbing-just 2 people in a relationship hurting each other.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disliked this movie-very much actually. In fact few movies have left me with such a bad taste in my mouth. I do know it's considered to be a classic and I suppose I understand why in some ways. But I really disliked it. Not being a terribly big fan of black comedies(though I do like some), that maybe one reason. I had a hard time with the attempt to turn such a serious subject matter into a comedy. There seemed no point to it-just a couple of people once in love and the movie mostly deals with who can hurt who more.Don't we get enough of that in real life? There was absolutely no point to the comedic element of this film beyond showing how dysfunctional love relationships can get and everyone already knows the answer to that.I am a person who has no problem with "heavy movies". One of my favorites is actually "The Hours" so it's nothing to do with a hard to watch movie. I also have no problem with films that highlight the dysfunctions that often go on in relationships.These type of films very much appeal to me too. I do actually, however, need to have some REASON to like a movie and for a movie being made-some purpose and meaning to the film.In this case, though the acting was first rate very little else about the movie was. The absolute meanness of this film was beyond me-and the attempts to turn some of the couples' actions into comedy was off the mark. What this was was a severely dysfunctional couple who were once in love and are now in hate. That's it. There's nothing else to this movie and nothing at all likable about it.I do understand the tragedy behind the comedy, I really do, but though the idea behind the making is interesting and though the performers are very good (excellent in fact), I still disliked this for the reasons listed. However, I will say, if the creators of this film wanted to create a disturbing piece of work they succeeded with that. This movie stayed with me for awhile.</fullReview>

Told as a terrible story warning to one of his clients by divorce lawyer Danny de Vito , the film itself tells us absolutely nothing that we did not know from the pre-publicity except perhaps that Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were too old to play college kids. As it is, the story follows a straight line, and by the time we reach the climax we are ,unfortunately , ready for it and cheering for it so we can go home. Well, I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was labelled as a comedy, but had no more jokes than any other film. I don't appreciate IMDb wasting my time by saying this is a comedy, I hope I save someone the time of watching this film if comedy is what they're looking for.The film was just about the rise and fall of the Roses' marriage and is as dull as it sounds. The divorce quickly becomes nasty. This movie might be handy for marriage counselling (well before any problems arise), but isn't useful as entertainment. The description misrepresents the film by only focusing on the divorce, since a large chunk of the movie occurs while they're happily together.Danny DeVito frequently appears, but rarely with any significance. His client in the office really doesn't say enough, it feels very artificial.The casting was good, as the pets and children at various ages blend gracefully.The directing was good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of better black comedies out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand how people can view this as hilarious. I suppose since DeVito adds more realism to this than "Throw Momma From the Train", that it should be judged on different merits, but the fact of the matter for me was, I could see the gags and the horrible things these people do to each other coming a mile away! Another user's comments mentioned Happiness, In the Company of Men, and The Ice Storm (not to mention Your Friends and Neighbors, and The House of Yes). This film does not hold up well compared to those. For all the nasty, unappealing, characteristics this film has, it is much less satisfying than those others. I don't know why, I just can't put my finger on it. I even enjoyed the recent "The Good Girl" more than this, and that had some pretty unappealing characteristics. This film is not funny enough for a comedy, and it's not disturbing enough to be macabre (not that it doesn't manage to be a total turnoff in other ways). Maybe the real problem is that the film doesn't do enough in the beginning to get us invested in the characters in the first place. I caught some flak for defending Irreconcilable Differences on a message board recently, but now that I've seen this, that film seems even more underrated, just as this one (dare I use the cliche?) overrated. I have no desire to see it again.P.S. Sadly, the trademark spark Marianne Sagebrecht brings to all her roles is wasted on this film.</fullReview>

You see Barbara is filing for divorce, and their subsequent violent 'separation' makes one wonder if they could have possibly ever cared for each other.Danny De Vito's comedy about divorce ( a contradiction in terms) is depressing and largely un-funny, and the little man once again proves he's no director.

Then everything falls apart for no reason and there are no marriage counselors to help them out. They fight over the house and fight and fight. The end. Everything they fight over is so petty and juvenile. All the while, Danny DeVito is smoking a cigarette and telling their story. I didn't find any humor in this movie. The only part I thought was funny was when she kicked him in the nuts. I knew that was coming because it was predictable. Divorce is a sad mess and to try to make it into a humorous joke is just boring and pathetic. Oliver acted like a jerk and took Barbaras love for granted and all the while she didn't love him anymore. So they decided to get a divorce and they fight nonstop. I could tell the story in less time than it takes to sit thorough divorce court.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically, this is a pretty well-made film. The script is, at times, interesting and the actors involved do a good job of making you hate them. But, overall, the film is a major downer--a depressing and awful film that is best if it is only seen by those planning on a divorce. Others just don't need the pain involved in watching this nightmare.Douglas and Turner portray a couple who go from a troubled marriage to all out war. Their utter cruelty to each other might be seen as funny by some, but most will only cringe at the evil that comes from them. And, I seriously wonder if past victims of domestic violence might just experience flashbacks of past violence when viewing this variation on CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH. In the end, the two creeps literally kill each other. Wow--that's pretty funny stuff,...if you are a sadist.But, for warring couples perhaps this is a good warning.
